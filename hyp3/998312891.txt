annual or perennial caulescent or acaulescent ( with or without a visible plant stem above the ground ) herbs , shrubs or very rarely treelets the simple leaves of plants with either habit are arranged alternately ; the acaulescent species produce basal rosettes the flowers of the vast majority of the species are strongly zygomorphic with bilateral symmetry and solitary , but occasionally form cymes the flowers are formed from five petals ; four are upswept or fan-shaped with two per side , and there is one , broad , lobed lower petal pointing downward the shape of the petals and placement defines many species , for example , some species have a '' spur '' on the end of each petal while most have a spur on the lower petal the flowers have a superior ovary with one cell , which has three placentae , containing many ovules after flowering , fruit capsules are produced that are thick walled , with few to many seeds per carpel , and dehisce ( split open ) by way of three valves first formally described by carl linnaeus in 1753 with 19 species , the genus viola bears his botanical authority , l however , in 1802 batsch had already established a separate family , which he called violariae based on viola as the type genus , with seven other genera viola is one of about 25 genera and about 600 species in the large family eudicot family violaceae , divided into subfamilies and tribes while most genera are monotypic , viola is a very large genus , variously circumscribed as having between 500 and 600 species species ) ; sect the genus includes dog violets , a group of scentless species which are the most common viola in many areas , sweet violet ( viola odorata ) ( named from its sweet scent ) , and many other species whose common name includes the word '' violet '' saintpaulia ( '' african violets '' , gesneriaceae ) nor erythronium dens-canis ( '' dogtooth violets '' , liliaceae ) are related to viola

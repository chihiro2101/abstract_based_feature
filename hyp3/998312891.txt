viola typically have heart-shaped or reniform ( kidney-shaped ) , scalloped leaf , though a number have linear or palmate leaves the flowers are formed from five petals ; four are upswept or fan-shaped with two per side , and there is one , broad , lobed lower petal pointing downward the shape of the petals and placement defines many species , for example , some species have a '' spur '' on the end of each petal while most have a spur on the lower petal the flowers have a superior ovary with one cell , which has three placentae , containing many ovules first formally described by carl linnaeus in 1753 with 19 species , the genus viola bears his botanical authority , l however , in 1802 batsch had already established a separate family , which he called violariae based on viola as the type genus , with seven other genera viola is one of about 25 genera and about 600 species in the large family eudicot family violaceae , divided into subfamilies and tribes while most genera are monotypic , viola is a very large genus , variously circumscribed as having between 500 and 600 species molecular phylogenetic studies show that viola occurs in clade i of the family , as viola , schweiggeria , noisettia and allexis , in which schweiggeria and noisettia are monotypic and form a sister group to viola one of these was that of gingins ( 1823 ) , based on stigma morphology , with five sections ( nomimium , dischidium , chamaemelanium , melanium , leptidium ) in particular section nomimium was dismembered into several new sections and transferring part of it to section viola ( 31–50 ) n , c and northern s america ; beringia ; hawaii sect rubellium w.becker ( 3–6 ) s america : chile sect tridens w.becker ( 2 ) southern s america sect

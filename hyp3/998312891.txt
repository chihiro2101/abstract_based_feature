annual or perennial caulescent or acaulescent ( with or without a visible plant stem above the ground ) herbs , shrubs or very rarely treelets the simple leaves of plants with either habit are arranged alternately ; the acaulescent species produce basal rosettes the flowers of the vast majority of the species are strongly zygomorphic with bilateral symmetry and solitary , but occasionally form cymes the shape of the petals and placement defines many species , for example , some species have a '' spur '' on the end of each petal while most have a spur on the lower petal the flowers have five sepals that persist after blooming , and in some species the sepals enlarge after blooming after flowering , fruit capsules are produced that are thick walled , with few to many seeds per carpel , and dehisce ( split open ) by way of three valves on drying , the capsules may eject seeds with considerable force to distances of several meters first formally described by carl linnaeus in 1753 with 19 species , the genus viola bears his botanical authority , l when jussieu established the hierarchical system of families ( 1789 ) , he placed viola in the cisti ( rock roses ) , though by 1811 he suggested viola be separated from these however , in 1802 batsch had already established a separate family , which he called violariae based on viola as the type genus , with seven other genera viola is one of about 25 genera and about 600 species in the large family eudicot family violaceae , divided into subfamilies and tribes while most genera are monotypic , viola is a very large genus , variously circumscribed as having between 500 and 600 species these are followed by the single australian section , erpetion , as sister group to chilenium , the northern hemisphere sections and finally the single african section , v species ) ; sect

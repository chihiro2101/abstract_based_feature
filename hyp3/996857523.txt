loa worms have a simple structure consisting of a head ( that lacks lips ) , a body , and a blunt tail the outer body of the worm is composed of a cuticle with 3 main layers made up of collagen and other compounds which aid in protecting the nematodes while they are inside the digestive system of their host male adults range from 20 to 34 & nbsp ; mm long and 350 to 430 Î¼m wide the flies serve as host ( biology ) in which the microfilariae undergo part of their morphological development , and then are borne to the next definitive host a fly bearing third-stage filarial larvae in its proboscis infects the human host through the bite wound after entering the human host , the larvae mature into adults , commonly in subcutaneous tissue the vector fly ingests microfilariae while feeding on the host 's blood once the larva is established in the proboscis and the fly takes its next human blood meal , the cycle of infection continues usually , about 5 months are needed for larvae ( transferred from a fly ) to mature into adult worms , which they can only do inside the human body loa are asymptomatic , symptoms generally do not appear until years , or even more than a decade , after the bite from an infected fly the most visual sign of an adult worm infections is when the worm crosses the sclera of the eye , which causes significant pain to the host and is usually associated with inflammation and less likely , blindness eye worms typically cause little eye damage and last a few hours to a week other tissues in which this worm can be found includes : the penis , testes , nipples , bridge of the nose , kidneys , and heart the main methods of diagnosis include the presence of microfilariae in the blood , the presence of a worm in the eye , and the presence of skin swellings other than blood , microfilariae can also be observed in urine and saliva samples adult worms found in the eye can be surgically removed with forceps after being paralyzed with a topical anesthesia dec is chosen over ivermectin because evidence supports its ability to kill both the adult worms and the microfilariae , which are the main cause of the severe neurological problems mentioned above a study conducted by the research foundation in tropical diseases and environment in 2002 had a sample of 1458 persons , spanning 16 different villages , and found loa loa presence in these villages ranging from 2.22 to 19.23 % of the population loa in nonendemic countries in the past 25 years reviewed 102 cases of imported loiasis , 61 of them from europe and 31 from the usa taxonomy browser : loa loa

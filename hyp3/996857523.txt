loa worms have a simple structure consisting of a head ( that lacks lips ) , a body , and a blunt tail male adults range from 20 to 34 & nbsp ; mm long and 350 to 430 μm wide female adults range from 20 to 70 & nbsp ; mm long and can be about 425 μm wide the flies serve as host ( biology ) in which the microfilariae undergo part of their morphological development , and then are borne to the next definitive host a fly bearing third-stage filarial larvae in its proboscis infects the human host through the bite wound after entering the human host , the larvae mature into adults , commonly in subcutaneous tissue the vector fly ingests microfilariae while feeding on the host 's blood usually , about 5 months are needed for larvae ( transferred from a fly ) to mature into adult worms , which they can only do inside the human body however , these swellings can be painful , as they are mostly found near the joints loa are asymptomatic , symptoms generally do not appear until years , or even more than a decade , after the bite from an infected fly the most visual sign of an adult worm infections is when the worm crosses the sclera of the eye , which causes significant pain to the host and is usually associated with inflammation and less likely , blindness eye worms typically cause little eye damage and last a few hours to a week the flies are also attracted to smoke from wood fires the main methods of diagnosis include the presence of microfilariae in the blood , the presence of a worm in the eye , and the presence of skin swellings a giemsa stain is the most commonly used diagnostic test that uses a thick blood smear to count the microfilariae in some cases , albendazole may also be an effective treatment used to reduce the microfilariae prior to treatment with dec loa in nonendemic countries in the past 25 years reviewed 102 cases of imported loiasis , 61 of them from europe and 31 from the usa in the subjects viewed , peripheral blood microfilariae were detected 61.4 % of the time , eye worm migration 53.5 % of the time , and calabar swellings 41.6 % of the time eye worm migration was observed in a similar proportion between the two groups taxonomy browser : loa loa

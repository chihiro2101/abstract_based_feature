loa worms have a simple structure consisting of a head ( that lacks lips ) , a body , and a blunt tail the flies serve as host ( biology ) in which the microfilariae undergo part of their morphological development , and then are borne to the next definitive host a fly bearing third-stage filarial larvae in its proboscis infects the human host through the bite wound after entering the human host , the larvae mature into adults , commonly in subcutaneous tissue adult females measure about 40 to 70 & nbsp ; mm in length and 0.5 & nbsp ; mm in diameter microfilariae tend to reside within spinal fluids , urine , and sputum ; by day , they also circulate in the bloodstream the vector fly ingests microfilariae while feeding on the host 's blood once the larva is established in the proboscis and the fly takes its next human blood meal , the cycle of infection continues usually , about 5 months are needed for larvae ( transferred from a fly ) to mature into adult worms , which they can only do inside the human body the most common display of infection is the localized allergic inflammations called calabar or cameroon swellings that signify the migration of the adult worm in the tissues away from the injection site by the vector however , these swellings can be painful , as they are mostly found near the joints loa are asymptomatic , symptoms generally do not appear until years , or even more than a decade , after the bite from an infected fly these parasites have a diurnal periodicity in which they circulate in the peripheral blood during the daytime , but migrate to vascular parts of the lungs during the night , where they are considered noncirculatory therefore , the appearing and disappearing characteristics of this parasite can cause recurrent swelling that can cause painful enlargements of cysts in the connective tissue surrounding tendons people at the highest risk for acquiring loiasis are those who live in the rainforests of west or central africa the flies are also attracted to smoke from wood fires the main methods of diagnosis include the presence of microfilariae in the blood , the presence of a worm in the eye , and the presence of skin swellings avoiding areas where the vectors , deer and mango flies , are found also reduces risk in the subjects viewed , peripheral blood microfilariae were detected 61.4 % of the time , eye worm migration 53.5 % of the time , and calabar swellings 41.6 % of the time taxonomy browser : loa loa

loa worms have a simple structure consisting of a head ( that lacks lips ) , a body , and a blunt tail male adults range from 20 to 34 & nbsp ; mm long and 350 to 430 μm wide female adults range from 20 to 70 & nbsp ; mm long and can be about 425 μm wide adult females measure about 40 to 70 & nbsp ; mm in length and 0.5 & nbsp ; mm in diameter males measure some 30 to 34 & nbsp ; mm by 0.35 to 0.43 & nbsp ; mm apart from their presence in bodily fluids , however , microfilariae in the noncirculation phase also occur in the lungs the vector fly ingests microfilariae while feeding on the host 's blood the third-stage larva migrates to the fly ’ s proboscis once the larva is established in the proboscis and the fly takes its next human blood meal , the cycle of infection continues usually , about 5 months are needed for larvae ( transferred from a fly ) to mature into adult worms , which they can only do inside the human body loa are asymptomatic , symptoms generally do not appear until years , or even more than a decade , after the bite from an infected fly these parasites have a diurnal periodicity in which they circulate in the peripheral blood during the daytime , but migrate to vascular parts of the lungs during the night , where they are considered noncirculatory eye worms typically cause little eye damage and last a few hours to a week the main methods of diagnosis include the presence of microfilariae in the blood , the presence of a worm in the eye , and the presence of skin swellings other than blood , microfilariae can also be observed in urine and saliva samples although ivermectin is a common treatment for loiasis , the center for disease control ( cdc ) recommends treatment with diethylcarbamazine ( dec ) dec is chosen over ivermectin because evidence supports its ability to kill both the adult worms and the microfilariae , which are the main cause of the severe neurological problems mentioned above in some cases , albendazole may also be an effective treatment used to reduce the microfilariae prior to treatment with dec in the western part of africa , an increase in prevalence has been associated with the distribution of ivermectin , which is used to prevent the infection of onchocerciasis , which is also very prevalent in the same region in the subjects viewed , peripheral blood microfilariae were detected 61.4 % of the time , eye worm migration 53.5 % of the time , and calabar swellings 41.6 % of the time

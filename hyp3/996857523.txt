loa worms have a simple structure consisting of a head ( that lacks lips ) , a body , and a blunt tail female adults range from 20 to 70 & nbsp ; mm long and can be about 425 μm wide the flies serve as host ( biology ) in which the microfilariae undergo part of their morphological development , and then are borne to the next definitive host after entering the human host , the larvae mature into adults , commonly in subcutaneous tissue the adult female produces large numbers of microfilariae , about 250 to 300 μm in length and 6-8 μm in width microfilariae tend to reside within spinal fluids , urine , and sputum ; by day , they also circulate in the bloodstream apart from their presence in bodily fluids , however , microfilariae in the noncirculation phase also occur in the lungs in the thoracic muscles , the microfilaria develops successively into a first-stage larva , second-stage larva , and finally into the infectious third-stage larva the migration does not cause significant damage to the host and is referred to as benign loa are asymptomatic , symptoms generally do not appear until years , or even more than a decade , after the bite from an infected fly the most visual sign of an adult worm infections is when the worm crosses the sclera of the eye , which causes significant pain to the host and is usually associated with inflammation and less likely , blindness these flies do not commonly enter houses , but they are attracted to the houses that are well lit , so will congregate outside springer dordrecht heidelberg london new york the main methods of diagnosis include the presence of microfilariae in the blood , the presence of a worm in the eye , and the presence of skin swellings patients with infections have a higher number of blood cells , namely eosinophils , as well as high ige levels that indicate an active infection with helminth parasites a giemsa stain is the most commonly used diagnostic test that uses a thick blood smear to count the microfilariae adult worms found in the eye can be surgically removed with forceps after being paralyzed with a topical anesthesia loa in nonendemic countries in the past 25 years reviewed 102 cases of imported loiasis , 61 of them from europe and 31 from the usa in the subjects viewed , peripheral blood microfilariae were detected 61.4 % of the time , eye worm migration 53.5 % of the time , and calabar swellings 41.6 % of the time taxonomy browser : loa loa

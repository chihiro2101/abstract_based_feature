loa worms have a simple structure consisting of a head ( that lacks lips ) , a body , and a blunt tail the flies serve as host ( biology ) in which the microfilariae undergo part of their morphological development , and then are borne to the next definitive host a fly bearing third-stage filarial larvae in its proboscis infects the human host through the bite wound after entering the human host , the larvae mature into adults , commonly in subcutaneous tissue the adult female produces large numbers of microfilariae , about 250 to 300 μm in length and 6-8 μm in width the vector fly ingests microfilariae while feeding on the host 's blood once inside the vector , the microfilaria sheds its sheaths and escapes through the walls of the midgut into the fly ’ s haemocoel usually , about 5 months are needed for larvae ( transferred from a fly ) to mature into adult worms , which they can only do inside the human body however , these swellings can be painful , as they are mostly found near the joints loa are asymptomatic , symptoms generally do not appear until years , or even more than a decade , after the bite from an infected fly other tissues in which this worm can be found includes : the penis , testes , nipples , bridge of the nose , kidneys , and heart these flies do not commonly enter houses , but they are attracted to the houses that are well lit , so will congregate outside travelers can be infected in less than 30 days after arriving in an affected area , although they are more likely to be infected whilst being bitten by multiple deerflies over the course of many months the main methods of diagnosis include the presence of microfilariae in the blood , the presence of a worm in the eye , and the presence of skin swellings a giemsa stain is the most commonly used diagnostic test that uses a thick blood smear to count the microfilariae other than blood , microfilariae can also be observed in urine and saliva samples the worm is not paralyzed completely , so if it is not extracted quickly , it can vanish upon attempting extraction in some cases , albendazole may also be an effective treatment used to reduce the microfilariae prior to treatment with dec loa in nonendemic countries in the past 25 years reviewed 102 cases of imported loiasis , 61 of them from europe and 31 from the usa taxonomy browser : loa loa

hilbert 's statement is sometimes misunderstood , because by the '' arithmetical axioms '' he did not mean a system equivalent to peano arithmetic , but a stronger system with a second-order completeness axiom the system hilbert asked for a completeness proof of is more like second-order arithmetic than first-order peano arithmetic as a nowadays common interpretation , a positive solution to hilbert 's second question would in particular provide a proof that peano arithmetic is consistent these do not provide a resolution to hilbert 's second question , however , because someone who doubts the consistency of peano arithmetic is unlikely to accept the axioms of set theory ( which is much stronger ) to prove its consistency thus a satisfactory answer to hilbert 's problem must be carried out using principles that would be acceptable to someone who does not already believe pa is consistent gödel 's second incompleteness theorem ( see gödel 's incompleteness theorems ) places a severe limit on how weak a finitistic system can be while still proving the consistency of peano arithmetic gödel 's second incompleteness theorem shows that it is not possible for any proof that peano arithmetic is consistent to be carried out within peano arithmetic itself however , as nagel and newman ( 1958:96 & ndash ; 99 ) explain , there is still room for a proof that can not be formalized in arithmetic : : '' this imposing result of godel 's analysis should not be misunderstood : it does not exclude a meta-mathematical proof of the consistency of arithmetic meta-mathematical proofs of the consistency of arithmetic have , in fact , been constructed , notably by gerhard gentzen , a member of the hilbert school , in 1936 , and by others since then the possibility of constructing a finitistic absolute proof of consistency for arithmetic is not excluded by gödel ’ s results . gentzen 's consistency proof gentzen 's proof proceeds by assigning to each proof in peano arithmetic an ordinal number , based on the structure of the proof , with each of these ordinals less than epsilon zero while the theorems of gödel and gentzen are now well understood by the mathematical logic community , no consensus has formed on whether ( or in what way ) these theorems answer hilbert 's second problem 2 ) calls the belief that gödel 's theorem eliminates the possibility of a persuasive consistency proof '' erroneous '' , citing the consistency proof given by gentzen and a later one given by gödel in 1958 '' gödel 's reformulation of gentzen 's first consistency proof of arithmetic : the no-counterexample interpretation

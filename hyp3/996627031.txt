hilbert 's problem and its interpretation in one english translation , hilbert asks : '' when we are engaged in investigating the foundations of a science , we must set up a system of axioms which contains an exact and complete description of the relations subsisting between the elementary ideas of that science in geometry , the proof of the compatibility of the axioms can be effected by constructing a suitable field of numbers , such that analogous relations between the numbers of this field correspond to the geometrical axioms hilbert 's statement is sometimes misunderstood , because by the '' arithmetical axioms '' he did not mean a system equivalent to peano arithmetic , but a stronger system with a second-order completeness axiom the system hilbert asked for a completeness proof of is more like second-order arithmetic than first-order peano arithmetic as a nowadays common interpretation , a positive solution to hilbert 's second question would in particular provide a proof that peano arithmetic is consistent gödel 's second incompleteness theorem shows that it is not possible for any proof that peano arithmetic is consistent to be carried out within peano arithmetic itself this theorem shows that if the only acceptable proof procedures are those that can be formalized within arithmetic then hilbert 's call for a consistency proof can not be answered the possibility of constructing a finitistic absolute proof of consistency for arithmetic is not excluded by gödel ’ s results gödel showed that no such proof is possible that can be represented within arithmetic his argument does not eliminate the possibility of strictly finitistic proofs that can not be represented within arithmetic gentzen 's proof proceeds by assigning to each proof in peano arithmetic an ordinal number , based on the structure of the proof , with each of these ordinals less than epsilon zero while the theorems of gödel and gentzen are now well understood by the mathematical logic community , no consensus has formed on whether ( or in what way ) these theorems answer hilbert 's second problem 2 ) calls the belief that gödel 's theorem eliminates the possibility of a persuasive consistency proof '' erroneous '' , citing the consistency proof given by gentzen and a later one given by gödel in 1958 '' gödel 's reformulation of gentzen 's first consistency proof of arithmetic : the no-counterexample interpretation

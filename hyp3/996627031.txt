the system hilbert asked for a completeness proof of is more like second-order arithmetic than first-order peano arithmetic as a nowadays common interpretation , a positive solution to hilbert 's second question would in particular provide a proof that peano arithmetic is consistent there are many known proofs that peano arithmetic is consistent that can be carried out in strong systems such as zermelo–fraenkel set theory these do not provide a resolution to hilbert 's second question , however , because someone who doubts the consistency of peano arithmetic is unlikely to accept the axioms of set theory ( which is much stronger ) to prove its consistency gödel 's second incompleteness theorem ( see gödel 's incompleteness theorems ) places a severe limit on how weak a finitistic system can be while still proving the consistency of peano arithmetic gödel 's second incompleteness theorem shows that it is not possible for any proof that peano arithmetic is consistent to be carried out within peano arithmetic itself however , as nagel and newman ( 1958:96 & ndash ; 99 ) explain , there is still room for a proof that can not be formalized in arithmetic : : '' this imposing result of godel 's analysis should not be misunderstood : it does not exclude a meta-mathematical proof of the consistency of arithmetic but these meta-mathematical proofs can not be represented within the arithmetical calculus ; and , since they are not finitistic , they do not achieve the proclaimed objectives of hilbert 's original program the possibility of constructing a finitistic absolute proof of consistency for arithmetic is not excluded by gödel ’ s results . gentzen 's consistency proof gentzen 's proof proceeds by assigning to each proof in peano arithmetic an ordinal number , based on the structure of the proof , with each of these ordinals less than epsilon zero gentzen 's consistency proof initiated the program of ordinal analysis in proof theory kreisel ( 1976 ) states that although gödel 's results imply that no finitistic syntactic consistency proof can be obtained , semantic ( in particular , second-order ) arguments can be used to give convincing consistency proofs & nbsp ; 65 ) argues that gödel 's theorem does not prevent a consistency proof because its hypotheses might not apply to all the systems in which a consistency proof could be carried out '' gödel 's reformulation of gentzen 's first consistency proof of arithmetic : the no-counterexample interpretation

'' in contrast to the relative dearth of reports on frozen ground in north america prior to world war ii , a vast literature on the engineering aspects of permafrost was available in russian geological survey library so that he was able to furnish the government an engineering field guide and a technical report about permafrost by 1943 '' , year in which he coined the term as a contraction of permanently frozen ground in areas of continuous permafrost and harsh winters , the depth of the permafrost can exceed permafrost can also store carbon , both as peat and as methane work investigating the permafrost carbon pool size estimates that 1400–1700 gt of carbon is stored in the northern circumpolar permafrost region while a recent study that includes stores of the tibetan plateau , estimates total carbon pools in the permafrost of the northern hemisphere to be 1832 gt image : digging in permafrost.jpg thumb excavating ice-rich permafrost with a jackhammer in alaska the middle zone is permanently frozen as “ permafrost ” , and the bottom layer is where the geothermal temperature is above freezing note the importance of the vertical 0° c line : it denotes the bottom of the active layer in the seasonally variable temperature zone and the bottom limit of permafrost as the temperature increases with depth -- - > permafrost is soil , rock or sediment that is frozen for more than two consecutive years in areas not overlain by ice , it exists beneath a layer of soil , rock or sediment , which freezes and thaws annually and is called the '' active layer '' active layer thickness varies with the season , but is 0.3 to 4 meters thick ( shallow along the arctic coast ; deep in southern siberia and the qinghai-tibetan plateau ) of this area slightly more than half is underlain by continuous permafrost , around 20 percent by discontinuous permafrost , and a little less than 30 percent by sporadic permafrost a435 most of this area is found in siberia , northern canada , alaska and greenland the deepest depth of permafrost occurs where geothermal heat maintains a temperature above freezing above that bottom limit there may be permafrost with a consistent annual temperature— '' isothermal permafrost '' permafrost typically forms in any climate where the mean annual air temperature is lower than the freezing point of water since all glaciers are warmed at their base by geothermal heat , glacier types , which are near the pressure-melting point throughout , may have liquid water at the interface with the ground and are therefore free of underlying permafrost the below-ground temperature varies less from season to season than the air temperature , with mean annual temperatures tending to increase with depth as a result of the geothermal crustal gradient thus , if the mean annual air temperature is only slightly below , permafrost will form only in spots that are sheltered—usually with a northern or southern aspect ( in north and south hemispheres respectively ) —creating discontinuous permafrost usually , permafrost will remain discontinuous in a climate where the mean annual soil surface temperature is between discontinuous permafrost is often further divided into extensive discontinuous permafrost , where permafrost covers between 50 and 90 percent of the landscape and is usually found in areas with mean annual temperatures between , and sporadic permafrost , where permafrost cover is less than 50 percent of the landscape and typically occurs at mean annual temperatures between in soil science , the sporadic permafrost zone is abbreviated spz and the extensive discontinuous permafrost zone dpz permafrost extends to a base depth where geothermal heat from the earth and the mean annual temperature at the surface achieve an equilibrium temperature of 0 & nbsp ; °c the table to the right shows that the first hundred metres of permafrost forms relatively quickly but that deeper levels take progressively longer when the ice content of a permafrost exceeds 250 percent ( ice to dry soil by mass ) it is classified as massive ice additionally , ice wedges—a separate type of ground ice—produce recognizable patterned ground or tundra polygons . carbon cycle in permafrost when permafrost continues to diminish , many climate change scenarios will be amplified in areas where permafrost is high , the infrastructure surrounded may be damaged severely by the thawing of permafrost ;

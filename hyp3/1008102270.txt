life can be supported only within the active layer since growth and root establishment can occur only in soil that is fully thawed for some part of the year thickness of the active layer varies by year and location , but is typically thick in areas of continuous permafrost and harsh winters , the depth of the permafrost can exceed work investigating the permafrost carbon pool size estimates that 1400–1700 gt of carbon is stored in the northern circumpolar permafrost region this large carbon pool represents more carbon than currently exists in all living things the middle zone is permanently frozen as “ permafrost ” , and the bottom layer is where the geothermal temperature is above freezing note the importance of the vertical 0° c line : it denotes the bottom of the active layer in the seasonally variable temperature zone and the bottom limit of permafrost as the temperature increases with depth -- - > permafrost is soil , rock or sediment that is frozen for more than two consecutive years in practice , this means that permafrost occurs at an mean annual temperature of or below active layer thickness varies with the season , but is 0.3 to 4 meters thick ( shallow along the arctic coast ; deep in southern siberia and the qinghai-tibetan plateau ) the extent of permafrost varies with the climate : in the northern hemisphere today , 24 % of the ice-free land area , equivalent to 19 & nbsp ; million square kilometers , is more or less influenced by permafrost of this area slightly more than half is underlain by continuous permafrost , around 20 percent by discontinuous permafrost , and a little less than 30 percent by sporadic permafrost a435 most of this area is found in siberia , northern canada , alaska and greenland above that bottom limit there may be permafrost with a consistent annual temperature— '' isothermal permafrost '' permafrost typically forms in any climate where the mean annual air temperature is lower than the freezing point of water exceptions are found in humid boreal forests , such as in northern scandinavia and the north-eastern part of european russia west of the urals , where snow acts as an insulating blanket the below-ground temperature varies less from season to season than the air temperature , with mean annual temperatures tending to increase with depth as a result of the geothermal crustal gradient thus , if the mean annual air temperature is only slightly below , permafrost will form only in spots that are sheltered—usually with a northern or southern aspect ( in north and south hemispheres respectively ) —creating discontinuous permafrost usually , permafrost will remain discontinuous in a climate where the mean annual soil surface temperature is between in the moist-wintered areas mentioned before , there may not be even discontinuous permafrost down to in soil science , the sporadic permafrost zone is abbreviated spz and the extensive discontinuous permafrost zone dpz permafrost extends to a base depth where geothermal heat from the earth and the mean annual temperature at the surface achieve an equilibrium temperature of 0 & nbsp ; °c the geothermal gradient is the rate of increasing temperature with respect to increasing depth in the earth 's interior two categories of massive ground ice are buried surface ice and intrasedimental ice ( also called constitutional ice ) buried surface ice may derive from snow , frozen lake or sea ice , aufeis ( stranded river ice ) and—probably the most prevalent—buried glacial ice intrasedimental or constitutional ice has been widely observed and studied across canada and also includes intrusive and injection ice additionally , ice wedges—a separate type of ground ice—produce recognizable patterned ground or tundra polygons . carbon cycle in permafrost when permafrost continues to diminish , many climate change scenarios will be amplified in areas where permafrost is high , the infrastructure surrounded may be damaged severely by the thawing of permafrost yugo ono and tomohisa irino ;

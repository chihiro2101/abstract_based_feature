beginning in 1942 , siemon william muller delved into the relevant russian literature held by the library of congress and the u.s geological survey library so that he was able to furnish the government an engineering field guide and a technical report about permafrost by 1943 '' , year in which he coined the term as a contraction of permanently frozen ground thickness of the active layer varies by year and location , but is typically thick work investigating the permafrost carbon pool size estimates that 1400–1700 gt of carbon is stored in the northern circumpolar permafrost region while a recent study that includes stores of the tibetan plateau , estimates total carbon pools in the permafrost of the northern hemisphere to be 1832 gt this large carbon pool represents more carbon than currently exists in all living things the middle zone is permanently frozen as “ permafrost ” , and the bottom layer is where the geothermal temperature is above freezing note the importance of the vertical 0° c line : it denotes the bottom of the active layer in the seasonally variable temperature zone and the bottom limit of permafrost as the temperature increases with depth -- - > permafrost is soil , rock or sediment that is frozen for more than two consecutive years in areas not overlain by ice , it exists beneath a layer of soil , rock or sediment , which freezes and thaws annually and is called the '' active layer '' in practice , this means that permafrost occurs at an mean annual temperature of or below active layer thickness varies with the season , but is 0.3 to 4 meters thick ( shallow along the arctic coast ; deep in southern siberia and the qinghai-tibetan plateau ) the extent of permafrost varies with the climate : in the northern hemisphere today , 24 % of the ice-free land area , equivalent to 19 & nbsp ; million square kilometers , is more or less influenced by permafrost of this area slightly more than half is underlain by continuous permafrost , around 20 percent by discontinuous permafrost , and a little less than 30 percent by sporadic permafrost a435 most of this area is found in siberia , northern canada , alaska and greenland beneath the active layer annual temperature swings of permafrost become smaller with depth the deepest depth of permafrost occurs where geothermal heat maintains a temperature above freezing above that bottom limit there may be permafrost with a consistent annual temperature— '' isothermal permafrost '' '' fossil '' cold anomalies in the geothermal gradient in areas where deep permafrost developed during the pleistocene persist down to several hundred metres this is evident from temperature measurements in boreholes in north america and europe thus , if the mean annual air temperature is only slightly below , permafrost will form only in spots that are sheltered—usually with a northern or southern aspect ( in north and south hemispheres respectively ) —creating discontinuous permafrost usually , permafrost will remain discontinuous in a climate where the mean annual soil surface temperature is between in the moist-wintered areas mentioned before , there may not be even discontinuous permafrost down to in soil science , the sporadic permafrost zone is abbreviated spz and the extensive discontinuous permafrost zone dpz exceptions occur in un-glaciated siberia and alaska where the present depth of permafrost is a relic of climatic conditions during glacial ages where winters were up to colder than those of today it varies with the thermal conductivity of geologic material and is less for permafrost in soil than in bedrock two categories of massive ground ice are buried surface ice and intrasedimental ice ( also called constitutional ice ) additionally , ice wedges—a separate type of ground ice—produce recognizable patterned ground or tundra polygons permafrost processes manifest themselves in large-scale land forms , such as palsas and pingos and smaller-scale phenomena , such as patterned ground found in arctic , periglacial and alpine areas south african journal of science , 98 : 171–180 , review articles , pretoria , sudáfrica by definition , permafrost is ground that remains frozen for two or more years over the past century , an increasing number of alpine rock slope failure events in mountain ranges around the world have been recorded it is expected that the high number of structural failures is due to permafrost thawing , which is thought to be linked to climate change increasing temperatures allow deeper active layer depths , resulting in increased water infiltration ice within the soil melts , causing loss of soil strength , accelerated movement , and potential debris flows instability of slopes in permafrost at elevated temperatures near freezing point in warming permafrost is related to effective stress and buildup of pore-water pressure in these soils they extended the use of effective stress concept to partially frozen soils for use in slope stability analysis of warming permafrost slopes in the northern circumpolar region , permafrost contains 1700 & nbsp ;

'' in contrast to the relative dearth of reports on frozen ground in north america prior to world war ii , a vast literature on the engineering aspects of permafrost was available in russian geological survey library so that he was able to furnish the government an engineering field guide and a technical report about permafrost by 1943 '' , year in which he coined the term as a contraction of permanently frozen ground in 1947 a revised report was released publicly , which is regarded as the first north american treatise on the subject in areas of continuous permafrost and harsh winters , the depth of the permafrost can exceed permafrost can also store carbon , both as peat and as methane work investigating the permafrost carbon pool size estimates that 1400–1700 gt of carbon is stored in the northern circumpolar permafrost region while a recent study that includes stores of the tibetan plateau , estimates total carbon pools in the permafrost of the northern hemisphere to be 1832 gt the middle zone is permanently frozen as “ permafrost ” , and the bottom layer is where the geothermal temperature is above freezing note the importance of the vertical 0° c line : it denotes the bottom of the active layer in the seasonally variable temperature zone and the bottom limit of permafrost as the temperature increases with depth -- - > permafrost is soil , rock or sediment that is frozen for more than two consecutive years in areas not overlain by ice , it exists beneath a layer of soil , rock or sediment , which freezes and thaws annually and is called the '' active layer '' in practice , this means that permafrost occurs at an mean annual temperature of or below the extent of permafrost varies with the climate : in the northern hemisphere today , 24 % of the ice-free land area , equivalent to 19 & nbsp ; million square kilometers , is more or less influenced by permafrost of this area slightly more than half is underlain by continuous permafrost , around 20 percent by discontinuous permafrost , and a little less than 30 percent by sporadic permafrost above that bottom limit there may be permafrost with a consistent annual temperature— '' isothermal permafrost '' since all glaciers are warmed at their base by geothermal heat , glacier types , which are near the pressure-melting point throughout , may have liquid water at the interface with the ground and are therefore free of underlying permafrost '' fossil '' cold anomalies in the geothermal gradient in areas where deep permafrost developed during the pleistocene persist down to several hundred metres this is evident from temperature measurements in boreholes in north america and europe thus , if the mean annual air temperature is only slightly below , permafrost will form only in spots that are sheltered—usually with a northern or southern aspect ( in north and south hemispheres respectively ) —creating discontinuous permafrost usually , permafrost will remain discontinuous in a climate where the mean annual soil surface temperature is between in the moist-wintered areas mentioned before , there may not be even discontinuous permafrost down to discontinuous permafrost is often further divided into extensive discontinuous permafrost , where permafrost covers between 50 and 90 percent of the landscape and is usually found in areas with mean annual temperatures between , and sporadic permafrost , where permafrost cover is less than 50 percent of the landscape and typically occurs at mean annual temperatures between exceptions occur in un-glaciated siberia and alaska where the present depth of permafrost is a relic of climatic conditions during glacial ages where winters were up to colder than those of today permafrost extends to a base depth where geothermal heat from the earth and the mean annual temperature at the surface achieve an equilibrium temperature of 0 & nbsp ; °c the base depth of permafrost reaches in the northern lena and yana river basins in siberia the geothermal gradient is the rate of increasing temperature with respect to increasing depth in the earth 's interior away from tectonic plate boundaries , it is about 25–30 & nbsp ; °c/km ( 124–139 & nbsp ; °f/mi ) near the surface in most of the world it varies with the thermal conductivity of geologic material and is less for permafrost in soil than in bedrock -- - > calculations indicate that the time required to form the deep permafrost underlying prudhoe bay , alaska was over a half-million years this extended over several glacial and interglacial cycles of the pleistocene and suggests that the present climate of prudhoe bay is probably considerably warmer than it has been on average over that period when the ice content of a permafrost exceeds 250 percent ( ice to dry soil by mass ) it is classified as massive ice massive ice bodies can range in composition , in every conceivable gradation from icy mud to pure ice permafrost processes manifest themselves in large-scale land forms , such as palsas and pingos and smaller-scale phenomena , such as patterned ground found in arctic , periglacial and alpine areas . carbon cycle in permafrost the permafrost carbon cycle ( arctic carbon cycle ) deals with the transfer of carbon from permafrost soils to terrestrial vegetation and microbes , to the atmosphere , back to vegetation , and finally back to permafrost soils through burial and sedimentation due to cryogenic processes yugo ono and tomohisa irino ;

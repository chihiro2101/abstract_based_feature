'' in contrast to the relative dearth of reports on frozen ground in north america prior to world war ii , a vast literature on the engineering aspects of permafrost was available in russian beginning in 1942 , siemon william muller delved into the relevant russian literature held by the library of congress and the u.s geological survey library so that he was able to furnish the government an engineering field guide and a technical report about permafrost by 1943 '' , year in which he coined the term as a contraction of permanently frozen ground thickness of the active layer varies by year and location , but is typically thick in areas of continuous permafrost and harsh winters , the depth of the permafrost can exceed work investigating the permafrost carbon pool size estimates that 1400–1700 gt of carbon is stored in the northern circumpolar permafrost region while a recent study that includes stores of the tibetan plateau , estimates total carbon pools in the permafrost of the northern hemisphere to be 1832 gt the middle zone is permanently frozen as “ permafrost ” , and the bottom layer is where the geothermal temperature is above freezing -- - > permafrost is soil , rock or sediment that is frozen for more than two consecutive years in practice , this means that permafrost occurs at an mean annual temperature of or below active layer thickness varies with the season , but is 0.3 to 4 meters thick ( shallow along the arctic coast ; deep in southern siberia and the qinghai-tibetan plateau ) the extent of permafrost varies with the climate : in the northern hemisphere today , 24 % of the ice-free land area , equivalent to 19 & nbsp ; million square kilometers , is more or less influenced by permafrost of this area slightly more than half is underlain by continuous permafrost , around 20 percent by discontinuous permafrost , and a little less than 30 percent by sporadic permafrost a435 most of this area is found in siberia , northern canada , alaska and greenland beneath the active layer annual temperature swings of permafrost become smaller with depth the deepest depth of permafrost occurs where geothermal heat maintains a temperature above freezing above that bottom limit there may be permafrost with a consistent annual temperature— '' isothermal permafrost '' exceptions are found in humid boreal forests , such as in northern scandinavia and the north-eastern part of european russia west of the urals , where snow acts as an insulating blanket thus , if the mean annual air temperature is only slightly below , permafrost will form only in spots that are sheltered—usually with a northern or southern aspect ( in north and south hemispheres respectively ) —creating discontinuous permafrost usually , permafrost will remain discontinuous in a climate where the mean annual soil surface temperature is between in the moist-wintered areas mentioned before , there may not be even discontinuous permafrost down to exceptions occur in un-glaciated siberia and alaska where the present depth of permafrost is a relic of climatic conditions during glacial ages where winters were up to colder than those of today permafrost extends to a base depth where geothermal heat from the earth and the mean annual temperature at the surface achieve an equilibrium temperature of 0 & nbsp ; °c it varies with the thermal conductivity of geologic material and is less for permafrost in soil than in bedrock massive ice bodies can range in composition , in every conceivable gradation from icy mud to pure ice two categories of massive ground ice are buried surface ice and intrasedimental ice ( also called constitutional ice ) buried surface ice may derive from snow , frozen lake or sea ice , aufeis ( stranded river ice ) and—probably the most prevalent—buried glacial ice intrasedimental or constitutional ice has been widely observed and studied across canada and also includes intrusive and injection ice when permafrost continues to diminish , many climate change scenarios will be amplified in areas where permafrost is high , the infrastructure surrounded may be damaged severely by the thawing of permafrost the ground can consist of many substrate materials , including bedrock , sediment , organic matter , water or ice over the past century , an increasing number of alpine rock slope failure events in mountain ranges around the world have been recorded it is expected that the high number of structural failures is due to permafrost thawing , which is thought to be linked to climate change in mountain ranges , much of the structural stability can be attributed to glaciers and permafrost as climate warms , permafrost thaws , which results in a less stable mountain structure , and ultimately more slope failures the use of effective stress concept has many advantages such as ability to extend the concepts of '' critical state soil mechanics '' into frozen ground engineering one of the most widespread examples is the dominance of black spruce in extensive permafrost areas , since this species can tolerate rooting pattern constrained to the near surface unep , nairobi , kenya release of greenhouse gases from thawed permafrost to the atmosphere increases global warming among other issues addressed by the ipa are : problems for construction on permafrost owing to the change of soil properties of the ground on which structures are placed and the biological processes in permafrost , e.g permafrostwatch university of alaska fairbanks infographics about permafrost international permafrost association ( ipa ) center for permafrost map of permafrost in antarctica

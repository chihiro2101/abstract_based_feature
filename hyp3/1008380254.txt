a dynamical system is generally described by one or more differential or difference equations dynamical systems in the physical world tend to arise from dissipative system : if it were not for some driving force , the motion would cease the subset of the phase space of the dynamical system corresponding to the typical behavior is the attractor , also known as the attracting section or attractee invariant sets and limit sets are similar to the attractor concept a limit set is a set of points such that there exists some initial state that ends up arbitrarily close to the limit set ( i.e for example , the damped pendulum has two invariant points : the point of minimum height and the point of maximum height the point is also a limit set , as trajectories converge to it ; the point is not a limit set because of the dissipation due to air resistance , the point is also an attractor that is , if a is a point in an n-dimensional phase space , representing the initial state of the system , then f ( 0 , a ) a and , for a positive value of t , f ( t , a ) is the result of the evolution of this state after t units of time there exists a neighborhood of a , called the basin of attraction for a and denoted b ( a ) , which consists of all points b that '' enter a in the limit t & nbsp ; → & nbsp ; ∞ '' more formally , b ( a ) is the set of all points b in the phase space with the following property : : : for any open neighborhood n of a , there is a positive constant t such that f ( t , b ) ∈ n for all real t > t since the basin of attraction contains an open set containing a , every point that is sufficiently close to a is attracted to a until the 1960s , attractors were thought of as being geometric primitive of the phase space , like points , lines , surfaces , and simple regions of three-dimensional space more complex attractors that can not be categorized as simple geometric subsets , such as topology wild sets , were known of at the time but were thought to be fragile anomalies two simple attractors are a fixed point and the limit cycle if we regard the evolution of a dynamical system as a series of transformations , then there may or may not be a point which remains fixed under each transformation in the case of a marble on top of an inverted bowl ( a hill ) , that point at the top of the bowl ( hill ) is a fixed point ( equilibrium ) , but not an attractor ( stable equilibrium ) in the case of a marble on top of an inverted bowl , even if the bowl seems perfectly hemispherical , and the marble 's sphere shape , are both much more complex surfaces when examined under a microscope , and their shapes change or deform during contact there are many points in this surface terrain ( and the dynamic system of a similarly rough marble rolling around on this microscopic terrain ) that are considered stationary or fixed points , some of which are categorized as attractors there may be more than one frequency in the periodic trajectory of the system through the state of a limit cycle examples of strange attractors include the double scroll attractor , hénon map , rössler attractor , and lorenz attractor this behavior can be thought of as similar to a strange attractor , due to its chaotic nature and potential to create fractional dimensional shapes in contrast , the basin of attraction of a hidden attractor does not contain neighborhoods of equilibria , so the hidden attractor can not be localized by standard computational procedures

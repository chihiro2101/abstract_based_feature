a dynamical system is generally described by one or more differential or difference equations the equations of a given dynamical system specify its behavior over any given short period of time to determine the system 's behavior for a longer period , it is often necessary to integral the equations , either through analytical means or through iteration , often with the aid of computers dynamical systems in the physical world tend to arise from dissipative system : if it were not for some driving force , the motion would cease ) the dissipation and the driving force tend to balance , killing off initial transients and settle the system into its typical behavior the subset of the phase space of the dynamical system corresponding to the typical behavior is the attractor , also known as the attracting section or attractee an invariant set is a set that evolves to itself under the dynamics a limit set is a set of points such that there exists some initial state that ends up arbitrarily close to the limit set ( i.e for example , the damped pendulum has two invariant points : the point of minimum height and the point of maximum height the point is also a limit set , as trajectories converge to it ; the point is not a limit set some attractors are known to be chaotic ( see strange attractor ) , in which case the evolution of any two distinct points of the attractor result in exponentially chaos theory , which complicates prediction when even the smallest noise is present in the system \ an attractor is a subset a of the phase space characterized by the following three conditions : a is forward invariant under f : if a is an element of a then so is f ( t , a ) , for all & nbsp ; t & nbsp ; > & nbsp ; 0 more formally , b ( a ) is the set of all points b in the phase space with the following property : : : for any open neighborhood n of a , there is a positive constant t such that f ( t , b ) ∈ n for all real t > t since the basin of attraction contains an open set containing a , every point that is sufficiently close to a is attracted to a for example , some authors require that an attractor have positive measure ( preventing a point from being an attractor ) , others relax the requirement that b ( a ) be a neighborhood attractors are portions or subsets of the phase space of a dynamical system two simple attractors are a fixed point and the limit cycle lines , surfaces , spheres , toroids , manifolds ) , then the attractor is called a strange attractor if we regard the evolution of a dynamical system as a series of transformations , then there may or may not be a point which remains fixed under each transformation there may be more than one frequency in the periodic trajectory of the system through the state of a limit cycle examples of strange attractors include the double scroll attractor , hénon map , rössler attractor , and lorenz attractor for the three-dimensional , incompressible navier–stokes equation with periodic boundary conditions , if it has a global attractor , then this attractor will be of finite dimensions while continuous systems like a pendulum may get exponentially close to an attractor , cellular automata can reach attractors in finite time

a dynamical system is generally described by one or more differential or difference equations the equations of a given dynamical system specify its behavior over any given short period of time dynamical systems in the physical world tend to arise from dissipative system : if it were not for some driving force , the motion would cease the subset of the phase space of the dynamical system corresponding to the typical behavior is the attractor , also known as the attracting section or attractee a limit set is a set of points such that there exists some initial state that ends up arbitrarily close to the limit set ( i.e for example , the damped pendulum has two invariant points : the point of minimum height and the point of maximum height the point is also a limit set , as trajectories converge to it ; the point is not a limit set because of the dissipation due to air resistance , the point is also an attractor some attractors are known to be chaotic ( see strange attractor ) , in which case the evolution of any two distinct points of the attractor result in exponentially chaos theory , which complicates prediction when even the smallest noise is present in the system that is , if a is a point in an n-dimensional phase space , representing the initial state of the system , then f ( 0 , a ) a and , for a positive value of t , f ( t , a ) is the result of the evolution of this state after t units of time more formally , b ( a ) is the set of all points b in the phase space with the following property : : : for any open neighborhood n of a , there is a positive constant t such that f ( t , b ) ∈ n for all real t > t since the basin of attraction contains an open set containing a , every point that is sufficiently close to a is attracted to a for example , some authors require that an attractor have positive measure ( preventing a point from being an attractor ) , others relax the requirement that b ( a ) be a neighborhood until the 1960s , attractors were thought of as being geometric primitive of the phase space , like points , lines , surfaces , and simple regions of three-dimensional space two simple attractors are a fixed point and the limit cycle lines , surfaces , spheres , toroids , manifolds ) , then the attractor is called a strange attractor if we regard the evolution of a dynamical system as a series of transformations , then there may or may not be a point which remains fixed under each transformation in the case of a marble on top of an inverted bowl ( a hill ) , that point at the top of the bowl ( hill ) is a fixed point ( equilibrium ) , but not an attractor ( stable equilibrium ) in a discrete-time system , an attractor can take the form of a finite number of points that are visited in sequence examples of strange attractors include the double scroll attractor , hénon map , rössler attractor , and lorenz attractor if the expression has more than one real root , some starting points for the iterative algorithm will lead to one of the roots asymptotically , and other starting points will lead to another while continuous systems like a pendulum may get exponentially close to an attractor , cellular automata can reach attractors in finite time in contrast , the basin of attraction of a hidden attractor does not contain neighborhoods of equilibria , so the hidden attractor can not be localized by standard computational procedures

a dynamical system is generally described by one or more differential or difference equations the equations of a given dynamical system specify its behavior over any given short period of time the subset of the phase space of the dynamical system corresponding to the typical behavior is the attractor , also known as the attracting section or attractee invariant sets and limit sets are similar to the attractor concept a limit set is a set of points such that there exists some initial state that ends up arbitrarily close to the limit set ( i.e attractors are limit sets , but not all limit sets are attractors : it is possible to have some points of a system converge to a limit set , but different points when perturbed slightly off the limit set may get knocked off and never return to the vicinity of the limit set for example , the damped pendulum has two invariant points : the point of minimum height and the point of maximum height the point is also a limit set , as trajectories converge to it ; the point is not a limit set because of the dissipation due to air resistance , the point is also an attractor some attractors are known to be chaotic ( see strange attractor ) , in which case the evolution of any two distinct points of the attractor result in exponentially chaos theory , which complicates prediction when even the smallest noise is present in the system that is , if a is a point in an n-dimensional phase space , representing the initial state of the system , then f ( 0 , a ) a and , for a positive value of t , f ( t , a ) is the result of the evolution of this state after t units of time \ an attractor is a subset a of the phase space characterized by the following three conditions : a is forward invariant under f : if a is an element of a then so is f ( t , a ) , for all & nbsp ; t & nbsp ; > & nbsp ; 0 more formally , b ( a ) is the set of all points b in the phase space with the following property : : : for any open neighborhood n of a , there is a positive constant t such that f ( t , b ) ∈ n for all real t > t the definition of an attractor uses a metric on the phase space , but the resulting notion usually depends only on the topology of the phase space for example , some authors require that an attractor have positive measure ( preventing a point from being an attractor ) , others relax the requirement that b ( a ) be a neighborhood lines , surfaces , spheres , toroids , manifolds ) , then the attractor is called a strange attractor but the fixed point ( s ) of a dynamic system is not necessarily an attractor of the system for example , if the bowl containing a rolling marble was inverted and the marble was balanced on top of the bowl , the center bottom ( now top ) of the bowl is a fixed state , but not an attractor there may be more than one frequency in the periodic trajectory of the system through the state of a limit cycle examples of strange attractors include the double scroll attractor , hénon map , rössler attractor , and lorenz attractor for the three-dimensional , incompressible navier–stokes equation with periodic boundary conditions , if it has a global attractor , then this attractor will be of finite dimensions while continuous systems like a pendulum may get exponentially close to an attractor , cellular automata can reach attractors in finite time in contrast , the basin of attraction of a hidden attractor does not contain neighborhoods of equilibria , so the hidden attractor can not be localized by standard computational procedures

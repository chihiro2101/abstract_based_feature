a dynamical system is generally described by one or more differential or difference equations dynamical systems in the physical world tend to arise from dissipative system : if it were not for some driving force , the motion would cease ( dissipation may come from friction , thermodynamics , or loss of material , among many causes the subset of the phase space of the dynamical system corresponding to the typical behavior is the attractor , also known as the attracting section or attractee a limit set is a set of points such that there exists some initial state that ends up arbitrarily close to the limit set ( i.e attractors are limit sets , but not all limit sets are attractors : it is possible to have some points of a system converge to a limit set , but different points when perturbed slightly off the limit set may get knocked off and never return to the vicinity of the limit set for example , the damped pendulum has two invariant points : the point of minimum height and the point of maximum height the point is also a limit set , as trajectories converge to it ; the point is not a limit set some attractors are known to be chaotic ( see strange attractor ) , in which case the evolution of any two distinct points of the attractor result in exponentially chaos theory , which complicates prediction when even the smallest noise is present in the system let t represent time and let f ( t , • ) be a function which specifies the dynamics of the system that is , if a is a point in an n-dimensional phase space , representing the initial state of the system , then f ( 0 , a ) a and , for a positive value of t , f ( t , a ) is the result of the evolution of this state after t units of time more formally , b ( a ) is the set of all points b in the phase space with the following property : : : for any open neighborhood n of a , there is a positive constant t such that f ( t , b ) ∈ n for all real t > t since the basin of attraction contains an open set containing a , every point that is sufficiently close to a is attracted to a the definition of an attractor uses a metric on the phase space , but the resulting notion usually depends only on the topology of the phase space attractors are portions or subsets of the phase space of a dynamical system until the 1960s , attractors were thought of as being geometric primitive of the phase space , like points , lines , surfaces , and simple regions of three-dimensional space stephen smale was able to show that his horseshoe map was robust and that its attractor had the structure of a cantor set two simple attractors are a fixed point and the limit cycle if we regard the evolution of a dynamical system as a series of transformations , then there may or may not be a point which remains fixed under each transformation there may be more than one frequency in the periodic trajectory of the system through the state of a limit cycle for the three-dimensional , incompressible navier–stokes equation with periodic boundary conditions , if it has a global attractor , then this attractor will be of finite dimensions while continuous systems like a pendulum may get exponentially close to an attractor , cellular automata can reach attractors in finite time in contrast , the basin of attraction of a hidden attractor does not contain neighborhoods of equilibria , so the hidden attractor can not be localized by standard computational procedures

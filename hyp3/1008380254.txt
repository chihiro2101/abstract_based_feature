a dynamical system is generally described by one or more differential or difference equations the equations of a given dynamical system specify its behavior over any given short period of time dynamical systems in the physical world tend to arise from dissipative system : if it were not for some driving force , the motion would cease ) the dissipation and the driving force tend to balance , killing off initial transients and settle the system into its typical behavior the subset of the phase space of the dynamical system corresponding to the typical behavior is the attractor , also known as the attracting section or attractee invariant sets and limit sets are similar to the attractor concept a limit set is a set of points such that there exists some initial state that ends up arbitrarily close to the limit set ( i.e attractors are limit sets , but not all limit sets are attractors : it is possible to have some points of a system converge to a limit set , but different points when perturbed slightly off the limit set may get knocked off and never return to the vicinity of the limit set for example , the damped pendulum has two invariant points : the point of minimum height and the point of maximum height the point is also a limit set , as trajectories converge to it ; the point is not a limit set that is , if a is a point in an n-dimensional phase space , representing the initial state of the system , then f ( 0 , a ) a and , for a positive value of t , f ( t , a ) is the result of the evolution of this state after t units of time \ an attractor is a subset a of the phase space characterized by the following three conditions : a is forward invariant under f : if a is an element of a then so is f ( t , a ) , for all & nbsp ; t & nbsp ; > & nbsp ; 0 the definition of an attractor uses a metric on the phase space , but the resulting notion usually depends only on the topology of the phase space for example , some authors require that an attractor have positive measure ( preventing a point from being an attractor ) , others relax the requirement that b ( a ) be a neighborhood stephen smale was able to show that his horseshoe map was robust and that its attractor had the structure of a cantor set lines , surfaces , spheres , toroids , manifolds ) , then the attractor is called a strange attractor if we regard the evolution of a dynamical system as a series of transformations , then there may or may not be a point which remains fixed under each transformation but the fixed point ( s ) of a dynamic system is not necessarily an attractor of the system in the case of a marble on top of an inverted bowl ( a hill ) , that point at the top of the bowl ( hill ) is a fixed point ( equilibrium ) , but not an attractor ( stable equilibrium ) examples of strange attractors include the double scroll attractor , hénon map , rössler attractor , and lorenz attractor for the three-dimensional , incompressible navier–stokes equation with periodic boundary conditions , if it has a global attractor , then this attractor will be of finite dimensions this behavior can be thought of as similar to a strange attractor , due to its chaotic nature and potential to create fractional dimensional shapes in contrast , the basin of attraction of a hidden attractor does not contain neighborhoods of equilibria , so the hidden attractor can not be localized by standard computational procedures

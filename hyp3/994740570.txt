this ancestor possibly evolved from an arboreal possum-like ancestor as is suspected of all macropodid marsupials in australia and new guinea global cooling during the pleistocene caused continent-wide drying and rainforest retractions in australia and new guinea the rainforest contractions isolated populations of bohra which resulted in the evolution of today 's tree-kangaroos ( dendrolagus spp these species are assigned to the genus dendrolagus : grizzled tree-kangaroo ( d inustus ) ; northern and western new guinea , plus the island of yapen , and possibly salawati and waigeo lumholtz 's tree-kangaroo ( d ursinus ) ; the bird 's head peninsula , west papua , new guinea matschie 's tree-kangaroo ( d matschiei ) ; the huon peninsula , papua new guinea doria 's tree-kangaroo ( d dorianus ) ; western , central , and southeastern new guinea seri 's tree-kangaroo ( d goodfellowi ) ; central and southeastern new guinea golden-mantled tree-kangaroo ( d pulcherrimus ) ; the foja mountains , papua and the torricelli mountains , papua new guinea lowlands tree-kangaroo ( d spadix ) ; the southwestern lowlands of papua new guinea dingiso ( d mayri ) ; the higher areas of the wondiwoi peninsula , west papua ( thought to be extinct until 2018 ) seri 's tree-kangaroo ( dendrolagus stellarum ) has been described as a subspecies of doria 's tree-kangaroo ( d tree-kangaroos inhabit the tropical rainforests of new guinea , far northeastern australia , and some of the islands in the region , in particular , the schouten islands and the raja ampat islands most tree-kangaroos are considered threatened due to hunting and habitat destruction tree-kangaroos will also eat grains , flour , various nuts , sap and tree bark the two most significant threats to tree-kangaroos are habitat loss and hunting research conducted on lumholtz 's tree-kangaroo , a species that dwells in the rain forests of northeastern australia , determined the frequency of causes of death

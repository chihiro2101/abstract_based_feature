the evolutionary history of tree-kangaroos possibly begins with a rainforest floor-dwelling pademelon-like ancestor this ancestor possibly evolved from an arboreal possum-like ancestor as is suspected of all macropodid marsupials in australia and new guinea the rock-wallabies that migrated into these introduced forests adapted to spend more time climbing trees during the late miocene the semi-arboreal rock-wallabies could have evolved into the now extinct tree-kangaroo genus bohra global cooling during the pleistocene caused continent-wide drying and rainforest retractions in australia and new guinea the rainforest contractions isolated populations of bohra which resulted in the evolution of today 's tree-kangaroos ( dendrolagus spp these species are assigned to the genus dendrolagus : grizzled tree-kangaroo ( d dorianus ) ; western , central , and southeastern new guinea seri 's tree-kangaroo ( d stellarum ) ; the highlands of west-central new guinea goodfellow 's tree-kangaroo ( d goodfellowi ) ; central and southeastern new guinea golden-mantled tree-kangaroo ( d pulcherrimus ) ; the foja mountains , papua and the torricelli mountains , papua new guinea lowlands tree-kangaroo ( d spadix ) ; the southwestern lowlands of papua new guinea dingiso ( d tree-kangaroos inhabit the tropical rainforests of new guinea , far northeastern australia , and some of the islands in the region , in particular , the schouten islands and the raja ampat islands most tree-kangaroos are considered threatened due to hunting and habitat destruction at least 14 known subspecies of tree-kangaroo are living in papua new guinea and australia tree-kangaroos have several adaptations to an arboreal life-style the two most significant threats to tree-kangaroos are habitat loss and hunting

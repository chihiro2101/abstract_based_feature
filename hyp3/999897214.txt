photomultipliers are typically constructed with an evacuated glass housing ( using an extremely tight and durable glass-to-metal seal like other vacuum_tube ) , containing a photocathode , several dynodes , and an anode incident photons strike the photocathode material , which is usually a thin vapor-deposited conducting layer on the inside of the entry window of the device a primary electron leaves the photocathode with the energy of the incoming photon , or about 3 & nbsp ; ev for '' blue '' photons , minus the work function of the photocathode 1 , the number of primary electrons in the initial group is proportional to the energy of the incident high energy gamma ray upon striking the first dynode , more low energy electrons are emitted , and these electrons are in turn accelerated toward the second dynode for example , if at each stage an average of 5 new electrons are produced for each incoming electron , and if there are 12 dynode stages , then at the last stage one expects for each primary electron about 5 12 ≈ 10 8 electrons this large number of electrons reaching the anode results in a sharp current pulse that is easily detectable , for example on an oscilloscope , signaling the arrival of the photon ( s ) at the photocathode ≈50 nanoseconds earlier in the example , the photocathode is held at a negative high voltage of order 1000 v , while the anode is usage_considerations the capacitors across the final few dynodes act as local reservoirs of charge to help maintain the voltage on the dynodes while electron avalanches propagate through the tube the side-on design is used , for instance , in the type 931 , the first mass-produced pmt besides the different photocathode materials , performance is also affected by the transmission of the window material that the light passes through , and by the arrangement of the dynodes many photomultiplier models are available having various combinations of these , and other , design variables the manufacturers manuals provide the information needed to choose an appropriate design for a particular application the invention of the photomultiplier is predicated upon two prior achievements , the separate discoveries of the photoelectric effect and of secondary emission significant for practical applications , elster and geitel two years later demonstrated the same effect using visible light striking alkali metals ( potassium and sodium ) it is worthwhile to note that heinrich hertz , working 18 years earlier , had not recognized that the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is proportional to the frequency but independent of the optical intensity this fact implied a discrete nature of light , i.e the application of the newly discovered secondary emission to the amplification of signals was only proposed after world war i by westinghouse scientist joseph slepian in a 1919 patent the ingredients for inventing the photomultiplier were coming together during the 1920s as the pace of vacuum tube technology accelerated the primary goal for many , if not most , workers was the need for a practical television camera technology photomultiplier technology was pursued to enable television camera tubes , such as the iconoscope and ( later ) the orthicon , to be sensitive enough to be practical , the photoelectric effect ) with secondary emission , both of which had already been studied and adequately understood , to create a practical photomultiplier the first documented photomultiplier demonstration dates to the early 1934 accomplishments of an rca group based in harrison , nj the tube had a gain of about eight and operated at frequencies well above 10 & nbsp ; khz however , it is an empirical fact that the yield of secondary electrons is limited in any given secondary emission process , regardless of acceleration voltage at the time the maximum first-stage gain that could be achieved was approximately 10 ( very significant developments in the 1960s permitted gains above 25 to be reached using negative electron affinity dynodes ) for this reason , multiple-stage photomultipliers , in which the photoelectron yield could be multiplied successively in several stages , were an important goal initially this challenge was overcome by using strong magnetic fields to bend the electrons ' trajectories accordingly , leading international research organizations turned their attention towards improving photomultiplers to achieve higher gain with multiple stages numerous visits were made by rca scientific personnel to the ussr in the 1930s , prior to the cold war , to instruct the soviet customers on the capabilities of rca equipment and to investigate customer needs '' the soviet device used a magnetic field to confine the secondary electrons and relied on the ag-o-cs photocathode which had been demonstrated by general electric in the 1920s the caesium-antimony photocathode had a dramatically improved quantum efficiency of 12 % at 400 & nbsp ; nm , and was used in the first commercially successful photomultipliers manufactured by rca ( i.e for example , blood analysis devices used by clinical medical laboratories , such as flow cytometry , utilize photomultipliers to determine the relative concentration of various components in blood samples , in combination with optical filters and incandescent lamps photomultipliers are typically used as the detectors in flying-spot scanners perhaps its most useful quality is that it acts , electronically , as a nearly perfect current source , owing to the high voltage utilized in extracting the tiny currents associated with weak light signals photon-counting applications generally demand photomultipliers designed to minimise dark current photomultiplier tubes : basics and applications ( second edition ) , hamamatsu photonics , hamamatsu city , japan , ( 1999 )

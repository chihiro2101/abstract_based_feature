photomultipliers are typically constructed with an evacuated glass housing ( using an extremely tight and durable glass-to-metal seal like other vacuum_tube ) , containing a photocathode , several dynodes , and an anode incident photons strike the photocathode material , which is usually a thin vapor-deposited conducting layer on the inside of the entry window of the device these electrons are directed by the focusing electrode toward the electron multiplier , where electrons are multiplied by the process of secondary emission the electron multiplier consists of a number of electrodes called dynodes a primary electron leaves the photocathode with the energy of the incoming photon , or about 3 & nbsp ; ev for '' blue '' photons , minus the work function of the photocathode ) the primary electrons move toward the first dynode because they are accelerated by the electric field they each arrive with ≈100 & nbsp ; ev kinetic energy imparted by the potential difference upon striking the first dynode , more low energy electrons are emitted , and these electrons are in turn accelerated toward the second dynode this large number of electrons reaching the anode results in a sharp current pulse that is easily detectable , for example on an oscilloscope , signaling the arrival of the photon ( s ) at the photocathode ≈50 nanoseconds earlier in the example , the photocathode is held at a negative high voltage of order 1000 v , while the anode is usage_considerations the side-on design is used , for instance , in the type 931 , the first mass-produced pmt besides the different photocathode materials , performance is also affected by the transmission of the window material that the light passes through , and by the arrangement of the dynodes the first demonstration of the photoelectric effect was carried out in 1887 by heinrich hertz using ultraviolet light significant for practical applications , elster and geitel two years later demonstrated the same effect using visible light striking alkali metals ( potassium and sodium ) the phenomenon of secondary emission ( the ability of electrons in a vacuum tube to cause the emission of additional electrons by striking an electrode ) was , at first , limited to purely electronic phenomena and devices ( which lacked photosensitivity ) in 1902 , austin and starke reported that the metal surfaces impacted by electron beams emitted a larger number of electrons than were incident bruining , physics and applications of secondary electron emission , ( mcgraw-hill book co the application of the newly discovered secondary emission to the amplification of signals was only proposed after world war i by westinghouse scientist joseph slepian in a 1919 patent slepian , westinghouse electric , '' hot cathode tube '' , issued april 3 , 1923 ( filed 1919 ) the race towards a practical electronic television camera the ingredients for inventing the photomultiplier were coming together during the 1920s as the pace of vacuum tube technology accelerated the primary goal for many , if not most , workers was the need for a practical television camera technology , the photoelectric effect ) with secondary emission , both of which had already been studied and adequately understood , to create a practical photomultiplier the first documented photomultiplier demonstration dates to the early 1934 accomplishments of an rca group based in harrison , nj harley iams and bernard salzberg were the first to integrate a photoelectric-effect cathode and single secondary emission amplification stage in a single vacuum envelope and the first to characterize its performance as a photomultiplier with electron amplification gain the device consisted of a semi-cylindrical photocathode , a secondary emitter mounted on the axis , and a collector grid surrounding the secondary emitter however , it is an empirical fact that the yield of secondary electrons is limited in any given secondary emission process , regardless of acceleration voltage at the time the maximum first-stage gain that could be achieved was approximately 10 ( very significant developments in the 1960s permitted gains above 25 to be reached using negative electron affinity dynodes ) initially this challenge was overcome by using strong magnetic fields to bend the electrons ' trajectories '' the soviet device used a magnetic field to confine the secondary electrons and relied on the ag-o-cs photocathode which had been demonstrated by general electric in the 1920s the rca prototype photomultipliers also used an ag-o-cs ( silver oxide-caesium ) photocathode the caesium-antimony photocathode had a dramatically improved quantum efficiency of 12 % at 400 & nbsp ; nm , and was used in the first commercially successful photomultipliers manufactured by rca ( i.e in subsequent years other products were added , such as cathode ray tubes , photomultiplier tubes , motion-sensing light control switches , and closed-circuit television systems photomultiplier tubes typically utilize 1000 to 2000 volts to accelerate electrons within the chain of dynodes photomultipliers with large distances between the photocathode and the first dynode are especially sensitive to magnetic fields in geiger mode the photomultiplier gain is set so high ( using high voltage ) that a single photo-electron resulting from a single photon incident on the primary surface generates a very large current at the output circuit a photomultiplier will produce a small current even without incident photons ; this is called the dark current

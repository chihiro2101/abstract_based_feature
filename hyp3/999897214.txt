photomultipliers are typically constructed with an evacuated glass housing ( using an extremely tight and durable glass-to-metal seal like other vacuum_tube ) , containing a photocathode , several dynodes , and an anode incident photons strike the photocathode material , which is usually a thin vapor-deposited conducting layer on the inside of the entry window of the device these electrons are directed by the focusing electrode toward the electron multiplier , where electrons are multiplied by the process of secondary emission a primary electron leaves the photocathode with the energy of the incoming photon , or about 3 & nbsp ; ev for '' blue '' photons , minus the work function of the photocathode a small group of primary electrons is created by the arrival of a group of initial photons 1 , the number of primary electrons in the initial group is proportional to the energy of the incident high energy gamma ray upon striking the first dynode , more low energy electrons are emitted , and these electrons are in turn accelerated toward the second dynode for example , if at each stage an average of 5 new electrons are produced for each incoming electron , and if there are 12 dynode stages , then at the last stage one expects for each primary electron about 5 12 ≈ 10 8 electrons in the example , the photocathode is held at a negative high voltage of order 1000 v , while the anode is usage_considerations many variations of design are used in practice ; the design shown is merely illustrative besides the different photocathode materials , performance is also affected by the transmission of the window material that the light passes through , and by the arrangement of the dynodes the manufacturers manuals provide the information needed to choose an appropriate design for a particular application the first demonstration of the photoelectric effect was carried out in 1887 by heinrich hertz using ultraviolet light significant for practical applications , elster and geitel two years later demonstrated the same effect using visible light striking alkali metals ( potassium and sodium ) it is worthwhile to note that heinrich hertz , working 18 years earlier , had not recognized that the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is proportional to the frequency but independent of the optical intensity this fact implied a discrete nature of light , i.e the phenomenon of secondary emission ( the ability of electrons in a vacuum tube to cause the emission of additional electrons by striking an electrode ) was , at first , limited to purely electronic phenomena and devices ( which lacked photosensitivity ) bruining , physics and applications of secondary electron emission , ( mcgraw-hill book co slepian , westinghouse electric , '' hot cathode tube '' , issued april 3 , 1923 ( filed 1919 ) the primary goal for many , if not most , workers was the need for a practical television camera technology television had been pursued with primitive prototypes for decades prior to the 1934 introduction of the first practical camera ( the iconoscope ) photomultiplier technology was pursued to enable television camera tubes , such as the iconoscope and ( later ) the orthicon , to be sensitive enough to be practical the first documented photomultiplier demonstration dates to the early 1934 accomplishments of an rca group based in harrison , nj these accomplishments were finalized prior to june 1934 as detailed in the manuscript submitted to proceedings of the institute of radio engineers ( proc the tube had a gain of about eight and operated at frequencies well above 10 & nbsp ; khz however , it is an empirical fact that the yield of secondary electrons is limited in any given secondary emission process , regardless of acceleration voltage at the time the maximum first-stage gain that could be achieved was approximately 10 ( very significant developments in the 1960s permitted gains above 25 to be reached using negative electron affinity dynodes ) '' the soviet device used a magnetic field to confine the secondary electrons and relied on the ag-o-cs photocathode which had been demonstrated by general electric in the 1920s pike , rca technical report tr-362 , '' electrostatic focusing in secondary emission multipliers , '' september 9 , 1937 following the acquisition , photonis was composed of photonis netherlands , photonis france , photonis usa , and burle industries connections to external circuits , hamamatsu ag-o-cs ( also called s1 ) transmission-mode , sensitive from 300–1200 & nbsp ; nm however , with the photocathode at high voltage , leakage currents sometimes result in unwanted '' dark current '' pulses that may affect the operation photomultipliers with large distances between the photocathode and the first dynode are especially sensitive to magnetic fields photomultipliers are used in research laboratories to measure the intensity and spectrum of light-emitting materials such as compound semiconductors and quantum dots there is no johnson noise associated with photomultiplier signal currents , even though they are greatly amplified , e.g the aforementioned refers to measurement of light fluxes that , while small , nonetheless amount to a continuous stream of multiple photons a photomultiplier will produce a small current even without incident photons ; this is called the dark current

photomultipliers are typically constructed with an evacuated glass housing ( using an extremely tight and durable glass-to-metal seal like other vacuum_tube ) , containing a photocathode , several dynodes , and an anode incident photons strike the photocathode material , which is usually a thin vapor-deposited conducting layer on the inside of the entry window of the device these electrons are directed by the focusing electrode toward the electron multiplier , where electrons are multiplied by the process of secondary emission a primary electron leaves the photocathode with the energy of the incoming photon , or about 3 & nbsp ; ev for '' blue '' photons , minus the work function of the photocathode a small group of primary electrons is created by the arrival of a group of initial photons 1 , the number of primary electrons in the initial group is proportional to the energy of the incident high energy gamma ray ) the primary electrons move toward the first dynode because they are accelerated by the electric field upon striking the first dynode , more low energy electrons are emitted , and these electrons are in turn accelerated toward the second dynode the geometry of the dynode chain is such that a cascade occurs with an exponentially-increasing number of electrons being produced at each stage for example , if at each stage an average of 5 new electrons are produced for each incoming electron , and if there are 12 dynode stages , then at the last stage one expects for each primary electron about 5 12 ≈ 10 8 electrons the necessary distribution of voltage along the series of dynodes is created by a voltage divider chain , as illustrated in fig the side-on design is used , for instance , in the type 931 , the first mass-produced pmt the manufacturers manuals provide the information needed to choose an appropriate design for a particular application the first demonstration of the photoelectric effect was carried out in 1887 by heinrich hertz using ultraviolet light significant for practical applications , elster and geitel two years later demonstrated the same effect using visible light striking alkali metals ( potassium and sodium ) the phenomenon of secondary emission ( the ability of electrons in a vacuum tube to cause the emission of additional electrons by striking an electrode ) was , at first , limited to purely electronic phenomena and devices ( which lacked photosensitivity ) in 1902 , austin and starke reported that the metal surfaces impacted by electron beams emitted a larger number of electrons than were incident bruining , physics and applications of secondary electron emission , ( mcgraw-hill book co the application of the newly discovered secondary emission to the amplification of signals was only proposed after world war i by westinghouse scientist joseph slepian in a 1919 patent photomultiplier technology was pursued to enable television camera tubes , such as the iconoscope and ( later ) the orthicon , to be sensitive enough to be practical so the stage was set to combine the dual phenomena of photoemission ( i.e harley iams and bernard salzberg were the first to integrate a photoelectric-effect cathode and single secondary emission amplification stage in a single vacuum envelope and the first to characterize its performance as a photomultiplier with electron amplification gain magnetic photomultipliers ( mid 1934–1937 ) however , it is an empirical fact that the yield of secondary electrons is limited in any given secondary emission process , regardless of acceleration voltage at the time the maximum first-stage gain that could be achieved was approximately 10 ( very significant developments in the 1960s permitted gains above 25 to be reached using negative electron affinity dynodes ) accordingly , leading international research organizations turned their attention towards improving photomultiplers to achieve higher gain with multiple stages numerous visits were made by rca scientific personnel to the ussr in the 1930s , prior to the cold war , to instruct the soviet customers on the capabilities of rca equipment and to investigate customer needs whereas these early photomultipliers used the magnetic field principle , electrostatic photomultipliers ( with no magnetic field ) were demonstrated by jan rajchman of rca laboratories in princeton , nj in the late 1930s and became the standard for all future commercial photomultipliers also in 1936 , a much improved photocathode , cs 3 sb ( caesium-antimony ) , was reported by p the caesium-antimony photocathode had a dramatically improved quantum efficiency of 12 % at 400 & nbsp ; nm , and was used in the first commercially successful photomultipliers manufactured by rca ( i.e in the early 1940s , the jedec ( joint electron device engineering council ) , an industry committee on standardization , developed a system of designating spectral responses various combinations of photocathode and window materials were assigned '' s-numbers '' ( spectral numbers ) ranging from s-1 through s-40 , which are still in use today navy in 1942 and operated by rca for the manufacture of radio and microwave tubes however , with the photocathode at high voltage , leakage currents sometimes result in unwanted '' dark current '' pulses that may affect the operation photomultipliers with large distances between the photocathode and the first dynode are especially sensitive to magnetic fields in geiger mode the photomultiplier gain is set so high ( using high voltage ) that a single photo-electron resulting from a single photon incident on the primary surface generates a very large current at the output circuit photon counting ( as it is called ) reveals that light , not only being a wave , consists of discrete particles ( i.e

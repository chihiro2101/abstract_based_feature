incident photons strike the photocathode material , which is usually a thin vapor-deposited conducting layer on the inside of the entry window of the device these electrons are directed by the focusing electrode toward the electron multiplier , where electrons are multiplied by the process of secondary emission a primary electron leaves the photocathode with the energy of the incoming photon , or about 3 & nbsp ; ev for '' blue '' photons , minus the work function of the photocathode 1 , the number of primary electrons in the initial group is proportional to the energy of the incident high energy gamma ray ) the primary electrons move toward the first dynode because they are accelerated by the electric field upon striking the first dynode , more low energy electrons are emitted , and these electrons are in turn accelerated toward the second dynode the geometry of the dynode chain is such that a cascade occurs with an exponentially-increasing number of electrons being produced at each stage for example , if at each stage an average of 5 new electrons are produced for each incoming electron , and if there are 12 dynode stages , then at the last stage one expects for each primary electron about 5 12 ≈ 10 8 electrons this large number of electrons reaching the anode results in a sharp current pulse that is easily detectable , for example on an oscilloscope , signaling the arrival of the photon ( s ) at the photocathode ≈50 nanoseconds earlier in the example , the photocathode is held at a negative high voltage of order 1000 v , while the anode is usage_considerations the capacitors across the final few dynodes act as local reservoirs of charge to help maintain the voltage on the dynodes while electron avalanches propagate through the tube the invention of the photomultiplier is predicated upon two prior achievements , the separate discoveries of the photoelectric effect and of secondary emission the addition of caesium , another alkali metal , has permitted the range of sensitive wavelengths to be extended towards longer wavelengths in the red portion of the visible spectrum historically , the photoelectric effect is associated with albert einstein , who relied upon the phenomenon to establish the fundamental principle of quantum mechanics in 1905 , an accomplishment for which einstein received the 1921 nobel prize the phenomenon of secondary emission ( the ability of electrons in a vacuum tube to cause the emission of additional electrons by striking an electrode ) was , at first , limited to purely electronic phenomena and devices ( which lacked photosensitivity ) in 1902 , austin and starke reported that the metal surfaces impacted by electron beams emitted a larger number of electrons than were incident the application of the newly discovered secondary emission to the amplification of signals was only proposed after world war i by westinghouse scientist joseph slepian in a 1919 patent the race towards a practical electronic television camera , the photoelectric effect ) with secondary emission , both of which had already been studied and adequately understood , to create a practical photomultiplier the first documented photomultiplier demonstration dates to the early 1934 accomplishments of an rca group based in harrison , nj harley iams and bernard salzberg were the first to integrate a photoelectric-effect cathode and single secondary emission amplification stage in a single vacuum envelope and the first to characterize its performance as a photomultiplier with electron amplification gain the tube had a gain of about eight and operated at frequencies well above 10 & nbsp ; khz however , it is an empirical fact that the yield of secondary electrons is limited in any given secondary emission process , regardless of acceleration voltage thus , any single-stage photomultiplier is limited in gain for this reason , multiple-stage photomultipliers , in which the photoelectron yield could be multiplied successively in several stages , were an important goal the challenge was to cause the photoelectrons to impinge on successively higher-voltage electrodes rather than to travel directly to the highest voltage electrode initially this challenge was overcome by using strong magnetic fields to bend the electrons ' trajectories whereas these early photomultipliers used the magnetic field principle , electrostatic photomultipliers ( with no magnetic field ) were demonstrated by jan rajchman of rca laboratories in princeton , nj in the late 1930s and became the standard for all future commercial photomultipliers the caesium-antimony photocathode had a dramatically improved quantum efficiency of 12 % at 400 & nbsp ; nm , and was used in the first commercially successful photomultipliers manufactured by rca ( i.e in subsequent years other products were added , such as cathode ray tubes , photomultiplier tubes , motion-sensing light control switches , and closed-circuit television systems on 9 march 2009 , photonis announced that it would cease all production of photomultipliers at both the lancaster , pennsylvania and the brive , france plants the japan-based company hamamatsu photonics ( also known as hamamatsu ) has emerged since the 1950s as a leader in the photomultiplier industry hamamatsu uses different designations for particular photocathode formulations and introduces modifications to these designations based on hamamatsu 's proprietary research and development photomultipliers are used in numerous medical equipment designs the aforementioned refers to measurement of light fluxes that , while small , nonetheless amount to a continuous stream of multiple photons a photomultiplier will produce a small current even without incident photons ;

photomultipliers are typically constructed with an evacuated glass housing ( using an extremely tight and durable glass-to-metal seal like other vacuum_tube ) , containing a photocathode , several dynodes , and an anode incident photons strike the photocathode material , which is usually a thin vapor-deposited conducting layer on the inside of the entry window of the device these electrons are directed by the focusing electrode toward the electron multiplier , where electrons are multiplied by the process of secondary emission a primary electron leaves the photocathode with the energy of the incoming photon , or about 3 & nbsp ; ev for '' blue '' photons , minus the work function of the photocathode 1 , the number of primary electrons in the initial group is proportional to the energy of the incident high energy gamma ray ) the primary electrons move toward the first dynode because they are accelerated by the electric field they each arrive with ≈100 & nbsp ; ev kinetic energy imparted by the potential difference upon striking the first dynode , more low energy electrons are emitted , and these electrons are in turn accelerated toward the second dynode the geometry of the dynode chain is such that a cascade occurs with an exponentially-increasing number of electrons being produced at each stage for example , if at each stage an average of 5 new electrons are produced for each incoming electron , and if there are 12 dynode stages , then at the last stage one expects for each primary electron about 5 12 ≈ 10 8 electrons many variations of design are used in practice ; the design shown is merely illustrative many photomultiplier models are available having various combinations of these , and other , design variables the invention of the photomultiplier is predicated upon two prior achievements , the separate discoveries of the photoelectric effect and of secondary emission significant for practical applications , elster and geitel two years later demonstrated the same effect using visible light striking alkali metals ( potassium and sodium ) the addition of caesium , another alkali metal , has permitted the range of sensitive wavelengths to be extended towards longer wavelengths in the red portion of the visible spectrum historically , the photoelectric effect is associated with albert einstein , who relied upon the phenomenon to establish the fundamental principle of quantum mechanics in 1905 , an accomplishment for which einstein received the 1921 nobel prize the phenomenon of secondary emission ( the ability of electrons in a vacuum tube to cause the emission of additional electrons by striking an electrode ) was , at first , limited to purely electronic phenomena and devices ( which lacked photosensitivity ) in 1902 , austin and starke reported that the metal surfaces impacted by electron beams emitted a larger number of electrons than were incident the application of the newly discovered secondary emission to the amplification of signals was only proposed after world war i by westinghouse scientist joseph slepian in a 1919 patent slepian , westinghouse electric , '' hot cathode tube '' , issued april 3 , 1923 ( filed 1919 ) the ingredients for inventing the photomultiplier were coming together during the 1920s as the pace of vacuum tube technology accelerated television had been pursued with primitive prototypes for decades prior to the 1934 introduction of the first practical camera ( the iconoscope ) , the photoelectric effect ) with secondary emission , both of which had already been studied and adequately understood , to create a practical photomultiplier the first documented photomultiplier demonstration dates to the early 1934 accomplishments of an rca group based in harrison , nj harley iams and bernard salzberg were the first to integrate a photoelectric-effect cathode and single secondary emission amplification stage in a single vacuum envelope and the first to characterize its performance as a photomultiplier with electron amplification gain the device consisted of a semi-cylindrical photocathode , a secondary emitter mounted on the axis , and a collector grid surrounding the secondary emitter the tube had a gain of about eight and operated at frequencies well above 10 & nbsp ; khz for this reason , multiple-stage photomultipliers , in which the photoelectron yield could be multiplied successively in several stages , were an important goal the challenge was to cause the photoelectrons to impinge on successively higher-voltage electrodes rather than to travel directly to the highest voltage electrode '' the soviet device used a magnetic field to confine the secondary electrons and relied on the ag-o-cs photocathode which had been demonstrated by general electric in the 1920s whereas these early photomultipliers used the magnetic field principle , electrostatic photomultipliers ( with no magnetic field ) were demonstrated by jan rajchman of rca laboratories in princeton , nj in the late 1930s and became the standard for all future commercial photomultipliers the first mass-produced photomultiplier , the type 931 , was of this design and is still commercially produced today various combinations of photocathode and window materials were assigned '' s-numbers '' ( spectral numbers ) ranging from s-1 through s-40 , which are still in use today photomultiplier tubes typically utilize 1000 to 2000 volts to accelerate electrons within the chain of dynodes photomultipliers were the first electric eye devices , being used to measure interruptions in beams of light after 50 years , during which solid-state electronic components have largely displaced the vacuum tube , the photomultiplier remains a unique and important optoelectronic component a photomultiplier will produce a small current even without incident photons ; this is called the dark current

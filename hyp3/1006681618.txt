captain thomas named the settlement for bishop john bird sumner , one of the leading members of the canterbury association andersen places this name on the beach at the mouth of the estuary , near shag rock ( rapanui ) sumner was surveyed in 1849 by edward jollie for captain joseph thomas , the advanced agent of the canterbury association however , his plans were abandoned through lack of funds and a new survey on which sumner is based was carried out in 1860 sumner was settled in late 1849 or early 1850 by work crews building the road to lyttelton , sumner is thus one of the oldest european settlements in the christchurch area the day family was the first to settle permanently in sumner followed by edward dobson and his family sumner had its first shop early in 1870 , and its proprietor , s.e when provincial councils were disestablished in 1876 and replaced with counties , sumner had a second parent body , the selwyn county added to the continuing road board in 1885 the harbour board granted the concession to build a bath at the east end of sumner beach on 22 february 2011 , sumner was hit by the christchurch earthquake , which destroyed or made uninhabitable a large number of the local houses and commercial buildings on 13 june the same year , sumner was hit by another earthquake of almost the same magnitude as the february event these two earthquakes caused many of sumner 's iconic cliffs to collapse , and many areas to be cordoned off with both traditional fences and shipping containers sumner is nestled in a coastal valley separated from the adjacent city suburbs by rugged volcano hill ridges that end in cliffs that descend to the sea shore in places there are other rocky outcrops in the area and the volcanic nature of the geology is readily apparent from several of the exposed cliffs around the valley left the sumner bar is a sand bar where the estuary meets the sea and is notoriously dangerous to cross quoted by the outlet of the avon heathcote estuary , at the western end of the beach , forms the sumner bar off shore of cave rock in earlier times , residents of those suburbs would often have been considered to be living in sumner , because these suburbs have road access via sumner or depend on services available in sumner settlement of flat land at sumner was also planned at an early stage in 1849 , this area was known as sumner nook and was the only comparatively safe place in the bay for landing from a boat , because of a lagoon formed by a small stream running into the sea in this area construction of a road from lyttelton to christchurch via evans pass and sumner began in 1849 sumner school was founded in 1876 and is these days a full primary school , teaching children from years 1 to 8 variously known as '' sumner college '' , '' beach glen boarding school '' or '' chelford '' , existed in sumner between about 1877 and 1895 he was also a church organist , sunday school teacher , a founding member of the sumner lawn tennis club , and involved in local body politics because of the hazard posed by the sumner bar , sumner has had a lifeboat of some kind almost since its settlement however , it is likely that small open rowing boats were available in the bay from the early 1850s

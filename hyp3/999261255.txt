situated about southeast of the city , it consisted of a two-story stone tower of limestone on which the russians had placed five heavy 18-pounder cannons at the beginning of the siege although it is known that the tower was built some time before the start of the war , the historical records do not show exactly when this occurred , and no mention of this is made in the contemporary descriptions of the siege itself at this time the russian cartographers marked all landmarks in and around this ridge as '' fort malakoff '' the name '' fortmortal malakoff '' ( or french '' fort malakoff '' , russian '' malakhov '' ) was retained after the war in western literature covering the crimean war the malakoff tower covered the suburb , flanked on either side by the redan and the little redan the russian artillery was initially successful , the french corps fell under siege and suffered heavy losses still , british siege batteries managed to silence the malakoff and its annexes , after having succeeded in hitting a munitions depot and , if failure had not occurred at the other points of attack , an assault might have succeeded at the end of the day , the russians drew off leaving 260 officers and 8,000 men dead or dying on the field ; the french and british only lost 1,700 the fighting was of the most desperate kind : the french attack on the malakoff was successful , but the other two french attacks were repelled the battle of the great redan was initially successful , but a russian counterattack drove the british out of the bastion after two hours after the french attacks on the flagstaff bastion ( left of the great redan ) were repelled with the failure of the french attacks in the left sector but with the fall of the malakoff in french hands further attacks were cancelled after the success of the french troops under the command of marshal pelissier , later the duke of malakoff ( french : duc de malakoff ) , and general patrice de mac-mahon , the russian defenders evacuated the entire city on 8 september 1855 , bringing a climax to the war among these were a number of stone mining towers in the ruhrgebiet , the so-called caponier fort malakoff in mainz , and the yellow sandstone malakoff tower in the city of luxembourg a malakoff was also named after this battle , as well as the avenue de malakoff

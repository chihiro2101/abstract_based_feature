until 1784 most of the fortifications around sevastopol were dedicated to the protection of the harbour entrance , the city itself and its naval base and were positioned close to these features situated about southeast of the city , it consisted of a two-story stone tower of limestone on which the russians had placed five heavy 18-pounder cannons at the beginning of the siege although it is known that the tower was built some time before the start of the war , the historical records do not show exactly when this occurred , and no mention of this is made in the contemporary descriptions of the siege itself what is known is that the tower was originally built or expanded by sevastopol merchants and then later taken over by the russian navy this included several large grave mounds and the same ridge lying in front known as mamelon ( '' vert mamelon '' ) the name '' fortmortal malakoff '' ( or french '' fort malakoff '' , russian '' malakhov '' ) was retained after the war in western literature covering the crimean war yet early in october 1854 , sevastopol was not the towering fortress it later became , and totleben himself maintained that had the allies assaulted it immediately , they would have succeeded in taking the city the russian artillery was initially successful , the french corps fell under siege and suffered heavy losses still , british siege batteries managed to silence the malakoff and its annexes , after having succeeded in hitting a munitions depot and , if failure had not occurred at the other points of attack , an assault might have succeeded the fighting was of the most desperate kind : the french attack on the malakoff was successful , but the other two french attacks were repelled the battle of the great redan was initially successful , but a russian counterattack drove the british out of the bastion after two hours after the french attacks on the flagstaff bastion ( left of the great redan ) were repelled the fall of the malakoff was the end of the siege of the city after the success of the french troops under the command of marshal pelissier , later the duke of malakoff ( french : duc de malakoff ) , and general patrice de mac-mahon , the russian defenders evacuated the entire city on 8 september 1855 , bringing a climax to the war a malakoff was also named after this battle , as well as the avenue de malakoff

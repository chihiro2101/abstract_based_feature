277 ; semsār , 1963 , p & nbsp ; 15 ) , thus dating its use at least as early as the time of the shah tahmasp i it seems , therefore , that abu ’ l-fath gilani should be credited with the introduction of the ḡalyān , already in use in persia , into india moreover , tobacco is believed to have arrived in india in the 17th century , until then cannabis was smoked in india , so that suggests another substance was probably smoked in ahlī shirazi 's quatrain , perhaps through some other method he later became a physician in the mughal court and raised health concerns after smoking tobacco became popular among indian noblemen instead of copper , brass , and low quality alloys , manufacturers increasingly use stainless steel and aluminium silicone rubber compounds are used for hookah hoses instead of leather and wire new materials make modern hookahs more durable , eliminate odors while smoking and allow washing without risks of corrosion or bacterial decay new technologies and modern design trends are changing the appearance of hookahs the concept of hookah is thought to have originated in medieval india the hookah has since become less popular ;

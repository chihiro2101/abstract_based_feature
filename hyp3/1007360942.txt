according to the talmud , makkoth 23b is to be interpreted to mean that moses transmitted the torah from god to the israelites : '' moses commanded us the torah as an inheritance for the community of jacob '' the talmud notes that the hebrew numerical value ( gematria ) of the word torah is 611 , and combining moses 's 611 commandments with the first two of the ten commandments which were the only ones heard directly from god , adds up to 613 makkoth 24a the talmud attributes the number 613 to rabbi simlai , but other classical sages who hold this view include rabbi simeon ben azzai sifre , deuteronomy 76 and rabbi eliezer ben jose by baal haturim , the maharal of prague and leaders of hasidic judaism ) find allusions and inspirational calculations relating to the number of commandments the tzitzit ( '' knotted fringes '' ) of the tallit ( '' prayer shawl '' ) are connected to the 613 commandments by interpretation : principal torah commentator rashi bases the number of knots on a gematria : the word tzitzit ( hebrew : ציצת ( biblical ) , ציצית , in its mishnah spelling ) has the value 600 but in truth there is no end to the number of mitzvot nahmanides , commentary to maimonides ' sefer hamitzvot , root principle 1 rabbi simeon ben zemah duran likewise rejected the dogma of the 613 as being the sum of the law , saying that '' perhaps the agreement that the number of mitzvot is 613 the vilna gaon suggested that there exist many more than 613 commandments ( because otherwise large narrative parts of the pentateuch would be without commandments , which he considered difficult to accept ) and that the count of 613 refers to '' roots '' ( shorashim ) of the other commandments in rabbinic literature , rishonim and later scholars composed to articulate and justify their enumeration of the commandments : halachot gedolot ( '' great laws '' ) , thought to be written by rabbi simeon kayyara ( the bahag ) is the earliest extant enumeration of the 613 mitzvot ) sefer hamitzvot ( '' book of commandments '' ) by maimonides , with a commentary by nachmanides though the original work included only those commandments relevant in all places and at all times , later editions include agricultural laws relevant today only in the land of israel as the number of temple-only commandments appears to be much lower than 293 ( for example , sefer hahinuch only counted 201 such commandments ) , it seems that the overall count of commandments would likely be lower than 613 steve wells , in the every jot and tittle section of the skeptic 's annotated bible , lists 786 commandments in the king james version of the old testament

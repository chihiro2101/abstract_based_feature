according to the talmud , makkoth 23b is to be interpreted to mean that moses transmitted the torah from god to the israelites : '' moses commanded us the torah as an inheritance for the community of jacob '' the talmud notes that the hebrew numerical value ( gematria ) of the word torah is 611 , and combining moses 's 611 commandments with the first two of the ten commandments which were the only ones heard directly from god , adds up to 613 makkoth 24a the talmud attributes the number 613 to rabbi simlai , but other classical sages who hold this view include rabbi simeon ben azzai sifre , deuteronomy 76 and rabbi eliezer ben jose by baal haturim , the maharal of prague and leaders of hasidic judaism ) find allusions and inspirational calculations relating to the number of commandments the tzitzit ( '' knotted fringes '' ) of the tallit ( '' prayer shawl '' ) are connected to the 613 commandments by interpretation : principal torah commentator rashi bases the number of knots on a gematria : the word tzitzit ( hebrew : ציצת ( biblical ) , ציצית , in its mishnah spelling ) has the value 600 a number of classical authorities denied that it was normative : rabbi abraham ibn ezra denied that this was an authentic rabbinic tradition nahmanides , commentary to maimonides ' sefer hamitzvot , root principle 1 rabbi simeon ben zemah duran likewise rejected the dogma of the 613 as being the sum of the law , saying that '' perhaps the agreement that the number of mitzvot is 613 is just rabbi simlai 's opinion , following his own explication of the mitzvot & nbsp ; 99 gersonides held that the number 613 was only one rabbi 's ( rabbi simlai 's ) opinion , and if the conclusion of a talmudic discussion indicated that the number of commandments was greater or lesser than 613 , rabbi simlai 's opinion would be overruled ) in addition to enumerating the commandments and giving a brief overview of relevant laws , the sefer ha-chinuch also tries to explain the philosophical reasons behind the mitzvot the chafetz chaim 's work follows the reckoning of maimonides but gives only the commandments relevant today sefer yereim by eliezer ben samuel lists only 417 commandments ( including commandments only applicable when the temple stood ) as the number of temple-only commandments appears to be much lower than 293 ( for example , sefer hahinuch only counted 201 such commandments ) , it seems that the overall count of commandments would likely be lower than 613

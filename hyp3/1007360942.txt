the talmud notes that the hebrew numerical value ( gematria ) of the word torah is 611 , and combining moses 's 611 commandments with the first two of the ten commandments which were the only ones heard directly from god , adds up to 613 makkoth 24a the talmud attributes the number 613 to rabbi simlai , but other classical sages who hold this view include rabbi simeon ben azzai sifre , deuteronomy 76 and rabbi eliezer ben jose midrash aggadah to genesis 15:1 it is quoted in midrash shemot rabbah 33:7 , bamidbar rabbah 13:15â€“16 ; 18:21 and talmud yevamot 47b by baal haturim , the maharal of prague and leaders of hasidic judaism ) find allusions and inspirational calculations relating to the number of commandments this reflects the concept that donning a garment with tzitzit reminds its wearer of all torah commandments for example , ben azzai held that there exist 300 positive mitzvot some rabbis declared that this count was not an authentic tradition , or that it was not logically possible to come up with a systematic count a number of classical authorities denied that it was normative : rabbi abraham ibn ezra denied that this was an authentic rabbinic tradition ibn ezra writes '' some sages enumerate 613 mitzvot in many diverse ways the vilna gaon suggested that there exist many more than 613 commandments ( because otherwise large narrative parts of the pentateuch would be without commandments , which he considered difficult to accept ) and that the count of 613 refers to '' roots '' ( shorashim ) of the other commandments lists differ , for example , in how they interpret passages in the torah that may be read as dealing with several cases under a single law or several separate laws other '' commandments '' in the torah are restricted as one-time acts , and would not be considered as '' mitzvot '' binding on other persons as the number of temple-only commandments appears to be much lower than 293 ( for example , sefer hahinuch only counted 201 such commandments ) , it seems that the overall count of commandments would likely be lower than 613

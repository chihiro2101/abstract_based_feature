paul was born at samosata into a family of humble origin edward gibbon describes him as follows : the wealth of that prelate was a sufficient evidence of his guilt , since it was neither derived from the inheritance of his fathers , nor acquired by the arts of honest industry his ecclesiastical jurisdiction was venal and rapacious ; he extorted frequent contributions from the most opulent of the faithful , and converted to his own use a considerable part of the public revenue when he harangued his people from the pulpit , paul affected the figurative style and the theatrical gestures of an asiatic sophist , while the cathedral resounded with the loudest and most extravagant acclamations in the praise of his divine eloquence for paul indulged himself very freely in the pleasures of the table , and he had received into the episcopal palace two young and beautiful women , as the constant companions of his leisure moments several councils were held , confutations were published , ex-communications were pronounced , ambiguous explanations were by turns accepted and refused , treaties were concluded and violated this letter is the only indisputably contemporary document concerning him and was preserved in eusebius of caesarea 's ecclesiastical history eusebius , ecclesiastical history , book 7 , chapter 30 however , because the synod had acted without consulting the clergy or the people , its authority was in question , enabling paul to claim continued possession of his bishopric paul 's pupil lucian of antioch is considered to have had a major influence on arius the founder of arianism another major source of information we have of paul of samosata comes from eusebius of caesarea , who described some of the doctrines and practices paul displayed openly , which included : receiving money for his religious services , eusebius of caesarea , ecclesiastical history , book vii eusebius of caesarea , ecclesiastical history , book vii likewise , eusebius hints to the fact that paul was '' too familiar '' with his women followers , eusebius of caesarea , ecclesiastical history , book vii

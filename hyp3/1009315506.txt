in addition to the classes mentioned above , connectors are characterised by their pinout , method of connection , materials , size , contact resistance , insulation , mechanical durability , ip code , lifetime ( number of cycles ) , and ease of use properties important to conductor materials are contact resistance , conductivity , mechanical strength , formability , and resilience insulators must have a high electrical resistance , withstand high temperatures , and be easy to manufacture for a precise fit electrodes in connectors are usually made of copper alloys , due to their good conductivity and malleability whilst technically inaccurate , electrical connectors can be viewed as a type of adapter to convert between two connection methods , which are permanently connected at one end and ( usually ) detachable at the other end the solder tabs on a male phone connector , and the male phone connector itself in this example , the solder tabs connected to the cable represent the permanent connection , whilst the male connector portion interfaces with a female socket forming a detachable connection other methods , while requiring a special tool , can assemble connectors much faster and more reliably , and make repairs easier plug and socket connectors are usually made up of a male plug ( typically pin contacts ) and a female socket ( typically receptacle contacts ) the connection between the mating metal parts must be sufficiently tight to make a good electrical connection and complete the circuit in other applications the two ends are terminated differently , either with male and female of the same connector ( as in an extension cord ) , or with incompatible connectors , which is sometimes called an adapter cable plugs and sockets are widely used in various connector systems including blade connectors , breadboards , xlr connectors , car power outlets , banana connectors , and phone connectors a jack is a connector that installs on the surface of a bulkhead or enclosure , and mates with its reciprocal , the plug according to the asme , the stationary ( more fixed ) connector of a pair is classified as a jack ( denoted j ) , usually attached to a piece of equipment as in a chassis-mount or panel-mount connector crimping is used in splice connectors , crimped multipin plugs and sockets , and crimped coaxial connectors crimping usually requires a specialised crimping tool , but the connectors are quick and easy to install and are a common alternative to solder connections or insulation displacement connectors many plug and socket connectors are attached to a wire or cable by soldering conductors to electrodes on the back of the connector another type , often called barrier strips , accepts wires that have ring or spade terminal lugs crimped onto the wires common types of blade connectors are the faston connectors and lucar connectors card-edge connectors or fpga mezzanine card twist-on wire connectors ( e.g

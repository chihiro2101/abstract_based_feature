in addition to the classes mentioned above , connectors are characterised by their pinout , method of connection , materials , size , contact resistance , insulation , mechanical durability , ip code , lifetime ( number of cycles ) , and ease of use electrical connectors essentially consist of two classes of materials : conductors and insulators electrodes in connectors are usually made of copper alloys , due to their good conductivity and malleability the solder tabs on a male phone connector , and the male phone connector itself in this example , the solder tabs connected to the cable represent the permanent connection , whilst the male connector portion interfaces with a female socket forming a detachable connection other methods , while requiring a special tool , can assemble connectors much faster and more reliably , and make repairs easier often , but not always , sockets are permanently fixed to a device as in a chassis connector , and plugs are attached to a cable the connection between the mating metal parts must be sufficiently tight to make a good electrical connection and complete the circuit an alternative type of plug and socket connection uses hyperboloid contacts , which makes a more reliable electrical connection when working with multi-pin connectors , it is helpful to have a pinout diagram to identify the wire or circuit node connected to each pin in other applications the two ends are terminated differently , either with male and female of the same connector ( as in an extension cord ) , or with incompatible connectors , which is sometimes called an adapter cable plugs and sockets are widely used in various connector systems including blade connectors , breadboards , xlr connectors , car power outlets , banana connectors , and phone connectors the movable ( less fixed ) connector is classified as a plug ( denoted p ) , designed to attach to a wire , cable or removable electrical assembly the connectors and wire ends can not be reused ) this relates to the side of the connector where the pins are anchored : front release contacts are released from the front ( contact side ) of the connector , and removed from the rear many plug and socket connectors are attached to a wire or cable by soldering conductors to electrodes on the back of the connector when wires are to be soldered to the back of a connector , a backshell is often used to protect the connection and add strain relief since stripping insulation from wires is time-consuming , many connectors intended for rapid assembly use insulation-displacement connectors which cut the insulation as the wire is inserted electrical contact is made by the flat surface of the ring or spade , while mechanically they are attached by passing a screw or bolt through them common types of blade connectors are the faston connectors and lucar connectors

in addition to the classes mentioned above , connectors are characterised by their pinout , method of connection , materials , size , contact resistance , insulation , mechanical durability , ip code , lifetime ( number of cycles ) , and ease of use in some cases an equipment manufacturer might choose a connector specifically because it is not compatible with those from other sources , allowing control of what may be connected electrical connectors essentially consist of two classes of materials : conductors and insulators insulators must have a high electrical resistance , withstand high temperatures , and be easy to manufacture for a precise fit electrodes in connectors are usually made of copper alloys , due to their good conductivity and malleability whilst technically inaccurate , electrical connectors can be viewed as a type of adapter to convert between two connection methods , which are permanently connected at one end and ( usually ) detachable at the other end in this example , the solder tabs connected to the cable represent the permanent connection , whilst the male connector portion interfaces with a female socket forming a detachable connection often , but not always , sockets are permanently fixed to a device as in a chassis connector , and plugs are attached to a cable an alternative type of plug and socket connection uses hyperboloid contacts , which makes a more reliable electrical connection some connector styles may combine pin and socket connection types in a single unit , referred to as a hermaphroditic connector in other applications the two ends are terminated differently , either with male and female of the same connector ( as in an extension cord ) , or with incompatible connectors , which is sometimes called an adapter cable plugs and sockets are widely used in various connector systems including blade connectors , breadboards , xlr connectors , car power outlets , banana connectors , and phone connectors according to the asme , the stationary ( more fixed ) connector of a pair is classified as a jack ( denoted j ) , usually attached to a piece of equipment as in a chassis-mount or panel-mount connector the movable ( less fixed ) connector is classified as a plug ( denoted p ) , designed to attach to a wire , cable or removable electrical assembly crimped connectors are a type of solderless connection , using mechanical friction and uniform deformation to secure a connector to a pre-stripped wire ( usually stranded ) crimping usually requires a specialised crimping tool , but the connectors are quick and easy to install and are a common alternative to solder connections or insulation displacement connectors many plug and socket connectors are attached to a wire or cable by soldering conductors to electrodes on the back of the connector since stripping insulation from wires is time-consuming , many connectors intended for rapid assembly use insulation-displacement connectors which cut the insulation as the wire is inserted common types of blade connectors are the faston connectors and lucar connectors card-edge connectors or fpga mezzanine card twist-on wire connectors ( e.g

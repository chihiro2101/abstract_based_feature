in addition to the classes mentioned above , connectors are characterised by their pinout , method of connection , materials , size , contact resistance , insulation , mechanical durability , ip code , lifetime ( number of cycles ) , and ease of use no single connector has all the ideal properties for every application ; the proliferation of types is a result of the diverse yet specific requirements of manufacturers electrodes in connectors are usually made of copper alloys , due to their good conductivity and malleability contact carriers that hold the parts of a connector together are usually made of plastic , due to its insulating properties whilst technically inaccurate , electrical connectors can be viewed as a type of adapter to convert between two connection methods , which are permanently connected at one end and ( usually ) detachable at the other end in this example , the solder tabs connected to the cable represent the permanent connection , whilst the male connector portion interfaces with a female socket forming a detachable connection plug and socket connectors plug and socket connectors are usually made up of a male plug ( typically pin contacts ) and a female socket ( typically receptacle contacts ) an alternative type of plug and socket connection uses hyperboloid contacts , which makes a more reliable electrical connection when working with multi-pin connectors , it is helpful to have a pinout diagram to identify the wire or circuit node connected to each pin some connector styles may combine pin and socket connection types in a single unit , referred to as a hermaphroditic connector in other applications the two ends are terminated differently , either with male and female of the same connector ( as in an extension cord ) , or with incompatible connectors , which is sometimes called an adapter cable according to the asme , the stationary ( more fixed ) connector of a pair is classified as a jack ( denoted j ) , usually attached to a piece of equipment as in a chassis-mount or panel-mount connector the movable ( less fixed ) connector is classified as a plug ( denoted p ) , designed to attach to a wire , cable or removable electrical assembly crimped connectors are a type of solderless connection , using mechanical friction and uniform deformation to secure a connector to a pre-stripped wire ( usually stranded ) crimping is used in splice connectors , crimped multipin plugs and sockets , and crimped coaxial connectors this relates to the side of the connector where the pins are anchored : front release contacts are released from the front ( contact side ) of the connector , and removed from the rear many plug and socket connectors are attached to a wire or cable by soldering conductors to electrodes on the back of the connector when wires are to be soldered to the back of a connector , a backshell is often used to protect the connection and add strain relief common types of blade connectors are the faston connectors and lucar connectors

in addition to the classes mentioned above , connectors are characterised by their pinout , method of connection , materials , size , contact resistance , insulation , mechanical durability , ip code , lifetime ( number of cycles ) , and ease of use in some cases an equipment manufacturer might choose a connector specifically because it is not compatible with those from other sources , allowing control of what may be connected electrical connectors essentially consist of two classes of materials : conductors and insulators insulators must have a high electrical resistance , withstand high temperatures , and be easy to manufacture for a precise fit electrodes in connectors are usually made of copper alloys , due to their good conductivity and malleability the base electrode metal is often coated with another inert metal such as gold , nickel , or tin whilst technically inaccurate , electrical connectors can be viewed as a type of adapter to convert between two connection methods , which are permanently connected at one end and ( usually ) detachable at the other end in this example , the solder tabs connected to the cable represent the permanent connection , whilst the male connector portion interfaces with a female socket forming a detachable connection there are many ways of applying a connector to a cable or device plug and socket connectors plug and socket connectors are usually made up of a male plug ( typically pin contacts ) and a female socket ( typically receptacle contacts ) often , but not always , sockets are permanently fixed to a device as in a chassis connector , and plugs are attached to a cable the connection between the mating metal parts must be sufficiently tight to make a good electrical connection and complete the circuit in other applications the two ends are terminated differently , either with male and female of the same connector ( as in an extension cord ) , or with incompatible connectors , which is sometimes called an adapter cable plugs and sockets are widely used in various connector systems including blade connectors , breadboards , xlr connectors , car power outlets , banana connectors , and phone connectors the movable ( less fixed ) connector is classified as a plug ( denoted p ) , designed to attach to a wire , cable or removable electrical assembly crimping is used in splice connectors , crimped multipin plugs and sockets , and crimped coaxial connectors they can be used to join multiple conductors , to connect wires to a printed circuit board , or to terminate a cable into a plug or socket common types of blade connectors are the faston connectors and lucar connectors card-edge connectors or fpga mezzanine card twist-on wire connectors ( e.g

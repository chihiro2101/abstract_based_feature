in addition to the classes mentioned above , connectors are characterised by their pinout , method of connection , materials , size , contact resistance , insulation , mechanical durability , ip code , lifetime ( number of cycles ) , and ease of use electrical connectors essentially consist of two classes of materials : conductors and insulators insulators must have a high electrical resistance , withstand high temperatures , and be easy to manufacture for a precise fit electrodes in connectors are usually made of copper alloys , due to their good conductivity and malleability whilst technically inaccurate , electrical connectors can be viewed as a type of adapter to convert between two connection methods , which are permanently connected at one end and ( usually ) detachable at the other end in this example , the solder tabs connected to the cable represent the permanent connection , whilst the male connector portion interfaces with a female socket forming a detachable connection other methods , while requiring a special tool , can assemble connectors much faster and more reliably , and make repairs easier plug and socket connectors plug and socket connectors are usually made up of a male plug ( typically pin contacts ) and a female socket ( typically receptacle contacts ) when working with multi-pin connectors , it is helpful to have a pinout diagram to identify the wire or circuit node connected to each pin in other applications the two ends are terminated differently , either with male and female of the same connector ( as in an extension cord ) , or with incompatible connectors , which is sometimes called an adapter cable plugs and sockets are widely used in various connector systems including blade connectors , breadboards , xlr connectors , car power outlets , banana connectors , and phone connectors the movable ( less fixed ) connector is classified as a plug ( denoted p ) , designed to attach to a wire , cable or removable electrical assembly crimped connectors are a type of solderless connection , using mechanical friction and uniform deformation to secure a connector to a pre-stripped wire ( usually stranded ) crimping is used in splice connectors , crimped multipin plugs and sockets , and crimped coaxial connectors since stripping insulation from wires is time-consuming , many connectors intended for rapid assembly use insulation-displacement connectors which cut the insulation as the wire is inserted they can be used to join multiple conductors , to connect wires to a printed circuit board , or to terminate a cable into a plug or socket in some cases the blade is an integral manufactured part of a component ( such as a switch or a speaker unit ) , and the reciprocal connector is pushed onto the device 's connector common types of blade connectors are the faston connectors and lucar connectors adapter bent pin analysis cable gland electrical contacts electrical network electrical splice electrical termination gender of connectors and fasteners lightbulb socket pothead for a termination on a high voltage electric power cable tee connector tube socket wire nut

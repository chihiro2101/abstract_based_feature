if the small signal gain is greater than 1 for some frequency then the system will start to oscillate at that frequency because noise at that frequency will be amplified the sound level will increase until the output starts clipping , reducing the loop gain to exactly unity this is the principle upon which electronic oscillators are based ; although in that case the feedback loop is purely electronic , the principle is the same if the gain is large , but slightly less than 1 , then high-pitched slowly decaying feedback tones will be created , but only when at least some input sound is already being sent through the system , such as through a microphone boner reasoned that when feedback happened , it did so at one precise frequency behavior of sound system response immediately below feedback , cp boner , j soc , 1966 he worked with gifford white , founder of white instruments to hand craft notch filters for specific feedback frequencies in specific rooms to maximize gain before feedback , the amount of sound energy that is fed back to the microphones must be reduced as much as is practical as well , microphones should not be positioned in front of speakers and individuals using mics should be asked to avoid pointing the microphone at speaker enclosures the sound engineer can increase the level of a microphone or guitar pickup until feedback occurs the engineer can then attenuate the relevant frequency on an equalizer preventing feedback at that frequency but allowing sufficient volume at other frequencies to avoid feedback , automatic anti-feedback devices can be used ( in the marketplace these go by the name '' feedback destroyer '' or '' feedback eliminator '' ) some of these work by shifting the frequency slightly , with this upshift resulting in a '' chirp '' -sound instead of a howling sound of unaddressed feedback to intentionally create feedback , an electric guitar player needs a guitar amplifier and a loudspeaker cabinet , with very high gain ( amplification ) and/or the guitar brought near the speaker the entire guitar solo was created using amplifier feedback the principle of feedback is used in many guitar sustain devices circuit bending comb filter distortion ( music ) echo cancellation feedback suppressor optical feedback

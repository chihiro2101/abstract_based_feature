if the small signal gain is greater than 1 for some frequency then the system will start to oscillate at that frequency because noise at that frequency will be amplified if the gain is large , but slightly less than 1 , then high-pitched slowly decaying feedback tones will be created , but only when at least some input sound is already being sent through the system , such as through a microphone early academic work on acoustical feedback was done by dr he also reasoned that it could be stopped by inserting a very narrow notch filter at that frequency in the loudspeaker 's signal chain behavior of sound system response immediately below feedback , cp boner , j boner was responsible for establishing basic theories of acoustic feedback , room-ring modes , and room-sound system equalizing techniques to maximize gain before feedback , the amount of sound energy that is fed back to the microphones must be reduced as much as is practical as well , microphones should not be positioned in front of speakers and individuals using mics should be asked to avoid pointing the microphone at speaker enclosures the sound engineer can increase the level of a microphone or guitar pickup until feedback occurs the engineer can then attenuate the relevant frequency on an equalizer preventing feedback at that frequency but allowing sufficient volume at other frequencies many professional sound engineers can identify feedback frequencies by ear but others use a real time analyzer to identify the ringing frequency to avoid feedback , automatic anti-feedback devices can be used ) some of these work by shifting the frequency slightly , with this upshift resulting in a '' chirp '' -sound instead of a howling sound of unaddressed feedback to intentionally create feedback , an electric guitar player needs a guitar amplifier and a loudspeaker cabinet , with very high gain ( amplification ) and/or the guitar brought near the speaker the entire guitar solo was created using amplifier feedback pitched melodies may be created entirely from feedback through changing the angle between a guitar and amplifier after establishing a feedback loop the principle of feedback is used in many guitar sustain devices the boss df-2 super feedbacker and distortion pedal is an electronic effect unit that helps electric guitarists to create feedback effects

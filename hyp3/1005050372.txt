if the small signal gain is greater than 1 for some frequency then the system will start to oscillate at that frequency because noise at that frequency will be amplified if the gain is large , but slightly less than 1 , then high-pitched slowly decaying feedback tones will be created , but only when at least some input sound is already being sent through the system , such as through a microphone boner reasoned that when feedback happened , it did so at one precise frequency behavior of sound system response immediately below feedback , cp boner , j to maximize gain before feedback , the amount of sound energy that is fed back to the microphones must be reduced as much as is practical as well , microphones should not be positioned in front of speakers and individuals using mics should be asked to avoid pointing the microphone at speaker enclosures almost always , the natural frequency responses of sound reinforcement systems is not ideally flat feedback can be reduced manually by '' ringing out '' a sound system prior to a performance the sound engineer can increase the level of a microphone or guitar pickup until feedback occurs many professional sound engineers can identify feedback frequencies by ear but others use a real time analyzer to identify the ringing frequency to avoid feedback , automatic anti-feedback devices can be used ) some of these work by shifting the frequency slightly , with this upshift resulting in a '' chirp '' -sound instead of a howling sound of unaddressed feedback to intentionally create feedback , an electric guitar player needs a guitar amplifier and a loudspeaker cabinet , with very high gain ( amplification ) and/or the guitar brought near the speaker jay hodgson agrees that it was the first chart-topper to showcase feedback distortion , created by john lennon leaning a semi-acoustic guitar against an amplifier lou reed created his album metal machine music ( 1975 ) entirely from loops of feedback played at various speeds pitched melodies may be created entirely from feedback through changing the angle between a guitar and amplifier after establishing a feedback loop the principle of feedback is used in many guitar sustain devices circuit bending comb filter distortion ( music ) echo cancellation feedback suppressor optical feedback

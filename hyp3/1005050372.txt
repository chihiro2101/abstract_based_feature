if the small signal gain is greater than 1 for some frequency then the system will start to oscillate at that frequency because noise at that frequency will be amplified the sound level will increase until the output starts clipping , reducing the loop gain to exactly unity if the gain is large , but slightly less than 1 , then high-pitched slowly decaying feedback tones will be created , but only when at least some input sound is already being sent through the system , such as through a microphone boner reasoned that when feedback happened , it did so at one precise frequency he also reasoned that it could be stopped by inserting a very narrow notch filter at that frequency in the loudspeaker 's signal chain behavior of sound system response immediately below feedback , cp boner , j to maximize gain before feedback , the amount of sound energy that is fed back to the microphones must be reduced as much as is practical as well , microphones should not be positioned in front of speakers and individuals using mics should be asked to avoid pointing the microphone at speaker enclosures almost always , the natural frequency responses of sound reinforcement systems is not ideally flat the sound engineer can increase the level of a microphone or guitar pickup until feedback occurs many professional sound engineers can identify feedback frequencies by ear but others use a real time analyzer to identify the ringing frequency to avoid feedback , automatic anti-feedback devices can be used ) some of these work by shifting the frequency slightly , with this upshift resulting in a '' chirp '' -sound instead of a howling sound of unaddressed feedback the entire guitar solo was created using amplifier feedback 91 both use feedback in their works pitched melodies may be created entirely from feedback through changing the angle between a guitar and amplifier after establishing a feedback loop audio feedback became a signature feature of many underground rock bands during the 1980s circuit bending comb filter distortion ( music ) echo cancellation feedback suppressor optical feedback

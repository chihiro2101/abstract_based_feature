if the small signal gain is greater than 1 for some frequency then the system will start to oscillate at that frequency because noise at that frequency will be amplified sound will be produced without anyone actually playing if the gain is large , but slightly less than 1 , then high-pitched slowly decaying feedback tones will be created , but only when at least some input sound is already being sent through the system , such as through a microphone boner reasoned that when feedback happened , it did so at one precise frequency he also reasoned that it could be stopped by inserting a very narrow notch filter at that frequency in the loudspeaker 's signal chain behavior of sound system response immediately below feedback , cp boner , j boner was responsible for establishing basic theories of acoustic feedback , room-ring modes , and room-sound system equalizing techniques to maximize gain before feedback , the amount of sound energy that is fed back to the microphones must be reduced as much as is practical as well , microphones should not be positioned in front of speakers and individuals using mics should be asked to avoid pointing the microphone at speaker enclosures this allows independent control of the sound pressure levels for the audience and the performers if monitors are oriented at 180 degrees to the microphones that are their sources , the microphones should have a cardioid pickup pattern almost always , the natural frequency responses of sound reinforcement systems is not ideally flat the sound engineer can increase the level of a microphone or guitar pickup until feedback occurs the guitarist then allows the open strings to vibrate freely and brings the guitar close to the speaker enclosure of the guitar amp the entire guitar solo was created using amplifier feedback pitched melodies may be created entirely from feedback through changing the angle between a guitar and amplifier after establishing a feedback loop intended closed-circuit feedback can also be created by an effects unit , such as a delay pedal or effect fed back into a mixing console the boss df-2 super feedbacker and distortion pedal is an electronic effect unit that helps electric guitarists to create feedback effects

if the small signal gain is greater than 1 for some frequency then the system will start to oscillate at that frequency because noise at that frequency will be amplified if the gain is large , but slightly less than 1 , then high-pitched slowly decaying feedback tones will be created , but only when at least some input sound is already being sent through the system , such as through a microphone boner reasoned that when feedback happened , it did so at one precise frequency he also reasoned that it could be stopped by inserting a very narrow notch filter at that frequency in the loudspeaker 's signal chain behavior of sound system response immediately below feedback , cp boner , j soc , 1966 he worked with gifford white , founder of white instruments to hand craft notch filters for specific feedback frequencies in specific rooms to maximize gain before feedback , the amount of sound energy that is fed back to the microphones must be reduced as much as is practical this leads to acoustical feedback at the frequency with the highest loop gain , which may be much higher than the average gain over all frequencies ( resonance ) the engineer can then attenuate the relevant frequency on an equalizer preventing feedback at that frequency but allowing sufficient volume at other frequencies many professional sound engineers can identify feedback frequencies by ear but others use a real time analyzer to identify the ringing frequency to avoid feedback , automatic anti-feedback devices can be used ) some of these work by shifting the frequency slightly , with this upshift resulting in a '' chirp '' -sound instead of a howling sound of unaddressed feedback to intentionally create feedback , an electric guitar player needs a guitar amplifier and a loudspeaker cabinet , with very high gain ( amplification ) and/or the guitar brought near the speaker the guitarist then allows the open strings to vibrate freely and brings the guitar close to the speaker enclosure of the guitar amp according to allmusic 's richie unterberger , the very first use of feedback on a commercial rock record is the introduction of the song '' i feel fine '' by the beatles , recorded in 1964 pitched melodies may be created entirely from feedback through changing the angle between a guitar and amplifier after establishing a feedback loop the principle of feedback is used in many guitar sustain devices circuit bending comb filter distortion ( music ) echo cancellation feedback suppressor optical feedback

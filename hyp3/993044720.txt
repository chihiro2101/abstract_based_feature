because it is so readily made by heating limestone , lime must have been known from the earliest times , and all the early civilizations used it in building mortars and as a stabilizer in mud renders and floors sir anthony fitzherbert , boke of husbandrye , 1523 the earliest descriptions of lime kilns differ little from those used for small-scale manufacture a century ago because land transportation of minerals like limestone and coal was difficult in the pre-industrial era , they were distributed by sea , and lime was most often manufactured at small coastal ports permanent lime kilns fall into two broad categories : '' flare kilns '' also known as '' intermittent '' or '' periodic '' kilns ; and '' draw kilns '' also known as '' perpetual '' or '' running '' kilns in a flare kiln , a bottom layer of coal was built up and the kiln above filled solely with chalk the fire was alight for several days , and then the entire kiln was emptied of the lime in a draw kiln , usually a stone structure , the chalk or limestone was layered with wood , coal or coke and lit the common feature of early kilns was an egg-cup shaped burning chamber , with an air inlet at the base ( the '' eye '' ) , constructed of brick successive dome-shaped layers of limestone and wood or coal were built up in the kiln on grate bars across the eye this also limited the size of kilns and explains why kilns were all much the same size so kilns always made 25â€“30 tonnes of lime in a batch the degree of burning was controlled by trial and error from batch to batch by varying the amount of fuel used typical fuel efficiency was low , with 0.5 tonnes or more of coal being used per tonne of finished lime ( 15 mj/kg ) a rarely used kiln was known as a '' lazy kiln '' the large kiln at crindledykes near haydon bridge , northumbria , was one of more than 300 in the county at the same time , new uses for lime in the chemical , steel and sugar industries led to large-scale plants image : lime kiln 1.jpg alt a preserved lime kiln in burgess park , london a preserved lime kiln in burgess park , london file : forrabury and minster - old lime kiln , boscastle - geograph.org.uk - 842707.jpg alt old lime kiln , boscastle , cornwall old lime kiln , boscastle , cornwall jpg lime kiln from 1906 at simplon , namibia this gathers pre-heated air from the cooling zone , which is then used to pressurize the middle annular zone of the kiln the rotary kiln is the most flexible of any lime kilns able to produce soft , medium , or hard burned as well as dead-burned lime or dolime the manufacture of one tonne of calcium oxide involves decomposing calcium carbonate , with the formation of 785 & nbsp ; kg of co 2 in some applications , such as when lime mortar ; this co 2 is later re-absorbed as the mortar goes off list of lime kilns list of lime kilns in the united states limepit

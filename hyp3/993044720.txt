because it is so readily made by heating limestone , lime must have been known from the earliest times , and all the early civilizations used it in building mortars and as a stabilizer in mud renders and floors 116–7 in the coalfields in the late 13th century , and an account of agricultural use was given in 1523 sir anthony fitzherbert , boke of husbandrye , 1523 the earliest descriptions of lime kilns differ little from those used for small-scale manufacture a century ago because land transportation of minerals like limestone and coal was difficult in the pre-industrial era , they were distributed by sea , and lime was most often manufactured at small coastal ports many preserved kilns are still to be seen on quaysides around the coasts of britain in a flare kiln , a bottom layer of coal was built up and the kiln above filled solely with chalk the fire was alight for several days , and then the entire kiln was emptied of the lime in a draw kiln , usually a stone structure , the chalk or limestone was layered with wood , coal or coke and lit as it burnt through , lime was extracted from the bottom of the kiln , through the draw hole because there were large temperature differences between the center of the charge and the material close to the wall , a mixture of underburned ( i.e high loss on ignition ) , well-burned and dead-burned lime was normally produced typical fuel efficiency was low , with 0.5 tonnes or more of coal being used per tonne of finished lime ( 15 mj/kg ) kilmarnock water and craufurdland kilm glenf ramb soc a lime kiln erected at dudley , west midlands ( formerly worcestershire ) in 1842 survives as part of the black country living museum which opened in 1976 , although the kilns were last used during the 1920s image : limekilnfroghall.jpg alt 19th century limekilns at froghall 19th century limekilns at froghall image : lime kiln 1.jpg alt a preserved lime kiln in burgess park , london a preserved lime kiln in burgess park , london image : annery kiln , weare gifford 1.jpg alt the annery kiln in devon , england. the annery kiln in devon , england image : dumbarton castle and lime kiln.jpg alt dumbarton castle in 1800 and functioning lime kiln with smoke in the foreground. dumbarton castle in 1800 and functioning lime kiln with smoke in the foreground the town , now called walkerville , was set on an isolated part of the victorian coastline and exported the lime by ship due to temperature peak at the burners up to 1200 & nbsp ; °c in a shaft kiln conditions are ideal to produce medium and hard burned lime the rotary kiln is the most flexible of any lime kilns able to produce soft , medium , or hard burned as well as dead-burned lime or dolime the manufacture of one tonne of calcium oxide involves decomposing calcium carbonate , with the formation of 785 & nbsp ; kg of co 2 in some applications , such as when lime mortar ; this co 2 is later re-absorbed as the mortar goes off this additional input is the equivalent of around 20 & nbsp ; kg co 2 per ton if the electricity is coal-generated

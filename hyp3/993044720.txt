because it is so readily made by heating limestone , lime must have been known from the earliest times , and all the early civilizations used it in building mortars and as a stabilizer in mud renders and floors sir anthony fitzherbert , boke of husbandrye , 1523 the earliest descriptions of lime kilns differ little from those used for small-scale manufacture a century ago permanent lime kilns fall into two broad categories : '' flare kilns '' also known as '' intermittent '' or '' periodic '' kilns ; and '' draw kilns '' also known as '' perpetual '' or '' running '' kilns in a draw kiln , usually a stone structure , the chalk or limestone was layered with wood , coal or coke and lit as it burnt through , lime was extracted from the bottom of the kiln , through the draw hole successive dome-shaped layers of limestone and wood or coal were built up in the kiln on grate bars across the eye this also limited the size of kilns and explains why kilns were all much the same size so kilns always made 25–30 tonnes of lime in a batch typically the kiln took a day to load , three days to fire , two days to cool and a day to unload , so a one-week turnaround was normal high loss on ignition ) , well-burned and dead-burned lime was normally produced the development of the national rail network made the local small-scale kilns increasingly unprofitable , and they gradually died out through the 19th century a lime kiln erected at dudley , west midlands ( formerly worcestershire ) in 1842 survives as part of the black country living museum which opened in 1976 , although the kilns were last used during the 1920s image : dumbarton castle and lime kiln.jpg alt dumbarton castle in 1800 and functioning lime kiln with smoke in the foreground. dumbarton castle in 1800 and functioning lime kiln with smoke in the foreground in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the town of waratah in gippsland , victoria , australia produced a majority of the quicklime used in the city of melbourne as well as around other parts of gippsland the town , now called walkerville , was set on an isolated part of the victorian coastline and exported the lime by ship file : wool bay lime kiln.jpg alt limestone kiln ruin at wool bay , south australia antoing jpg04.jpg old lime kilns , antoing , belgium fornosdacal1.jpg lime kilns , oeiras , portugal kalkofen untermarchtal , baden-württemberg.jpg lime kiln untermarchtal , baden-württemberg old lime kiln of 1906 at simplon , namibia ( 2017 ) the theoretical heat ( the standard enthalpy ) of reaction required to make high-calcium lime is around 3.15 mj per kg of lime , so the batch kilns were only around 20 % efficient as with batch kilns , only large , graded stone can be used , in order to ensure uniform gas-flows through the charge first , when shaft a is the '' primary '' and b the '' secondary '' shaft , the combustion air is added from the top of shaft a , while fuel somewhat below via burner lances with exhaust gas temperatures as low as 120 & nbsp ; °c and lime temperature at kiln outlet in 80 & nbsp ; °c range the heat loss of the regenerative kiln is minimal , fuel consumption is as low as 3.6 mj/kg if the heat supplied to form the lime ( 3.75 mj/kg in an efficient kiln ) is obtained by burning fossil fuel it will release co 2 : in the case of coal fuel 295 & nbsp ; kg/t ; in the case of natural gas fuel 206 & nbsp ; kg/t list of lime kilns list of lime kilns in the united states limepit

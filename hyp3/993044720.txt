because it is so readily made by heating limestone , lime must have been known from the earliest times , and all the early civilizations used it in building mortars and as a stabilizer in mud renders and floors sir anthony fitzherbert , boke of husbandrye , 1523 the earliest descriptions of lime kilns differ little from those used for small-scale manufacture a century ago because land transportation of minerals like limestone and coal was difficult in the pre-industrial era , they were distributed by sea , and lime was most often manufactured at small coastal ports many preserved kilns are still to be seen on quaysides around the coasts of britain permanent lime kilns fall into two broad categories : '' flare kilns '' also known as '' intermittent '' or '' periodic '' kilns ; and '' draw kilns '' also known as '' perpetual '' or '' running '' kilns in a flare kiln , a bottom layer of coal was built up and the kiln above filled solely with chalk in a draw kiln , usually a stone structure , the chalk or limestone was layered with wood , coal or coke and lit as it burnt through , lime was extracted from the bottom of the kiln , through the draw hole the common feature of early kilns was an egg-cup shaped burning chamber , with an air inlet at the base ( the '' eye '' ) , constructed of brick successive dome-shaped layers of limestone and wood or coal were built up in the kiln on grate bars across the eye the degree of burning was controlled by trial and error from batch to batch by varying the amount of fuel used high loss on ignition ) , well-burned and dead-burned lime was normally produced typical fuel efficiency was low , with 0.5 tonnes or more of coal being used per tonne of finished lime ( 15 mj/kg ) at the same time , new uses for lime in the chemical , steel and sugar industries led to large-scale plants file : forrabury and minster - old lime kiln , boscastle - geograph.org.uk - 842707.jpg alt old lime kiln , boscastle , cornwall old lime kiln , boscastle , cornwall image : annery kiln , weare gifford 1.jpg alt the annery kiln in devon , england. the annery kiln in devon , england antoing jpg04.jpg old lime kilns , antoing , belgium fornosdacal1.jpg lime kilns , oeiras , portugal kalkofen untermarchtal , baden-württemberg.jpg lime kiln untermarchtal , baden-württemberg old lime kiln of 1906 at simplon , namibia ( 2017 ) jpg lime kiln from 1906 at simplon , namibia the key to development in efficiency was the invention of continuous kilns , avoiding the wasteful heat-up and cool-down cycles of the batch kilns the cycling produces a long burning zone of constant , relatively low temperature ( around 950 & nbsp ; °c ) that is ideal for the production of high quality soft burned reactive lime modern installations partially overcome this disadvantage by adding a preheater , which has the same good solids/gas contact as a shaft kiln , but fuel consumption is still somewhat higher , typically in range of 4.5 to 6 mj/kg the rotary kiln is the most flexible of any lime kilns able to produce soft , medium , or hard burned as well as dead-burned lime or dolime list of lime kilns list of lime kilns in the united states limepit

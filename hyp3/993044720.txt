116–7 in the coalfields in the late 13th century , and an account of agricultural use was given in 1523 sir anthony fitzherbert , boke of husbandrye , 1523 the earliest descriptions of lime kilns differ little from those used for small-scale manufacture a century ago permanent lime kilns fall into two broad categories : '' flare kilns '' also known as '' intermittent '' or '' periodic '' kilns ; and '' draw kilns '' also known as '' perpetual '' or '' running '' kilns in a flare kiln , a bottom layer of coal was built up and the kiln above filled solely with chalk the fire was alight for several days , and then the entire kiln was emptied of the lime in a draw kiln , usually a stone structure , the chalk or limestone was layered with wood , coal or coke and lit as it burnt through , lime was extracted from the bottom of the kiln , through the draw hole limestone was crushed ( often by hand ) to fairly uniform lumps – fine stone was rejected when loading was complete , the kiln was kindled at the bottom , and the fire gradually spread upwards through the charge this also limited the size of kilns and explains why kilns were all much the same size above a certain diameter , the half-burned charge would be likely to collapse under its own weight , extinguishing the fire so kilns always made 25–30 tonnes of lime in a batch the degree of burning was controlled by trial and error from batch to batch by varying the amount of fuel used typical fuel efficiency was low , with 0.5 tonnes or more of coal being used per tonne of finished lime ( 15 mj/kg ) the large kiln at crindledykes near haydon bridge , northumbria , was one of more than 300 in the county image : lime kiln 1.jpg alt a preserved lime kiln in burgess park , london a preserved lime kiln in burgess park , london the ruins of the lime kilns can still be seen today the theoretical heat ( the standard enthalpy ) of reaction required to make high-calcium lime is around 3.15 mj per kg of lime , so the batch kilns were only around 20 % efficient as with batch kilns , only large , graded stone can be used , in order to ensure uniform gas-flows through the charge due to temperature peak at the burners up to 1200 & nbsp ; °c in a shaft kiln conditions are ideal to produce medium and hard burned lime fuel consumption is in 4 to 4.5 mj/kg range and the lime is typically medium burned the rotary kiln is the most flexible of any lime kilns able to produce soft , medium , or hard burned as well as dead-burned lime or dolime list of lime kilns list of lime kilns in the united states limepit

the nave is the main body of the church where most of the worshippers stand , and the sanctuary is the area around the altar , east of the nave the iconostasis does not sit directly on the edge of the sanctuary , but is usually set a few feet back from the edge of the top step in the very center of the soleas is an extension ( or thrust ) , often rounded , called the ambon , on which the deacon will stand to give ektenia during the services the iconostasis typically has three openings or sets of doors : the royal doors or holy doors in the center , and the north and south doors to either side the beautiful gates are sometimes called the royal doors , but that name more properly belongs to the central doors connecting the narthex , or porch , to the nave so called because the emperor used to enter by these doors during official ceremonies at hagia sophia in constantinople the north and south doors are often called deacons ' doors because the deacons use them frequently icons of sainted deacons are often depicted on these doors ( particularly st alternatively , they may be called angels ' doors , and the archangels michael and gabriel are often depicted there the south door is typically the '' entrance '' door , and michael is depicted there because he is the '' defender '' ; the north door is the '' exit '' , and gabriel is depicted here because he is the '' messenger '' of god ( in the greek and antiochian liturgical tradition , the archangel michael is usually stationed on the north ( i.e '' entrance '' ) door , and that it is far more common in modern times to see the archangels than the deacons on these doors ) these doors may also be casually referred to as the '' side doors '' in many monastery churches and chapels ( though often not in the katholikon , the monastery 's main church ) one may find iconostases with only two doors : the holy doors and the north door a number of guidelines or rubrics govern which icons are on which parts of the iconostasis , although there is some room for variation when the iconostasis does not reach all the way to the ceiling , it is often surmounted by a central cross , centered directly above the beautiful gates in a convent , only the abbess and elder nuns are permitted to enter the sanctuary ( altar ) , and they may only enter through the side doors male members of the laity who are usually allowed to enter the sanctuary include those involved in the running of the particular church , i.e therefore , the personages on the icons upon the iconostasis guide us into heaven , and therefore the iconostasis connects not separates in saint andrew 's church of kiev , ukraine file : open doors on an iconostas in a church in chicago.jpg modern cossack baroque iconostasis with doors open to sanctuary at st stephen church in istanbul file : saint vladimir skete ( valaam monastery ) 09.jpg saint vladimir skete ( valaam monastery ) , church of st

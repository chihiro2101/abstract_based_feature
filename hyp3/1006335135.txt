the nave is the main body of the church where most of the worshippers stand , and the sanctuary is the area around the altar , east of the nave the iconostasis does not sit directly on the edge of the sanctuary , but is usually set a few feet back from the edge of the top step this forms a walkway in front of the iconostasis for the clergy , called a soleas in the very center of the soleas is an extension ( or thrust ) , often rounded , called the ambon , on which the deacon will stand to give ektenia during the services the iconostasis typically has three openings or sets of doors : the royal doors or holy doors in the center , and the north and south doors to either side so called because the emperor used to enter by these doors during official ceremonies at hagia sophia in constantinople alternatively , they may be called angels ' doors , and the archangels michael and gabriel are often depicted there ( in the greek and antiochian liturgical tradition , the archangel michael is usually stationed on the north ( i.e '' entrance '' ) door , and that it is far more common in modern times to see the archangels than the deacons on these doors ) these doors may also be casually referred to as the '' side doors '' in many monastery churches and chapels ( though often not in the katholikon , the monastery 's main church ) one may find iconostases with only two doors : the holy doors and the north door a number of guidelines or rubrics govern which icons are on which parts of the iconostasis , although there is some room for variation peter and paul , and then any other important church fathers that may be desired for inclusion as space allows in a convent , only the abbess and elder nuns are permitted to enter the sanctuary ( altar ) , and they may only enter through the side doors the iconostasis does not really '' separate '' the nave from the holy of holies ; rather , it brings them together therefore , the personages on the icons upon the iconostasis guide us into heaven , and therefore the iconostasis connects not separates archaeological evidence from the stoudios monastery in constantinople suggests that the iconostasis evolved from the early templon file : iconostas uspenskiy.jpg dormition cathedral , russia file : iconostasis in st in saint andrew 's church of kiev , ukraine file : open doors on an iconostas in a church in chicago.jpg modern cossack baroque iconostasis with doors open to sanctuary at st stephen church in istanbul file : saint vladimir skete ( valaam monastery ) 09.jpg saint vladimir skete ( valaam monastery ) , church of st church of the aposltes , athens 1000 ad the bulgarian orthodox iconostasis

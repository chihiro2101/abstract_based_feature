the nave is the main body of the church where most of the worshippers stand , and the sanctuary is the area around the altar , east of the nave the iconostasis , though often tall , rarely touches the ceiling in small , modern churches the iconostasis may be completely absent : in such cases it is replaced by a few small icons on analogia ( lecterns ) , forming a virtual divide the iconostasis typically has three openings or sets of doors : the royal doors or holy doors in the center , and the north and south doors to either side the beautiful gates are sometimes called the royal doors , but that name more properly belongs to the central doors connecting the narthex , or porch , to the nave the north and south doors are often called deacons ' doors because the deacons use them frequently icons of sainted deacons are often depicted on these doors ( particularly st ( in the greek and antiochian liturgical tradition , the archangel michael is usually stationed on the north ( i.e '' entrance '' ) door , and that it is far more common in modern times to see the archangels than the deacons on these doors ) these doors may also be casually referred to as the '' side doors '' in many monastery churches and chapels ( though often not in the katholikon , the monastery 's main church ) one may find iconostases with only two doors : the holy doors and the north door a number of guidelines or rubrics govern which icons are on which parts of the iconostasis , although there is some room for variation other icons on this tier beside those on the doors themselves usually include depictions of the patron saint or feast day to which the church is dedicated , st above this are two interchangeable tiers : the deisis and the twelve great feasts : in the center of the deisis is a large icon of christ enthroned there are rules regarding who may enter or leave the sanctuary ( altar ) , and by which door in a convent , only the abbess and elder nuns are permitted to enter the sanctuary ( altar ) , and they may only enter through the side doors the iconostasis is the link between heaven ( the holy of holies ) and the nave ( the holy place ) the orthodox armenian apostolic church and catholic armenian catholic church ; a comparison with the biblical kodesh hakodashim was intended in saint andrew 's church of kiev , ukraine file : open doors on an iconostas in a church in chicago.jpg modern cossack baroque iconostasis with doors open to sanctuary at st stephen church in istanbul file : saint vladimir skete ( valaam monastery ) 09.jpg saint vladimir skete ( valaam monastery ) , church of st church of the aposltes , athens 1000 ad the bulgarian orthodox iconostasis

the vlt consists of an arrangement of four large ( 8.2 metre diameter ) telescopes ( called unit telescopes or uts ) with optical elements that can combine them into an astronomical interferometer ( vlti ) , which is used to resolve small objects the interferometer also includes a set of four 1.8 meter diameter movable telescopes dedicated to interferometric observations four 1.8-metre auxiliary telescopes ( ats ) have been added to the vlti to make it available when the uts are being used for other projects the vlt 's 8.2-meter telescopes were originally designed to operate in three modes : as a set of four independent telescopes ( this is the primary mode of operation ) as a single large coherent interferometric instrument ( the vlt interferometer or vlti ) , for extra resolution in its interferometric operating mode , the light from the telescopes is reflected off mirrors and directed through tunnels to a central beam combining laboratory during this operation it achieved an angular resolution of Â±0.08 milli-arc-seconds ( 0.388 nano-radians ) in 2011 , an incoherent integration mode was introduced called amber '' blind mode '' , which is more similar to the observation mode used at earlier interferometer arrays such as coast , iota and chara at more challenging mid-infrared wavelengths , the vlti can reach magnitude 4.5 , significantly fainter than the infrared spatial interferometer when fringe tracking is introduced , the limiting magnitude of the vlti is expected to improve by a factor of almost 1000 , reaching a magnitude of about 14 for interferometric observations on the brightest objects , there is little benefit in using 8 meter telescopes rather than 1.8 meter telescopes in march 2011 , the pionier instrument for the first time simultaneously combined the light of the four unit telescopes , potentially making vlti the biggest optical telescope in the world

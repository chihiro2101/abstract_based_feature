the vlt consists of an arrangement of four large ( 8.2 metre diameter ) telescopes ( called unit telescopes or uts ) with optical elements that can combine them into an astronomical interferometer ( vlti ) , which is used to resolve small objects the interferometer also includes a set of four 1.8 meter diameter movable telescopes dedicated to interferometric observations four 1.8-metre auxiliary telescopes ( ats ) have been added to the vlti to make it available when the uts are being used for other projects the vlt 's 8.2-meter telescopes were originally designed to operate in three modes : as a set of four independent telescopes ( this is the primary mode of operation ) as a single large coherent interferometric instrument ( the vlt interferometer or vlti ) , for extra resolution in its interferometric operating mode , the light from the telescopes is reflected off mirrors and directed through tunnels to a central beam combining laboratory in the year 2001 , during commissioning , the vlti successfully measured the angular diameters of four red dwarfs including proxima centauri during this operation it achieved an angular resolution of Â±0.08 milli-arc-seconds ( 0.388 nano-radians ) at more challenging mid-infrared wavelengths , the vlti can reach magnitude 4.5 , significantly fainter than the infrared spatial interferometer for interferometric observations on the brightest objects , there is little benefit in using 8 meter telescopes rather than 1.8 meter telescopes the first successful attempt was in february 2012 , with four telescopes combined into a 130-meter diameter mirror eso vlt official site for the 8 m and 1.8 m telescopes

the vlt consists of an arrangement of four large ( 8.2 metre diameter ) telescopes ( called unit telescopes or uts ) with optical elements that can combine them into an astronomical interferometer ( vlti ) , which is used to resolve small objects the interferometer also includes a set of four 1.8 meter diameter movable telescopes dedicated to interferometric observations four 1.8-metre auxiliary telescopes ( ats ) have been added to the vlti to make it available when the uts are being used for other projects the vlt 's 8.2-meter telescopes were originally designed to operate in three modes : as a set of four independent telescopes ( this is the primary mode of operation ) as a single large coherent interferometric instrument ( the vlt interferometer or vlti ) , for extra resolution unlike many earlier optical and infrared interferometers , the astronomical multi-beam recombiner ( amber ) instrument on vlti was initially designed to perform coherent integration ( which requires signal-to-noise greater than one in each atmospheric coherence time ) in 2011 , an incoherent integration mode was introduced called amber '' blind mode '' , which is more similar to the observation mode used at earlier interferometer arrays such as coast , iota and chara the vlti has become worldwide the first general user optical/infrared interferometric facility offered with this kind of service to the astronomical community this includes most of the stars in the solar neighborhood and many extragalactic objects such as bright active galactic nuclei , but this sensitivity limit rules out interferometry observations of most solar-system objects the first two instruments at the vlti were vinci ( a test instrument used to set up the system , now decommissioned ) and midi , which only allow two telescopes to be used at any one time in march 2011 , the pionier instrument for the first time simultaneously combined the light of the four unit telescopes , potentially making vlti the biggest optical telescope in the world in march 2019 , eso astronomers , employing the instruments on their very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) , announced the first direct detection of an exoplanet , hr 8799 e , using interferometry

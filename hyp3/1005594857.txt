the vlt consists of an arrangement of four large ( 8.2 metre diameter ) telescopes ( called unit telescopes or uts ) with optical elements that can combine them into an astronomical interferometer ( vlti ) , which is used to resolve small objects the interferometer also includes a set of four 1.8 meter diameter movable telescopes dedicated to interferometric observations the other telescopes became operational in 1999 and 2000 , enabling multi-telescope vlt capability the vlt 's 8.2-meter telescopes were originally designed to operate in three modes : as a set of four independent telescopes ( this is the primary mode of operation ) as a single large coherent interferometric instrument ( the vlt interferometer or vlti ) , for extra resolution multiple telescopes are sometimes independently pointed at the same object , either to increase the total light-gathering power or to provide simultaneous observations with complementary instruments in its interferometric operating mode , the light from the telescopes is reflected off mirrors and directed through tunnels to a central beam combining laboratory in 2011 , an incoherent integration mode was introduced called amber '' blind mode '' , which is more similar to the observation mode used at earlier interferometer arrays such as coast , iota and chara because the unit telescopes are used most of the time independently , they are used in the interferometric mode mostly during bright time ( that is , close to full moon ) for interferometric observations on the brightest objects , there is little benefit in using 8 meter telescopes rather than 1.8 meter telescopes in march 2011 , the pionier instrument for the first time simultaneously combined the light of the four unit telescopes , potentially making vlti the biggest optical telescope in the world in march 2019 , eso astronomers , employing the instruments on their very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) , announced the first direct detection of an exoplanet , hr 8799 e , using interferometry

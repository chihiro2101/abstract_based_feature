the vlt consists of an arrangement of four large ( 8.2 metre diameter ) telescopes ( called unit telescopes or uts ) with optical elements that can combine them into an astronomical interferometer ( vlti ) , which is used to resolve small objects the interferometer also includes a set of four 1.8 meter diameter movable telescopes dedicated to interferometric observations the other telescopes became operational in 1999 and 2000 , enabling multi-telescope vlt capability four 1.8-metre auxiliary telescopes ( ats ) have been added to the vlti to make it available when the uts are being used for other projects the vlt 's 8.2-meter telescopes were originally designed to operate in three modes : as a set of four independent telescopes ( this is the primary mode of operation ) as a single large coherent interferometric instrument ( the vlt interferometer or vlti ) , for extra resolution this mode is used for observations of relatively bright sources with small angular extent using the big telescopes and coherent integration , the faintest object the vlti can observe is magnitude 7 in the near infrared for broadband observations , similar to many other near infrared / optical interferometers without fringe tracking for interferometric observations on the brightest objects , there is little benefit in using 8 meter telescopes rather than 1.8 meter telescopes the first two instruments at the vlti were vinci ( a test instrument used to set up the system , now decommissioned ) and midi , which only allow two telescopes to be used at any one time in march 2011 , the pionier instrument for the first time simultaneously combined the light of the four unit telescopes , potentially making vlti the biggest optical telescope in the world the first successful attempt was in february 2012 , with four telescopes combined into a 130-meter diameter mirror

evidence from ancient egypt shows that the early egyptians knew how to assemble planks of wood into a ship hull as early as 3100 & nbsp ; bc egyptian pottery as old as 4000 bc shows designs of early boats or other means for navigation that some of the oldest ships yet unearthed are known as the abydos boats woven straps were found to have been used to lash the planks together , and reeds or grass stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams because the ships are all buried together and near a mortuary belonging to khasekhemwy , originally they were all thought to have belonged to him , but one of the 14 ships dates to 3000 & nbsp ; bc , and the associated pottery jars buried with the vessels also suggest earlier dating the ship dating to 3000 & nbsp ; bc was about 75 & nbsp ; feet ( 23 & nbsp ; m ) long and is now thought to perhaps have belonged to an earlier pharaoh according to professor o'connor , the 5,000-year-old ship may have even belonged to hor-aha austronesians invented unique ship technologies like catamarans , outrigger boats , lashed-lug boatbuilding techniques , crab claw sails , and tanja sails ; as well as oceanic navigation techniques austronesian ships varied from simple canoes to large multihull ships at the sides were two planks , and two horseshoe-shaped wood pieces formed the prow and stern these were fitted tightly together edge-to-edge with dowels inserted into holes in between , and then lashed to each other with ropes ( made from rattan or fiber ) wrapped around protruding lugs on the planks this characteristic and ancient austronesian boat-building practice is known as the '' lashed-lug '' technique they were commonly caulked with pastes made from various plants as well as tapa bark and fibres which would expand when wet , further tightening joints and making the hull watertight fixed masts also developed later in both southeast asia ( usually as bipod or tripod masts ) and oceania austronesians traditionally made their sails from woven mats of the resilient and salt-resistant pandanus leaves the ancient champa of vietnam also uniquely developed basket-hulled boats whose hulls were composed of woven and resin-caulked bamboo , either entirely or in conjunction with plank strakes they range from small coracles ( the o thúng ) to large ocean-going trading ships like the ghe mành this is still evident in sri lankan and south indian languages early egyptians also knew how to assemble planks of wood with treenails to fasten them together , using pitch for caulking the seams 1996 , 133–208 ships from the harbour at these ancient port cities established trade with mesopotamia lal 1997 : 182–188 ) shipbuilding and boatmaking may have been prosperous industries in ancient india the ocean and sea going ships of ancient egypt were constructed with cedar wood , most likely hailing from lebanon the ships of phoenicia seem to have been of a similar design the naval history of china stems back to the spring and autumn period ( 722 bc–481 bc ) of the ancient china zhou dynasty however , the chinese vessels during this era were essentially fluvial ( riverine ) the ancient china also built ramming vessels as in the greco-roman tradition of the trireme , although oar-steered ships in china lost favor very early on since it was in the 1st century china that the stern-mounted rudder was first developed this was dually met with the introduction of the han dynasty junk ship design in the same century the malay and javanese people , started building large djong ( ship ) about 1st century ad these ships used 2 types of sail of their invention , the junk sail and tanja sail southern chinese junks were based on keeled and multi-planked austronesian jong ( known as po by the chinese , from javanese or malay perahu - large ship ) chattopadhyaya ( eds ) , history of science , philosophy , and culture in indian civilization , volume iii , part 7 : the trading world of the indian ocean , 1500-1800 , pp southern chinese junks showed characteristics of austronesian jong : v-shaped , double-ended hull with a keel , and using timbers of tropical origin medieval europe , song china , abbasid caliphate , pacific islanders , ming china until recently , viking longships were seen as marking a very considerable advance on traditional clinker-built hulls of plank boards tied together with leather thongs carvel construction in western europe ( see map an insight into ship building in the north sea/baltic areas of the early medieval period was found at sutton hoo , england , where a ship was buried with a chieftain upward from the keel , the hull was made by overlapping nine strakes on either side with rivets fastening the oaken planks together development in the middle ages favored '' round ships '' , with a broad beam and heavily curved at both ends the shipbuilding industry in imperial china reached its height during the song dynasty , yuan dynasty , and early ming dynasty the mainstay of china 's merchant and naval fleets was the junk , which had existed for centuries , but it was at this time that the large ships based on this design were built the largest seaports in the world were in china and included guangzhou , quanzhou , and xiamen at this time islands spread over vast distances across the pacific ocean were being colonised by the melanesians and polynesians , who built giant canoes and progressed to great catamarans between 1405 and 1433 , the government conducted seven diplomatic ming treasure voyages to over thirty countries in southeast asia , india , the middle east and eastern africa although the hongxi and xuande emperors did not emphasize sailing as much as the yongle emperor , they were not against it the shipbuilders were brought from different places in china to the shipyard in nanjing , including zhejiang , jiangxi , fujian , and huguang ( now the provinces of hubei and hunan ) one of the most famous shipyards was long jiang shipyard ( : zh : 龙江船厂 ) , located in nanjing near the treasure shipyard where the ocean-going ships were built zheng he 's treasure ships were regarded as shachuan types , mainly because they were made in the treasure shipyard in nanjing shachuan , or 'sand-ships ' , are ships used primarily for inland transport therefore , the best shipbuilders and laborers were brought from these places to support zheng he 's expedition these two ambitious projects commissioned by emperor yongle would have had enormous environmental and economic effects , even if the ships were half the dimensions given in the history of ming with the development of the carrack , the west moved into a new era of ship construction by building the first regular oceangoing vessels ship design work , also called naval architecture , may be conducted using a ship model basin however , a large number of repair and maintenance works can only be carried out while the ship is out of commercial operation , in a ship repair yard

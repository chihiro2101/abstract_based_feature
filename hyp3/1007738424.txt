evidence from ancient egypt shows that the early egyptians knew how to assemble planks of wood into a ship hull as early as 3100 & nbsp ; bc '' world 's oldest planked boats '' , in archaeology ( volume 54 , number 3 , may/june 2009 ) these are a group of 14 ships discovered in abydos that were constructed of wooden planks which were '' sewn '' together discovered by egyptologist david o'connor of new york university , schuster , angela m.h woven straps were found to have been used to lash the planks together , and reeds or grass stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams the ship dating to 3000 & nbsp ; bc was about 75 & nbsp ; feet ( 23 & nbsp ; m ) long and is now thought to perhaps have belonged to an earlier pharaoh the first true ocean-going vessels were built by the austronesian peoples during the austronesian expansion ( c this was followed by later migrations even further onward ; reaching madagascar in the indian ocean and new zealand and easter island in the pacific ocean at its furthest extent , possibly even reaching the americas austronesians invented unique ship technologies like catamarans , outrigger boats , lashed-lug boatbuilding techniques , crab claw sails , and tanja sails ; as well as oceanic navigation techniques austronesian ships varied from simple canoes to large multihull ships the simplest form of all ancestral austronesian boats had five parts at the sides were two planks , and two horseshoe-shaped wood pieces formed the prow and stern this characteristic and ancient austronesian boat-building practice is known as the '' lashed-lug '' technique they were commonly caulked with pastes made from various plants as well as tapa bark and fibres which would expand when wet , further tightening joints and making the hull watertight they formed the shell of the boat , which was then reinforced by horizontal ribs shipwrecks of austronesian ships can be identified from this construction , as well as the absence of metal nails austronesian ships traditionally had no central rudders but were instead steered using an oar on one side the ancestral austronesian rig was the mastless triangular crab claw sail which had two booms that could be tilted to the wind in island southeast asia , these developed into double outriggers on each side that provided greater stability the ancient champa of vietnam also uniquely developed basket-hulled boats whose hulls were composed of woven and resin-caulked bamboo , either entirely or in conjunction with plank strakes early contact with arab ships in the indian ocean during austronesian voyages is also believed to have resulted in the development of the triangular arabic lateen sail early egyptians also knew how to fasten the planks of this ship together with mortise and tenon joints the oldest known tidal dock in the world was built around 2500 bc during the harappan civilisation at lothal near the present day mangrol harbour on the gujarat coast in india however , it is probable that many small-scale ports , and not massive ports , were used for the harappan maritime trade lal 1997 : 182–188 ) shipbuilding and boatmaking may have been prosperous industries in ancient india tripathi , page 145 the indians also exported teak for shipbuilding to ancient persia other references to indian timber used for shipbuilding is noted in the works of ibn jubayr the ocean and sea going ships of ancient egypt were constructed with cedar wood , most likely hailing from lebanon the naval history of china stems back to the spring and autumn period ( 722 bc–481 bc ) of the ancient china zhou dynasty the chinese built large rectangular barges known as '' castle ships '' , which were essentially floating fortresses complete with multiple decks with guarded ramparts this type of ship was favored by chinese travelers , because they did not build seaworthy ships until around 8–9th century ad chattopadhyaya ( eds ) , history of science , philosophy , and culture in indian civilization , volume iii , part 7 : the trading world of the indian ocean , 1500-1800 , pp this is different from northern chinese junks , which are developed from flat bottomed riverine boats the northern chinese junks had flat bottoms , no keel , no frames ( only water-tight bulkheads ) , transom stern and stem , would have been built out of pine or fir wood , and would have its planks fastened with iron nails or clamps medieval europe , song china , abbasid caliphate , pacific islanders , ming china haywood has argued that earlier frankish and anglo-saxon nautical practice was much more accomplished than had been thought , and has described the distribution of clinker vs carvel construction in western europe ( see map an insight into ship building in the north sea/baltic areas of the early medieval period was found at sutton hoo , england , where a ship was buried with a chieftain sometime around the 12th century , northern european ships began to be built with a straight sternpost , enabling the mounting of a rudder , which was much more durable than a steering oar held over the side development in the middle ages favored '' round ships '' , with a broad beam and heavily curved at both ends 1436 by michael of rhodes , a man who began his career as an oarsman on a venetian galley in 1401 and worked his way up into officer positions he wrote and illustrated a book that contains a treatise on ship building , a treatise on mathematics , much material on astrology , and other materials ( cambridge , ma : mit press , 2009 ) outside medieval europe , great advances were being made in shipbuilding the shipbuilding industry in imperial china reached its height during the song dynasty , yuan dynasty , and early ming dynasty at this time islands spread over vast distances across the pacific ocean were being colonised by the melanesians and polynesians , who built giant canoes and progressed to great catamarans shipbuilders in the ming dynasty primarily worked for the government , under command of the ministry of public works between 1405 and 1433 , the government conducted seven diplomatic ming treasure voyages to over thirty countries in southeast asia , india , the middle east and eastern africa the voyages were initiated by the yongle emperor , and led by the admiral zheng he if a shipbuilder entered the occupation through an apprenticeship , the shipbuilder was likely a farmer before he was hired as a shipbuilder , or he was previously an experienced shipbuilder the watercraft included miscellaneous facilities such as cooking hearths , and storage spaces for the crew 's sleeping mats '' the design originated from bengal rice ships , with bengal being famous for its shipbuilding industry at the time ship design work , also called naval architecture , may be conducted using a ship model basin however , a large number of repair and maintenance works can only be carried out while the ship is out of commercial operation , in a ship repair yard

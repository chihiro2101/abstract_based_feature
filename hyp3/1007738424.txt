evidence from ancient egypt shows that the early egyptians knew how to assemble planks of wood into a ship hull as early as 3100 & nbsp ; bc egyptian pottery as old as 4000 bc shows designs of early boats or other means for navigation that some of the oldest ships yet unearthed are known as the abydos boats these are a group of 14 ships discovered in abydos that were constructed of wooden planks which were '' sewn '' together because the ships are all buried together and near a mortuary belonging to khasekhemwy , originally they were all thought to have belonged to him , but one of the 14 ships dates to 3000 & nbsp ; bc , and the associated pottery jars buried with the vessels also suggest earlier dating the ship dating to 3000 & nbsp ; bc was about 75 & nbsp ; feet ( 23 & nbsp ; m ) long and is now thought to perhaps have belonged to an earlier pharaoh according to professor o'connor , the 5,000-year-old ship may have even belonged to hor-aha the first true ocean-going vessels were built by the austronesian peoples during the austronesian expansion ( c from taiwan , they first settled the island of luzon in the philippines before migrating onwards to the rest of island southeast asia and to micronesia by 1500 bc , covering distances of thousands of kilometers of open ocean austronesians invented unique ship technologies like catamarans , outrigger boats , lashed-lug boatbuilding techniques , crab claw sails , and tanja sails ; as well as oceanic navigation techniques austronesian ships varied from simple canoes to large multihull ships these were fitted tightly together edge-to-edge with dowels inserted into holes in between , and then lashed to each other with ropes ( made from rattan or fiber ) wrapped around protruding lugs on the planks they were commonly caulked with pastes made from various plants as well as tapa bark and fibres which would expand when wet , further tightening joints and making the hull watertight austronesian ships traditionally had no central rudders but were instead steered using an oar on one side these were built in the double-canoe configuration or had a single outrigger on the windward side the triangular crab claw sails also later developed into square or rectangular tanja sails , which like crab claw sails , had distinctive booms spanning the upper and lower edges fixed masts also developed later in both southeast asia ( usually as bipod or tripod masts ) and oceania for example , tamil paṭavu , telugu paḍava , and kannada paḍahu , all meaning '' ship '' , are all derived from proto-hesperonesian padaw , '' sailboat '' , with austronesian cognates like javanese perahu , kadazan padau , maranao padaw , cebuano paráw , samoan folau , hawaiian halau , and maori wharau early egyptians also knew how to assemble planks of wood with treenails to fasten them together , using pitch for caulking the seams early egyptians also knew how to fasten the planks of this ship together with mortise and tenon joints native labourers may have manufactured the flotilla of boats used by alexander the great to navigate across the hydaspes and even the indus , under nearchos tripathi , page 145 the indians also exported teak for shipbuilding to ancient persia the ships of ancient egypt 's eighteenth dynasty were typically about 25 & nbsp ; meters ( 80 & nbsp ; ft ) in length , and had a single mast , sometimes consisting of two poles lashed together at the top making an '' a '' shape the chinese built large rectangular barges known as '' castle ships '' , which were essentially floating fortresses complete with multiple decks with guarded ramparts however , the chinese vessels during this era were essentially fluvial ( riverine ) there is considerable knowledge regarding shipbuilding and seafaring in the ancient mediterranean the ancient china also built ramming vessels as in the greco-roman tradition of the trireme , although oar-steered ships in china lost favor very early on since it was in the 1st century china that the stern-mounted rudder was first developed this was dually met with the introduction of the han dynasty junk ship design in the same century the malay and javanese people , started building large djong ( ship ) about 1st century ad this type of ship was favored by chinese travelers , because they did not build seaworthy ships until around 8–9th century ad southern chinese junks were based on keeled and multi-planked austronesian jong ( known as po by the chinese , from javanese or malay perahu - large ship ) “ asian ship-building traditions in the indian ocean at the dawn of european expansion ” , in : om prakash and d southern chinese junks showed characteristics of austronesian jong : v-shaped , double-ended hull with a keel , and using timbers of tropical origin archeological investigations done at portus near rome have revealed inscriptions indicating the existence of a 'guild of shipbuilders ' during the time of hadrian until recently , viking longships were seen as marking a very considerable advance on traditional clinker-built hulls of plank boards tied together with leather thongs sometime around the 12th century , northern european ships began to be built with a straight sternpost , enabling the mounting of a rudder , which was much more durable than a steering oar held over the side 1436 by michael of rhodes , a man who began his career as an oarsman on a venetian galley in 1401 and worked his way up into officer positions the shipbuilding industry in imperial china reached its height during the song dynasty , yuan dynasty , and early ming dynasty the mainstay of china 's merchant and naval fleets was the junk , which had existed for centuries , but it was at this time that the large ships based on this design were built at this time islands spread over vast distances across the pacific ocean were being colonised by the melanesians and polynesians , who built giant canoes and progressed to great catamarans shipbuilders in the ming dynasty primarily worked for the government , under command of the ministry of public works during the early years of the ming dynasty , the ming government maintained an open policy towards sailing between 1405 and 1433 , the government conducted seven diplomatic ming treasure voyages to over thirty countries in southeast asia , india , the middle east and eastern africa six voyages were conducted under the yongle emperor 's reign , the last of which returned to china in 1422 the ming voyages were large in size , numbering as many as 300 ships and 28,000 men one of the most famous shipyards was long jiang shipyard ( : zh : 龙江船厂 ) , located in nanjing near the treasure shipyard where the ocean-going ships were built the shipbuilders could built 24 models of ships of varying sizes it was a critical invention in shipbuilding technique in ancient china and was only used by the chinese for a fairly long time shipyards became large industrial complexes and the ships built were financed by consortia of investors in the us , the jones act ( which places restrictions on the ships that can be used for moving domestic cargoes ) has meant that merchant shipbuilding has continued , albeit at a reduced rate , but such protection has failed to penalise shipbuilding inefficiencies as modern shipbuilding panels on a panel line become lighter and thinner , the laser hybrid welding technique is utilized however , a large number of repair and maintenance works can only be carried out while the ship is out of commercial operation , in a ship repair yard

evidence from ancient egypt shows that the early egyptians knew how to assemble planks of wood into a ship hull as early as 3100 & nbsp ; bc egyptian pottery as old as 4000 bc shows designs of early boats or other means for navigation '' world 's oldest planked boats '' , in archaeology ( volume 54 , number 3 , may/june 2009 ) that some of the oldest ships yet unearthed are known as the abydos boats these are a group of 14 ships discovered in abydos that were constructed of wooden planks which were '' sewn '' together discovered by egyptologist david o'connor of new york university , schuster , angela m.h the ship dating to 3000 & nbsp ; bc was about 75 & nbsp ; feet ( 23 & nbsp ; m ) long and is now thought to perhaps have belonged to an earlier pharaoh according to professor o'connor , the 5,000-year-old ship may have even belonged to hor-aha the first true ocean-going vessels were built by the austronesian peoples during the austronesian expansion ( c the simplest form of all ancestral austronesian boats had five parts this characteristic and ancient austronesian boat-building practice is known as the '' lashed-lug '' technique shipwrecks of austronesian ships can be identified from this construction , as well as the absence of metal nails the ancestral austronesian rig was the mastless triangular crab claw sail which had two booms that could be tilted to the wind fixed masts also developed later in both southeast asia ( usually as bipod or tripod masts ) and oceania they range from small coracles ( the o thúng ) to large ocean-going trading ships like the ghe mành this may have possibly included limited colonization that have since been assimilated early contact with arab ships in the indian ocean during austronesian voyages is also believed to have resulted in the development of the triangular arabic lateen sail early egyptians also knew how to assemble planks of wood with treenails to fasten them together , using pitch for caulking the seams early egyptians also knew how to fasten the planks of this ship together with mortise and tenon joints however , it is probable that many small-scale ports , and not massive ports , were used for the harappan maritime trade native labourers may have manufactured the flotilla of boats used by alexander the great to navigate across the hydaspes and even the indus , under nearchos hourani & carswel , page 90 the ships of ancient egypt 's eighteenth dynasty were typically about 25 & nbsp ; meters ( 80 & nbsp ; ft ) in length , and had a single mast , sometimes consisting of two poles lashed together at the top making an '' a '' shape they mounted a single square sail on a yard , with an additional spar along the bottom of the sail the ocean and sea going ships of ancient egypt were constructed with cedar wood , most likely hailing from lebanon the naval history of china stems back to the spring and autumn period ( 722 bc–481 bc ) of the ancient china zhou dynasty the chinese built large rectangular barges known as '' castle ships '' , which were essentially floating fortresses complete with multiple decks with guarded ramparts there is considerable knowledge regarding shipbuilding and seafaring in the ancient mediterranean this was dually met with the introduction of the han dynasty junk ship design in the same century large ships are about 50–60 metres ( 164–197 & nbsp ; ft ) long , had tall freeboard , each carrying provisions enough for a year , needham , volume 4 , part 3 , 464 this type of ship was favored by chinese travelers , because they did not build seaworthy ships until around 8–9th century ad southern chinese junks were based on keeled and multi-planked austronesian jong ( known as po by the chinese , from javanese or malay perahu - large ship ) upward from the keel , the hull was made by overlapping nine strakes on either side with rivets fastening the oaken planks together sometime around the 12th century , northern european ships began to be built with a straight sternpost , enabling the mounting of a rudder , which was much more durable than a steering oar held over the side development in the middle ages favored '' round ships '' , with a broad beam and heavily curved at both ends another important ship type was the galley which was constructed with both sails and oars his treatise on shipbuilding treats three kinds of galleys and two kinds of round ships ( cambridge , ma : mit press , 2009 ) outside medieval europe , great advances were being made in shipbuilding the mainstay of china 's merchant and naval fleets was the junk , which had existed for centuries , but it was at this time that the large ships based on this design were built shipbuilders in the ming dynasty primarily worked for the government , under command of the ministry of public works during the early years of the ming dynasty , the ming government maintained an open policy towards sailing the voyages were initiated by the yongle emperor , and led by the admiral zheng he six voyages were conducted under the yongle emperor 's reign , the last of which returned to china in 1422 large numbers of ships were built to meet the demand the ming voyages were large in size , numbering as many as 300 ships and 28,000 men one of the most famous shipyards was long jiang shipyard ( : zh : 龙江船厂 ) , located in nanjing near the treasure shipyard where the ocean-going ships were built shipyards became large industrial complexes and the ships built were financed by consortia of investors driving this steady progress seems to be continuous evolution of sails and rigging , and improved hulls that allowed a greater area of sail to be set safely in a given wind key shipbuilders in europe are fincantieri , navantia , naval group and bae systems ship design work , also called naval architecture , may be conducted using a ship model basin although it is commonly accepted that modern steel has eliminated brittle fracture in ships , some controversy still exists however , a large number of repair and maintenance works can only be carried out while the ship is out of commercial operation , in a ship repair yard

evidence from ancient egypt shows that the early egyptians knew how to assemble planks of wood into a ship hull as early as 3100 & nbsp ; bc egyptian pottery as old as 4000 bc shows designs of early boats or other means for navigation these are a group of 14 ships discovered in abydos that were constructed of wooden planks which were '' sewn '' together the ship dating to 3000 & nbsp ; bc was about 75 & nbsp ; feet ( 23 & nbsp ; m ) long and is now thought to perhaps have belonged to an earlier pharaoh according to professor o'connor , the 5,000-year-old ship may have even belonged to hor-aha the first true ocean-going vessels were built by the austronesian peoples during the austronesian expansion ( c from taiwan , they first settled the island of luzon in the philippines before migrating onwards to the rest of island southeast asia and to micronesia by 1500 bc , covering distances of thousands of kilometers of open ocean this was followed by later migrations even further onward ; reaching madagascar in the indian ocean and new zealand and easter island in the pacific ocean at its furthest extent , possibly even reaching the americas the simplest form of all ancestral austronesian boats had five parts this characteristic and ancient austronesian boat-building practice is known as the '' lashed-lug '' technique they formed the shell of the boat , which was then reinforced by horizontal ribs shipwrecks of austronesian ships can be identified from this construction , as well as the absence of metal nails austronesian ships traditionally had no central rudders but were instead steered using an oar on one side the ancestral austronesian rig was the mastless triangular crab claw sail which had two booms that could be tilted to the wind the triangular crab claw sails also later developed into square or rectangular tanja sails , which like crab claw sails , had distinctive booms spanning the upper and lower edges fixed masts also developed later in both southeast asia ( usually as bipod or tripod masts ) and oceania austronesians traditionally made their sails from woven mats of the resilient and salt-resistant pandanus leaves early contact with arab ships in the indian ocean during austronesian voyages is also believed to have resulted in the development of the triangular arabic lateen sail early egyptians also knew how to fasten the planks of this ship together with mortise and tenon joints the oldest known tidal dock in the world was built around 2500 bc during the harappan civilisation at lothal near the present day mangrol harbour on the gujarat coast in india however , it is probable that many small-scale ports , and not massive ports , were used for the harappan maritime trade native labourers may have manufactured the flotilla of boats used by alexander the great to navigate across the hydaspes and even the indus , under nearchos they mounted a single square sail on a yard , with an additional spar along the bottom of the sail the ocean and sea going ships of ancient egypt were constructed with cedar wood , most likely hailing from lebanon the naval history of china stems back to the spring and autumn period ( 722 bc–481 bc ) of the ancient china zhou dynasty the chinese built large rectangular barges known as '' castle ships '' , which were essentially floating fortresses complete with multiple decks with guarded ramparts malay people independently invented junk rig , made from woven mats reinforced with bamboo , at least several hundred years bc this type of ship was favored by chinese travelers , because they did not build seaworthy ships until around 8–9th century ad “ asian ship-building traditions in the indian ocean at the dawn of european expansion ” , in : om prakash and d the northern chinese junks had flat bottoms , no keel , no frames ( only water-tight bulkheads ) , transom stern and stem , would have been built out of pine or fir wood , and would have its planks fastened with iron nails or clamps archeological investigations done at portus near rome have revealed inscriptions indicating the existence of a 'guild of shipbuilders ' during the time of hadrian haywood has argued that earlier frankish and anglo-saxon nautical practice was much more accomplished than had been thought , and has described the distribution of clinker vs ( cambridge , ma : mit press , 2009 ) outside medieval europe , great advances were being made in shipbuilding the mainstay of china 's merchant and naval fleets was the junk , which had existed for centuries , but it was at this time that the large ships based on this design were built shipbuilders in the ming dynasty primarily worked for the government , under command of the ministry of public works during the early years of the ming dynasty , the ming government maintained an open policy towards sailing although the hongxi and xuande emperors did not emphasize sailing as much as the yongle emperor , they were not against it one of the most famous shipyards was long jiang shipyard ( : zh : 龙江船厂 ) , located in nanjing near the treasure shipyard where the ocean-going ships were built it is said in vol.176 of san guo bei meng hui bian ( 三朝北盟汇编 ) that ships made in fujian are the best ones historical perspectives on east asian science , technology and medicine 107 the shipbuilders were forced to move away from their hometown to the shipyards the ships built for zheng he 's voyages needed to be waterproof , solid , safe , and have ample room to carry large amounts of trading goods shipbuilding was not the sole industry utilising chinese lumber at that time ; the new capital was being built in beijing from approximately 1407 onwards , which required huge amounts of high-quality wood some were responsible for fixing old ships ; some were responsible for making the keel and some were responsible for building the helm the keel is the middle of the bottom of the hull , constructed by connecting three sections ; stern keel , main keel and poop keel it was a critical invention in shipbuilding technique in ancient china and was only used by the chinese for a fairly long time and , they were built by a workforce consisting largely of women and other inexperienced workers who had never seen a ship before ( or even the ocean ) where state subsidy have been removed and domestic industrial policies do not provide support in high labor cost countries , shipbuilding has gone into decline 64 , december 2011 , the output of the united states also underwent a similar change however , since the early 1970s computer-aided design became normal for the shipbuilding design and lofting process however , a large number of repair and maintenance works can only be carried out while the ship is out of commercial operation , in a ship repair yard photos of the reconstruction of the dutch east indiaman batavia—photo web site about the reconstruction of the batavia on the shipyard batavia werf , a 16th-century east indiaman in the netherlands

on the other hand , von neumann–bernays–gödel set theory ( nbg ) can be finitely axiomatized the ontology of nbg includes proper classes as well as sets ; a set is any class that can be a member of another class nbg and zfc are equivalent set theories in the sense that any theorem not mentioning classes and provable in one theory can be proved in the other moreover , robinson arithmetic can be interpreted in general set theory , a small fragment of zfc the consistency of zfc does follow from the existence of a weakly inaccessible cardinal , which is unprovable in zfc if zfc is consistent because there are non-well-founded models that satisfy each axiom of zfc except the axiom of regularity , that axiom is independent of the other zfc axioms forcing proves that the following statements are independent of zfc : continuum hypothesis diamondsuit suslin 's problem martin 's axiom ( which is not a zfc axiom ) axiom of constructibility ( which is also not a zfc axiom ) : for criticism of set theory in general , see objections to set theory zfc has been criticized both for being excessively strong and for being excessively weak , as well as for its failure to capture objects such as proper classes and the universal set some of '' mainstream mathematics '' ( mathematics not directly connected with axiomatic set theory ) is beyond peano arithmetic and second-order arithmetic , but still , all such mathematics can be carried out in zc ( zermelo set theory with choice ) , another theory weaker than zfc unlike von neumann–bernays–gödel set theory ( nbg ) and morse–kelley set theory ( mk ) , zfc does not admit the existence of proper classes some of these conjectures are provable with the addition of axioms such as martin 's axiom or large cardinal axioms to zfc the mizar system and metamath have adopted tarski–grothendieck set theory , an extension of zfc , so that proofs involving grothendieck universes ( encountered in category theory and algebraic geometry ) can be formalized .

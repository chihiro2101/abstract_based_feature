von neumann–bernays–gödel set theory the ontology of nbg includes proper classes as well as sets ; a set is any class that can be a member of another class nbg and zfc are equivalent set theories in the sense that any theorem not mentioning classes and provable in one theory can be proved in the other moreover , robinson arithmetic can be interpreted in general set theory , a small fragment of zfc this much is certain — zfc is immune to the classic paradoxes of naive set theory : russell 's paradox , the burali-forti paradox , and cantor 's paradox because there are non-well-founded models that satisfy each axiom of zfc except the axiom of regularity , that axiom is independent of the other zfc axioms if consistent , zfc can not prove the existence of the inaccessible cardinals that category theory requires forcing proves that the following statements are independent of zfc : continuum hypothesis diamondsuit suslin 's problem martin 's axiom ( which is not a zfc axiom ) axiom of constructibility ( which is also not a zfc axiom ) much of the power of zfc , including the axiom of regularity and the axiom schema of replacement , is included primarily to facilitate the study of the set theory itself unlike von neumann–bernays–gödel set theory ( nbg ) and morse–kelley set theory ( mk ) , zfc does not admit the existence of proper classes some of these conjectures are provable with the addition of axioms such as martin 's axiom or large cardinal axioms to zfc the mizar system and metamath have adopted tarski–grothendieck set theory , an extension of zfc , so that proofs involving grothendieck universes ( encountered in category theory and algebraic geometry ) can be formalized .

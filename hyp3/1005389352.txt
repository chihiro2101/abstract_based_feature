von neumann–bernays–gödel set theory thesis : if zfc is consistent , it is impossible to axiomatize zfc using only finitely many axioms on the other hand , von neumann–bernays–gödel set theory ( nbg ) can be finitely axiomatized the ontology of nbg includes proper classes as well as sets ; a set is any class that can be a member of another class nbg and zfc are equivalent set theories in the sense that any theorem not mentioning classes and provable in one theory can be proved in the other moreover , robinson arithmetic can be interpreted in general set theory , a small fragment of zfc this much is certain — zfc is immune to the classic paradoxes of naive set theory : russell 's paradox , the burali-forti paradox , and cantor 's paradox because there are non-well-founded models that satisfy each axiom of zfc except the axiom of regularity , that axiom is independent of the other zfc axioms this method can prove that the existence of large cardinals is not provable in zfc , but can not prove that assuming such cardinals , given zfc , is free of contradiction : for criticism of set theory in general , see objections to set theory zfc has been criticized both for being excessively strong and for being excessively weak , as well as for its failure to capture objects such as proper classes and the universal set unlike von neumann–bernays–gödel set theory ( nbg ) and morse–kelley set theory ( mk ) , zfc does not admit the existence of proper classes the mizar system and metamath have adopted tarski–grothendieck set theory , an extension of zfc , so that proofs involving grothendieck universes ( encountered in category theory and algebraic geometry ) can be formalized .

von neumann–bernays–gödel set theory on the other hand , von neumann–bernays–gödel set theory ( nbg ) can be finitely axiomatized the ontology of nbg includes proper classes as well as sets ; a set is any class that can be a member of another class nbg and zfc are equivalent set theories in the sense that any theorem not mentioning classes and provable in one theory can be proved in the other moreover , robinson arithmetic can be interpreted in general set theory , a small fragment of zfc because there are non-well-founded models that satisfy each axiom of zfc except the axiom of regularity , that axiom is independent of the other zfc axioms if consistent , zfc can not prove the existence of the inaccessible cardinals that category theory requires assuming that axiom turns the axioms of infinity , power set , and choice ( 7 & thinsp ; – & thinsp ; 9 above ) into theorems many important statements are independent of zfc ( see list of statements independent of zfc ) unlike von neumann–bernays–gödel set theory ( nbg ) and morse–kelley set theory ( mk ) , zfc does not admit the existence of proper classes a further comparative weakness of zfc is that the axiom of choice included in zfc is weaker than the axiom of global choice included in nbg and mk some of these conjectures are provable with the addition of axioms such as martin 's axiom or large cardinal axioms to zfc

von neumann–bernays–gödel set theory on the other hand , von neumann–bernays–gödel set theory ( nbg ) can be finitely axiomatized nbg and zfc are equivalent set theories in the sense that any theorem not mentioning classes and provable in one theory can be proved in the other moreover , robinson arithmetic can be interpreted in general set theory , a small fragment of zfc the consistency of zfc does follow from the existence of a weakly inaccessible cardinal , which is unprovable in zfc if zfc is consistent using models , they proved this subtheory consistent , and proved that each of the axioms of extensionality , replacement , and power set is independent of the four remaining axioms of this subtheory because there are non-well-founded models that satisfy each axiom of zfc except the axiom of regularity , that axiom is independent of the other zfc axioms assuming that axiom turns the axioms of infinity , power set , and choice ( 7 & thinsp ; – & thinsp ; 9 above ) into theorems forcing proves that the following statements are independent of zfc : continuum hypothesis diamondsuit suslin 's problem martin 's axiom ( which is not a zfc axiom ) axiom of constructibility ( which is also not a zfc axiom ) : for criticism of set theory in general , see objections to set theory zfc has been criticized both for being excessively strong and for being excessively weak , as well as for its failure to capture objects such as proper classes and the universal set unlike von neumann–bernays–gödel set theory ( nbg ) and morse–kelley set theory ( mk ) , zfc does not admit the existence of proper classes a further comparative weakness of zfc is that the axiom of choice included in zfc is weaker than the axiom of global choice included in nbg and mk

by the summer of 1906 , mahler had been director of the vienna hofoper for nine years since 1899 this had been at maiernigg , near the resort town of maria wörth in carinthia , southern austria , where mahler built a villa overlooking the wörthersee 137 in these restful surroundings mahler completed his symphonies no 158 , 165 , 203 until 1901 , mahler 's compositions had been heavily influenced by the german folk-poem collection des knaben wunderhorn ( '' the youth 's magic horn '' ) , which he had first encountered around 1887 prague 1885–86 and leipzig 1886–88 ) the music of mahler 's many wunderhorn settings is reflected in his symphonies no & nbsp ; 4 , which all employ vocal as well as instrumental forces from about 1901 , however , mahler 's music underwent a change in character as he moved into the middle period of his compositional life mahler arrived at maiernigg in june 1906 with the draft manuscript of his seventh symphony ; he intended to spend time revising the orchestration until an idea for a new work should strike 426–427 the composer 's wife alma mahler , in her memoirs , says that for a fortnight mahler was '' haunted by the spectre of failing inspiration '' ; a 102 mahler 's recollection , however , is that on the first day of the vacation he was seized by the creative spirit , and plunged immediately into composition of the work that would become his eighth symphony two notes in mahler 's handwriting dating from june 1906 show that early schemes for the work , which he may not at first have intended as a fully choral symphony , were based on a four-movement structure in which two '' hymns '' surround an instrumental core hymn '' ) from mahler 's later comments on the symphony 's gestation , it is evident that the four-movement plan was relatively short-lived 519 in comments recorded by his biographer richard specht , mahler makes no mention of the original four-movement plans '' the work was written at a frantic pace— '' in record time '' , according to the musicologist henry-louis de la grange 432–447 mahler began composing the veni creator hymn without waiting for the text to arrive from vienna '' although amendments and alterations were subsequently carried out to the score , there is very little manuscript evidence of the sweeping changes and rewriting that occurred with his earlier symphonies as they were prepared for performance 523–525 with its use of vocal elements throughout , rather than in episodes at or near the end , the work was the first completely choral symphony to be written mahler made arrangements with the impresario emil gutmann for the symphony to be premiered in munich in the autumn of 1910 meanwhile , bruno walter , mahler 's assistant at the vienna hofoper , was responsible for the recruitment and preparation of the eight soloists up to this time , receptions of mahler 's new symphonies had usually been disappointing '' the austrian music historian oscar bie , while impressed with the festival as a whole , wrote subsequently that the eighth was '' stronger in effect than in significance , and purer in its voices than in emotion '' 186 this most affirmative work of mahler 's is , in adorno 's view , his least successful , musically and artistically inferior to his other symphonies '' mahler biographer jonathan carr finds much of the symphony '' bland '' , lacking the tension and resolution present in the composer 's other symphonies 11 once inspired by the veni creator idea , mahler soon saw the faust poem as an ideal counterpart to the latin hymn the international gustav mahler society , founded in 1955 , has as its main objective the production of a complete critical edition of all of mahler 's works

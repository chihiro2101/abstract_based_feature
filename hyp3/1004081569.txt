throughout this time his practice was to leave vienna at the close of the hofoper season for a summer retreat , where he could devote himself to composition since 1899 this had been at maiernigg , near the resort town of maria wörth in carinthia , southern austria , where mahler built a villa overlooking the wörthersee prague 1885–86 and leipzig 1886–88 ) the music of mahler 's many wunderhorn settings is reflected in his symphonies no & nbsp ; 4 , which all employ vocal as well as instrumental forces from about 1901 , however , mahler 's music underwent a change in character as he moved into the middle period of his compositional life 32 during this period symphonies no & nbsp ; 7 were written , all as purely instrumental works , portrayed by mahler scholar deryck cooke as '' more stern and forthright & nbsp ; mahler arrived at maiernigg in june 1906 with the draft manuscript of his seventh symphony ; he intended to spend time revising the orchestration until an idea for a new work should strike 426–427 the composer 's wife alma mahler , in her memoirs , says that for a fortnight mahler was '' haunted by the spectre of failing inspiration '' ; a 102 mahler 's recollection , however , is that on the first day of the vacation he was seized by the creative spirit , and plunged immediately into composition of the work that would become his eighth symphony two notes in mahler 's handwriting dating from june 1906 show that early schemes for the work , which he may not at first have intended as a fully choral symphony , were based on a four-movement structure in which two '' hymns '' surround an instrumental core hymn '' ) from mahler 's later comments on the symphony 's gestation , it is evident that the four-movement plan was relatively short-lived 519 in comments recorded by his biographer richard specht , mahler makes no mention of the original four-movement plans he told specht that having chanced on the veni creator hymn , he had a sudden vision of the complete work : '' i saw the whole piece immediately before my eyes , and only needed to write it down as though it were being dictated to me '' the work was written at a frantic pace— '' in record time '' , according to the musicologist henry-louis de la grange '' although amendments and alterations were subsequently carried out to the score , there is very little manuscript evidence of the sweeping changes and rewriting that occurred with his earlier symphonies as they were prepared for performance 151 mahler had no doubts about the ground-breaking nature of the symphony , calling it the grandest thing he had ever done , and maintaining that all his previous symphonies were merely preludes to it 229–232 preparations began early in the year , with the selection of choirs from the choral societies of munich , leipzig and vienna through the spring and summer these forces prepared in their home towns , before assembling in munich early in september for three full days of final rehearsals under mahler during the next three years , according to the calculations of mahler 's friend guido adler the eighth symphony received a further 20 performances across europe 928 the composer-critic robert simpson , usually a champion of mahler , referred to part & nbsp ; ii as '' an ocean of shameless kitsch '' mahler biographer jonathan carr finds much of the symphony '' bland '' , lacking the tension and resolution present in the composer 's other symphonies the eighth symphony 's two parts combine the sacred text of the 9th-century latin hymn veni creator spiritus with the secular text from the closing passages from goethe 's 19th-century dramatic poem faust 11 once inspired by the veni creator idea , mahler soon saw the faust poem as an ideal counterpart to the latin hymn the first issued recording of the complete symphony was stokowski 's carnegie hall performance with the new york philharmonic and combined new york choirs on 9 & nbsp ; april 1950

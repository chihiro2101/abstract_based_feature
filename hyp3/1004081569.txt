by the summer of 1906 , mahler had been director of the vienna hofoper for nine years since 1899 this had been at maiernigg , near the resort town of maria wörth in carinthia , southern austria , where mahler built a villa overlooking the wörthersee 137 in these restful surroundings mahler completed his symphonies no 158 , 165 , 203 until 1901 , mahler 's compositions had been heavily influenced by the german folk-poem collection des knaben wunderhorn ( '' the youth 's magic horn '' ) , which he had first encountered around 1887 prague 1885–86 and leipzig 1886–88 ) the music of mahler 's many wunderhorn settings is reflected in his symphonies no from about 1901 , however , mahler 's music underwent a change in character as he moved into the middle period of his compositional life & nbsp ; 7 were written , all as purely instrumental works , portrayed by mahler scholar deryck cooke as '' more stern and forthright & nbsp ; , more tautly symphonic , with a new granite-like hardness of orchestration '' mahler arrived at maiernigg in june 1906 with the draft manuscript of his seventh symphony ; he intended to spend time revising the orchestration until an idea for a new work should strike 426–427 the composer 's wife alma mahler , in her memoirs , says that for a fortnight mahler was '' haunted by the spectre of failing inspiration '' ; a 102 mahler 's recollection , however , is that on the first day of the vacation he was seized by the creative spirit , and plunged immediately into composition of the work that would become his eighth symphony 889 these outlines show that mahler had fixed on the idea of opening with the latin hymn , but had not yet settled on the precise form of the rest '' the work was written at a frantic pace— '' in record time '' , according to the musicologist henry-louis de la grange 432–447 mahler began composing the veni creator hymn without waiting for the text to arrive from vienna when it did , according to alma mahler , '' the complete text fitted the music exactly 523–525 with its use of vocal elements throughout , rather than in episodes at or near the end , the work was the first completely choral symphony to be written 151 mahler had no doubts about the ground-breaking nature of the symphony , calling it the grandest thing he had ever done , and maintaining that all his previous symphonies were merely preludes to it through the spring and summer these forces prepared in their home towns , before assembling in munich early in september for three full days of final rehearsals under mahler at one point during rehearsals he turned to us and said , 'if , after my death , something does n't sound right , then change it this vast hall had a capacity of 3,200 ; to assist ticket sales and raise publicity , gutmann devised the nickname '' symphony of a thousand '' , which has remained the symphony 's popular subtitle despite mahler 's disapproval however , the munich premiere of the eighth symphony was an unqualified triumph ; as the final chords died away there was a short pause before a huge outbreak of applause which lasted for twenty minutes 186 this most affirmative work of mahler 's is , in adorno 's view , his least successful , musically and artistically inferior to his other symphonies '' mahler biographer jonathan carr finds much of the symphony '' bland '' , lacking the tension and resolution present in the composer 's other symphonies deryck cooke , on the other hand , compares mahler 's eighth to beethoven 's choral ( ninth ) symphony in london on 16 & nbsp ; july 2010 the opening concert of the bbc proms celebrated the 150th anniversary of mahler 's birth with a performance of the eighth , with jiří bělohlávek conducting the bbc symphony orchestra

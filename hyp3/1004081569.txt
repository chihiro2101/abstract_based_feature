by the summer of 1906 , mahler had been director of the vienna hofoper for nine years throughout this time his practice was to leave vienna at the close of the hofoper season for a summer retreat , where he could devote himself to composition since 1899 this had been at maiernigg , near the resort town of maria wörth in carinthia , southern austria , where mahler built a villa overlooking the wörthersee 137 in these restful surroundings mahler completed his symphonies no 158 , 165 , 203 until 1901 , mahler 's compositions had been heavily influenced by the german folk-poem collection des knaben wunderhorn ( '' the youth 's magic horn '' ) , which he had first encountered around 1887 prague 1885–86 and leipzig 1886–88 ) the music of mahler 's many wunderhorn settings is reflected in his symphonies no & nbsp ; 7 were written , all as purely instrumental works , portrayed by mahler scholar deryck cooke as '' more stern and forthright & nbsp ; mahler arrived at maiernigg in june 1906 with the draft manuscript of his seventh symphony ; he intended to spend time revising the orchestration until an idea for a new work should strike 426–427 the composer 's wife alma mahler , in her memoirs , says that for a fortnight mahler was '' haunted by the spectre of failing inspiration '' ; a 102 mahler 's recollection , however , is that on the first day of the vacation he was seized by the creative spirit , and plunged immediately into composition of the work that would become his eighth symphony 889 these outlines show that mahler had fixed on the idea of opening with the latin hymn , but had not yet settled on the precise form of the rest hymn '' ) from mahler 's later comments on the symphony 's gestation , it is evident that the four-movement plan was relatively short-lived 77 mahler had long nurtured an ambition to set the end of the faust epic to music , '' and to set it quite differently from other composers who have made it saccharine and feeble he told specht that having chanced on the veni creator hymn , he had a sudden vision of the complete work : '' i saw the whole piece immediately before my eyes , and only needed to write it down as though it were being dictated to me 890 it was completed in all its essentials by mid-august , even though mahler had to absent himself for a week to attend the salzburg festival 432–447 mahler began composing the veni creator hymn without waiting for the text to arrive from vienna when it did , according to alma mahler , '' the complete text fitted the music exactly 229–232 preparations began early in the year , with the selection of choirs from the choral societies of munich , leipzig and vienna also in the audience was the 28-year-old british conductor leopold stokowski , who six years later would lead the first united states performance of the symphony however , the munich premiere of the eighth symphony was an unqualified triumph ; as the final chords died away there was a short pause before a huge outbreak of applause which lasted for twenty minutes back at his hotel mahler received a letter from thomas mann , which referred to the composer as '' the man who , as i believe , expresses the art of our time in its profoundest and most sacred form '' '' mahler biographer jonathan carr finds much of the symphony '' bland '' , lacking the tension and resolution present in the composer 's other symphonies in london on 16 & nbsp ; july 2010 the opening concert of the bbc proms celebrated the 150th anniversary of mahler 's birth with a performance of the eighth , with jiří bělohlávek conducting the bbc symphony orchestra 11 once inspired by the veni creator idea , mahler soon saw the faust poem as an ideal counterpart to the latin hymn the first issued recording of the complete symphony was stokowski 's carnegie hall performance with the new york philharmonic and combined new york choirs on 9 & nbsp ; april 1950

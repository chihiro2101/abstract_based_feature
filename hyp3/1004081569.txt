by the summer of 1906 , mahler had been director of the vienna hofoper for nine years throughout this time his practice was to leave vienna at the close of the hofoper season for a summer retreat , where he could devote himself to composition since 1899 this had been at maiernigg , near the resort town of maria wörth in carinthia , southern austria , where mahler built a villa overlooking the wörthersee & nbsp ; 4 , no 158 , 165 , 203 until 1901 , mahler 's compositions had been heavily influenced by the german folk-poem collection des knaben wunderhorn ( '' the youth 's magic horn '' ) , which he had first encountered around 1887 prague 1885–86 and leipzig 1886–88 ) the music of mahler 's many wunderhorn settings is reflected in his symphonies no from about 1901 , however , mahler 's music underwent a change in character as he moved into the middle period of his compositional life & nbsp ; 7 were written , all as purely instrumental works , portrayed by mahler scholar deryck cooke as '' more stern and forthright & nbsp ; mahler arrived at maiernigg in june 1906 with the draft manuscript of his seventh symphony ; he intended to spend time revising the orchestration until an idea for a new work should strike 426–427 the composer 's wife alma mahler , in her memoirs , says that for a fortnight mahler was '' haunted by the spectre of failing inspiration '' ; a 102 mahler 's recollection , however , is that on the first day of the vacation he was seized by the creative spirit , and plunged immediately into composition of the work that would become his eighth symphony 889 these outlines show that mahler had fixed on the idea of opening with the latin hymn , but had not yet settled on the precise form of the rest 77 mahler had long nurtured an ambition to set the end of the faust epic to music , '' and to set it quite differently from other composers who have made it saccharine and feeble he told specht that having chanced on the veni creator hymn , he had a sudden vision of the complete work : '' i saw the whole piece immediately before my eyes , and only needed to write it down as though it were being dictated to me 890 it was completed in all its essentials by mid-august , even though mahler had to absent himself for a week to attend the salzburg festival 432–447 mahler began composing the veni creator hymn without waiting for the text to arrive from vienna 523–525 with its use of vocal elements throughout , rather than in episodes at or near the end , the work was the first completely choral symphony to be written 913 and 918 this performance was the last time that mahler conducted a premiere of one of his own works on the day following the munich premiere mahler led the orchestra and choruses in a repeat performance 928 the composer-critic robert simpson , usually a champion of mahler , referred to part & nbsp ; ii as '' an ocean of shameless kitsch deryck cooke , on the other hand , compares mahler 's eighth to beethoven 's choral ( ninth ) symphony 93–95 in the late 20th century and into the 21st , the symphony was performed in all parts of the world the eighth symphony 's two parts combine the sacred text of the 9th-century latin hymn veni creator spiritus with the secular text from the closing passages from goethe 's 19th-century dramatic poem faust the international gustav mahler society , founded in 1955 , has as its main objective the production of a complete critical edition of all of mahler 's works the first issued recording of the complete symphony was stokowski 's carnegie hall performance with the new york philharmonic and combined new york choirs on 9 & nbsp ; april 1950

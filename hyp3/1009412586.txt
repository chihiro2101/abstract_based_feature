the lower register of its frieze depicts agricultural work meant to communicate the abundance and prosperity of the roman peace the monument as a whole serves a dual civic ritual and propaganda function for augustus and his regime , easing notions of autocracy and dynastic succession that might otherwise be unpalatable to traditional roman culture within the enclosing precinct walls , the altar itself was carved with images illustrating the lex aria , the law governing the ritual performed at the altar the sacrificial procession depicts animals being led to sacrifice by figures carved in a republican style similar to the so-called '' altar of domitius ahenobarbus '' , in sharp contrast with the style on the exterior of the precinct walls what remains of the altar is otherwise fragmentary , but it appears to have been largely functional with less emphasis on art and decoration the interior of the precinct walls are carved with bucrania , ox skulls , from which carved garlands hang the exterior walls of the ara pacis are divided between allegorical and pseudo-historical relief panels on the upper register while the lower register comprises scenes of nature : harmonic , intertwined vines that contain wildlife and connote nature under control the upper register of the northern and southern walls depict scenes of the emperor , his family , and members of the regime in the act of processing to or performing a sacrifice other figures wear laurel crowns , traditional roman symbols of victory the western and eastern walls are both pierced by entryways to the altar , although the interior would only have been accessed by a stairway on the western side on the eastern wall , panels depicted the seated figures of roma and pax , while the western side depicts the discovery of the twins and she-wolf and the sacrifice of a figure traditionally identified as aeneas , but increasingly believed to be rome 's second king , numa pompilius the identity of these various figures has been a point of some controversy over the years , relying heavily on interpretation of fragmentary remains , discussed below the sculpture of the ara pacis is primarily symbolic rather than decorative , and its iconography has several levels of significance studies of the ara pacis and similar public roman monuments traditionally address the potent political symbolism of their decorative programs , and their emphasis and promulgation of dynastic and other imperial policies ; they are usually studied as a form of imperial propaganda the program of the ara pacis addressed this group 's very real fears of cyclical history , and promised that the rule of augustus would avert the cataclysmic destruction of the world predicted by contemporary models of historical thought due to the widespread depiction around the sculpture of scenes of peace , and because the altar is named for '' peace '' , the favoured conclusion is that the goddess is pax the better preserved scene depicts the sacrifice of a pig ( the standard sacrifice when romans made a peace treaty ) by an old priest and two attendants subsequently , the suggestion was made that the scene shows numa pompilius , the roman king associated with peace and the gates of janus their identification by their non-roman costume and their participation in the ceremony advertises to all that rome is the centre of the world , and that other nations send their young to rome to learn roman ways , so great is rome 's reputation the first two foreground figures are lictors , carrying fasces ( bundles of rods symbolizing roman authority ) although the name suggests this college has exactly fifteen members , the size of the college has grown to 23 , including augustus and agrippa , who appear on the south frieze gerhard koeppel , “ die historischen reliefs der römischen kaiserzeit v : ara pacis augustae , '' teil 1 the last portion of the north frieze consists of members of the imperial family other figures in the entourage might include marcella major ( a daughter of octavia ) , iullus antonius ( a son of mark antony ) , and two boys and a girl of the imperial family many scholars , realizing by 1935 that lucius was too young to be the boy beside agrippa , preferred to identify him as gaius they named the smallest child on the north frieze '' lucius , '' even though he is a mere toddler ( lucius was four in 13 bc ) rose points out that only gaius would have been of an age to participate in the troy game in 13 bc the gaius identification is best supported by his size , however an additional boy in roman dress who has a bulla ( but has lost his head !

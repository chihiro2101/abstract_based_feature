the altar reflects the augustan vision of roman civil religion the lower register of its frieze depicts agricultural work meant to communicate the abundance and prosperity of the roman peace the monument as a whole serves a dual civic ritual and propaganda function for augustus and his regime , easing notions of autocracy and dynastic succession that might otherwise be unpalatable to traditional roman culture the monument consists of a traditional open-air altar at its centre surrounded by precinct walls which are pierced on the eastern and western ends ( so called today because of the modern layout ) by openings and elaborately and finely sculpted entirely in luna marble within the enclosing precinct walls , the altar itself was carved with images illustrating the lex aria , the law governing the ritual performed at the altar the sacrificial procession depicts animals being led to sacrifice by figures carved in a republican style similar to the so-called '' altar of domitius ahenobarbus '' , in sharp contrast with the style on the exterior of the precinct walls the lower register of the interior walls imitate the appearance of traditionally wooden altar precincts , which were meant to bring to mind other such altars in rome and the tradition of constructing altars at the boundary of the city 's pomerium the upper register of the northern and southern walls depict scenes of the emperor , his family , and members of the regime in the act of processing to or performing a sacrifice various figures in togas are shown with their heads covered ( capite velato ) , signifying their role as both priests and sacrificiants members of individual flamen are depicted in traditional garb appropriate to their office , while lictors can be identified by their iconographic fasces the western and eastern walls are both pierced by entryways to the altar , although the interior would only have been accessed by a stairway on the western side on the eastern wall , panels depicted the seated figures of roma and pax , while the western side depicts the discovery of the twins and she-wolf and the sacrifice of a figure traditionally identified as aeneas , but increasingly believed to be rome 's second king , numa pompilius studies of the ara pacis and similar public roman monuments traditionally address the potent political symbolism of their decorative programs , and their emphasis and promulgation of dynastic and other imperial policies ; they are usually studied as a form of imperial propaganda peter holliday suggested that the altar 's imagery of the golden age , usually discussed as mere poetic allusion , appealed to a significant component of the roman populace when the monument was being reconstructed at its present site , edmund buchner and other scholars sketched what the panel may have looked like this interpretation , although widely accepted , can not be proved correct , as so little of the original panel survives due to the widespread depiction around the sculpture of scenes of peace , and because the altar is named for '' peace '' , the favoured conclusion is that the goddess is pax the better preserved scene depicts the sacrifice of a pig ( the standard sacrifice when romans made a peace treaty ) by an old priest and two attendants in the 1960s , stephan weinstock challenged this identification ( and the very identity of the entire monument ) , citing numerous discrepancies that sieveking and his followers had failed to notice between vergil 's version and the panel in addition there are two or three non-roman children , who may be guests ( or hostages ) in rome their identification by their non-roman costume and their participation in the ceremony advertises to all that rome is the centre of the world , and that other nations send their young to rome to learn roman ways , so great is rome 's reputation the first two foreground figures are lictors , carrying fasces ( bundles of rods symbolizing roman authority ) the next set of figures consists of priests from the college of the epulones , so identified by an incense box they carry with special symbols although the name suggests this college has exactly fifteen members , the size of the college has grown to 23 , including augustus and agrippa , who appear on the south frieze two very badly damaged figures in the middle are split by a gap gerhard koeppel , “ die historischen reliefs der römischen kaiserzeit v : ara pacis augustae , '' teil 1 , diane atnally conlin , the artists of the ara pacis ( chapel hill 1997 ) , gaius stern , '' women children and senators on the ara pacis augustae '' berk gaius stern , '' women children and senators on the ara pacis augustae '' berk du quesnay , horace , odes 4.5 : pro reditu imperatoris caesaris divi filii augusti , '' in homage to horace : a bimillenary celebration ( oxford : clarendon press , 1995 ) , p they named the smallest child on the north frieze '' lucius , '' even though he is a mere toddler ( lucius was four in 13 bc ) for gaius to appear in public without his bulla would invite the evil eye gaius stern , '' women children and senators on the ara pacis augustae '' berk see also kleiner and buxton , '' pledges of empire : the ara pacis and the donations of rome , '' aja ( 2008 ) , 57–89 unlike the north wall , where most of the heads are new ( not authentic ancient heads , but modern creations ) , the heads of the figures on the south wall are mostly original the figure of augustus was not discovered until the 1903 excavation , and his head was damaged by the cornerstone of the renaissance palazzo built on top of the original ara pacis site although he was identified correctly in 1903 , petersen , strong , and stuart-jones initially saw the figure as the rex sacrorum 2004 , '' women , children and senators on the ara pacis augustae '' , ( berk diss syme also proved somewhat unintentionally , based on the inscription ils 6095 that lucius domitius ahenobarbus was governor of africa in 13 bc and could not be in rome for the ara pacis ceremony the new cover building , which has been named '' ara pacis museum '' , now stands on the same site as mussolini 's structure file : ara pacis relieve 25.jpg ara pacis relief file : ara pacis relieve 26.jpg ara pacis relief file : ara pacis relieve 27.jpg ara pacis relief file : ara pacis relieve 28.jpg ara pacis relief the artists of the ara pacis : the process of hellenization in roman relief sculpture ( studies in the history of greece and rome university of north carolina press ) peter j high-resolution 360° panoramas and images of ara pacis art atlas

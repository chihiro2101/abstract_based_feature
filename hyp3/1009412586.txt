the altar reflects the augustan vision of roman civil religion the lower register of its frieze depicts agricultural work meant to communicate the abundance and prosperity of the roman peace the monument as a whole serves a dual civic ritual and propaganda function for augustus and his regime , easing notions of autocracy and dynastic succession that might otherwise be unpalatable to traditional roman culture the monument consists of a traditional open-air altar at its centre surrounded by precinct walls which are pierced on the eastern and western ends ( so called today because of the modern layout ) by openings and elaborately and finely sculpted entirely in luna marble within the enclosing precinct walls , the altar itself was carved with images illustrating the lex aria , the law governing the ritual performed at the altar the sacrificial procession depicts animals being led to sacrifice by figures carved in a republican style similar to the so-called '' altar of domitius ahenobarbus '' , in sharp contrast with the style on the exterior of the precinct walls the lower register of the interior walls imitate the appearance of traditionally wooden altar precincts , which were meant to bring to mind other such altars in rome and the tradition of constructing altars at the boundary of the city 's pomerium the exterior walls of the ara pacis are divided between allegorical and pseudo-historical relief panels on the upper register while the lower register comprises scenes of nature : harmonic , intertwined vines that contain wildlife and connote nature under control the western and eastern walls are both pierced by entryways to the altar , although the interior would only have been accessed by a stairway on the western side the entryways were flanked by panels depicting allegorical or mythological scenes evocative of peace , piety and tradition on the eastern wall , panels depicted the seated figures of roma and pax , while the western side depicts the discovery of the twins and she-wolf and the sacrifice of a figure traditionally identified as aeneas , but increasingly believed to be rome 's second king , numa pompilius the sculpture of the ara pacis is primarily symbolic rather than decorative , and its iconography has several levels of significance studies of the ara pacis and similar public roman monuments traditionally address the potent political symbolism of their decorative programs , and their emphasis and promulgation of dynastic and other imperial policies ; they are usually studied as a form of imperial propaganda the program of the ara pacis addressed this group 's very real fears of cyclical history , and promised that the rule of augustus would avert the cataclysmic destruction of the world predicted by contemporary models of historical thought when the monument was being reconstructed at its present site , edmund buchner and other scholars sketched what the panel may have looked like scholars have variously suggested that the goddess is italia , tellus ( earth ) , venus genetrix or pax ( peace ) , ≈ '' a new interpretation of the renowned tellus on the east wall of the ara pacis is in fact venus genetrix , shown with attributes of fertility due to the widespread depiction around the sculpture of scenes of peace , and because the altar is named for '' peace '' , the favoured conclusion is that the goddess is pax the better preserved scene depicts the sacrifice of a pig ( the standard sacrifice when romans made a peace treaty ) by an old priest and two attendants the long friezes of the ara pacis ( the north and south walls ) contain figures advancing towards the west , who participate in a state of thanksgiving to celebrate the peace created by augustus in addition there are two or three non-roman children , who may be guests ( or hostages ) in rome their identification by their non-roman costume and their participation in the ceremony advertises to all that rome is the centre of the world , and that other nations send their young to rome to learn roman ways , so great is rome 's reputation the next set of figures consists of priests from the college of the epulones , so identified by an incense box they carry with special symbols two very badly damaged figures in the middle are split by a gap gerhard koeppel , “ die historischen reliefs der römischen kaiserzeit v : ara pacis augustae , '' teil 1 , diane atnally conlin , the artists of the ara pacis ( chapel hill 1997 ) , gaius stern , '' women children and senators on the ara pacis augustae '' berk in 1894 , and again in 1902 and 1903 , eugen petersen suggested that lucius caesar appears with agrippa , dressed in a '' trojan '' costume for the troy game held in 13 bc ( see below ) many scholars , realizing by 1935 that lucius was too young to be the boy beside agrippa , preferred to identify him as gaius some scholars assumed this boy also was a participant in the troy games , although he is certainly too young ( six or seven was the minimum age ) rose points out that only gaius would have been of an age to participate in the troy game in 13 bc the youth wearing hellenistic greek clothing suited to a hellenistic prince has been identified as gaius in the guise of a camillus , john pollini , the portraiture of gaius and lucius caesar , ( 1987 ) , 24–26 for gaius to appear in public without his bulla would invite the evil eye 2006 , chapter 8 ;

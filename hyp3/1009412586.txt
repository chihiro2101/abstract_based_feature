the altar reflects the augustan vision of roman civil religion the lower register of its frieze depicts agricultural work meant to communicate the abundance and prosperity of the roman peace the monument as a whole serves a dual civic ritual and propaganda function for augustus and his regime , easing notions of autocracy and dynastic succession that might otherwise be unpalatable to traditional roman culture within the enclosing precinct walls , the altar itself was carved with images illustrating the lex aria , the law governing the ritual performed at the altar the sacrificial procession depicts animals being led to sacrifice by figures carved in a republican style similar to the so-called '' altar of domitius ahenobarbus '' , in sharp contrast with the style on the exterior of the precinct walls what remains of the altar is otherwise fragmentary , but it appears to have been largely functional with less emphasis on art and decoration the garlands bear fruits from various types of plants , all displayed on a single garland as allegorical representations of plenty and abundance the lower register of the interior walls imitate the appearance of traditionally wooden altar precincts , which were meant to bring to mind other such altars in rome and the tradition of constructing altars at the boundary of the city 's pomerium the exterior walls of the ara pacis are divided between allegorical and pseudo-historical relief panels on the upper register while the lower register comprises scenes of nature : harmonic , intertwined vines that contain wildlife and connote nature under control the upper register of the northern and southern walls depict scenes of the emperor , his family , and members of the regime in the act of processing to or performing a sacrifice the western and eastern walls are both pierced by entryways to the altar , although the interior would only have been accessed by a stairway on the western side on the eastern wall , panels depicted the seated figures of roma and pax , while the western side depicts the discovery of the twins and she-wolf and the sacrifice of a figure traditionally identified as aeneas , but increasingly believed to be rome 's second king , numa pompilius the identity of these various figures has been a point of some controversy over the years , relying heavily on interpretation of fragmentary remains , discussed below the sculpture of the ara pacis is primarily symbolic rather than decorative , and its iconography has several levels of significance studies of the ara pacis and similar public roman monuments traditionally address the potent political symbolism of their decorative programs , and their emphasis and promulgation of dynastic and other imperial policies ; they are usually studied as a form of imperial propaganda peter holliday suggested that the altar 's imagery of the golden age , usually discussed as mere poetic allusion , appealed to a significant component of the roman populace scholars have variously suggested that the goddess is italia , tellus ( earth ) , venus genetrix or pax ( peace ) , ≈ '' a new interpretation of the renowned tellus on the east wall of the ara pacis is in fact venus genetrix , shown with attributes of fertility due to the widespread depiction around the sculpture of scenes of peace , and because the altar is named for '' peace '' , the favoured conclusion is that the goddess is pax the better preserved scene depicts the sacrifice of a pig ( the standard sacrifice when romans made a peace treaty ) by an old priest and two attendants the long friezes of the ara pacis ( the north and south walls ) contain figures advancing towards the west , who participate in a state of thanksgiving to celebrate the peace created by augustus in addition there are two or three non-roman children , who may be guests ( or hostages ) in rome the ceremony took place in the summer of 13 bc , but not necessarily on 4 july , when the senate voted to build the ara pacis , diane atnally conlin , the artists of the ara pacis ( chapel hill 1997 ) , gaius stern , '' women children and senators on the ara pacis augustae '' berk many scholars used to identify the veiled , leading figure as julia the elder , but since julia appears on the south frieze , it is more likely that this figure is octavia minor du quesnay , horace , odes 4.5 : pro reditu imperatoris caesaris divi filii augusti , '' in homage to horace : a bimillenary celebration ( oxford : clarendon press , 1995 ) , p if this toddler were lucius , he would be too young and in the wrong costume for the troy games as charles brian rose has noted , '' the variable value of the eastern costume and the uneasy interaction of trojan and parthian iconography can make it difficult to determine whether one is viewing the founders of the romans or their fiercest opponents the gaius identification is best supported by his size , however an additional boy in roman dress who has a bulla ( but has lost his head ! ) is also the right size , and therefore a better guess this same figure in hellenistic dress has also been interpreted as ptolemy of mauretania representing africa , along with the german boy ( europe ) and the parthian prince ( asia ) gaius stern , '' women children and senators on the ara pacis augustae '' berk see also kleiner and buxton , '' pledges of empire : the ara pacis and the donations of rome , '' aja ( 2008 ) , 57–89 unlike the north wall , where most of the heads are new ( not authentic ancient heads , but modern creations ) , the heads of the figures on the south wall are mostly original nevertheless , much debate has taken place over many of these figures , including augustus , agrippa , tiberius , julia , and antonia the figure of augustus was not discovered until the 1903 excavation , and his head was damaged by the cornerstone of the renaissance palazzo built on top of the original ara pacis site many scholars continue to see the julia figure as livia , having reasoned that livia has to be on the ara pacis julia also better personified augustus ' new pro-natalism program , having already given birth to four surviving children ( and was pregnant with a fifth ) von domaszewski , '' die familie des augustus auf der ara pacis '' , joai 6 ( 1903 ) 57 ff stern adds the costume is wrong for a trojan ( no phrygian hat ) and no bulla – worn by all roman boys as protection from the evil eye this led to a great number of complaints from locals , starting a long series of arguments and criticisms of the ara pacis project these arguments are ongoing despite the original pavilion being replaced by a new one in 2006 , known as the '' ara pacis museum '' the artists of the ara pacis : the process of hellenization in roman relief sculpture ( studies in the history of greece and rome university of north carolina press ) peter j high-resolution 360° panoramas and images of ara pacis art atlas

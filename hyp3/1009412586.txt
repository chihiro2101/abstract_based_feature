the altar reflects the augustan vision of roman civil religion the lower register of its frieze depicts agricultural work meant to communicate the abundance and prosperity of the roman peace within the enclosing precinct walls , the altar itself was carved with images illustrating the lex aria , the law governing the ritual performed at the altar the interior of the precinct walls are carved with bucrania , ox skulls , from which carved garlands hang the garlands bear fruits from various types of plants , all displayed on a single garland as allegorical representations of plenty and abundance the lower register of the interior walls imitate the appearance of traditionally wooden altar precincts , which were meant to bring to mind other such altars in rome and the tradition of constructing altars at the boundary of the city 's pomerium the upper register of the northern and southern walls depict scenes of the emperor , his family , and members of the regime in the act of processing to or performing a sacrifice other figures wear laurel crowns , traditional roman symbols of victory the western and eastern walls are both pierced by entryways to the altar , although the interior would only have been accessed by a stairway on the western side the entryways were flanked by panels depicting allegorical or mythological scenes evocative of peace , piety and tradition on the eastern wall , panels depicted the seated figures of roma and pax , while the western side depicts the discovery of the twins and she-wolf and the sacrifice of a figure traditionally identified as aeneas , but increasingly believed to be rome 's second king , numa pompilius the identity of these various figures has been a point of some controversy over the years , relying heavily on interpretation of fragmentary remains , discussed below the sculpture of the ara pacis is primarily symbolic rather than decorative , and its iconography has several levels of significance peter holliday suggested that the altar 's imagery of the golden age , usually discussed as mere poetic allusion , appealed to a significant component of the roman populace this interpretation , although widely accepted , can not be proved correct , as so little of the original panel survives due to the widespread depiction around the sculpture of scenes of peace , and because the altar is named for '' peace '' , the favoured conclusion is that the goddess is pax the fragmentary '' lupercal panel '' apparently preserves the moment when romulus and remus were discovered by faustulus the shepherd , while mars looks on again this panel is a modern drawing without much evidence marble fragments of the tree and the head and shoulder of mars ( if it is mars ) and part of a second individual ( thought to be faustulus ) survive , but the addition of the she-wolf , romulus , and remus is entirely speculative the better preserved scene depicts the sacrifice of a pig ( the standard sacrifice when romans made a peace treaty ) by an old priest and two attendants the long friezes of the ara pacis ( the north and south walls ) contain figures advancing towards the west , who participate in a state of thanksgiving to celebrate the peace created by augustus in addition there are two or three non-roman children , who may be guests ( or hostages ) in rome their identification by their non-roman costume and their participation in the ceremony advertises to all that rome is the centre of the world , and that other nations send their young to rome to learn roman ways , so great is rome 's reputation the next set of figures consists of priests from the college of the epulones , so identified by an incense box they carry with special symbols from photos , the gap appears to affect a single figure , but as koeppel , conlin , and stern have proven , in-site examination reveals that one is a foreground and the other a background figure gerhard koeppel , “ die historischen reliefs der römischen kaiserzeit v : ara pacis augustae , '' teil 1 , diane atnally conlin , the artists of the ara pacis ( chapel hill 1997 ) , gaius stern , '' women children and senators on the ara pacis augustae '' berk many scholars used to identify the veiled , leading figure as julia the elder , but since julia appears on the south frieze , it is more likely that this figure is octavia minor they named the smallest child on the north frieze '' lucius , '' even though he is a mere toddler ( lucius was four in 13 bc ) '' charles brian rose , '' the parthians in augustan rome , '' in american journal of archaeology 109 ( 2005 ) , p rose points out that only gaius would have been of an age to participate in the troy game in 13 bc for gaius to appear in public without his bulla would invite the evil eye this same figure in hellenistic dress has also been interpreted as ptolemy of mauretania representing africa , along with the german boy ( europe ) and the parthian prince ( asia ) the south wall has seen a great deal of scholarship and the greatest number of academic debates nevertheless , much debate has taken place over many of these figures , including augustus , agrippa , tiberius , julia , and antonia the figure of augustus was not discovered until the 1903 excavation , and his head was damaged by the cornerstone of the renaissance palazzo built on top of the original ara pacis site aside from a very small minority of scholars ( most vehemently defensive of lepidus in rom mitt in the 1930s was ludwig curtius ) , the rest of the academy concluded that this figure is agrippa this helps prove that the ceremony is an event in 13 , although a few scholars continued to argue the ceremony was that of 9 bc ( until definitive proof in favor of 13 came out in 1939 ) these arguments are ongoing despite the original pavilion being replaced by a new one in 2006 , known as the '' ara pacis museum '' file : ara pacis louvre.jpg ara pacis relief in the louve

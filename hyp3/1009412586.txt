the altar reflects the augustan vision of roman civil religion the monument as a whole serves a dual civic ritual and propaganda function for augustus and his regime , easing notions of autocracy and dynastic succession that might otherwise be unpalatable to traditional roman culture the bucrania in turn evoke the idea of sacrificial piety , appropriate motifs for the interior of the altar precinct the exterior walls of the ara pacis are divided between allegorical and pseudo-historical relief panels on the upper register while the lower register comprises scenes of nature : harmonic , intertwined vines that contain wildlife and connote nature under control members of individual flamen are depicted in traditional garb appropriate to their office , while lictors can be identified by their iconographic fasces the western and eastern walls are both pierced by entryways to the altar , although the interior would only have been accessed by a stairway on the western side on the eastern wall , panels depicted the seated figures of roma and pax , while the western side depicts the discovery of the twins and she-wolf and the sacrifice of a figure traditionally identified as aeneas , but increasingly believed to be rome 's second king , numa pompilius the identity of these various figures has been a point of some controversy over the years , relying heavily on interpretation of fragmentary remains , discussed below the sculpture of the ara pacis is primarily symbolic rather than decorative , and its iconography has several levels of significance studies of the ara pacis and similar public roman monuments traditionally address the potent political symbolism of their decorative programs , and their emphasis and promulgation of dynastic and other imperial policies ; they are usually studied as a form of imperial propaganda peter holliday suggested that the altar 's imagery of the golden age , usually discussed as mere poetic allusion , appealed to a significant component of the roman populace the program of the ara pacis addressed this group 's very real fears of cyclical history , and promised that the rule of augustus would avert the cataclysmic destruction of the world predicted by contemporary models of historical thought the east and west walls each contain two panels , one well preserved and one represented only in fragments when the monument was being reconstructed at its present site , edmund buchner and other scholars sketched what the panel may have looked like a goddess sits amid a scene of fertility and prosperity with twins on her lap scholars have variously suggested that the goddess is italia , tellus ( earth ) , venus genetrix or pax ( peace ) , ≈ '' a new interpretation of the renowned tellus on the east wall of the ara pacis is in fact venus genetrix , shown with attributes of fertility in the 1960s , stephan weinstock challenged this identification ( and the very identity of the entire monument ) , citing numerous discrepancies that sieveking and his followers had failed to notice between vergil 's version and the panel subsequently , the suggestion was made that the scene shows numa pompilius , the roman king associated with peace and the gates of janus the long friezes of the ara pacis ( the north and south walls ) contain figures advancing towards the west , who participate in a state of thanksgiving to celebrate the peace created by augustus their identification by their non-roman costume and their participation in the ceremony advertises to all that rome is the centre of the world , and that other nations send their young to rome to learn roman ways , so great is rome 's reputation the ceremony took place in the summer of 13 bc , but not necessarily on 4 july , when the senate voted to build the ara pacis after them follows the collegium of the quindecimviri sacris faciundis , also identified by the incense box carried by a public slave among them , diane atnally conlin , the artists of the ara pacis ( chapel hill 1997 ) , gaius stern , '' women children and senators on the ara pacis augustae '' berk many scholars , realizing by 1935 that lucius was too young to be the boy beside agrippa , preferred to identify him as gaius some scholars assumed this boy also was a participant in the troy games , although he is certainly too young ( six or seven was the minimum age ) this same figure in hellenistic dress has also been interpreted as ptolemy of mauretania representing africa , along with the german boy ( europe ) and the parthian prince ( asia ) see also kleiner and buxton , '' pledges of empire : the ara pacis and the donations of rome , '' aja ( 2008 ) , 57–89 in the absence of augustus from the panel , early scholars debated whether agrippa ( the tall veiled priest ) was augustus or agrippa or lepidus sieveking later reversed his position with a series of peculiar suggestions in 1926 , loewy compared the ara pacis agrippa to the louvre agrippa and the agrippa in copenhagen ( and elsewhere ) in order to demonstrate the iconographical similarity moretti , in making the glass museum for the ara pacis at mussolini 's command , guessed that the two consuls ( tiberius and varus ) of 13 flank augustus , so he saw this figure as m dütschke , '' ueber ein römisches relief mit darstellung der familie des augustus '' , gelehrtenschule des johanneums zu hamburg ( 1880 ) a von domaszewski amended this family identification and correctly saw the child as germanicus welin , '' die beiden festtagge der ara pacis augustae '' , δραγμα m.p welin 's article did not circulate widely , but a summary in english appears as an appendix in arnoldo momigliano , '' the peace of the ara pacis , '' journal of the warburg and courtauld institutes 5 ( 1942 ) , 228–231 suetonius , life of nero 5.1 as this campaign is known to have begun in 2 bc , john pollini , '' ahenobarbi , appuleii and some others on the ara pacis '' , ajarch 90 ( 1986 ) , p 455 it means that gnaeus must have been of mature age by that time , therefore requiring a birth year of at least 17 bc , which would , in turn , make him sufficiently old to be the boy on the ara pacis sir ronald syme , '' neglected children on the ara pacis '' , in ajarch 88 ( 1984 ) , pp of ca press 1995 ) ;

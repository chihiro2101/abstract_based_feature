theologians usually use reason and deduction to prove the existence , unity and oneness of god they use a teleological argument for the existence of god as a creator based on perceived evidence of order , purpose , design , or direction—or some combination of these—in nature آنان‌ بيشترِ دلايل‌ توحيد را با اين‌ رويكرد ارائه كرده اند for the qur'an , god is an immanent and transcendent deity who actively creates , maintains and destroys the universe the reality of god as the ultimate cause of things is the belief that god is veiled from human understanding because of the secondary causes and contingent realities of things in the world thus the belief in the oneness of god is equated in the qur'an with the '' belief in the unseen '' ( sura the qur'an states that god 's signals are so near and yet so far , demanding that its students listen to what it has to say with humility ( sura , sura the qur'an draws attention to certain observable facts , to present them as '' reminders '' of god instead of providing lengthy '' theological '' proofs for the existence and unity of god these medieval scholars argued that nature was composed of uniform atoms that were '' re-created '' at every instant by god the laws of nature were only the customary sequence of apparent causes ( customs of god ) , the ultimate cause of each accident being god himself mourison ( 2002 ) other forms of the argument also appear in avicenna 's other works , and this argument became known as the proof of the truthful ibn sina initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of being , in which he distinguished between essence ( mahiat ) and existence ( wujud ) he argued that the fact of existence can not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things and that form and matter by themselves can not interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things existence must , therefore , be due to an causality that necessitates , imparts , gives , or adds existence to an essence an ontological argument for the existence of god was first proposed by avicenna ( 965-1037 ) in the metaphysics section of the book of healing this was the first attempt at using the method of a priori proof , which utilizes intuition and reason alone avicenna 's proof of god 's existence is unique in that it can be classified as both a cosmological argument and an ontological argument '' it is ontological insofar as ‘ necessary existence ’ in intellect is the first basis for arguing for a necessary existent '' thus his ontological system rests on the conception of god as the wajib al-wujud ( necessary existent ) avicenna 's cosmological argument for god 's existence later muslim theologians elaborated on this verse saying that the existence of at least two gods would inevitably arise between them , at one time or another , a conflict of wills the quran argues that human beings have an instinctive distaste for polytheism : at times of crisis , for example , even the idolatry forget the false deities and call upon the one true god for help as soon as they are relieved from the danger , they however start associating other beings with god next , the qur'an argues that polytheism takes away from human dignity : god has honored human beings and given them charge of the physical world , and yet they disgrace their position in the world by worshipping what they carve out with their own hands lastly , the qur'an argues that monotheism is not a later discovery made by the human race , but rather there is the combined evidence of the prophetic call for monotheism throughout human history starting from adam understanding of the meaning of tawhid is one of the most controversial issues among muslims in its current usage , the expressions '' tawhid '' or '' knowledge of tawhid '' are sometimes used as an equivalent for the whole kalam , the islamic theology all muslim authorities maintain that a true understanding of god is impossible unless he introduces himself due to the fact that god is beyond the range of human vision and senses the approach of textual interpretation in islam is to avoid delving into theological speculation and did not employ the use of kalam in maqalat al-islamiyin , abu al-hasan al-ash'ari describes the mu'tazilite conception of the tawhid as follows : corbin ( 1993 ) , pp 109 and 110 god is unique , nothing is like him ; he is neither body , nor individual , nor substance , nor accident he can not dwell in a place or within a being ; he is not the object of any creatural attribute or qualification 110 mu'tazilis believed that god is deprived of all positive attributes , in the sense that all divine qualifications must be understood as being the essence itself , and declaring that god is existing ubiquitously and in everything as this divine essence is infinite , his qualities are the same as his essence , essentially there is one reality which is one and indivisible 210 for muslim mystics ( sufis ) , the affirmation in speech of god 's unity is only the first step of tawhid while all muslims believe the reality of god to be one , critics hold that the term '' existence '' ( wujud ) is also used for the existence of things in this world and that the doctrine blurs the distinction between the existence of the creator and that of the creation '' god 's '' signs '' ( ayat ) and '' traces '' ( athar ) —the creatures—are neither the same as god nor different from him , because god must be understood as both absent and present , both transcendent and immanent in many jurisdictions of the world , the laws and the general attitude of the population hold that the sphere of public life should be secular , and that belief in and practice of religion should remain in the sphere of private life

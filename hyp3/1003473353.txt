the concept of '' majestic 12 '' emerged during a period in the 1980s when ufologists believed there had been a cover-up of the roswell ufo incident and speculated some secretive upper tier of the united states government was responsible their suppositions appeared to be confirmed in 1984 when ufologist jaime shandera received an envelope containing film which , when developed , showed images of eight pages of documents that appeared to be briefing papers describing '' operation majestic 12 '' the documents purported to reveal a secret committee of 12 , supposedly authorized by united states president harry s twining and containing a reference to majestic 12 , the memo is widely held to be a forgery , likely planted as part of a hoax historian robert goldberg wrote that the ufologists came to believe the story despite the documents being '' obviously planted to bolster the legitimacy of the briefing papers '' soon , distrust and suspicion led to disagreements within the ufology community over the authenticity of the mj-12 documents , and moore was accused of taking part in an elaborate hoax , while other ufologists and debunkers such as philip j the fbi began its own investigation of the supposed '' secret '' documents and quickly formed doubts as to their authenticity the fbi subsequently declared the mj-12 documents to be '' completely bogus '' later in 1996 , a document called the mj-12 '' special operations manual '' circulated among ufologists

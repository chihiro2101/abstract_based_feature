caregivers are to follow in some cases a living will may forbid the use of various kinds of burdensome medical treatment however , by the late 1980s , public advocacy groups became aware that many people remained unaware of advance directives and even fewer actually completed them in part , this was seen as a failure of health care providers and medical organizations to promote and support the use of these documents which attempted to address this awareness problem by requiring health care institutions to better promote and support the use of advance directives this led to the development of what some have called '' second generation '' advance directives – the '' health care proxy appointment '' or '' medical power of attorney '' living wills also reflect a moment in time , and may therefore need regular updating to ensure that the correct course of action can be chosen durable power of attorney and healthcare proxy power of attorney statutes have existed in the united states since the days of '' common law '' ( i.e the appointed healthcare proxy has , in essence , the same rights to request or refuse treatment that the individual would have if still capable of making and communicating health care decisions this new advance directive was heartily endorsed by the u.s public , and supporting legislation soon followed in virtually all states eventually , however , deficiencies in '' second-generation '' advance directives were also soon noted primarily , individuals faced problems similar to those that handicapped living wills – knowing what to tell the proxy decision-maker about one 's wishes in a meaningful way while a study comparing next-of-kin decisions on behalf of an incapacitated person , ( who later recovered ) found that these surrogates chose correctly 68 % of the time overall this continuing problem led to the development of what might be called '' third generation '' advance directives third generation advance directives were designed to

that any recording of one 's wishes is problematic , the preponderance of experts recommend the completion of an advance directive document – especially one that includes both a living will and a

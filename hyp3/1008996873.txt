'' pleasure '' refers to experience that feels good , that involves the enjoyment of something pleasure contrasts with pain or suffering , which are forms of feeling bad this assumption is important for the possibility of comparing and aggregating the degrees of pleasure of different experiences , for example , in order to perform the utilitarian calculus the concept of pleasure is similar but not identical to the concepts of well-being and of happiness pleasure refers to a certain type of experience while well-being is about what is good for a person many philosophers agree that pleasure is good for a person and therefore is a form of well-being pleasure may have a role to play in this attitude , but it is not identical to happiness pleasure is closely related to value , desire , motivation and right action axiological hedonists hold that pleasure is the only thing that has intrinsic value psychological hedonism is the thesis that all our actions aim at increasing pleasure and avoiding pain freud 's pleasure principle ties pleasure to motivation and action by holding that there is a strong psychological tendency to seek pleasure and to avoid pain classical utilitarianism connects pleasure to ethics in stating that whether an action is right depends on the pleasure it produces : it should maximize the sum-total of pleasure . sources and types of pleasure many pleasurable experiences are associated with satisfying basic biological drives , such as eating , exercise , hygiene , sleep , and sex quality theories hold that pleasure is a quality of pleasurable experiences themselves while attitude theories state that pleasure is in some sense external to the experience since it depends on the subject 's attitude to the experience in natural language , the term '' pleasure '' is primarily associated with sensory pleasures like the enjoyment of food or sex one traditionally important quality-theory closely follows this association by holding that pleasure is a sensation these problems can be avoided by felt-quality-theories , which see pleasure not as a sensation but as an aspect qualifying sensations or other mental phenomena as an aspect , pleasure is dependent on the mental phenomenon it qualifies , it can not be present on its own it also captures the intuition that pleasure is usually pleasure of something : enjoyment of drinking a milkshake or of playing chess but not just pure or object-less enjoyment attitude theories propose to analyze pleasure in terms of attitudes to experiences instead , the subject has to have the right attitude to this taste for pleasure to arise so the difference between the first and the second person in the example above is that only the first person has a corresponding desire directed at the taste of chocolate one important argument against this version is that while it is often the case that we desire something first and then enjoy it , this can not always be the case in fact , often the opposite seems to be true : we have to learn first that something is enjoyable before we start to desire it another argument against desire theories is that desire and pleasure can come apart : we can have a desire for things that are not enjoyable and we can enjoy things without desiring to do so dispositional theories try to account for pleasure in terms of dispositions , often by including insights from both the quality theories and the attitude theories one way to combine these elements is to hold that pleasure consists in being disposed to desire an experience in virtue of the qualities of this experience some of the problems of the regular desire theory can be avoided this way since the disposition does not need to be realized for there to be pleasure , thereby taking into account that desire and pleasure can come apart this sum-total includes the agent 's pleasure as well , but only as one factor among many that for an object to be beautiful is for it to cause pleasure or that the experience of beauty is always accompanied by pleasure opponents of aesthetic hedonism have pointed out that despite commonly occurring together , there are cases of beauty without pleasure sigmund freud formulated his pleasure principle in order to account for the effect pleasure has on our behavior cognitive biases in regard to pleasure include the peakâ€“end rule , the focusing illusion , the nearness bias and the future bias

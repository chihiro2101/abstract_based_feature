'' pleasure '' refers to experience that feels good , that involves the enjoyment of something but in its most general sense , it includes all types of positive or pleasant experiences including the enjoyment of sports , seeing a beautiful sunset or engaging in an intellectually satisfying activity pleasure contrasts with pain or suffering , which are forms of feeling bad both pleasure and pain come in degrees and have been thought of as a dimension going from positive degrees through a neutral point to negative degrees this assumption is important for the possibility of comparing and aggregating the degrees of pleasure of different experiences , for example , in order to perform the utilitarian calculus the concept of pleasure is similar but not identical to the concepts of well-being and of happiness pleasure refers to a certain type of experience while well-being is about what is good for a person many philosophers agree that pleasure is good for a person and therefore is a form of well-being but there may be other things besides or instead of pleasure that constitute well-being , like health , virtue , knowledge or the fulfillment of desires life satisfaction theories , on the other hand , hold that happiness involves having the right attitude towards one 's life as a whole pleasure may have a role to play in this attitude , but it is not identical to happiness pleasure is closely related to value , desire , motivation and right action freud 's pleasure principle ties pleasure to motivation and action by holding that there is a strong psychological tendency to seek pleasure and to avoid pain classical utilitarianism connects pleasure to ethics in stating that whether an action is right depends on the pleasure it produces : it should maximize the sum-total of pleasure pleasure comes in various forms , for example , in the enjoyment of food , sex , sports , seeing a beautiful sunset or engaging in an intellectually satisfying activity theories of pleasure try to determine what all these pleasurable experiences have in common , what is essential to them they are traditionally divided into quality theories and attitude theories in natural language , the term '' pleasure '' is primarily associated with sensory pleasures like the enjoyment of food or sex on the simplest version of the sensation theory , whenever we experience pleasure there is a distinctive pleasure-sensation present but considering the pleasure of seeing a beautiful sunset , there seems to be no specific region in the body at which we experience this pleasure these problems can be avoided by felt-quality-theories , which see pleasure not as a sensation but as an aspect qualifying sensations or other mental phenomena since the link to the enjoyed phenomenon is already built into the pleasure , it solves the problem faced by sensation theories to explain how this link comes about it also captures the intuition that pleasure is usually pleasure of something : enjoyment of drinking a milkshake or of playing chess but not just pure or object-less enjoyment according to this approach , pleasurable experiences differ in content ( drinking a milkshake , playing chess ) but agree in feeling or hedonic tone attitude theories propose to analyze pleasure in terms of attitudes to experiences one way to combine these elements is to hold that pleasure consists in being disposed to desire an experience in virtue of the qualities of this experience ethical hedonist theories can be classified in relation to whose pleasure should be increased this position entails that things other than pleasure , like knowledge , virtue or money , only have instrumental value : they are valuable because or to the extent that they produce pleasure but lack value otherwise aesthetic hedonism makes this relation part of the definition of beauty by holding that there is a necessary connection between pleasure and beauty , e.g we take pleasure from many things that are not beautiful , which is why beauty is usually defined in terms of a special type of pleasure : aesthetic or disinterested pleasure yet , some lines of research suggest that people do experience pleasure and suffering at the same time , giving rise to so-called mixed feelings the thesis of psychological hedonism generalizes this insight by holding that all our actions aim at increasing pleasure and avoiding pain false beliefs may mislead us and thus our actions may fail to result in pleasure , but even failed actions are motivated by considerations of pleasure , according to psychological hedonism sigmund freud formulated his pleasure principle in order to account for the effect pleasure has on our behavior

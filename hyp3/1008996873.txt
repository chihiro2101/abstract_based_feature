'' pleasure '' refers to experience that feels good , that involves the enjoyment of something pleasure contrasts with pain or suffering , which are forms of feeling bad this assumption is important for the possibility of comparing and aggregating the degrees of pleasure of different experiences , for example , in order to perform the utilitarian calculus these terms are used in overlapping ways , but their meanings tend to come apart in technical contexts like philosophy or psychology pleasure refers to a certain type of experience while well-being is about what is good for a person many philosophers agree that pleasure is good for a person and therefore is a form of well-being but there may be other things besides or instead of pleasure that constitute well-being , like health , virtue , knowledge or the fulfillment of desires pleasure may have a role to play in this attitude , but it is not identical to happiness pleasure is closely related to value , desire , motivation and right action axiological hedonists hold that pleasure is the only thing that has intrinsic value many desires are concerned with pleasure psychological hedonism is the thesis that all our actions aim at increasing pleasure and avoiding pain freud 's pleasure principle ties pleasure to motivation and action by holding that there is a strong psychological tendency to seek pleasure and to avoid pain classical utilitarianism connects pleasure to ethics in stating that whether an action is right depends on the pleasure it produces : it should maximize the sum-total of pleasure pleasure is sometimes subdivided into fundamental pleasures that are closely related to survival ( food , sex , and social belonging ) and higher-order pleasures ( e.g theories of pleasure try to determine what all these pleasurable experiences have in common , what is essential to them quality theories hold that pleasure is a quality of pleasurable experiences themselves while attitude theories state that pleasure is in some sense external to the experience since it depends on the subject 's attitude to the experience in natural language , the term '' pleasure '' is primarily associated with sensory pleasures like the enjoyment of food or sex one traditionally important quality-theory closely follows this association by holding that pleasure is a sensation these problems can be avoided by felt-quality-theories , which see pleasure not as a sensation but as an aspect qualifying sensations or other mental phenomena since the link to the enjoyed phenomenon is already built into the pleasure , it solves the problem faced by sensation theories to explain how this link comes about it also captures the intuition that pleasure is usually pleasure of something : enjoyment of drinking a milkshake or of playing chess but not just pure or object-less enjoyment various attitudes have been proposed for the type of attitude responsible for pleasure , but historically the most influential version assigns this role to desire on this account , pleasure is linked to experiences that fulfill a desire had by the experiencer one important argument against this version is that while it is often the case that we desire something first and then enjoy it , this can not always be the case this objection can be partially avoided by holding that it does not matter whether the desire was there before the experience but that it only matters what we desire while the experience is happening another argument against desire theories is that desire and pleasure can come apart : we can have a desire for things that are not enjoyable and we can enjoy things without desiring to do so dispositional theories try to account for pleasure in terms of dispositions , often by including insights from both the quality theories and the attitude theories some of the problems of the regular desire theory can be avoided this way since the disposition does not need to be realized for there to be pleasure , thereby taking into account that desire and pleasure can come apart ethical hedonist theories can be classified in relation to whose pleasure should be increased according to cicero ( or rather his character torquatus ) epicurus also believed that pleasure was the chief good and pain the chief evil the thesis of psychological hedonism generalizes this insight by holding that all our actions aim at increasing pleasure and avoiding pain it states that our overall impression of past events is determined for the most part not by the total pleasure and suffering it contained but by how it felt at its peaks and at its end the nearness bias and the future bias are two different forms of violating the principle of temporal neutrality

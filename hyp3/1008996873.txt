'' pleasure '' refers to experience that feels good , that involves the enjoyment of something the term is primarily used in association with sensory pleasures like the enjoyment of food or sex pleasure contrasts with pain or suffering , which are forms of feeling bad this assumption is important for the possibility of comparing and aggregating the degrees of pleasure of different experiences , for example , in order to perform the utilitarian calculus the concept of pleasure is similar but not identical to the concepts of well-being and of happiness these terms are used in overlapping ways , but their meanings tend to come apart in technical contexts like philosophy or psychology pleasure refers to a certain type of experience while well-being is about what is good for a person many philosophers agree that pleasure is good for a person and therefore is a form of well-being but there may be other things besides or instead of pleasure that constitute well-being , like health , virtue , knowledge or the fulfillment of desires on some conceptions , happiness is identified with '' the individual â€™ s balance of pleasant over unpleasant experience '' pleasure may have a role to play in this attitude , but it is not identical to happiness pleasure is closely related to value , desire , motivation and right action freud 's pleasure principle ties pleasure to motivation and action by holding that there is a strong psychological tendency to seek pleasure and to avoid pain pleasure is sometimes subdivided into fundamental pleasures that are closely related to survival ( food , sex , and social belonging ) and higher-order pleasures ( e.g pleasure comes in various forms , for example , in the enjoyment of food , sex , sports , seeing a beautiful sunset or engaging in an intellectually satisfying activity theories of pleasure try to determine what all these pleasurable experiences have in common , what is essential to them quality theories hold that pleasure is a quality of pleasurable experiences themselves while attitude theories state that pleasure is in some sense external to the experience since it depends on the subject 's attitude to the experience one traditionally important quality-theory closely follows this association by holding that pleasure is a sensation so a pleasurable experience of eating chocolate involves a sensation of the taste of chocolate together with a pleasure-sensation but this account can not explain why the enjoyment is linked to the taste of the chocolate and not to the itch as an aspect , pleasure is dependent on the mental phenomenon it qualifies , it can not be present on its own it also captures the intuition that pleasure is usually pleasure of something : enjoyment of drinking a milkshake or of playing chess but not just pure or object-less enjoyment according to this approach , pleasurable experiences differ in content ( drinking a milkshake , playing chess ) but agree in feeling or hedonic tone one way for quality theorists to respond to this objection is by pointing out that the hedonic tone of pleasure-experiences is not a regular quality but a higher-order quality attitude theories propose to analyze pleasure in terms of attitudes to experiences dispositional theories try to account for pleasure in terms of dispositions , often by including insights from both the quality theories and the attitude theories some of the problems of the regular desire theory can be avoided this way since the disposition does not need to be realized for there to be pleasure , thereby taking into account that desire and pleasure can come apart pleasure plays a central role in theories from various areas of philosophy pleasure is related not just to how we actually act , but also to how we ought to act , which belongs to the field of ethics ethical hedonism takes the strongest position on this relation in stating that considerations of increasing pleasure and decreasing pain fully determine what we should do or which action is right pleasure is intimately connected to value as something that is desirable and worth seeking this position entails that things other than pleasure , like knowledge , virtue or money , only have instrumental value : they are valuable because or to the extent that they produce pleasure but lack value otherwise it asserts that being motivated by pleasure is self-defeating in the sense that it leads to less actual pleasure than following other motives it states that our overall impression of past events is determined for the most part not by the total pleasure and suffering it contained but by how it felt at its peaks and at its end

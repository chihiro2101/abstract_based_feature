'' pleasure '' refers to experience that feels good , that involves the enjoyment of something but in its most general sense , it includes all types of positive or pleasant experiences including the enjoyment of sports , seeing a beautiful sunset or engaging in an intellectually satisfying activity pleasure contrasts with pain or suffering , which are forms of feeling bad this assumption is important for the possibility of comparing and aggregating the degrees of pleasure of different experiences , for example , in order to perform the utilitarian calculus the concept of pleasure is similar but not identical to the concepts of well-being and of happiness pleasure refers to a certain type of experience while well-being is about what is good for a person many philosophers agree that pleasure is good for a person and therefore is a form of well-being but there may be other things besides or instead of pleasure that constitute well-being , like health , virtue , knowledge or the fulfillment of desires pleasure is closely related to value , desire , motivation and right action axiological hedonists hold that pleasure is the only thing that has intrinsic value freud 's pleasure principle ties pleasure to motivation and action by holding that there is a strong psychological tendency to seek pleasure and to avoid pain classical utilitarianism connects pleasure to ethics in stating that whether an action is right depends on the pleasure it produces : it should maximize the sum-total of pleasure pleasure comes in various forms , for example , in the enjoyment of food , sex , sports , seeing a beautiful sunset or engaging in an intellectually satisfying activity quality theories hold that pleasure is a quality of pleasurable experiences themselves while attitude theories state that pleasure is in some sense external to the experience since it depends on the subject 's attitude to the experience one traditionally important quality-theory closely follows this association by holding that pleasure is a sensation but considering the pleasure of seeing a beautiful sunset , there seems to be no specific region in the body at which we experience this pleasure these problems can be avoided by felt-quality-theories , which see pleasure not as a sensation but as an aspect qualifying sensations or other mental phenomena as an aspect , pleasure is dependent on the mental phenomenon it qualifies , it can not be present on its own it also captures the intuition that pleasure is usually pleasure of something : enjoyment of drinking a milkshake or of playing chess but not just pure or object-less enjoyment one objection to both the sensation theory and the felt-quality theory is that there is no one quality shared by all pleasure-experiences attitude theories propose to analyze pleasure in terms of attitudes to experiences various attitudes have been proposed for the type of attitude responsible for pleasure , but historically the most influential version assigns this role to desire one important argument against this version is that while it is often the case that we desire something first and then enjoy it , this can not always be the case another argument against desire theories is that desire and pleasure can come apart : we can have a desire for things that are not enjoyable and we can enjoy things without desiring to do so dispositional theories try to account for pleasure in terms of dispositions , often by including insights from both the quality theories and the attitude theories some of the problems of the regular desire theory can be avoided this way since the disposition does not need to be realized for there to be pleasure , thereby taking into account that desire and pleasure can come apart pleasure plays a central role in theories from various areas of philosophy ethical hedonist theories can be classified in relation to whose pleasure should be increased this sum-total includes the agent 's pleasure as well , but only as one factor among many this position entails that things other than pleasure , like knowledge , virtue or money , only have instrumental value : they are valuable because or to the extent that they produce pleasure but lack value otherwise that for an object to be beautiful is for it to cause pleasure or that the experience of beauty is always accompanied by pleasure we take pleasure from many things that are not beautiful , which is why beauty is usually defined in terms of a special type of pleasure : aesthetic or disinterested pleasure the clinical condition of being unable to experience pleasure from usually enjoyable activities is called anhedonia it asserts that being motivated by pleasure is self-defeating in the sense that it leads to less actual pleasure than following other motives

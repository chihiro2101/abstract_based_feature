'' pleasure '' refers to experience that feels good , that involves the enjoyment of something pleasure contrasts with pain or suffering , which are forms of feeling bad this assumption is important for the possibility of comparing and aggregating the degrees of pleasure of different experiences , for example , in order to perform the utilitarian calculus the concept of pleasure is similar but not identical to the concepts of well-being and of happiness pleasure refers to a certain type of experience while well-being is about what is good for a person but there may be other things besides or instead of pleasure that constitute well-being , like health , virtue , knowledge or the fulfillment of desires on some conceptions , happiness is identified with '' the individual â€™ s balance of pleasant over unpleasant experience '' life satisfaction theories , on the other hand , hold that happiness involves having the right attitude towards one 's life as a whole pleasure may have a role to play in this attitude , but it is not identical to happiness pleasure is closely related to value , desire , motivation and right action there is broad agreement that pleasure is valuable in some sense psychological hedonism is the thesis that all our actions aim at increasing pleasure and avoiding pain freud 's pleasure principle ties pleasure to motivation and action by holding that there is a strong psychological tendency to seek pleasure and to avoid pain classical utilitarianism connects pleasure to ethics in stating that whether an action is right depends on the pleasure it produces : it should maximize the sum-total of pleasure many pleasurable experiences are associated with satisfying basic biological drives , such as eating , exercise , hygiene , sleep , and sex quality theories hold that pleasure is a quality of pleasurable experiences themselves while attitude theories state that pleasure is in some sense external to the experience since it depends on the subject 's attitude to the experience one traditionally important quality-theory closely follows this association by holding that pleasure is a sensation so a pleasurable experience of eating chocolate involves a sensation of the taste of chocolate together with a pleasure-sensation but considering the pleasure of seeing a beautiful sunset , there seems to be no specific region in the body at which we experience this pleasure as an aspect , pleasure is dependent on the mental phenomenon it qualifies , it can not be present on its own one objection to both the sensation theory and the felt-quality theory is that there is no one quality shared by all pleasure-experiences the force of this objection comes from the intuition that the variety of pleasure-experiences is just too wide to point out one quality shared by all , for example , the quality shared by enjoying a milkshake and enjoying a chess game one way for quality theorists to respond to this objection is by pointing out that the hedonic tone of pleasure-experiences is not a regular quality but a higher-order quality on this account , pleasure is linked to experiences that fulfill a desire had by the experiencer one important argument against this version is that while it is often the case that we desire something first and then enjoy it , this can not always be the case another argument against desire theories is that desire and pleasure can come apart : we can have a desire for things that are not enjoyable and we can enjoy things without desiring to do so one way to combine these elements is to hold that pleasure consists in being disposed to desire an experience in virtue of the qualities of this experience some of the problems of the regular desire theory can be avoided this way since the disposition does not need to be realized for there to be pleasure , thereby taking into account that desire and pleasure can come apart pleasure is related not just to how we actually act , but also to how we ought to act , which belongs to the field of ethics within this family , classical utilitarianism draws the closest connection between pleasure and right action by holding that the agent should maximize the sum-total of everyone 's happiness this position entails that things other than pleasure , like knowledge , virtue or money , only have instrumental value : they are valuable because or to the extent that they produce pleasure but lack value otherwise pleasure is often regarded as a bipolar construct , meaning that the two ends of the spectrum from pleasure to suffering are mutually exclusive as such , pleasure is an affect and not an emotion , as it forms one component of several different emotions sigmund freud formulated his pleasure principle in order to account for the effect pleasure has on our behavior

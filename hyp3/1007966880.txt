shenandoah was originally designated fa-1 , for '' fleet airship number one '' but this was changed to zr-1 shenandoah was assembled at naval air station lakehurst , new jersey in 1922–1923 , in hangar no nas lakehurst had served as a base for navy blimps for some time , but shenandoah was the first rigid airship to join the fleet whether the changes introduced into the original design of l-49 played a part in shenandoahs later breakup is a matter of debate the gas cells were made of goldbeater 's skins , one of the most gas-impervious materials known at the time named for their use in beating and separating gold leaf , goldbeater 's skins were made from the outer membrane of the large intestines of cattle 63 each gas cell had a spring-loaded relief valve and manual valves operated from the control car as the first rigid airship to use helium rather than hydrogen , shenandoah had a significant edge in safety over previous airships helium was relatively scarce at the time , and shenandoah used much of the world 's reserves just to fill its volume —the next rigid airship to enter navy service , originally built by luftschiffbau zeppelin in germany as lz 126—was at first filled with the helium from shenandoah until more could be procured denby named the airship after her home in the shenandoah valley of virginia , and the word '' shenandoah '' was then believed to be a native american word meaning '' daughter of stars '' on 27 october , shenandoah celebrated navy day with a flight down the shenandoah valley and returned to lakehurst that night by way of washington and baltimore , where crowds gathered to see the new airship in the beams of searchlights moffett , chief of the bureau of aeronautics and staunch advocate of the airship , was discussing the possibility of using shenandoah to explore the arctic he felt such a program would produce valuable weather data as well as experience in cold-weather operations with its endurance and ability to fly at low speeds , the airship was thought to be well suited to such work technical difficulties and lack of support facilities in the fleet forced it to depart the operating area ahead of time to return to lakehurst although this marred the exercises as far as airship reconnaissance went , it emphasized the need for advanced bases and maintenance ships if lighter-than-air craft were to take any part in operations of this kind in july 1924 , the oiler put in at norfolk naval shipyard for extensive modifications to become the navy 's first airship tender shenandoah engaged in a short series of mooring experiments with patoka to determine the practicality of mobile fleet support of scouting airships 1925 began with nearly six months of maintenance and ground test work shenandoah did not take to the air until 26 june , when it began preparations for summer operations with the fleet the shenandoah crash sites are located in the hillsides of noble county lansdowne 's annapolis class ring had also been thought to have been taken from his hand by looters as it was not then recovered-it was found by chance in june 1937 near the crash site 1 shenandoah airship disaster www.roadsideamerica.com the noble local school district—which serves the area where shenandoah crashed—has named its elementary , junior high , and high school after shenandoah '' a truck stop located about away in old washington , ohio was named shenandoah plaza after the airship and the wreck of the shenandoah which was written by vernon dalhart and carson robison , '' seeing america from the 'shenandoah ' '' , national geographic , january 1925 ill wind : the naval airship shenandoah in noble county , ohio '' america 's airship disaster '' : the crash of the uss shenandoah howard , ohio : little river publishing

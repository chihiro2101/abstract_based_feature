shenandoah was originally designated fa-1 , for '' fleet airship number one '' but this was changed to zr-1 shenandoah was assembled at naval air station lakehurst , new jersey in 1922–1923 , in hangar no 1 , the only hangar large enough to accommodate the ship ; its parts were fabricated at the naval aircraft factory in philadelphia nas lakehurst had served as a base for navy blimps for some time , but shenandoah was the first rigid airship to join the fleet hayward ( 1978 ) p united states navy aircraft since 1912 the design was found insufficient and a number of the features of newer zeppelins were used , as well as some structural improvements whether the changes introduced into the original design of l-49 played a part in shenandoahs later breakup is a matter of debate named for their use in beating and separating gold leaf , goldbeater 's skins were made from the outer membrane of the large intestines of cattle as the first rigid airship to use helium rather than hydrogen , shenandoah had a significant edge in safety over previous airships helium was relatively scarce at the time , and shenandoah used much of the world 's reserves just to fill its volume —the next rigid airship to enter navy service , originally built by luftschiffbau zeppelin in germany as lz 126—was at first filled with the helium from shenandoah until more could be procured the first frame of shenandoah was erected by 24 june 1922 ; on 20 august 1923 , the completed airship was floated free of the ground shenandoah first flew on 4 september 1923 edwin denby , wife of the secretary of the navy , and commissioned on the same day with commander frank r denby named the airship after her home in the shenandoah valley of virginia , and the word '' shenandoah '' was then believed to be a native american word meaning '' daughter of stars '' 21 shenandoah was designed for fleet reconnaissance work of the type carried out by german naval airships in world war i with its endurance and ability to fly at low speeds , the airship was thought to be well suited to such work zeppelin test pilot anton heinen rode out the storm for several hours and landed safely while the airship was being blown backwards shenandoah succeeded in discovering the '' enemy '' force as planned but lost contact with it in foul weather during october 1924 , shenandoah flew from lakehurst to california and on to washington state to test newly erected mooring masts on 2 september 1925 , shenandoah departed lakehurst on a promotional flight to the midwest that would include flyovers of 40 cities and visits to state fairs fourteen crew members , including commander zachary lansdowne , were killed retrieved 5 august 2012 two schools of thought developed about the cause of the crash his pleas for a cancellation of the flight only caused a temporary postponement : his superiors were keen to publicize airship technology and justify the huge cost of the airship to the taxpayers shenandoah airship disaster www.roadsideamerica.com the noble local school district—which serves the area where shenandoah crashed—has named its elementary , junior high , and high school after shenandoah '' america 's airship disaster '' : the crash of the uss shenandoah howard , ohio : little river publishing , vadm usn '' comment and discussion '' united states naval institute proceedings august 1978 '' the shenandoah adventure '' a brief official account of the accident flight 21 february 1924 , pp

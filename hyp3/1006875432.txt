progress is of much the same size and shape as soyuz this carries the supplies for the crew such as scientific equipment , clothes , prepackaged and fresh food , and letters from home the propulsion module , at the rear of the spacecraft , remained unchanged from the soyuz and contains the orientation engines used for the automatic docking there were 42 spacecraft built using the initial progress design , the last one being launched in may 1990 progress 1 launched on 20 january 1978 aboard the same rocket used to launch the soyuz this first version of progress had a mass of 7,020 kg and carried 2,300 kg of cargo , or 30 % of its launch mass launch mass : 7,020â€“7,249 kg mass of cargo : ~2,300 kg ( before progress-24 ) ~2,500 kg ( from progress-24 ) length : 7.94 m diameter of cargo modules : 2.2 m maximum diameter : 2.72 m volume of cargo compartment : 6.6 m 3 the first 43 flights all went to mir ; following mir 's re-entry , progress was used as the resupply vehicle for the international space station as of december 2020 , there have been over 80 flights ( over different configurations ) to the iss and more are scheduled the progress m is essentially the same spacecraft as the progress , but it features improvements based on the soyuz-t and soyuz-tm designs the first spacecraft of this series was progress m-01m progress m1 is another variant , capable of carrying more propellant ( but less total cargo ) to the space station progress spacecraft are used to resupply the international space station ( iss ) as of 2021 on 9 july 2018 , progress ms-09 broke a previous record by reaching the iss in 3 hours and 48 minutes , carrying about 2450 kg of cargo and supplies atvs can carry up to 8.85 tonnes of cargo into space , roughly three times as much as the progress , and were launched annually by ariane 5 rockets from 2011-2014 as part of esa contribution to iss upkeep

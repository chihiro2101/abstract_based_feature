progress is of much the same size and shape as soyuz it consists of three modules : a pressurized forward module the reentry module of the soyuz was replaced with an unpressurized propellant and refueling compartment with ducting along the outside of the spacecraft the propulsion module , at the rear of the spacecraft , remained unchanged from the soyuz and contains the orientation engines used for the automatic docking there were 42 spacecraft built using the initial progress design , the last one being launched in may 1990 they began work on the design in mid-1973 , assigning progress the grau index 11f615a15 progress 1 launched on 20 january 1978 aboard the same rocket used to launch the soyuz this first version of progress had a mass of 7,020 kg and carried 2,300 kg of cargo , or 30 % of its launch mass the first 43 flights all went to mir ; following mir 's re-entry , progress was used as the resupply vehicle for the international space station progress m can also dock to the forward port of the station and still transfer fuel progress m1 ( 2000-2004 ) progress m1 is another variant , capable of carrying more propellant ( but less total cargo ) to the space station mass : 7,150 kg capacity cargo : 2,230 kg capacity dry cargo : 1,800 kg capacity propellant : 1,950 kg progress spacecraft are used to resupply the international space station ( iss ) as of 2021 it delivered food , fuel and supplies , including 705 kg of propellant , 50 kg of oxygen and air , 420 kg of water

progress is of much the same size and shape as soyuz the reentry module of the soyuz was replaced with an unpressurized propellant and refueling compartment with ducting along the outside of the spacecraft the propulsion module , at the rear of the spacecraft , remained unchanged from the soyuz and contains the orientation engines used for the automatic docking reduction in mass was possible because the progress was designed to be uncrewed and disposable the spacecraft also has no ability to split into separate modules there were 42 spacecraft built using the initial progress design , the last one being launched in may 1990 the design was complete by february 1974 , and the first production model was ready for launch in november 1977 progress 1 launched on 20 january 1978 aboard the same rocket used to launch the soyuz it still featured the same launch shroud as the soyuz , though this was purely for aerodynamic purposes as the launch escape system had been deactivated this first version of progress had a mass of 7,020 kg and carried 2,300 kg of cargo , or 30 % of its launch mass the first 43 flights all went to mir ; following mir 's re-entry , progress was used as the resupply vehicle for the international space station the progress m is essentially the same spacecraft as the progress , but it features improvements based on the soyuz-t and soyuz-tm designs progress m1 ( 2000-2004 ) progress spacecraft are used to resupply the international space station ( iss ) as of 2021 progress m-67 , the final flight of a progress-m spacecraft , was launched 24 july 2009 on a soyuz-u

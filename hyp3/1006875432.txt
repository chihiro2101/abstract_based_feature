progress is of much the same size and shape as soyuz this meant that if a leak occurred , the poisonous gas would not enter the station 's atmosphere the propulsion module , at the rear of the spacecraft , remained unchanged from the soyuz and contains the orientation engines used for the automatic docking it may be used to boost the orbit of the station once docked reduction in mass was possible because the progress was designed to be uncrewed and disposable progress 1 launched on 20 january 1978 aboard the same rocket used to launch the soyuz this first version of progress had a mass of 7,020 kg and carried 2,300 kg of cargo , or 30 % of its launch mass launch mass : 7,020â€“7,249 kg mass of cargo : ~2,300 kg ( before progress-24 ) ~2,500 kg ( from progress-24 ) length : 7.94 m diameter of cargo modules : 2.2 m maximum diameter : 2.72 m volume of cargo compartment : 6.6 m 3 the upgraded progress m ( grau : 11f615a55 , manufacturer 's designation : 7k-tgm ) was first launched in august 1989 the first 43 flights all went to mir ; following mir 's re-entry , progress was used as the resupply vehicle for the international space station the progress m is essentially the same spacecraft as the progress , but it features improvements based on the soyuz-t and soyuz-tm designs it can spend up to 30 days in autonomous flight and is able to carry 100 kg more progress spacecraft are used to resupply the international space station ( iss ) as of 2021 progress m-67 , the final flight of a progress-m spacecraft , was launched 24 july 2009 on a soyuz-u it delivered food , fuel and supplies , including 705 kg of propellant , 50 kg of oxygen and air , 420 kg of water

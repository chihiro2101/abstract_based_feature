this carries the supplies for the crew such as scientific equipment , clothes , prepackaged and fresh food , and letters from home the reentry module of the soyuz was replaced with an unpressurized propellant and refueling compartment with ducting along the outside of the spacecraft the propulsion module , at the rear of the spacecraft , remained unchanged from the soyuz and contains the orientation engines used for the automatic docking a small amount of weight is saved due to the lack of automatic rescue crews system and lack of parachutes there were 42 spacecraft built using the initial progress design , the last one being launched in may 1990 the bureau in charge of designing the freighter was tskbem ( now energia ( corporation ) ) progress 1 launched on 20 january 1978 aboard the same rocket used to launch the soyuz it still featured the same launch shroud as the soyuz , though this was purely for aerodynamic purposes as the launch escape system had been deactivated this first version of progress had a mass of 7,020 kg and carried 2,300 kg of cargo , or 30 % of its launch mass launch mass : 7,020â€“7,249 kg mass of cargo : ~2,300 kg ( before progress-24 ) ~2,500 kg ( from progress-24 ) length : 7.94 m diameter of cargo modules : 2.2 m maximum diameter : 2.72 m volume of cargo compartment : 6.6 m 3 the first 43 flights all went to mir ; following mir 's re-entry , progress was used as the resupply vehicle for the international space station progress m1 ( 2000-2004 ) mass : 7,150 kg capacity cargo : 2,230 kg capacity dry cargo : 1,800 kg capacity propellant : 1,950 kg the m2 variant would have a larger service module for larger cargo or space station modules and would have been launched on a zenit rocket as the spacecraft is bigger progress spacecraft are used to resupply the international space station ( iss ) as of 2021

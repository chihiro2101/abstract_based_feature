the '' biefeld–brown effect '' was the name given to a phenomenon observed by thomas townsend brown while he was experimenting with x-ray tubes during the 1920s while he was still in high school when he applied a high voltage electrical charge to a coolidge tube that he placed on a scale , brown noticed a difference in the tubes mass depending on orientation , implying some kind of net force in 1929 , brown published an article for the popular american magazine science and invention , which detailed his work the article also mentioned the '' gravitator , '' an invention by brown which produced motion without the use of electromagnetism , gears , propellers , or wheels , but instead using the principles of what he called '' electro-gravitation alt url at some point this effect also gained the moniker '' biefeld–brown effect '' , probably coined by brown to claim denison university professor of physics and astronomy paul alfred biefeld as his mentor and co-experimenter brown attended denison for a year before he dropped out and records of him even having an association with biefeld are sketchy at best brown filed another patent in 1960 that detailed the physics of the biefeld–brown effect , making the following claims : there is a negative correlation between the distance between the plates of the capacitor and the strength of the effect , where the shorter the distance , the greater the effect there is a positive correlation between the dielectric strength of the material between the electrodes and the strength of the effect , where the higher the strength , the greater the effect there is a positive correlation between the area of the conductors and the strength of the effect , where the greater the area , the greater the effect there is a positive correlation between the voltage difference between the capacitor plates and the strength of the effect , where the greater the voltage , the greater the effect in 1965 , brown filed a patent that claimed that a net force on the asymmetric capacitor can exist even in a vacuum having proposed that the biefeld–brown effect could theoretically be explained using ion drift instead of ion wind due to how the former involves collisions instead of ballistic trajectories , they noted these were only '' scaling estimates '' and more experimental and theoretical work was needed around ten years later , researchers from the technical university of liberec conducted experiments on the biefeld–brown effect that supported one of arl 's hypotheses that assigned ion drift as the most likely source of the generated force

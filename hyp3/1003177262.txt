the '' biefeld–brown effect '' was the name given to a phenomenon observed by thomas townsend brown while he was experimenting with x-ray tubes during the 1920s while he was still in high school this discovery caused him to assume that he had somehow influenced gravity electronically and led him to design a propulsion system based on this phenomenon on 15 april 1927 , he applied for a patent , entitled '' method of producing force or motion , '' that described his invention as an electrical-based method that could control gravity to produce linear force or motion alt url at some point this effect also gained the moniker '' biefeld–brown effect '' , probably coined by brown to claim denison university professor of physics and astronomy paul alfred biefeld as his mentor and co-experimenter brown filed another patent in 1960 that detailed the physics of the biefeld–brown effect , making the following claims : there is a negative correlation between the distance between the plates of the capacitor and the strength of the effect , where the shorter the distance , the greater the effect there is a positive correlation between the dielectric strength of the material between the electrodes and the strength of the effect , where the higher the strength , the greater the effect there is a positive correlation between the area of the conductors and the strength of the effect , where the greater the area , the greater the effect there is a positive correlation between the voltage difference between the capacitor plates and the strength of the effect , where the greater the voltage , the greater the effect there is a positive correlation between the mass of the dielectric material and the strength of the effect , where the greater the mass , the greater the effect in 1965 , brown filed a patent that claimed that a net force on the asymmetric capacitor can exist even in a vacuum usually , two electrodes are used with a high voltage between them , ranging from a few kilovolts and up to megavolt levels , where one electrode is small or sharp , and the other larger and smoother charles berlitz devoted an entire chapter of his book the philadelphia experiment to a retelling of brown 's early work with the effect , implying he had discovered a new electrogravity effect and that it was being used by ufos around ten years later , researchers from the technical university of liberec conducted experiments on the biefeld–brown effect that supported one of arl 's hypotheses that assigned ion drift as the most likely source of the generated force

archaeological findings show people settled in the middle alpine region , later to be called tyrol , when the glaciers retreated and flora and fauna revived , after the last ice age ended around 12,000 bc stone artefacts recovered there were dated to the 8th millennia bc there is ample evidence of settlements in the main and side valleys during the early and middle bronze age ( 1800-1300 bc ) in the bronze and iron ages the region was home to a series of autochthonous cultures occupying roughly the area of the later county of tyrol the most prominent are the late bronze age laugen-melaun culture and iron age fritzens-sanzeno culture cultures the laugen-melaun culture , named after two important archaeological sites near the modern-day town of brixen in south tyrol , originated in the 14th century bc , in the area of today 's south tyrol and trentino it soon spread over the central area of the southern alps , encompassing south and east tyrol , trentino north of rovereto and the lower engadine ; the northern part of tyrol came under the influence of the urnfield culture around 500 bc , the fritzens-sanzeno culture , also known as culture of the raeti , after the goddess raetia who according to roman authors was the main deity of the people inhabiting the region , succeeded both the laugen-melaun culture of the southern and the urnfield culture of the northern part of tyrol in 15 bc , the region was conquered by the romans , and its northern and eastern part incorporated into the roman empire as the provinces of raetia and noricum respectively the part south of and including the area around the modern day cities of bolzano and merano became part of italia 's regio x after the conquest of italy by the goths , tyrol became part of the ostrogothic kingdom from the 5th to the 6th century the northern part of tyrol came under the influence of the bavarii , while the west probably was part of alamannia thus , tyrol was divided among three spheres of influence that met in the approximate area of today 's bolzano consequently , tyrol came to be of great importance as a bridgehead to italy , which was re-affirmed during the italian campaign of otto i since the bishops were nominated directly by the emperor and their office was not hereditary , putting the area under their control was intended to secure it to the emperors later counts would hold much of their territory directly from the holy roman emperor at the end of count meinhard ii 's rule ( 1259â€“1295 ) the '' county and reign of tyrol '' had established itself firmly in the '' land on the adige and inn '' , as the region was then called this happened on the expense of the power of the bishops , who were nominally the feudal lords of the counts of tyrol the acquisition of tyrol was strategically important to the habsburg dynasty , since it allowed it to connect their austrian territories with their territorial possessions in the area of today 's switzerland from that time , tyrol was ruled by various lines of the habsburg family , who bore the title count the battle of sempach in 1386 , in which duke leopold iii of austria was defeated by the old swiss confederacy had important repercussions on tyrol , and was the first of a series of military conflicts between the county and its neighbours in 1423 , during the rule of frederick iv '' empty pockets '' , the first meeting that could be called a tyrolean parliament met tyrol : impressions of tyrol tyrol : impressions of tyrol following defeat by napoleon in 1805 , austria was forced to cede tyrol to the kingdom of bavaria in the peace of pressburg tyrol , as a part of bavaria , became a member of the confederation of the rhine in 1806 when in 1808 a new constitution for the kingdom of bavaria was introduced , tyrol was integrated into south bavaria , and divided into three districts , losing its special status in the kingdom in 1806 , delegates from tyrol travelled to vienna to make plans for an insurrection of the tyrolean people following the defeat of the austrian army on the bavarian front , napoleon dispatched charles lefebvre to tyrol , and by may 19 innsbruck had been seized again and the rebellion seemed quelled andreas hofer , who in the meantime had advanced to supreme commander of the insurgents , became regent of tyrol in the name of the emperor tyrol remained divided under bavarian and italian authority for another four years , before its reunification and return to austria following the decisions at the congress of vienna in 1814 austria did not have the means to guarantee the orderly retreat of its own army or the organized return of italian war prisoners the treaty of saint-germain-en-laye ( 1919 ) ruled that , according to the treaty of london , the southern part of tyrol had to be ceded to the kingdom of italy 19 , table 11 the northern part of tyrol was retained by the first austrian republic

archaeological findings show people settled in the middle alpine region , later to be called tyrol , when the glaciers retreated and flora and fauna revived , after the last ice age ended around 12,000 bc in the valley bottoms near bolzano , brixen and salorno , mesolithic hunters resting places were discovered in the bronze and iron ages the region was home to a series of autochthonous cultures occupying roughly the area of the later county of tyrol the most prominent are the late bronze age laugen-melaun culture and iron age fritzens-sanzeno culture cultures the laugen-melaun culture , named after two important archaeological sites near the modern-day town of brixen in south tyrol , originated in the 14th century bc , in the area of today 's south tyrol and trentino it soon spread over the central area of the southern alps , encompassing south and east tyrol , trentino north of rovereto and the lower engadine ; the northern part of tyrol came under the influence of the urnfield culture distinguishing factors include its characteristic richly decorated pottery , while the metal-working is strongly influenced by adjacent cultures rich burial objects show that from the 13th to 11th century bc , the laugen-melaun culture ( laugen-melaun a ) flourished , due to the mining of copper , the source material for the alloy bronze around 500 bc , the fritzens-sanzeno culture , also known as culture of the raeti , after the goddess raetia who according to roman authors was the main deity of the people inhabiting the region , succeeded both the laugen-melaun culture of the southern and the urnfield culture of the northern part of tyrol in 15 bc , the region was conquered by the romans , and its northern and eastern part incorporated into the roman empire as the provinces of raetia and noricum respectively the part south of and including the area around the modern day cities of bolzano and merano became part of italia 's regio x as in the rest of europe , the roman era left deep impressions on the culture and language , with the rhaeto-romance languages after the conquest of italy by the goths , tyrol became part of the ostrogothic kingdom from the 5th to the 6th century after the fall of the ostrogothic kingdom in 553 , the germanic tribe of the lombards invaded italy and founded the lombard kingdom of italy , which no longer included all of tyrol , only its southern part thus , tyrol was divided among three spheres of influence that met in the approximate area of today 's bolzano in the years 1007 and 1027 the emperors of the holy roman empire granted the counties of trento , bolzano and vinschgau to the bishopric of trent since the bishops were nominated directly by the emperor and their office was not hereditary , putting the area under their control was intended to secure it to the emperors the meinhardinger family , originating in gorizia , held not only tyrol and gorizia , but for a time the duchy of carinthia at the end of count meinhard ii 's rule ( 1259–1295 ) the '' county and reign of tyrol '' had established itself firmly in the '' land on the adige and inn '' , as the region was then called this happened on the expense of the power of the bishops , who were nominally the feudal lords of the counts of tyrol margarete maultasch decided to bequeath tyrol to duke rudolph iv of the house of habsburg , probably pressed by the aristocracy , an act which caused a conflict between meinhard 's uncle stephen ii , who forged an alliance with the powerful lord of milan bernabò visconti to invade tyrol , and the house of habsburg the red eagle in tyrol 's coat of arms derives from the red brandenburg eagle , dating from the time when louis v and margarete maultasch governed brandenburg as well the acquisition of tyrol was strategically important to the habsburg dynasty , since it allowed it to connect their austrian territories with their territorial possessions in the area of today 's switzerland tyrol repeatedly became involved in the political and military conflicts of the habsburgs with milan , venice , switzerland and the county of görz , as well as bavaria and swabia the battle of sempach in 1386 , in which duke leopold iii of austria was defeated by the old swiss confederacy had important repercussions on tyrol , and was the first of a series of military conflicts between the county and its neighbours three years after the succession , maximilian became holy roman emperor , making his preferred residence , innsbruck , the imperial capitol maximilian added kufstein , rattenberg and kitzbühel to tyrol , and when he inherited the puster valley and east tyrol the borders of tyrol were set , with the exception of the 1817 addition of the ziller valley chizzali following defeat by napoleon in 1805 , austria was forced to cede tyrol to the kingdom of bavaria in the peace of pressburg tyrol , as a part of bavaria , became a member of the confederation of the rhine in 1806 when in 1808 a new constitution for the kingdom of bavaria was introduced , tyrol was integrated into south bavaria , and divided into three districts , losing its special status in the kingdom furthermore , tyroleans were now subjected to the bavarian conscription levies , and faced the prospect of having to fight against austrian troops this inconclusive attack weakened the eastern front , which enabled the russian army to overrun austrian positions in galicia and threaten the heart of the habsburg empire rothenberg 1977 , p to secure access to the inn valley , crucial for an advance into southern germany , innsbruck , capital of tyrol , and the village landeck were occupied as well ) : '' south tyrol in figures 2008 '' , provincial statistics institute of the autonomous province of south tyrol , bozen/bolzano 2007 , p

the 13th floor elevators emerged on the local austin music scene in december 1965 , where they were contemporary to bands such as the wig and the babycakes and later followed by shiva 's headband and the conqueroo the band formed when roky erickson left his group the spades , and joined up with stacy sutherland , benny thurman , and john ike walton who had been playing texas coastal towns as the lingsmen tommy hall was instrumental in bringing the band members together , and joined the group as lyricist and electric jug player the band 's name developed from a suggestion by drummer john ike walton to use the name '' elevators '' clementine hall added '' 13th floor '' in addition to an awareness that a number of tall buildings in the us lack a designated 13th floor , it was noted that the letter '' m '' ( for marijuana ) is the thirteenth letter of the alphabet in early january 1966 , producer gordon bynum brought the band to houston to record two songs to release as a single on his newly formed contact record label the songs were erickson 's '' you 're gon na miss me '' , and hall-sutherland 's '' tried to hide '' the international artists record label in houston , also home to contemporary texas underground groups such as red krayola and bubble puppy , signed the elevators to a record contract and released the album the psychedelic sounds of the 13th floor elevators in november 1966 , which became popular among the burgeoning counterculture tommy hall 's sleeve-notes for the album , which advocated chemical agents ( such as lsd ) as a gateway to a higher , 'non-aristotelian ' state of consciousness , has also contributed to the album 's cult status on returning to texas in early 1967 , they released a second single , '' levitation '' , and continued to play live in austin , houston and other texas cities despite the lengthy studio work and resources utilized , easter everywhere was not the success the band and international artists had hoped for record label paperwork indicate that the band 's debut album sold upwards of 40,000 copies during its original run , while easter everywhere may have sold around 10,000 copies chris gerniottis , ex-lead singer of zakary thaks has spoken repeatedly of how the elevators stood apart from all the other bands on the regional scene , and they continued to influence these bands during the late 1960s following the local popularity of the track '' slip inside this house '' , an edited version was released as a single in early 1968 and was played frequently on houston radio meanwhile , the elevators had lost their bass player dan galindo , who went on to another international artists band , the rubiayat however , because of an unstable member line-up and the increasingly erratic behavior of the psychedelicized tommy hall and mentally fragile roky erickson , little of value came out of these sessions international artists put out a live lp in august 1968 , which was composed of old demo tapes and outtakes dating back to 1966 for the most part , with fake applause and audience noise added around this time , the original 13th floor elevators disbanded , as the nucleus of erickson-hall-sutherland had been reduced to guitarist stacy sutherland only the final 13th floor elevators record released by international artists was a reissue of the '' you 're gon na miss me '' single in mid-1969 in 1969 , facing a felony marijuana possession charge , roky erickson chose to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital rather than serve a prison term , thus signaling the end of the band 's career the rhythm section went through several changes , with drummer john ike walton and bass player ronnie leatherman being replaced in july 1967 walton and leatherman left the band ; in their stead were new recruits danny thomas ( drums , piano ) and dan galindo ( bass ) which completed the classic elevators line-up hall remained the band 's primary lyricist and philosopher , with sutherland and erickson both contributing lyrics as well as writing music , and , later , working with danny thomas to arrange the group 's more challenging music at that point the elevators had already dissolved , although local promoters , along with their record label , international artists , made some attempts to keep the band 's name alive on may 10 , 2015 members of the band ( erickson , hall , leatherman , and walton ) joined for a 50th anniversary reunion concert appearance at the psychedelic music festival austin psych fest ( levitation 2015 ) noted hollywood actor johnny depp praised the elevators in a 2005 interview with esquire magazine : '' roky erickson and the 13th floor elevators , a band out of texas the best of 13th floor elevators ( 1995 ) best of the 13th floor elevators : manicure your mind ( 1997 , 1998 ) the 13th floor elevators : his eye is on the pyramid ( 1999 ) going up : the very best of the 13th floor elevators ( 2004 ) psychedelic circus ( live recordings ) ( 2009 ) headstone : the contact sessions ( charly records ) ( 2010 ) eye mind : the saga of roky erickson and the 13th floor elevators by paul drummond , foreword by julian cope ( process media , december 2007 ) ,

the 13th floor elevators emerged on the local austin music scene in december 1965 , where they were contemporary to bands such as the wig and the babycakes and later followed by shiva 's headband and the conqueroo the band formed when roky erickson left his group the spades , and joined up with stacy sutherland , benny thurman , and john ike walton who had been playing texas coastal towns as the lingsmen tommy hall was instrumental in bringing the band members together , and joined the group as lyricist and electric jug player the band 's name developed from a suggestion by drummer john ike walton to use the name '' elevators '' in addition to an awareness that a number of tall buildings in the us lack a designated 13th floor , it was noted that the letter '' m '' ( for marijuana ) is the thirteenth letter of the alphabet in early january 1966 , producer gordon bynum brought the band to houston to record two songs to release as a single on his newly formed contact record label some months later , the international artists label picked it up and re-released it during their california tour , the band shared bills with quicksilver messenger service , the great society ( featuring grace slick ) , and moby grape on returning to texas in early 1967 , they released a second single , '' levitation '' , and continued to play live in austin , houston and other texas cities in november 1967 , the band released a second album , easter everywhere despite the lengthy studio work and resources utilized , easter everywhere was not the success the band and international artists had hoped for lacking a hit single and released too late in the year , it sold out its original run , but was never reprinted , suggesting somewhat disappointing sales erickson insisted that he join the elevators on bass , even though he was a guitarist who had never played bass before while the band were unable to repeat their national success , they were still a powerful presence on the texas rock music scene chris gerniottis , ex-lead singer of zakary thaks has spoken repeatedly of how the elevators stood apart from all the other bands on the regional scene , and they continued to influence these bands during the late 1960s meanwhile , the elevators had lost their bass player dan galindo , who went on to another international artists band , the rubiayat duke davis briefly replaced galindo , before the band 's earlier bassist ronnie leatherman returned in the summer of 1968 around this time , the original 13th floor elevators disbanded , as the nucleus of erickson-hall-sutherland had been reduced to guitarist stacy sutherland only these final sessions consisted of sutherland on guitar , ronnie leatherman on bass , and danny thomas on drums the final 13th floor elevators record released by international artists was a reissue of the '' you 're gon na miss me '' single in mid-1969 drug overuse and related legal problems left the band in a state of constant turmoil , which took its toll , both physically and mentally , on the members in contrast to traditional musical jug technique , hall did not blow into the jug to produce a tuba-like sound when playing live , he held the microphone up to the mouth of the jug , but when recording the easter everywhere album , the recording engineer placed a microphone inside the jug to enhance the sound at tommy hall 's urging , the band often played their live shows and recorded their albums while under the influence of lsd , and built their lifestyle and music around the psychedelic experience the original 13th floor elevators line-up was built around singer/guitarist roky erickson , electric jug player tommy hall , and guitarist stacy sutherland , all of whom claimed erickson 's or the elevators ' influenceâ€”was released noted hollywood actor johnny depp praised the elevators in a 2005 interview with esquire magazine : '' roky erickson and the 13th floor elevators , a band out of texas '' texas recording artist ray wylie hubbard sang '' no band was cooler than the 13th floor elevators '' in his song '' screw you , we 're from texas '' from his 2003 album growl music of austin list of psychedelic rock artists

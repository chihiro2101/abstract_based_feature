send a request to the librarian , who , if he thought the request justified , would bring it to the scriptorium third day , vespers , paragraphs 64-68 the letters of adjacent rooms , read together , give the name of a region ( e.g the entrance to the library is in the central room of the east tower , which is connected to the scriptorium by a staircase much attention has been paid to the mystery the book 's title refers to in one version of the story , when he had finished writing the novel , eco hurriedly suggested some ten names for it and asked a few of his friends to choose one in this novel , the lost '' rose '' could be seen as aristotle 's book on comedy ( now forever lost ) , the exquisite library now destroyed , or the beautiful peasant girl now dead a number of the characters

the species inia geoffrensis was described by henri marie ducrotay de blainville in 1817 originally , the amazon river dolphin belonged to the superfamily platanistoidea , which constituted all river dolphins , making them paraphyletic group today , however , the amazon river dolphin has been reclassified into the superfamily inioidea there is ongoing debate about the classification of species and subspecies , with large international bodies being in disagreement the iucn recognizes three subspecies : i geoffrensis ( amazon river dolphin ) , i boliviensis ( bolivian river dolphin ) , and i humboldtiana ( orinoco river dolphin ) ; while the committee on taxonomy of the society for marine mammalogy only recognizes the first two of these therefore , the bolivian river dolphin is currently recognized as a subspecies in addition , a 2014 study identifies a third species in the araguaia-tocantins basin , but this designation is not recognized by any international organization and the committee on taxonomy of the society for marine mammalogy suggests this analysis is not persuasive inia geoffrensis boliviensis has populations in the upper reaches of the madeira river , upstream of the rapids of teotonio , in bolivia inia geoffrensis humboldtiana are located in the orinoco river basin , including the apure and meta rivers this subspecies is not recognized by the committee on taxonomy of the society for marine mammalogy , or the iucn the amazon river dolphin is the largest river dolphin it has very evident sexual dimorphism , with males measuring and weighing between 16 % and 55 % more than females , making it unique among cetaceans , where females are generally larger than males the texture of the body is robust and strong but flexible the length of its fins allows the animal to perform a circular movement , allowing for exceptional maneuverability to swim through the flooded forest but decreasing its speed males tend to be pinker than females due to more frequent trauma from intra-species aggression the color of adults varies between solid and mottled pink and in some adults the dorsal surface is darker the skull of the species is slightly asymmetrical compared to the other toothed whales it has a melon on the head , the shape of which can be modified by muscular control when used for biosonar the amazon river dolphin are commonly seen singly or in twos , but may also occur in pods that rarely contain more than eight individuals pods as large as 37 individuals have been seen in the amazon , but average is three in the orinoco , the largest observed groups number 30 , but average is just above five during prey time , as many as 35 pink dolphins work together to obtain their prey the largest congregations are seen in areas with abundant food , and at the mouths of rivers there is significant segregation during the rainy season , with males occupying the river channels , while females and their offspring are located in flooded areas however , in the dry season , there is no such separation they are harder to train than most other species of dolphin '' before determining that the species had an evident sexual dimorphism , it was postulated that the river dolphins were monogamous the male takes the initiative by nibbling the fins of the female , but reacts aggressively if the female is not receptive the relatively long duration of breastfeeding and parenting suggests a strong mother-child bond the diet of the amazon river dolphin is the most diverse of the toothed whales the dolphin 's dentition allows it to access shells of river turtles and freshwater crabs however , echolocation in shallow waters and flooded forests may result in many echoes to keep track of these observations suggest that the amazon river dolphin is found in higher density than any other cetacean the amazon river dolphin has historically been kept in dolphinariums legend also states that if a person makes eye contact with an amazon river dolphin , he or she will have lifelong nightmares omacha foundationâ€”a non-government and non-profit organization created to study , research and protect river dolphins and other fauna and aquatic ecosystems in colombia convention on migratory species page on the amazon dolphin

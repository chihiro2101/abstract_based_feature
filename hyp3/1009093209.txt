the species inia geoffrensis was described by henri marie ducrotay de blainville in 1817 originally , the amazon river dolphin belonged to the superfamily platanistoidea , which constituted all river dolphins , making them paraphyletic group today , however , the amazon river dolphin has been reclassified into the superfamily inioidea there is ongoing debate about the classification of species and subspecies , with large international bodies being in disagreement geoffrensis ( amazon river dolphin ) , i boliviensis ( bolivian river dolphin ) , and i humboldtiana ( orinoco river dolphin ) ; while the committee on taxonomy of the society for marine mammalogy only recognizes the first two of these therefore , the bolivian river dolphin is currently recognized as a subspecies inia geoffrensis boliviensis has populations in the upper reaches of the madeira river , upstream of the rapids of teotonio , in bolivia inia geoffrensis humboldtiana are located in the orinoco river basin , including the apure and meta rivers this subspecies is restricted , at least during the dry season , to the waterfalls of rio negro rapids in the orinoco between samariapo and puerto ayacucho , and the casiquiare canal the amazon river dolphin is the largest river dolphin it has very evident sexual dimorphism , with males measuring and weighing between 16 % and 55 % more than females , making it unique among cetaceans , where females are generally larger than males the flukes are broad and triangular , and the dorsal fin , which is keel-shaped , is short in height but very long , extending from the middle of the body to the caudal region the length of its fins allows the animal to perform a circular movement , allowing for exceptional maneuverability to swim through the flooded forest but decreasing its speed newborns and the young have a dark grey tint , which in adolescence transforms into light grey , and in adults turns pink as a result of repeated abrasion of the skin surface the color of adults varies between solid and mottled pink and in some adults the dorsal surface is darker it is believed that the difference in color depends on the temperature , water transparency , and geographical location it has a long , thin snout , with 25 to 28 pairs of long and slender teeth to each side of both jaws dentition is heterodont , meaning that the teeth differ in shape and length , with differing functions for both grabbing and crushing prey despite small eyes , the species seems to have good eyesight in and out of the water life expectancy of the amazon river dolphin in the wild is unknown , but in captivity , the longevity of healthy individuals has been recorded at between 10 and 30 years during prey time , as many as 35 pink dolphins work together to obtain their prey typically , social bonds occur between mother and child , but may also been seen in heterogeneous groups or bachelor groups the largest congregations are seen in areas with abundant food , and at the mouths of rivers there is significant segregation during the rainy season , with males occupying the river channels , while females and their offspring are located in flooded areas captive studies have shown that the amazon river dolphin is less shy than the bottlenose dolphin , but also less sociable the behavior is '' triggered by an unusually large number of adult males and/or adult females in a group , or perhaps it attracts such into the group a plausible explanation of the results is that object-carrying is aimed at females and is stimulated by the number of females in the group , while aggression is aimed at other adult males and is stimulated by object-carrying in the group '' before determining that the species had an evident sexual dimorphism , it was postulated that the river dolphins were monogamous they also commonly have numerous secondary teeth-raking scars this suggests fierce competition for access to females , with a polygynous mating system , though polyandry and promiscuity can not be excluded a high frequency of copulations in a couple was observed ; they used three different positions : contacting the womb at right angles , lying head to head , or head to tail gestation is estimated to be around eleven months and captive births take 4 to 5 hours the diet of the amazon river dolphin is the most diverse of the toothed whales they are also distributed in the basin of the orinoco river , except the caroni river and the upper caura river in venezuela the abundance of distinct fish species lures the amazon river dolphin into the v√°rzea areas of high water occurrences during the seasonal flooding legend also states that if a person makes eye contact with an amazon river dolphin , he or she will have lifelong nightmares they are derived from costero , are most likely harvested along the coast and the amazon river delta , and then are traded up the amazon river jpg amazon river dolphin ( inia geoffrensis )

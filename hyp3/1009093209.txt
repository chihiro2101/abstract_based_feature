the species inia geoffrensis was described by henri marie ducrotay de blainville in 1817 originally , the amazon river dolphin belonged to the superfamily platanistoidea , which constituted all river dolphins , making them paraphyletic group today , however , the amazon river dolphin has been reclassified into the superfamily inioidea there is no consensus on when and how they penetrated the amazon basin ; they may have done so during the miocene from the pacific ocean , before the formation of the andes , or from the atlantic ocean there is ongoing debate about the classification of species and subspecies , with large international bodies being in disagreement geoffrensis ( amazon river dolphin ) , i boliviensis ( bolivian river dolphin ) , and i humboldtiana ( orinoco river dolphin ) ; while the committee on taxonomy of the society for marine mammalogy only recognizes the first two of these boliviensis was a different species therefore , the bolivian river dolphin is currently recognized as a subspecies in addition , a 2014 study identifies a third species in the araguaia-tocantins basin , but this designation is not recognized by any international organization and the committee on taxonomy of the society for marine mammalogy suggests this analysis is not persuasive it is confined to the mamore river and its main tributary , the it√©nez inia geoffrensis humboldtiana are located in the orinoco river basin , including the apure and meta rivers this subspecies is not recognized by the committee on taxonomy of the society for marine mammalogy , or the iucn the amazon river dolphin is the largest river dolphin the flukes are broad and triangular , and the dorsal fin , which is keel-shaped , is short in height but very long , extending from the middle of the body to the caudal region newborns and the young have a dark grey tint , which in adolescence transforms into light grey , and in adults turns pink as a result of repeated abrasion of the skin surface the skull of the species is slightly asymmetrical compared to the other toothed whales life expectancy of the amazon river dolphin in the wild is unknown , but in captivity , the longevity of healthy individuals has been recorded at between 10 and 30 years however , the average longevity in captive animals is only 33 months the amazon river dolphin are commonly seen singly or in twos , but may also occur in pods that rarely contain more than eight individuals pods as large as 37 individuals have been seen in the amazon , but average is three typically , social bonds occur between mother and child , but may also been seen in heterogeneous groups or bachelor groups there is significant segregation during the rainy season , with males occupying the river channels , while females and their offspring are located in flooded areas however , in the dry season , there is no such separation captive studies have shown that the amazon river dolphin is less shy than the bottlenose dolphin , but also less sociable they are harder to train than most other species of dolphin the males appear to carry these objects as a socio-sexual display which is part of their mating system the behavior is '' triggered by an unusually large number of adult males and/or adult females in a group , or perhaps it attracts such into the group '' before determining that the species had an evident sexual dimorphism , it was postulated that the river dolphins were monogamous they also commonly have numerous secondary teeth-raking scars the interval between births is estimated between 15 and 36 months , and the young dolphins are thought to become independent within two to three years the diet of the amazon river dolphin is the most diverse of the toothed whales the dolphin 's dentition allows it to access shells of river turtles and freshwater crabs usually , these dolphins are active and feeding throughout the day and night amazonian rivers are often very murky , and the amazon river dolphin is therefore likely to depend much more on its sense of echolocation than vision when navigating and finding prey amazon river dolphins are the most widespread river dolphins the use of the amazon river dolphin carcass as bait for the piracatinga dates back to 2000 according to the pink amazon river dolphin myth , it is said that this creature takes form of a human and seduces men and woman to the underworld of encante jpg heart of the amazon river dolphin boto-cor-de-rosa ( inia geoffrensis )

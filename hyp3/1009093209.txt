the species inia geoffrensis was described by henri marie ducrotay de blainville in 1817 originally , the amazon river dolphin belonged to the superfamily platanistoidea , which constituted all river dolphins , making them paraphyletic group today , however , the amazon river dolphin has been reclassified into the superfamily inioidea there is no consensus on when and how they penetrated the amazon basin ; they may have done so during the miocene from the pacific ocean , before the formation of the andes , or from the atlantic ocean geoffrensis ( amazon river dolphin ) , i humboldtiana ( orinoco river dolphin ) ; while the committee on taxonomy of the society for marine mammalogy only recognizes the first two of these therefore , the bolivian river dolphin is currently recognized as a subspecies in addition , a 2014 study identifies a third species in the araguaia-tocantins basin , but this designation is not recognized by any international organization and the committee on taxonomy of the society for marine mammalogy suggests this analysis is not persuasive inia geoffrensis humboldtiana are located in the orinoco river basin , including the apure and meta rivers this subspecies is restricted , at least during the dry season , to the waterfalls of rio negro rapids in the orinoco between samariapo and puerto ayacucho , and the casiquiare canal the amazon river dolphin is the largest river dolphin it has very evident sexual dimorphism , with males measuring and weighing between 16 % and 55 % more than females , making it unique among cetaceans , where females are generally larger than males unlike in oceanic dolphins , the cervical vertebrae are not fused , allowing the head to turn 90 degrees newborns and the young have a dark grey tint , which in adolescence transforms into light grey , and in adults turns pink as a result of repeated abrasion of the skin surface the color of adults varies between solid and mottled pink and in some adults the dorsal surface is darker it has a long , thin snout , with 25 to 28 pairs of long and slender teeth to each side of both jaws dentition is heterodont , meaning that the teeth differ in shape and length , with differing functions for both grabbing and crushing prey pods as large as 37 individuals have been seen in the amazon , but average is three in their freshwater habitat they are apex predators and gatherings depend more on food sources and habitat availability than in oceanic dolphins where protection from larger predators is necessary captive studies have shown that the amazon river dolphin is less shy than the bottlenose dolphin , but also less sociable when they surface , the tips of the snout , melon and dorsal fins appear simultaneously , the tail rarely showing before diving they can also shake their fins , and pull their tail fin and head above the water to observe the environment adult males have been observed carrying objects in their mouths such as branches or other floating vegetation , or balls of hardened clay '' before determining that the species had an evident sexual dimorphism , it was postulated that the river dolphins were monogamous males often have a significant degree of damage in the dorsal , caudal , and pectoral fins , as well as the blowhole , due to bites and abrasions the male takes the initiative by nibbling the fins of the female , but reacts aggressively if the female is not receptive the period of birthing coincides with the flood season , and this may provide an advantage because the females and their offspring remain in flooded areas longer than males at birth , calves are long and in captivity have registered a growth of per year the relatively long duration of breastfeeding and parenting suggests a strong mother-child bond it consists of at least 53 different species of fish , grouped in 19 families the most frequently consumed fish belong to the families sciaenidae ( croakers ) , cichlidae , and characidae ( tetras and piranhas ) the dolphin 's dentition allows it to access shells of river turtles and freshwater crabs the diet is more diverse during the wet season , when fish are spread in flooded areas outside riverbeds , thus becoming more difficult to catch this may be why the amazon river dolphin produces less powerful clicks compared to other similar sized toothed whales in a previous study conducted at the center of the amazon river , a dolphin was observed that moved only a few dozen kilometers from the dry season and wet season the local fishermen overfish and when the amazon river dolphins remove the commercial catch from the nets and lines , it causes damages to the equipment and the capture , as well as generating ill will from the local fishermen scavenger species feed upon the carcasses , and the complexity of the river currents make it nearly impossible to locate all of the dead animals increasing pollution and gradual destruction of the amazon rainforest add to the vulnerability of the species they are derived from costero , are most likely harvested along the coast and the amazon river delta , and then are traded up the amazon river jpg amazon river dolphin ( inia geoffrensis )

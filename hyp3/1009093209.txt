the species inia geoffrensis was described by henri marie ducrotay de blainville in 1817 originally , the amazon river dolphin belonged to the superfamily platanistoidea , which constituted all river dolphins , making them paraphyletic group today , however , the amazon river dolphin has been reclassified into the superfamily inioidea there is no consensus on when and how they penetrated the amazon basin ; they may have done so during the miocene from the pacific ocean , before the formation of the andes , or from the atlantic ocean there is ongoing debate about the classification of species and subspecies , with large international bodies being in disagreement geoffrensis ( amazon river dolphin ) , i boliviensis ( bolivian river dolphin ) , and i humboldtiana ( orinoco river dolphin ) ; while the committee on taxonomy of the society for marine mammalogy only recognizes the first two of these boliviensis was a different species inia geoffrensis boliviensis has populations in the upper reaches of the madeira river , upstream of the rapids of teotonio , in bolivia it is confined to the mamore river and its main tributary , the iténez inia geoffrensis humboldtiana are located in the orinoco river basin , including the apure and meta rivers the amazon river dolphin is the largest river dolphin adult males reach a maximum length and weight of ( average and ( average , while females reach a length and weight of ( mean and ( average unlike in oceanic dolphins , the cervical vertebrae are not fused , allowing the head to turn 90 degrees the flukes are broad and triangular , and the dorsal fin , which is keel-shaped , is short in height but very long , extending from the middle of the body to the caudal region newborns and the young have a dark grey tint , which in adolescence transforms into light grey , and in adults turns pink as a result of repeated abrasion of the skin surface the color of adults varies between solid and mottled pink and in some adults the dorsal surface is darker it has a long , thin snout , with 25 to 28 pairs of long and slender teeth to each side of both jaws dentition is heterodont , meaning that the teeth differ in shape and length , with differing functions for both grabbing and crushing prey life expectancy of the amazon river dolphin in the wild is unknown , but in captivity , the longevity of healthy individuals has been recorded at between 10 and 30 years however , the average longevity in captive animals is only 33 months an individual named baby at the duisburg zoo , germany , lived at least 46 years , spending 45 years , 9 months at the zoo the amazon river dolphin are commonly seen singly or in twos , but may also occur in pods that rarely contain more than eight individuals in the orinoco , the largest observed groups number 30 , but average is just above five typically , social bonds occur between mother and child , but may also been seen in heterogeneous groups or bachelor groups there is significant segregation during the rainy season , with males occupying the river channels , while females and their offspring are located in flooded areas in their freshwater habitat they are apex predators and gatherings depend more on food sources and habitat availability than in oceanic dolphins where protection from larger predators is necessary captive studies have shown that the amazon river dolphin is less shy than the bottlenose dolphin , but also less sociable adult males have been observed carrying objects in their mouths such as branches or other floating vegetation , or balls of hardened clay the behavior is '' triggered by an unusually large number of adult males and/or adult females in a group , or perhaps it attracts such into the group amazonian rivers are often very murky , and the amazon river dolphin is therefore likely to depend much more on its sense of echolocation than vision when navigating and finding prey this may be why the amazon river dolphin produces less powerful clicks compared to other similar sized toothed whales like other dolphins , river dolphins use whistling tones to communicate the issuance of these sounds is related to the time they return to the surface before diving , suggesting a link to food one of these ecosystems is a floodplain , or a várzea forest , and is home to a large number of fish species which are an essential resource for human consumption the abundance of distinct fish species lures the amazon river dolphin into the várzea areas of high water occurrences during the seasonal flooding in traditional amazon river folklore , at night , an amazon river dolphin becomes a handsome young man who seduces girls , impregnates them , and then returns to the river in the morning to become a dolphin again legend also states that if a person makes eye contact with an amazon river dolphin , he or she will have lifelong nightmares jpg heart of the amazon river dolphin boto-cor-de-rosa ( inia geoffrensis )

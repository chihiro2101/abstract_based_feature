the species inia geoffrensis was described by henri marie ducrotay de blainville in 1817 originally , the amazon river dolphin belonged to the superfamily platanistoidea , which constituted all river dolphins , making them paraphyletic group today , however , the amazon river dolphin has been reclassified into the superfamily inioidea there is no consensus on when and how they penetrated the amazon basin ; they may have done so during the miocene from the pacific ocean , before the formation of the andes , or from the atlantic ocean there is ongoing debate about the classification of species and subspecies , with large international bodies being in disagreement geoffrensis ( amazon river dolphin ) , i boliviensis ( bolivian river dolphin ) , and i humboldtiana ( orinoco river dolphin ) ; while the committee on taxonomy of the society for marine mammalogy only recognizes the first two of these boliviensis was a different species therefore , the bolivian river dolphin is currently recognized as a subspecies inia geoffrensis humboldtiana are located in the orinoco river basin , including the apure and meta rivers the amazon river dolphin is the largest river dolphin adult males reach a maximum length and weight of ( average and ( average , while females reach a length and weight of ( mean and ( average the skull of the species is slightly asymmetrical compared to the other toothed whales dentition is heterodont , meaning that the teeth differ in shape and length , with differing functions for both grabbing and crushing prey anterior teeth are conical and later have ridges on the inside of the crown despite small eyes , the species seems to have good eyesight in and out of the water however , the average longevity in captive animals is only 33 months the amazon river dolphin are commonly seen singly or in twos , but may also occur in pods that rarely contain more than eight individuals typically , social bonds occur between mother and child , but may also been seen in heterogeneous groups or bachelor groups the largest congregations are seen in areas with abundant food , and at the mouths of rivers captive studies have shown that the amazon river dolphin is less shy than the bottlenose dolphin , but also less sociable they are harder to train than most other species of dolphin '' before determining that the species had an evident sexual dimorphism , it was postulated that the river dolphins were monogamous a high frequency of copulations in a couple was observed ; they used three different positions : contacting the womb at right angles , lying head to head , or head to tail at birth , calves are long and in captivity have registered a growth of per year the interval between births is estimated between 15 and 36 months , and the young dolphins are thought to become independent within two to three years the diet of the amazon river dolphin is the most diverse of the toothed whales the dolphin 's dentition allows it to access shells of river turtles and freshwater crabs the diet becomes more selective during the dry season when prey density is greater it has also been observed that captive dolphins share food amazonian rivers are often very murky , and the amazon river dolphin is therefore likely to depend much more on its sense of echolocation than vision when navigating and finding prey however , echolocation in shallow waters and flooded forests may result in many echoes to keep track of for each click produced a multitude of echoes are likely to return to the echolocating animal almost on top of each other which makes object discrimination difficult this may be why the amazon river dolphin produces less powerful clicks compared to other similar sized toothed whales like other dolphins , river dolphins use whistling tones to communicate the amazon river dolphin is located in most of the area 's aquatic habitats , including ; river basins , major courses of rivers , canals , river tributaries , lakes , and at the ends of rapids and waterfalls the use of the amazon river dolphin carcass as bait for the piracatinga dates back to 2000 they are derived from costero , are most likely harvested along the coast and the amazon river delta , and then are traded up the amazon river jpg amazon river dolphin ( inia geoffrensis )

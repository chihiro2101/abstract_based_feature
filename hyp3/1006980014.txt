in a fossil fuel power plant using a steam cycle for power generation , the primary heat source will be combustion of coal , oil , or natural gas in some cases byproduct fuel such as the carbon monoxide rich offgasses of a coke battery can be burned to heat a boiler ; biofuels such as bagasse , where economically available , can also be used in a nuclear power plant , boilers called steam generators are heated by the heat produced by nuclear fission where a large volume of hot gas is available from some process , a heat recovery steam generator or recovery boiler can use the heat to produce steam , with little or no extra fuel consumed ; such a configuration is common in a combined cycle power plant where a gas turbine and a steam boiler are used in all cases the combustion product waste gases are separate from the working fluid of the steam cycle , making these systems examples of external combustion engines the pressure vessel of a boiler is usually made of steel ( or alloy steel ) , or historically of wrought iron however , ferritic stainless steel is often used in superheater sections that will not be exposed to boiler water , and electrically-heated stainless steel shell boilers are allowed under the european '' pressure equipment directive '' for production of steam for sterilizers and disinfectors bs en 14222 : '' stainless steel shell boilers '' in live steam models , copper or brass is often used because it is more easily fabricated in smaller size boilers cast iron may be used for the heating vessel of domestic water heaters although such heaters are usually termed '' boilers '' in some countries , their purpose is usually to produce hot water , not steam , and so they run at low pressure and try to avoid boiling electric steam boilers use resistance- or immersion-type heating elements nuclear fission is also used as a heat source for generating steam , either directly ( bwr ) or , in most cases , in specialised heat exchangers called '' steam generators '' ( pwr ) direct method of boiler efficiency test is more usable or more common boilers can be classified into the following configurations : pot boiler or haycock boiler/haystack boiler : a primitive '' kettle '' where a fire heats a partially filled water container from below 225pxfire-tube boiler : here , water partially fills a boiler barrel with a small volume left above to accommodate the steam ( steam space ) this is the type of boiler used in nearly all steam locomotives fire-tube boilers usually have a comparatively low rate of steam production , but high steam storage capacity rightwater-tube boiler : in this type , tubes filled with water are arranged inside a furnace in a number of possible configurations often the water tubes connect large drums , the lower ones containing water and the upper ones steam and water ; in other cases , such as a mono-tube boiler , water is circulated by a pump through a succession of coils this type generally gives high steam production rates , but less storage capacity than the above flash boiler : a flash boiler is a specialized type of water-tube boiler in which tubes are close together and water is pumped through them for instance , the asme boiler and pressure vessel code is a standard providing a wide range of rules and directives to ensure compliance of the boilers and other pressure vessels with safety , security and design standards because of this , steam is an efficient method of moving energy and heat around a site from a central boiler house to where it is needed , but without the right boiler feedwater treatment , a steam-raising plant will suffer from scale formation and corrosion thumb when water is boiled the result is saturated steam , also referred to as '' wet steam superheated steam boilers evaporate the water and then further heat the steam in a superheater , causing the discharged steam temperature to be substantially above the boiling temperature at the boiler 's operating pressure also , higher steam pressure will be possible than with saturated steam , enabling the steam to carry more energy although superheating adds more energy to the steam in the form of heat there is no effect on pressure , which is determined by the rate at which steam is drawn from the boiler and the pressure settings of the safety valves the pump used to charge the boiler must be able to overcome the boiler 's operating pressure , else water will not flow the term '' boiler '' should not be used for a supercritical pressure steam generator , as no '' boiling '' occurs in this device automatic blowdown/continuous heat recovery system : this system allows the boiler to blowdown only when makeup water is flowing to the boiler , thereby transferring the maximum amount of heat possible from the blowdown to the makeup water this may be fitted to the side of the boiler , just below the water level , or to the top of the boiler types of draught can also be divided into induced draught , where exhaust gases are pulled out of the boiler ; forced draught , where fresh air is pushed into the boiler ; and balanced draught , where both effects are employed

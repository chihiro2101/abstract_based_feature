in a fossil fuel power plant using a steam cycle for power generation , the primary heat source will be combustion of coal , oil , or natural gas in some cases byproduct fuel such as the carbon monoxide rich offgasses of a coke battery can be burned to heat a boiler ; biofuels such as bagasse , where economically available , can also be used in a nuclear power plant , boilers called steam generators are heated by the heat produced by nuclear fission in all cases the combustion product waste gases are separate from the working fluid of the steam cycle , making these systems examples of external combustion engines the pressure vessel of a boiler is usually made of steel ( or alloy steel ) , or historically of wrought iron for much of the victorian '' age of steam '' , the only material used for boilermaking was the highest grade of wrought iron , with assembly by riveting this iron was often obtained from specialist ironworks , such as those in the cleator moor ( uk ) area , noted for the high quality of their rolled plate , which was especially suitable for use in critical applications such as high-pressure boilers wrought iron boilers corrode far more slowly than their modern-day steel counterparts , and are less susceptible to localized pitting and stress-corrosion cast iron may be used for the heating vessel of domestic water heaters although such heaters are usually termed '' boilers '' in some countries , their purpose is usually to produce hot water , not steam , and so they run at low pressure and try to avoid boiling electric steam boilers use resistance- or immersion-type heating elements 18th century haycock boilers generally produced and stored large volumes of very low-pressure steam , often hardly above that of the atmosphere 225pxfire-tube boiler : here , water partially fills a boiler barrel with a small volume left above to accommodate the steam ( steam space ) the heat source is inside a furnace or firebox that has to be kept permanently surrounded by the water in order to maintain the temperature of the heating surface below the boiling point in a flash boiler , the tube is kept so hot that the water feed is quickly flashed into steam and superheated sometimes the two above types have been combined in the following manner : the firebox contains an assembly of water tubes , called thermic siphons the gases then pass through a conventional firetube boiler for instance , the asme boiler and pressure vessel code is a standard providing a wide range of rules and directives to ensure compliance of the boilers and other pressure vessels with safety , security and design standards collapsed or dislodged boiler tubes can also spray scalding-hot steam and smoke out of the air intake and firing chute , injuring the firemen who load the coal into the fire chamber this document also contains a list of day-by-day boiler accidents and accident summaries by year , and discussions of boiler damage claims the hartford loop was invented in 1919 by the hartford steam boiler inspection and insurance company as a method to help prevent this condition from occurring , and thereby reduce their insurance claims saturated steam is useful for many purposes , such as cooking , heating and sanitation , but is not desirable when steam is expected to convey energy to machinery , such as a ship 's propulsion system or the '' motion '' of a steam locomotive superheated steam boilers evaporate the water and then further heat the steam in a superheater , causing the discharged steam temperature to be substantially above the boiling temperature at the boiler 's operating pressure however , the overall energy efficiency of the steam plant ( the combination of boiler , superheater , piping and machinery ) generally will be improved enough to more than offset the increased fuel consumption superheater operation is similar to that of the coils on an air conditioning unit , although for a different purpose the steam piping is directed through the flue gas path in the boiler furnace , an area in which the temperature is typically between the pump used to charge the boiler must be able to overcome the boiler 's operating pressure , else water will not flow in contrast to a '' subcritical boiler '' , a supercritical steam generator operates at such a high pressure ( over that the physical turbulence that characterizes boiling ceases to occur ; the fluid is neither liquid nor gas but a super-critical fluid circulating pump : it is designed to circulate water back to the boiler after it has expelled some of its heat this may be fitted to the side of the boiler , just below the water level , or to the top of the boiler types of draught can also be divided into induced draught , where exhaust gases are pulled out of the boiler ; forced draught , where fresh air is pushed into the boiler ; and balanced draught , where both effects are employed this is more common with larger boilers where the flue gases have to travel a long distance through many boiler passes

in a fossil fuel power plant using a steam cycle for power generation , the primary heat source will be combustion of coal , oil , or natural gas in some cases byproduct fuel such as the carbon monoxide rich offgasses of a coke battery can be burned to heat a boiler ; biofuels such as bagasse , where economically available , can also be used where a large volume of hot gas is available from some process , a heat recovery steam generator or recovery boiler can use the heat to produce steam , with little or no extra fuel consumed ; such a configuration is common in a combined cycle power plant where a gas turbine and a steam boiler are used in all cases the combustion product waste gases are separate from the working fluid of the steam cycle , making these systems examples of external combustion engines the pressure vessel of a boiler is usually made of steel ( or alloy steel ) , or historically of wrought iron however , ferritic stainless steel is often used in superheater sections that will not be exposed to boiler water , and electrically-heated stainless steel shell boilers are allowed under the european '' pressure equipment directive '' for production of steam for sterilizers and disinfectors bs en 14222 : '' stainless steel shell boilers '' in live steam models , copper or brass is often used because it is more easily fabricated in smaller size boilers for much of the victorian '' age of steam '' , the only material used for boilermaking was the highest grade of wrought iron , with assembly by riveting wrought iron boilers corrode far more slowly than their modern-day steel counterparts , and are less susceptible to localized pitting and stress-corrosion although such heaters are usually termed '' boilers '' in some countries , their purpose is usually to produce hot water , not steam , and so they run at low pressure and try to avoid boiling nuclear fission is also used as a heat source for generating steam , either directly ( bwr ) or , in most cases , in specialised heat exchangers called '' steam generators '' ( pwr ) 225pxfire-tube boiler : here , water partially fills a boiler barrel with a small volume left above to accommodate the steam ( steam space ) this is the type of boiler used in nearly all steam locomotives fire-tube boilers usually have a comparatively low rate of steam production , but high steam storage capacity rightwater-tube boiler : in this type , tubes filled with water are arranged inside a furnace in a number of possible configurations often the water tubes connect large drums , the lower ones containing water and the upper ones steam and water ; in other cases , such as a mono-tube boiler , water is circulated by a pump through a succession of coils flash boiler : a flash boiler is a specialized type of water-tube boiler in which tubes are close together and water is pumped through them a flash boiler differs from the type of mono-tube steam generator in which the tube is permanently filled with water in a flash boiler , the tube is kept so hot that the water feed is quickly flashed into steam and superheated when water is converted to steam it expands to over 1,000 times its original volume and travels down steam pipes at over at best , this increases energy costs and can lead to poor quality steam , reduced efficiency , shorter plant life and unreliable operation if feed water is then sent into the empty boiler , the small cascade of incoming water instantly boils on contact with the superheated metal shell and leads to a violent explosion that can not be controlled even by safety steam valves draining of the boiler can also happen if a leak occurs in the steam supply lines that is larger than the make-up water supply could replace this is because unavoidable temperature and/or pressure loss that occurs as steam travels from the boiler to the machinery will cause some condensation , resulting in liquid water being carried into the machinery the water entrained in the steam may damage turbine blades or in the case of a steam engine , may cause serious mechanical damage due to hydrostatic lock however , the overall energy efficiency of the steam plant ( the combination of boiler , superheater , piping and machinery ) generally will be improved enough to more than offset the increased fuel consumption the steam piping is directed through the flue gas path in the boiler furnace , an area in which the temperature is typically between as the name implies , this valve is usually located directly on the bottom of the boiler , and is occasionally opened to use the pressure in the boiler to push these particulates out automatic blowdown/continuous heat recovery system : this system allows the boiler to blowdown only when makeup water is flowing to the boiler , thereby transferring the maximum amount of heat possible from the blowdown to the makeup water main steam stop valve : steam traps : main steam stop/check valve : it is used on multiple boiler installations fuel oil system : fuel oil heaters gas system : coal system : types of draught can also be divided into induced draught , where exhaust gases are pulled out of the boiler ; forced draught , where fresh air is pushed into the boiler ; and balanced draught , where both effects are employed

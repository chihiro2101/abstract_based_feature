in a fossil fuel power plant using a steam cycle for power generation , the primary heat source will be combustion of coal , oil , or natural gas in some cases byproduct fuel such as the carbon monoxide rich offgasses of a coke battery can be burned to heat a boiler ; biofuels such as bagasse , where economically available , can also be used in a nuclear power plant , boilers called steam generators are heated by the heat produced by nuclear fission where a large volume of hot gas is available from some process , a heat recovery steam generator or recovery boiler can use the heat to produce steam , with little or no extra fuel consumed ; such a configuration is common in a combined cycle power plant where a gas turbine and a steam boiler are used the pressure vessel of a boiler is usually made of steel ( or alloy steel ) , or historically of wrought iron however , ferritic stainless steel is often used in superheater sections that will not be exposed to boiler water , and electrically-heated stainless steel shell boilers are allowed under the european '' pressure equipment directive '' for production of steam for sterilizers and disinfectors bs en 14222 : '' stainless steel shell boilers '' in live steam models , copper or brass is often used because it is more easily fabricated in smaller size boilers cast iron may be used for the heating vessel of domestic water heaters electric steam boilers use resistance- or immersion-type heating elements nuclear fission is also used as a heat source for generating steam , either directly ( bwr ) or , in most cases , in specialised heat exchangers called '' steam generators '' ( pwr ) heat recovery steam generators ( hrsgs ) use the heat rejected from other processes such as gas turbine boilers can be classified into the following configurations : pot boiler or haycock boiler/haystack boiler : a primitive '' kettle '' where a fire heats a partially filled water container from below 18th century haycock boilers generally produced and stored large volumes of very low-pressure steam , often hardly above that of the atmosphere flued boiler with one or two large fluesâ€”an early type or forerunner of fire-tube boiler 225pxfire-tube boiler : here , water partially fills a boiler barrel with a small volume left above to accommodate the steam ( steam space ) the heat source is inside a furnace or firebox that has to be kept permanently surrounded by the water in order to maintain the temperature of the heating surface below the boiling point in case of a locomotive-type boiler , a boiler barrel extends from the firebox and the hot gases pass through a bundle of fire tubes inside the barrel which greatly increases the heating surface compared to a single tube and further improves heat transfer rightwater-tube boiler : in this type , tubes filled with water are arranged inside a furnace in a number of possible configurations often the water tubes connect large drums , the lower ones containing water and the upper ones steam and water ; in other cases , such as a mono-tube boiler , water is circulated by a pump through a succession of coils flash boiler : a flash boiler is a specialized type of water-tube boiler in which tubes are close together and water is pumped through them in a cast iron sectional boiler , sometimes called a '' pork chop boiler '' the water is contained inside cast iron sections when water is converted to steam it expands to over 1,000 times its original volume and travels down steam pipes at over because of this , steam is an efficient method of moving energy and heat around a site from a central boiler house to where it is needed , but without the right boiler feedwater treatment , a steam-raising plant will suffer from scale formation and corrosion this document also contains a list of day-by-day boiler accidents and accident summaries by year , and discussions of boiler damage claims a boiler that has a loss of feed water and is permitted to boil dry can be extremely dangerous saturated steam is useful for many purposes , such as cooking , heating and sanitation , but is not desirable when steam is expected to convey energy to machinery , such as a ship 's propulsion system or the '' motion '' of a steam locomotive this is because unavoidable temperature and/or pressure loss that occurs as steam travels from the boiler to the machinery will cause some condensation , resulting in liquid water being carried into the machinery there is no generation of steam bubbles within the water , because the pressure is above the critical pressure point at which steam bubbles can form the term '' boiler '' should not be used for a supercritical pressure steam generator , as no '' boiling '' occurs in this device flash tank : high-pressure blowdown enters this vessel where the steam can 'flash ' safely and be used in a low-pressure system or be vented to atmosphere while the ambient pressure blowdown flows to drain this may be fitted to the side of the boiler , just below the water level , or to the top of the boiler air is often passed through an air heater ; which , as the name suggests , heats the air going into the furnace in order to increase the overall efficiency of the boiler

in a fossil fuel power plant using a steam cycle for power generation , the primary heat source will be combustion of coal , oil , or natural gas in some cases byproduct fuel such as the carbon monoxide rich offgasses of a coke battery can be burned to heat a boiler ; biofuels such as bagasse , where economically available , can also be used in a nuclear power plant , boilers called steam generators are heated by the heat produced by nuclear fission the pressure vessel of a boiler is usually made of steel ( or alloy steel ) , or historically of wrought iron however , ferritic stainless steel is often used in superheater sections that will not be exposed to boiler water , and electrically-heated stainless steel shell boilers are allowed under the european '' pressure equipment directive '' for production of steam for sterilizers and disinfectors bs en 14222 : '' stainless steel shell boilers '' in live steam models , copper or brass is often used because it is more easily fabricated in smaller size boilers cast iron may be used for the heating vessel of domestic water heaters although such heaters are usually termed '' boilers '' in some countries , their purpose is usually to produce hot water , not steam , and so they run at low pressure and try to avoid boiling the source of heat for a boiler is combustion of any of several fuels , such as wood , coal , oil , or natural gas electric steam boilers use resistance- or immersion-type heating elements nuclear fission is also used as a heat source for generating steam , either directly ( bwr ) or , in most cases , in specialised heat exchangers called '' steam generators '' ( pwr ) heat recovery steam generators ( hrsgs ) use the heat rejected from other processes such as gas turbine flued boiler with one or two large fluesâ€”an early type or forerunner of fire-tube boiler 225pxfire-tube boiler : here , water partially fills a boiler barrel with a small volume left above to accommodate the steam ( steam space ) the heat source is inside a furnace or firebox that has to be kept permanently surrounded by the water in order to maintain the temperature of the heating surface below the boiling point fire-tube boilers usually have a comparatively low rate of steam production , but high steam storage capacity rightwater-tube boiler : in this type , tubes filled with water are arranged inside a furnace in a number of possible configurations this type generally gives high steam production rates , but less storage capacity than the above water tube boilers can be designed to exploit any heat source and are generally preferred in high-pressure applications since the high-pressure water/steam is contained within small diameter pipes which can withstand the pressure with a thinner wall flash boiler : a flash boiler is a specialized type of water-tube boiler in which tubes are close together and water is pumped through them a flash boiler differs from the type of mono-tube steam generator in which the tube is permanently filled with water collapsed or dislodged boiler tubes can also spray scalding-hot steam and smoke out of the air intake and firing chute , injuring the firemen who load the coal into the fire chamber an article on a massive pabst brewing company boiler explosion in 1909 that destroyed a building , and blew parts onto the roof of nearby buildings '' saturated steam , while mostly consisting of water vapor , carries some unevaporated water in the form of droplets this is because unavoidable temperature and/or pressure loss that occurs as steam travels from the boiler to the machinery will cause some condensation , resulting in liquid water being carried into the machinery superheated steam boilers evaporate the water and then further heat the steam in a superheater , causing the discharged steam temperature to be substantially above the boiling temperature at the boiler 's operating pressure although superheating adds more energy to the steam in the form of heat there is no effect on pressure , which is determined by the rate at which steam is drawn from the boiler and the pressure settings of the safety valves however , the overall energy efficiency of the steam plant ( the combination of boiler , superheater , piping and machinery ) generally will be improved enough to more than offset the increased fuel consumption water level indicators : they show the operator the level of fluid in the boiler , also known as a sight glass , water gauge or water column blowdown is also often used to monitor the chemistry of the boiler water automatic blowdown/continuous heat recovery system : this system allows the boiler to blowdown only when makeup water is flowing to the boiler , thereby transferring the maximum amount of heat possible from the blowdown to the makeup water this may be fitted to the side of the boiler , just below the water level , or to the top of the boiler

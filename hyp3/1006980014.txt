in a fossil fuel power plant using a steam cycle for power generation , the primary heat source will be combustion of coal , oil , or natural gas in some cases byproduct fuel such as the carbon monoxide rich offgasses of a coke battery can be burned to heat a boiler ; biofuels such as bagasse , where economically available , can also be used in a nuclear power plant , boilers called steam generators are heated by the heat produced by nuclear fission where a large volume of hot gas is available from some process , a heat recovery steam generator or recovery boiler can use the heat to produce steam , with little or no extra fuel consumed ; such a configuration is common in a combined cycle power plant where a gas turbine and a steam boiler are used however , ferritic stainless steel is often used in superheater sections that will not be exposed to boiler water , and electrically-heated stainless steel shell boilers are allowed under the european '' pressure equipment directive '' for production of steam for sterilizers and disinfectors bs en 14222 : '' stainless steel shell boilers '' in live steam models , copper or brass is often used because it is more easily fabricated in smaller size boilers in the 20th century , design practice moved towards the use of steel , with welded construction , which is stronger and cheaper , and can be fabricated more quickly and with less labour cast iron may be used for the heating vessel of domestic water heaters although such heaters are usually termed '' boilers '' in some countries , their purpose is usually to produce hot water , not steam , and so they run at low pressure and try to avoid boiling the source of heat for a boiler is combustion of any of several fuels , such as wood , coal , oil , or natural gas electric steam boilers use resistance- or immersion-type heating elements nuclear fission is also used as a heat source for generating steam , either directly ( bwr ) or , in most cases , in specialised heat exchangers called '' steam generators '' ( pwr ) heat recovery steam generators ( hrsgs ) use the heat rejected from other processes such as gas turbine flued boiler with one or two large fluesâ€”an early type or forerunner of fire-tube boiler 225pxfire-tube boiler : here , water partially fills a boiler barrel with a small volume left above to accommodate the steam ( steam space ) rightwater-tube boiler : in this type , tubes filled with water are arranged inside a furnace in a number of possible configurations water tube boilers can be designed to exploit any heat source and are generally preferred in high-pressure applications since the high-pressure water/steam is contained within small diameter pipes which can withstand the pressure with a thinner wall flash boiler : a flash boiler is a specialized type of water-tube boiler in which tubes are close together and water is pumped through them in a flash boiler , the tube is kept so hot that the water feed is quickly flashed into steam and superheated for instance , the asme boiler and pressure vessel code is a standard providing a wide range of rules and directives to ensure compliance of the boilers and other pressure vessels with safety , security and design standards historically , boilers were a source of many serious injuries and property destruction due to poorly understood engineering principles at best , this increases energy costs and can lead to poor quality steam , reduced efficiency , shorter plant life and unreliable operation a boiler that has a loss of feed water and is permitted to boil dry can be extremely dangerous if feed water is then sent into the empty boiler , the small cascade of incoming water instantly boils on contact with the superheated metal shell and leads to a violent explosion that can not be controlled even by safety steam valves saturated steam is useful for many purposes , such as cooking , heating and sanitation , but is not desirable when steam is expected to convey energy to machinery , such as a ship 's propulsion system or the '' motion '' of a steam locomotive superheated steam boilers evaporate the water and then further heat the steam in a superheater , causing the discharged steam temperature to be substantially above the boiling temperature at the boiler 's operating pressure although superheating adds more energy to the steam in the form of heat there is no effect on pressure , which is determined by the rate at which steam is drawn from the boiler and the pressure settings of the safety valves as a superheated boiler is usually operated at high pressure , the corresponding feedwater pressure must be even higher , demanding a more robust pump design there is no generation of steam bubbles within the water , because the pressure is above the critical pressure point at which steam bubbles can form blowdown is also often used to monitor the chemistry of the boiler water automatic blowdown/continuous heat recovery system : this system allows the boiler to blowdown only when makeup water is flowing to the boiler , thereby transferring the maximum amount of heat possible from the blowdown to the makeup water types of draught can also be divided into induced draught , where exhaust gases are pulled out of the boiler ; forced draught , where fresh air is pushed into the boiler ; and balanced draught , where both effects are employed

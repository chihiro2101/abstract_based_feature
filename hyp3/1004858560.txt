an important contributor to the discussion concerning the proper relationship between church and state was st augustine , who in the city of god , book xix , chapter 17 , examined the ideal relationship between the '' earthly city '' and the '' city of god '' in this work , augustine posited that major points of overlap were to be found between the '' earthly city '' and the '' city of god '' , especially as people need to live together and get along on earth sometimes this began to be used by a monarch to support the notion that the king ruled both his own kingdom and church within its boundaries , a theory known as caesaropapism on the other side was the catholic doctrine that the pope , as the vicar of christ on earth , should have the ultimate authority over the church , and indirectly over the state moreover , throughout the middle ages the pope claimed the right to depose the catholic kings of western europe and tried to exercise it , sometimes successfully ( see the investiture controversy , below ) , sometimes not , such as was the case with henry viii of england and henry iii of navarre in the west the issue of the separation of church and state during the medieval period centered on monarchs who sphere sovereignty but encroached on the church 's rule of the spiritual sphere this unresolved contradiction in ultimate control of the church led to power struggles and crises of leadership , notably in the investiture controversy , which was resolved in the concordat of worms in 1122 according to james madison , perhaps one of the most important modern proponents of the separation of church and state , luther 's doctrine of the two kingdoms marked the beginning of the modern conception of separation of church and state anabaptists came to teach that religion should never be compelled by state power , approaching the issue of church-state relations primarily from the position of protecting the church from the state in the 1530s , henry viii , angered by the pope clement vii 's refusal to annul his marriage to catherine of aragon , decided to break with the church and set himself as ruler of the church of england the monarchs of great britain have retained ecclesiastical authority in the church of england since henry viii , having the current title , supreme governor of the church of england this eventually led to nonconformism , english dissenters , and the anti-catholicism of oliver cromwell , the commonwealth of england , and the penal laws against catholics and others who did not adhere to the church of england after the american colonies revolted against george iii of the united kingdom , the constitution of united states was amended to ban the establishment of religion by congress the concept of separating church and state is often credited to the writings of english philosopher john locke ( 1632â€“1704 ) 29 at the same period of the 17th century , pierre bayle and some fideism were forerunners of the separation of church and state , maintaining that faith was independent of reason during the 18th century , the ideas of locke and bayle , in particular the separation of church and state , became more common , promoted by the philosophers of the age of enlightenment in english , the exact term is an offshoot of the phrase , '' wall of separation between church and state '' , as written in thomas jefferson 's letter to the danbury baptist association in 1802 the metaphor '' a wall of separation between church and state '' used by jefferson in the above quoted letter became a part of the first amendment jurisprudence of the u.s if a neutral state can prohibit polygamy , even though it is a restriction on religious freedom , then a catholic state can likewise restrict the public activity of non-catholic groups leon hooper , religious liberty : catholic struggles with pluralism , pp the friendly type limits the interference of the church in matters of the state but also limits the interference of the state in church matters about : how to separate church & state by barry mcgowan religiousliberty.tv current and historical information about church-state separation history of the separation of church and state in america churches are not exempt from state licenses by richard r

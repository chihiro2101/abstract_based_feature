though joseph smith , the founder of the latter day saint movement , never used the term '' adam–god '' in any of his recorded public statements , he provided several teachings from which the doctrine 's adherents draw support for example , smith taught in an 1839 sermon that adam was actually the archangel michael , who held the first presidency in the premortal life '' ) ; ( doctrine of adam as michael and as premortal first president cited as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) ( adam 's assignment of the keys of the universe cited as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) '' ; ( adam-as-mediator doctrine cited as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) finally , smith taught in his 1844 king follett discourse that god was once a man '' like one of us god himself , the father of us all , once dwelled on an earth the same as jesus christ himself did in the flesh '' ) ; ( citing teaching that god is an exalted man as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) ( citing minutes of meeting of the quorum of twelve , 4 april 1860 , in which it was recorded : '' it was joseph 's doctrine that adam was god god comes to earth and eats and partakes of fruit joseph could not reveal what was revealed to him , and if joseph had it revealed , he was not told to reveal it '' ) ; ( citing wilford woodruff journal of 4 september 1860 , in which george q cannon said '' that adam is our father and is a true doctrine revealed from god to joseph & brigham '' ) ; ( citing wilford woodruff journal of 16 december 1867 , stating that '' president young said adam was michael the archangel , & he was the father of jesus christ & was our god & that joseph taught this principle however , the prevailing academic view is that the doctrine taught by young and others was an elaboration of smith 's vague references to adam 's unique role in mormon doctrine ; ( '' young 's adam–god teachings were an expansion of joseph smith 's sermons in 1839-44 '' ) ; ( stating that there is '' no reliable evidence contemporary to smith 's lifetime which lends support '' to the view that smith taught the adam–god doctrine , and that young '' was not above inventing support for beliefs where none existed previously '' ) although young is generally credited with originating the doctrine , the original source may also have been young 's counselor in the first presidency , heber c the adam–god doctrine teaches that adam is the father of both the spirits and physical bodies of all humans born on earth , including jesus '' in smith 's original endowment ceremony , the gods involved in the creation were called '' elohim , jehovah , and michael , '' but unlike in modern mormon theology , '' jehovah '' was not identified as jesus michael was selected by the heads of this council of gods to be the father of this earth also , the doctrine teaches that michael was the father of the spirits in heaven who are associated with this earth next , the doctrine teaches that michael came to the earth with one of his wives , where they became known as adam and eve , and became the progenitor of the human race and the father of mortal bodies of all his spirit offspring so that they could progress and achieve godhood like themselves the names '' adam '' and '' eve '' are titles that reflect their roles as the parents of humanity , adam meaning man or '' father of mankind '' and eve meaning the '' mothers of all living '' the privilege of peopling the earth was part of adam and eve 's eternal purpose as exalted beings and eternal parents of their spirit children the bodies of adam and eve fell to a mortal state when they ate the fruit of tree of knowledge of good and evil in the garden of eden . then , the doctrine teaches that after his mortal existence , adam returned to his throne and reigned as the immortal god of this earth ( noting that in the late 19th century , several mormon leaders who still adhered to the adam–god doctrine began to adopt the modern mormon belief that the old testament deity was also jesus ) smith stated that adam 's ascension to godhood took place at or after a gathering at a adam-ondi-ahman the naming of adam-ondi-ahman is also recorded in the history of the reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints in volume 2 , chapter 9 , pages 153–154 finally , the doctrine teaches that michael/adam was the literal , biological father of the mortal body of jesus ; ( describing the adam–god doctrine as '' that adam was at once the spiritual as well as the physical father of all persons born on this world , including jesus christ '' ) whether or not smith had taught the doctrine , the first recorded explanation of the doctrine using the term '' adam–god '' was by young , who first taught the doctrine at the church 's spring general conference on april 9 , 1852 . watt published the sermon in 1854 in the british periodical journal of discourses , which was endorsed by young and his counselors in the church 's first presidency the transcript reads : when our father adam came into the garden of eden , he came into it with a celestial body , and brought eve , one of his wives , with him every man upon the earth , professing christians or non-professing , must hear it , and will know it sooner or later the transcript then reads : '' when the virgin mary conceived the child jesus , the father had begotten him in his own likeness and who is the father ? he is the first of the human family '' i have given you a few leading items upon this subject , but a great deal more remains to be told for example , attendee samuel hollister rogers wrote several days later , confirming that young said that when adam went to the garden , he '' brought his wife or one of his wives with him '' , that '' adam was the only god that we would have , and that christ was not begotten by the holy ghost , but of the father adam young taught that adam was the father of jesus and the only god to us young concluded , '' i could tell you much more about this ; but were i to tell you the whole truth , blasphemy would be nothing to it , in the estimation of the superstitious and overrighteous mankind in a special conference on august 28 , 1852 , young explained in greater detail the mechanism by which celestial beings like adam and eve could give birth to mortal offspring this is what adam and eve did , young said , and '' adam is my father '' he also reiterated the doctrine at the october 1854 general conference , journal of joseph l in a sermon that was reported to have '' held the vast audience as it were spellbound '' minutes of the general conference , deseret news , october 12 , 1853 87–88 ( '' there are lords many and there are gods many , & the father of our spirits is the father of jesus christ : he is the father of jesus christ , spirit & body and he is the beginner of the bodies of all men '' ) ; john pulsipher papers , mss 1041 , p 35–37 , byu special collections ( '' there are lords many & gods many but the god that we have to account to , is the father of our spirits & mdash ; adam when young discussed the doctrine again in early 1857 , he emphasized again that '' to become acquainted with our father and our god '' was '' one of the first principles of the doctrine of salvation '' , and that '' no man can enjoy or be prepared for eternal life without that knowledge '' i do not care for one moment how that is ; it is no matter whether we are to consider him our god , or whether his father , or his grandfather , for in either case we are of one species of one family and jesus christ is also of our species the reaction within the mormon community to young 's adam–god teachings was mixed for example , the clerk of the conference , thomas bullock , recorded that during young 's sermon , '' the holy ghost rested upon him with great power '' journal of wilford woodruff , april 10 , 1852 kimball readily adopted young 's views , and preached on june 29 , 1856 , that '' i have learned by experience that there is but one god that pertains to this people , and he is the god that pertains to this earth—the first man the poem is included as a hymn in the current lds church hymnal , but the wording has been altered from '' eternal father '' to '' ancient father '' '' sons of michael , he approaches '' , hymns of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints , hymn 51 however , some prominent members of the church took issue with the doctrine most significantly , apostle and philosopher orson pratt disagreed with the doctrine , and expressed that disagreement publicly journal of thomas evans jeremy sr cannon said '' that adam is our father and is a true doctrine revealed from god to joseph & brigham ( citing wilford woodruff journal of 16 december 1867 , stating that '' president young said adam was michael the archangel , & he was the father of jesus christ & was our god & that joseph taught this principle mcconkie gave a speech elaborating upon the church 's position towards the adam–god theory : there are those who believe or say they believe that adam is our father and our god , that he is the father of our spirits and our bodies , and that he is the one we worship adherents of mormon fundamentalism generally accept the adam–god doctrine the understanding from these revelations is that jesus was the only begotten son in the flesh of the savior of the previous earth where the father of all spirits , michael/adam , had his mortal probation

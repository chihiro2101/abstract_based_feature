though joseph smith , the founder of the latter day saint movement , never used the term '' adam–god '' in any of his recorded public statements , he provided several teachings from which the doctrine 's adherents draw support for example , smith taught in an 1839 sermon that adam was actually the archangel michael , who held the first presidency in the premortal life ( before the world was formed , the first presidency '' was first given to adam '' ) ; ( doctrine of adam as michael and as premortal first president cited as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) ( adam 's assignment of the keys of the universe cited as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) in 1840 , smith taught that adam is the one '' through whom christ has been revealed from heaven , and will continue to be revealed from henceforth '' ; ( adam-as-mediator doctrine cited as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) finally , smith taught in his 1844 king follett discourse that god was once a man '' like one of us '' ( god '' once was a man like one of us and god himself , the father of us all , once dwelled on an earth the same as jesus christ himself did in the flesh '' ) ; ( citing teaching that god is an exalted man as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) ( citing minutes of meeting of the quorum of twelve , 4 april 1860 , in which it was recorded : '' it was joseph 's doctrine that adam was god cannon said '' that adam is our father and is a true doctrine revealed from god to joseph & brigham for this same doctrine is taught in some of the old jewish records which have never been in print '' ) ; ( citing wilford woodruff journal of 16 december 1867 , stating that '' president young said adam was michael the archangel , & he was the father of jesus christ & was our god & that joseph taught this principle although young is generally credited with originating the doctrine , the original source may also have been young 's counselor in the first presidency , heber c the adam–god doctrine teaches that adam is the father of both the spirits and physical bodies of all humans born on earth , including jesus ( describing the adam–god doctrine as '' that adam was at once the spiritual as well as the physical father of all persons born on this world , including jesus christ '' ) first , he was a creator god he and his wife , eve , had become gods by living a mortal life , becoming resurrected , and receiving their exaltation '' michael was not the only creator god , however , as he was a member of a council of earth 's creator gods , which also included the gods '' elohim '' and '' jehovah smith journal , 6/17/1871 ) ( describing michael as a '' god in the council of gods '' ) ; within the council , jehovah and michael were subordinate to elohim and created the earth , under the direction of elohim michael was selected by the heads of this council of gods to be the father of this earth . with eve , and possibly his other wives , michael had fathered the spirits of spirit offspring in the preexistence next , the doctrine teaches that michael came to the earth with one of his wives , where they became known as adam and eve , and became the progenitor of the human race and the father of mortal bodies of all his spirit offspring so that they could progress and achieve godhood like themselves the names '' adam '' and '' eve '' are titles that reflect their roles as the parents of humanity , adam meaning man or '' father of mankind '' and eve meaning the '' mothers of all living '' the privilege of peopling the earth was part of adam and eve 's eternal purpose as exalted beings and eternal parents of their spirit children the bodies of adam and eve fell to a mortal state when they ate the fruit of tree of knowledge of good and evil in the garden of eden . then , the doctrine teaches that after his mortal existence , adam returned to his throne and reigned as the immortal god of this earth smith stated that adam 's ascension to godhood took place at or after a gathering at a adam-ondi-ahman finally , the doctrine teaches that michael/adam was the literal , biological father of the mortal body of jesus ; ( describing the adam–god doctrine as '' that adam was at once the spiritual as well as the physical father of all persons born on this world , including jesus christ '' ) . watt published the sermon in 1854 in the british periodical journal of discourses , which was endorsed by young and his counselors in the church 's first presidency . in watt 's transcript of the sermon , young said he intended to discuss '' who it was that begat the son of the virgin mary , '' a subject which he said '' has remained a mystery in this kingdom up to this day the transcript reads : when our father adam came into the garden of eden , he came into it with a celestial body , and brought eve , one of his wives , with him every man upon the earth , professing christians or non-professing , must hear it , and will know it sooner or later the transcript then reads : '' when the virgin mary conceived the child jesus , the father had begotten him in his own likeness i have given you a few leading items upon this subject , but a great deal more remains to be told '' young explained that adam '' was begotten by his father in heaven '' in the same way that adam begat his own sons and daughters , and that there were '' three distinct characters , namely , eloheim , yahovah , and michael '' . then , reiterating , he said that '' jesus , our elder brother , was begotten in the flesh by the same character that was in the garden of eden , and who is our father in heaven watt 's transcript of the sermon was the only known stenographic recording ; however , several other witnesses summarized it in their journals '' brigham young addresses 2:12 ; samuel hollister rogers journal 145 young taught that adam was the father of jesus and the only god to us wilford woodruff wrote that young said god went to the garden of eden with '' one of his wifes '' , that '' adam is michael or god and all the god that we have any thing to do with '' , and '' when the virgin mary was begotton with child it was by the father and in no other way ownly as we were begotton according to young , when a couple first become gods and goddesses , they first begin to create spiritual offspring he also reiterated the doctrine at the october 1854 general conference , journal of joseph l nevertheless , he later said : whether adam is the personage that we should consider our heavenly father , or not , is considerable of a mystery to a good many kimball stated his agreement that '' the god and father of jesus christ was adam '' journal of wilford woodruff , april 10 , 1852 richards , reported in '' minutes of the special general council '' , millennial star 16:534 , 26 august 1854 ( emphasis in original ) one published in 1856 , entitled '' we believe in our god '' , stated : '' we believe in our god the great prince of his race , / the archangel michael , the ancient of days , / our own father adam , earth 's lord , as is plain '' the first line of a poem published in 1861 , titled '' sons of michael '' , stated : '' sons of michael , he approaches ! / rise ; the eternal father greet '' the poem is included as a hymn in the current lds church hymnal , but the wording has been altered from '' eternal father '' to '' ancient father '' '' sons of michael , he approaches '' , hymns of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints , hymn 51 for instance , '' the lord made moses a god to pharaoh '' ( exodus 7:1 ) and as paul was '' as christ jesus '' to the galatians ( 4:14 ) in 1861 , he stated : some years ago , i advanced a doctrine with regard to adam being our father and god , that will be a curse to many of the elders of israel because of their folly george temple and after taking his evening meal , he attended a meeting with young , wilford woodruff , erastus snow , brigham young , jr at the end of his 1852 sermon , he stated , '' now , let all who may hear these doctrines , pause before they make light of them , or treat them with indifference , for they will prove their salvation or damnation mcconkie gave a speech elaborating upon the church 's position towards the adam–god theory : there are those who believe or say they believe that adam is our father and our god , that he is the father of our spirits and our bodies , and that he is the one we worship it is contrary to the whole plan of salvation set forth in the scriptures , and anyone who has read the book of moses , and anyone who has received the temple endowment and who yet believes the adam–god theory does not deserve to be saved thus the adam–god doctrine of young is simply a fuller understanding of the new testament doctrine of joint-heirs with christ

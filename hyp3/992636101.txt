though joseph smith , the founder of the latter day saint movement , never used the term '' adam–god '' in any of his recorded public statements , he provided several teachings from which the doctrine 's adherents draw support for example , smith taught in an 1839 sermon that adam was actually the archangel michael , who held the first presidency in the premortal life ( before the world was formed , the first presidency '' was first given to adam '' ) ; ( doctrine of adam as michael and as premortal first president cited as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) in the same sermon , smith taught that adam holds '' the keys of the universe , '' ( '' adam delivers up his stewardship to christ , that which was delivered to him as holding the keys of the universe , but retains his standing as head of the human family ( adam 's assignment of the keys of the universe cited as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) in 1840 , smith taught that adam is the one '' through whom christ has been revealed from heaven , and will continue to be revealed from henceforth '' ; ( adam-as-mediator doctrine cited as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) '' ( god '' once was a man like one of us and god himself , the father of us all , once dwelled on an earth the same as jesus christ himself did in the flesh '' ) ; ( citing teaching that god is an exalted man as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) ( citing minutes of meeting of the quorum of twelve , 4 april 1860 , in which it was recorded : '' it was joseph 's doctrine that adam was god '' ) ; ( citing wilford woodruff journal of 4 september 1860 , in which george q cannon said '' that adam is our father and is a true doctrine revealed from god to joseph & brigham '' ) ; ( citing wilford woodruff journal of 16 december 1867 , stating that '' president young said adam was michael the archangel , & he was the father of jesus christ & was our god & that joseph taught this principle however , the prevailing academic view is that the doctrine taught by young and others was an elaboration of smith 's vague references to adam 's unique role in mormon doctrine the adam–god doctrine teaches that adam is the father of both the spirits and physical bodies of all humans born on earth , including jesus ( describing the adam–god doctrine as '' that adam was at once the spiritual as well as the physical father of all persons born on this world , including jesus christ '' ) under the doctrine , adam had a number of roles '' michael was not the only creator god , however , as he was a member of a council of earth 's creator gods , which also included the gods '' elohim '' and '' jehovah they made this earth and michael became adam michael was selected by the heads of this council of gods to be the father of this earth the names '' adam '' and '' eve '' are titles that reflect their roles as the parents of humanity , adam meaning man or '' father of mankind '' and eve meaning the '' mothers of all living '' the privilege of peopling the earth was part of adam and eve 's eternal purpose as exalted beings and eternal parents of their spirit children to bear mortal children , adam and eve had to take on mortal bodies the bodies of adam and eve fell to a mortal state when they ate the fruit of tree of knowledge of good and evil in the garden of eden the naming of adam-ondi-ahman is also recorded in the history of the reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints in volume 2 , chapter 9 , pages 153–154 finally , the doctrine teaches that michael/adam was the literal , biological father of the mortal body of jesus . watt published the sermon in 1854 in the british periodical journal of discourses , which was endorsed by young and his counselors in the church 's first presidency the transcript reads : when our father adam came into the garden of eden , he came into it with a celestial body , and brought eve , one of his wives , with him every man upon the earth , professing christians or non-professing , must hear it , and will know it sooner or later the transcript then reads : '' when the virgin mary conceived the child jesus , the father had begotten him in his own likeness '' young explained that adam '' was begotten by his father in heaven '' in the same way that adam begat his own sons and daughters , and that there were '' three distinct characters , namely , eloheim , yahovah , and michael '' . then , reiterating , he said that '' jesus , our elder brother , was begotten in the flesh by the same character that was in the garden of eden , and who is our father in heaven young taught that adam was the father of jesus and the only god to us wilford woodruff wrote that young said god went to the garden of eden with '' one of his wifes '' , that '' adam is michael or god and all the god that we have any thing to do with '' , and '' when the virgin mary was begotton with child it was by the father and in no other way ownly as we were begotton young concluded , '' i could tell you much more about this ; but were i to tell you the whole truth , blasphemy would be nothing to it , in the estimation of the superstitious and overrighteous mankind in a special conference on august 28 , 1852 , young explained in greater detail the mechanism by which celestial beings like adam and eve could give birth to mortal offspring he also reiterated the doctrine at the october 1854 general conference , journal of joseph l in a sermon that was reported to have '' held the vast audience as it were spellbound '' minutes of the general conference , deseret news , october 12 , 1853 in the october conference , young is reported as clarifying that adam and eve were '' natural father and mother of every spirit that comes to this planet , or that receives tabernacles on this planet , consequently we are brother and sisters , and that adam was god , our eternal father nevertheless , he later said : whether adam is the personage that we should consider our heavenly father , or not , is considerable of a mystery to a good many i do not care for one moment how that is ; it is no matter whether we are to consider him our god , or whether his father , or his grandfather , for in either case we are of one species of one family and jesus christ is also of our species . initial reactions to the doctrine while many accepted the doctrine , others regarded it as misguided , or interpreted it to adhere to their prior understanding for example , the clerk of the conference , thomas bullock , recorded that during young 's sermon , '' the holy ghost rested upon him with great power '' richards , accepted the doctrine '' that adam is our father and our god '' as well , stating in a conference held in june 1854 that '' the prophet and apostle brigham has declared it , and that it is the word of the lord '' that first man sent his own son to redeem the world a number of hymns acknowledging this doctrine were sung in local congregations of the lds church acceptance of the doctrine by the lds church continued through the 19th century most significantly , apostle and philosopher orson pratt disagreed with the doctrine , and expressed that disagreement publicly journal of thomas evans jeremy sr , september 30 , 1852 ( '' also he did not believe that father adam had flesh and bones , when he came to the garden of eden , but he and his wife eve were spirits , and that god formed their bodies out of the dust of the ground , and the ( sic ) became a living souls he also said that he believed that jesus christ and adam are brothers in the spirit , and that adam is not the god that he is praying unto had i revealed the doctrine of baptism from sic the dead instead of joseph smith there are men around me who would have ridiculed the idea until dooms day sic ? ( citing minutes of meeting of the quorum of twelve , 4 april 1860 , in which it was recorded : '' it was joseph 's doctrine that adam was god ( citing wilford woodruff journal of 16 december 1867 , stating that '' president young said adam was michael the archangel , & he was the father of jesus christ & was our god & that joseph taught this principle on this earth he had lived on an earth similar to ours … and had begotten all the spirit that was to come to this earth '' adam is our father and god and no use to discuss it with the josephites reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints or any one else if any of you have been confused by false teachers who come among us , if you have been assailed by advocates of erroneous doctrines , counsel with your priesthood leaders salt lake city , utah : truth publishing company , 1963 thus the adam–god doctrine of young is simply a fuller understanding of the new testament doctrine of joint-heirs with christ musser , michael , our father and our god , truth publishing , 1938

though joseph smith , the founder of the latter day saint movement , never used the term '' adam–god '' in any of his recorded public statements , he provided several teachings from which the doctrine 's adherents draw support for example , smith taught in an 1839 sermon that adam was actually the archangel michael , who held the first presidency in the premortal life ( before the world was formed , the first presidency '' was first given to adam '' ) ; ( doctrine of adam as michael and as premortal first president cited as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) in the same sermon , smith taught that adam holds '' the keys of the universe , '' ( '' adam delivers up his stewardship to christ , that which was delivered to him as holding the keys of the universe , but retains his standing as head of the human family ( adam 's assignment of the keys of the universe cited as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) in 1840 , smith taught that adam is the one '' through whom christ has been revealed from heaven , and will continue to be revealed from henceforth '' ; ( adam-as-mediator doctrine cited as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) finally , smith taught in his 1844 king follett discourse that god was once a man '' like one of us '' ) ; ( citing teaching that god is an exalted man as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) cannon said '' that adam is our father and is a true doctrine revealed from god to joseph & brigham for this same doctrine is taught in some of the old jewish records which have never been in print '' ) ; ( citing wilford woodruff journal of 16 december 1867 , stating that '' president young said adam was michael the archangel , & he was the father of jesus christ & was our god & that joseph taught this principle ; ( '' young 's adam–god teachings were an expansion of joseph smith 's sermons in 1839-44 '' ) ; ( stating that there is '' no reliable evidence contemporary to smith 's lifetime which lends support '' to the view that smith taught the adam–god doctrine , and that young '' was not above inventing support for beliefs where none existed previously '' ) although young is generally credited with originating the doctrine , the original source may also have been young 's counselor in the first presidency , heber c stenhouse both attributed the doctrine to kimball ) the adam–god doctrine teaches that adam is the father of both the spirits and physical bodies of all humans born on earth , including jesus ( describing the adam–god doctrine as '' that adam was at once the spiritual as well as the physical father of all persons born on this world , including jesus christ '' ) '' michael was not the only creator god , however , as he was a member of a council of earth 's creator gods , which also included the gods '' elohim '' and '' jehovah '' in smith 's original endowment ceremony , the gods involved in the creation were called '' elohim , jehovah , and michael , '' but unlike in modern mormon theology , '' jehovah '' was not identified as jesus smith journal , 6/17/1871 ) ( describing michael as a '' god in the council of gods '' also , the doctrine teaches that michael was the father of the spirits in heaven who are associated with this earth next , the doctrine teaches that michael came to the earth with one of his wives , where they became known as adam and eve , and became the progenitor of the human race and the father of mortal bodies of all his spirit offspring so that they could progress and achieve godhood like themselves the names '' adam '' and '' eve '' are titles that reflect their roles as the parents of humanity , adam meaning man or '' father of mankind '' and eve meaning the '' mothers of all living '' the privilege of peopling the earth was part of adam and eve 's eternal purpose as exalted beings and eternal parents of their spirit children to bear mortal children , adam and eve had to take on mortal bodies the bodies of adam and eve fell to a mortal state when they ate the fruit of tree of knowledge of good and evil in the garden of eden . then , the doctrine teaches that after his mortal existence , adam returned to his throne and reigned as the immortal god of this earth ( noting that in the late 19th century , several mormon leaders who still adhered to the adam–god doctrine began to adopt the modern mormon belief that the old testament deity was also jesus ) smith taught that a similar gathering is to prelude the second coming of christ whether or not smith had taught the doctrine , the first recorded explanation of the doctrine using the term '' adam–god '' was by young , who first taught the doctrine at the church 's spring general conference on april 9 , 1852 . watt published the sermon in 1854 in the british periodical journal of discourses , which was endorsed by young and his counselors in the church 's first presidency . in watt 's transcript of the sermon , young said he intended to discuss '' who it was that begat the son of the virgin mary , '' a subject which he said '' has remained a mystery in this kingdom up to this day he is michael , the archangel , the ancient of days ! about whom holy men have written and spoken & mdash ; he is our father and our god , and the only god with whom we have to do i have given you a few leading items upon this subject , but a great deal more remains to be told . then , reiterating , he said that '' jesus , our elder brother , was begotten in the flesh by the same character that was in the garden of eden , and who is our father in heaven young taught that adam was the father of jesus and the only god to us now , let all who may hear these doctrines , pause before they make light of them , or treat them with indifference , for they will prove their salvation or damnation according to young , when a couple first become gods and goddesses , they first begin to create spiritual offspring this is what adam and eve did , young said , and '' adam is my father '' in a sermon that was reported to have '' held the vast audience as it were spellbound '' minutes of the general conference , deseret news , october 12 , 1853 when young discussed the doctrine again in early 1857 , he emphasized again that '' to become acquainted with our father and our god '' was '' one of the first principles of the doctrine of salvation '' , and that '' no man can enjoy or be prepared for eternal life without that knowledge '' nevertheless , he later said : whether adam is the personage that we should consider our heavenly father , or not , is considerable of a mystery to a good many i do not care for one moment how that is ; it is no matter whether we are to consider him our god , or whether his father , or his grandfather , for in either case we are of one species of one family and jesus christ is also of our species the reaction within the mormon community to young 's adam–god teachings was mixed young 's initial 1852 announcement of the doctrine was greeted by some as prophetic kimball readily adopted young 's views , and preached on june 29 , 1856 , that '' i have learned by experience that there is but one god that pertains to this people , and he is the god that pertains to this earth—the first man a number of hymns acknowledging this doctrine were sung in local congregations of the lds church one published in 1856 , entitled '' we believe in our god '' , stated : '' we believe in our god the great prince of his race , / the archangel michael , the ancient of days , / our own father adam , earth 's lord , as is plain '' the first line of a poem published in 1861 , titled '' sons of michael '' , stated : '' sons of michael , he approaches ! / rise ; the eternal father greet '' acceptance of the doctrine by the lds church continued through the 19th century cannon , a member of the first presidency , when asked by his son about the conception of jesus by mary , asked '' what was to prevent father adam from visiting and overshadowing the mother of jesus ? '' daily journal of abraham h however , some prominent members of the church took issue with the doctrine , september 30 , 1852 ( '' also he did not believe that father adam had flesh and bones , when he came to the garden of eden , but he and his wife eve were spirits , and that god formed their bodies out of the dust of the ground , and the ( sic ) became a living souls orson pratt , '' the pre-existence of man '' , the seer , 1:3 , 158–59 ( march , october 1853 ) for example , he stated that on the way to exaltation , one would have to '' pass by '' and '' pay tribute to '' various apostles and prophets , then jesus , and '' at length '' this confession was negotiated during a series of meetings among the church hierarchy richards who , according to one researcher , interpreted the idea of adam being '' our god '' or '' our father '' as meaning merely that adam , as the first mortal man , stands at the head of the human family in this way , adam as our great progenitor , will preside over the human family as '' father and god robinson , '' the apocalypse of adam '' , byu studies , vol then was adam our god , or did god become adam ? ridiculous ! adam was neither god nor the only begotten son of god thus the adam–god doctrine of young is simply a fuller understanding of the new testament doctrine of joint-heirs with christ

though joseph smith , the founder of the latter day saint movement , never used the term '' adam–god '' in any of his recorded public statements , he provided several teachings from which the doctrine 's adherents draw support for example , smith taught in an 1839 sermon that adam was actually the archangel michael , who held the first presidency in the premortal life he is michael the archangel , spoken of in the scriptures '' ) ; ( doctrine of adam as michael and as premortal first president cited as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) in the same sermon , smith taught that adam holds '' the keys of the universe , '' ( '' adam delivers up his stewardship to christ , that which was delivered to him as holding the keys of the universe , but retains his standing as head of the human family ( adam 's assignment of the keys of the universe cited as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) in 1840 , smith taught that adam is the one '' through whom christ has been revealed from heaven , and will continue to be revealed from henceforth '' ; ( adam-as-mediator doctrine cited as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) finally , smith taught in his 1844 king follett discourse that god was once a man '' like one of us god himself , the father of us all , once dwelled on an earth the same as jesus christ himself did in the flesh '' ) ; ( citing teaching that god is an exalted man as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) young and other adherents of the doctrine claim that smith was its originator ; ; ( same ) ; ; ( citing minutes of meeting of the quorum of twelve , 4 april 1860 , in which it was recorded : '' it was joseph 's doctrine that adam was god cannon said '' that adam is our father and is a true doctrine revealed from god to joseph & brigham for this same doctrine is taught in some of the old jewish records which have never been in print '' ) ; ( citing wilford woodruff journal of 16 december 1867 , stating that '' president young said adam was michael the archangel , & he was the father of jesus christ & was our god & that joseph taught this principle however , the prevailing academic view is that the doctrine taught by young and others was an elaboration of smith 's vague references to adam 's unique role in mormon doctrine although young is generally credited with originating the doctrine , the original source may also have been young 's counselor in the first presidency , heber c the adam–god doctrine teaches that adam is the father of both the spirits and physical bodies of all humans born on earth , including jesus ( describing the adam–god doctrine as '' that adam was at once the spiritual as well as the physical father of all persons born on this world , including jesus christ '' ) they made this earth and michael became adam michael was selected by the heads of this council of gods to be the father of this earth also , the doctrine teaches that michael was the father of the spirits in heaven who are associated with this earth . with eve , and possibly his other wives , michael had fathered the spirits of spirit offspring in the preexistence next , the doctrine teaches that michael came to the earth with one of his wives , where they became known as adam and eve , and became the progenitor of the human race and the father of mortal bodies of all his spirit offspring so that they could progress and achieve godhood like themselves the names '' adam '' and '' eve '' are titles that reflect their roles as the parents of humanity , adam meaning man or '' father of mankind '' and eve meaning the '' mothers of all living '' the privilege of peopling the earth was part of adam and eve 's eternal purpose as exalted beings and eternal parents of their spirit children to bear mortal children , adam and eve had to take on mortal bodies the bodies of adam and eve fell to a mortal state when they ate the fruit of tree of knowledge of good and evil in the garden of eden . then , the doctrine teaches that after his mortal existence , adam returned to his throne and reigned as the immortal god of this earth . he is thus considered to be the biblical god of israel smith taught that a similar gathering is to prelude the second coming of christ the naming of adam-ondi-ahman is also recorded in the history of the reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints in volume 2 , chapter 9 , pages 153–154 ; ( describing the adam–god doctrine as '' that adam was at once the spiritual as well as the physical father of all persons born on this world , including jesus christ '' ) whether or not smith had taught the doctrine , the first recorded explanation of the doctrine using the term '' adam–god '' was by young , who first taught the doctrine at the church 's spring general conference on april 9 , 1852 . watt published the sermon in 1854 in the british periodical journal of discourses , which was endorsed by young and his counselors in the church 's first presidency he is michael , the archangel , the ancient of days ! about whom holy men have written and spoken & mdash ; he is our father and our god , and the only god with whom we have to do again , they will try to tell how the divinity of jesus is joined to his humanity , and exhaust all their mental faculties , and wind up with this profound language , as describing the soul of man , '' it is an immaterial substance ! '' what a learned idea ! jesus , our elder brother , was begotten in the flesh by the same character that was in the garden of eden , and who is our father in heaven i have given you a few leading items upon this subject , but a great deal more remains to be told young taught that adam was the father of jesus and the only god to us '' diary of hosea stout 2:435 ( april 9 , 1852 ) wilford woodruff wrote that young said god went to the garden of eden with '' one of his wifes '' , that '' adam is michael or god and all the god that we have any thing to do with '' , and '' when the virgin mary was begotton with child it was by the father and in no other way ownly as we were begotton now , let all who may hear these doctrines , pause before they make light of them , or treat them with indifference , for they will prove their salvation or damnation in a special conference on august 28 , 1852 , young explained in greater detail the mechanism by which celestial beings like adam and eve could give birth to mortal offspring this is what adam and eve did , young said , and '' adam is my father '' in a sermon that was reported to have '' held the vast audience as it were spellbound '' minutes of the general conference , deseret news , october 12 , 1853 in the october conference , young is reported as clarifying that adam and eve were '' natural father and mother of every spirit that comes to this planet , or that receives tabernacles on this planet , consequently we are brother and sisters , and that adam was god , our eternal father when young discussed the doctrine again in early 1857 , he emphasized again that '' to become acquainted with our father and our god '' was '' one of the first principles of the doctrine of salvation '' , and that '' no man can enjoy or be prepared for eternal life without that knowledge '' nevertheless , he later said : whether adam is the personage that we should consider our heavenly father , or not , is considerable of a mystery to a good many i do not care for one moment how that is ; it is no matter whether we are to consider him our god , or whether his father , or his grandfather , for in either case we are of one species of one family and jesus christ is also of our species for example , the clerk of the conference , thomas bullock , recorded that during young 's sermon , '' the holy ghost rested upon him with great power '' thomas bullock , minutes of the lds general conference deseret news , april 17 , 1852 , p another apostle , franklin d richards , reported in '' minutes of the special general council '' , millennial star 16:534 , 26 august 1854 ( emphasis in original ) kimball readily adopted young 's views , and preached on june 29 , 1856 , that '' i have learned by experience that there is but one god that pertains to this people , and he is the god that pertains to this earth—the first man a number of hymns acknowledging this doctrine were sung in local congregations of the lds church sacred hymns and spiritual songs for the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints ( 11th ed the first line of a poem published in 1861 , titled '' sons of michael '' , stated : '' sons of michael , he approaches ! / rise ; the eternal father greet '' '' sons of michael , he approaches '' , hymns of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints , hymn 51 in 1861 , he stated : some years ago , i advanced a doctrine with regard to adam being our father and god , that will be a curse to many of the elders of israel because of their folly beginning around 1892 , church leaders privately decided to no longer publicly teach the doctrine thus the adam–god doctrine of young is simply a fuller understanding of the new testament doctrine of joint-heirs with christ

though joseph smith , the founder of the latter day saint movement , never used the term '' adam–god '' in any of his recorded public statements , he provided several teachings from which the doctrine 's adherents draw support for example , smith taught in an 1839 sermon that adam was actually the archangel michael , who held the first presidency in the premortal life ( before the world was formed , the first presidency '' was first given to adam he is michael the archangel , spoken of in the scriptures '' ) ; ( doctrine of adam as michael and as premortal first president cited as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) in the same sermon , smith taught that adam holds '' the keys of the universe , '' ( '' adam delivers up his stewardship to christ , that which was delivered to him as holding the keys of the universe , but retains his standing as head of the human family and so it is through his authority that all priesthood '' keys , '' the abilities to unlock particular priesthood powers , are revealed from heaven ( adam 's assignment of the keys of the universe cited as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) in 1840 , smith taught that adam is the one '' through whom christ has been revealed from heaven , and will continue to be revealed from henceforth '' ; ( adam-as-mediator doctrine cited as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) finally , smith taught in his 1844 king follett discourse that god was once a man '' like one of us '' ( god '' once was a man like one of us and god himself , the father of us all , once dwelled on an earth the same as jesus christ himself did in the flesh '' ) ; ( citing teaching that god is an exalted man as a precursor for the adam–god doctrine ) young and other adherents of the doctrine claim that smith was its originator ; ; ( same ) ; ; ( citing minutes of meeting of the quorum of twelve , 4 april 1860 , in which it was recorded : '' it was joseph 's doctrine that adam was god cannon said '' that adam is our father and is a true doctrine revealed from god to joseph & brigham for this same doctrine is taught in some of the old jewish records which have never been in print '' ) ; ( citing wilford woodruff journal of 16 december 1867 , stating that '' president young said adam was michael the archangel , & he was the father of jesus christ & was our god & that joseph taught this principle the adam–god doctrine teaches that adam is the father of both the spirits and physical bodies of all humans born on earth , including jesus he and his wife , eve , had become gods by living a mortal life , becoming resurrected , and receiving their exaltation . as a god before the creation of the earth , he was known as michael , or the '' ancient of days smith that '' elohim , jehovah and michael are father , son , and grandson they made this earth and michael became adam smith journal , 6/17/1871 ) ( describing michael as a '' god in the council of gods '' michael was selected by the heads of this council of gods to be the father of this earth also , the doctrine teaches that michael was the father of the spirits in heaven who are associated with this earth . with eve , and possibly his other wives , michael had fathered the spirits of spirit offspring in the preexistence to bear mortal children , adam and eve had to take on mortal bodies the bodies of adam and eve fell to a mortal state when they ate the fruit of tree of knowledge of good and evil in the garden of eden . then , the doctrine teaches that after his mortal existence , adam returned to his throne and reigned as the immortal god of this earth the naming of adam-ondi-ahman is also recorded in the history of the reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints in volume 2 , chapter 9 , pages 153–154 ; ( describing the adam–god doctrine as '' that adam was at once the spiritual as well as the physical father of all persons born on this world , including jesus christ '' ) . in watt 's transcript of the sermon , young said he intended to discuss '' who it was that begat the son of the virgin mary , '' a subject which he said '' has remained a mystery in this kingdom up to this day he helped to make and organize this world he is michael , the archangel , the ancient of days !

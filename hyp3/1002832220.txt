mary 's magnificat , recorded only in luke 's gospel , is one of four hymns , distilled from a collection of early jewish-christian canticles , which complement the promise-fulfillment theme of luke 's nativity of jesus these songs are mary 's magnificat ; zechariah 's benedictus ( 1:67–79 ) ; the angels ' gloria in excelsis deo ( 2:13–14 ) ; and simeon 's ( 2:28–32 ) in form and content , these four canticles are patterned on the '' hymns of praise '' in israel 's psalter '' the balance of the opening two lines bursts out into a dual magnificat of declaring the greatness of and finding delight in god although there is some scholarly discussion of whether the historical mary herself actually proclaimed this canticle , luke portrays her as the singer of this song of reversals and the interpreter of the contemporary events taking place mary symbolizes both israelites and the lucan faith-community as the author/singer of the magnificat the canticle echoes several biblical passages , but the most pronounced allusions are to the song of hannah , from the books of samuel scriptural echoes from the torah , the nevi'im , and the ketuvim complement the main allusions to hannah 's '' magnificat of rejoicing '' as with other canticles and psalms , western liturgical tradition usually adds the doxology known as gloria patri to the end of the magnificat in a style reminiscent of old testament poetry and song , mary praises the lord in alignment with this structure : mary rejoices that she has the privilege of giving birth to the promised messiah mary looks forward to god transforming the world through the messiah the proud will be brought low , and the humble will be lifted up ; the hungry will be fed , and the rich will go without in anglican , lutheran , and catholic services , the magnificat is generally followed by the gloria patri in orthodox liturgical practice , the magnificat is always sung during the matins service before the irmos of the ninth ode of the canon '' the 'merciless ' magnificat '' : a magnificat reflection by father johann roten , s.m the magnificat exegesis and sermon study of luke 1:46–55 : the magnificat , by curtis a

psycholinguistics is an interdisciplinary field that consists of researchers from a variety of different backgrounds , including psychology , cognitive science , linguistics , speech and language pathology , and discourse analysis a researcher interested in language production might study how words are prepared to be spoken starting from the conceptual or semantic level ( this concerns connotation , and possibly can be examined through the conceptual framework concerned with the semantic differential ) developmental linguistics study infants ' and children 's ability to learn and process language psycholinguistics further divide their studies according to the different components that make up human language within psycholinguistics , research focuses on how the brain processes and understands these sounds in seeking to understand the properties of language acquisition , psycholinguistics has roots in debates regarding innate versus acquired behaviors ( both in biology and psychology ) for some time , the concept of an innate trait was something that was not recognized in studying the psychology of the individual after the diminished popularity of the behaviorism model , ethology reemerged as a leading train of thought within psychology , allowing the subject of language , an innate behavior , to be examined once more within the scope of psychology the theoretical framework for psycholinguistics began to be developed before the end of the 19th century as the '' psychology of language '' the science of psycholinguistics , so called , began in 1936 when jacob kantor , a prominent psychologist at the time , used the term '' psycholinguistic '' as a description within his book an objective psychology of grammar psycholinguistics was used for the first time to talk about an interdisciplinary science '' that could be coherent '' , as well as being the title of psycholinguistics : a survey of theory and research problems , a 1954 book by charles e chomsky posited that humans possess a special , innate ability for language , and that syntactic structures , such as recursion , are '' hard-wired '' in the brain when chomsky asserted that children acquiring a language have a vast search space to explore among all possible human grammars , there was no evidence that children received poverty of the stimulus all the rules of their language hence , there must be some other innate mechanism that endows humans with the ability to learn language the view in favor of chomsky still holds that the human ability to use language ( specifically the ability to use recursion ) is qualitatively different from any sort of animal ability the view that language must be learned was especially popular before 1960 and is well represented by the mentalistic theories of jean piaget and the empiricist rudolf carnap with the increase in computer technology since the 1980s , researchers have been able to simulate language acquisition using neural network models these models provide evidence that there may be sufficient information contained in the input to learn language , even syntax one question in the realm of language comprehension is how people understand sentences as they read ( i.e these theories are typically concerned with the types of information , contained in the sentence , that the reader can use to build meaning , and at what point in reading does that information becomes available to the reader assuming that eye movements are closely linked to the current focus of attention , language processing can be studied by monitoring eye movements while a subject is listening to spoken language speech errors tend to occur in the lexeme , morpheme , and phoneme encoding steps of language production , as seen by the ways errors can manifest themselves where an illness made brain surgery necessary , language researchers had an opportunity to pursue their research psycholinguistics is concerned with the nature of the processes that the brain undergoes in order to comprehend and produce language another unanswered question in psycholinguistics is whether the human ability to use syntax originates from innate mental structures or social interaction , and whether or not some animals can be taught the syntax of human language

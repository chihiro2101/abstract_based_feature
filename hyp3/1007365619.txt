psycholinguistics is an interdisciplinary field that consists of researchers from a variety of different backgrounds , including psychology , cognitive science , linguistics , speech and language pathology , and discourse analysis a researcher interested in language production might study how words are prepared to be spoken starting from the conceptual or semantic level ( this concerns connotation , and possibly can be examined through the conceptual framework concerned with the semantic differential ) developmental linguistics study infants ' and children 's ability to learn and process language psycholinguistics further divide their studies according to the different components that make up human language within psycholinguistics , research focuses on how the brain processes and understands these sounds morphology is the study of word structures , especially between related words ( such as dog and dogs ) and the formation of words based on rules ( such as plural formation ) where syntax is concerned with the formal structure of sentences , semantics deals with the actual meaning of sentences in seeking to understand the properties of language acquisition , psycholinguistics has roots in debates regarding innate versus acquired behaviors ( both in biology and psychology ) however , with the redefinition of innateness as time progressed , behaviors considered innate could once again be analyzed as behaviors that interacted with the psychological aspect of an individual after the diminished popularity of the behaviorism model , ethology reemerged as a leading train of thought within psychology , allowing the subject of language , an innate behavior , to be examined once more within the scope of psychology the theoretical framework for psycholinguistics began to be developed before the end of the 19th century as the '' psychology of language '' the science of psycholinguistics , so called , began in 1936 when jacob kantor , a prominent psychologist at the time , used the term '' psycholinguistic '' as a description within his book an objective psychology of grammar when chomsky asserted that children acquiring a language have a vast search space to explore among all possible human grammars , there was no evidence that children received poverty of the stimulus all the rules of their language hence , there must be some other innate mechanism that endows humans with the ability to learn language according to the '' innateness hypothesis '' , such a language faculty is what defines human language and makes that faculty different from even the most sophisticated forms of animal communication the field of linguistics and psycholinguistics has since been defined by pro-and-con reactions to chomsky the view in favor of chomsky still holds that the human ability to use language ( specifically the ability to use recursion ) is qualitatively different from any sort of animal ability the view that language must be learned was especially popular before 1960 and is well represented by the mentalistic theories of jean piaget and the empiricist rudolf carnap these models provide evidence that there may be sufficient information contained in the input to learn language , even syntax these theories are typically concerned with the types of information , contained in the sentence , that the reader can use to build meaning , and at what point in reading does that information becomes available to the reader for example , one influential theory of sentence processing , the '' garden-path theory '' , states that syntactic analysis takes place first rather , their language faculty is constantly tapped during the speech production process errors of speech , in particular , grant insight into how the mind produces language while a speaker is mid-utterance psycholinguistics is concerned with the nature of the processes that the brain undergoes in order to comprehend and produce language studies in aphasiology can offer both advances in therapy for individuals suffering from aphasia and further insight into how the brain processes language .

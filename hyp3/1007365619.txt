psycholinguistics is an interdisciplinary field that consists of researchers from a variety of different backgrounds , including psychology , cognitive science , linguistics , speech and language pathology , and discourse analysis a researcher interested in language production might study how words are prepared to be spoken starting from the conceptual or semantic level ( this concerns connotation , and possibly can be examined through the conceptual framework concerned with the semantic differential ) developmental linguistics study infants ' and children 's ability to learn and process language psycholinguistics further divide their studies according to the different components that make up human language linguistics-related areas include : phonetics and phonology are the study of speech sounds within psycholinguistics , research focuses on how the brain processes and understands these sounds morphology is the study of word structures , especially between related words ( such as dog and dogs ) and the formation of words based on rules ( such as plural formation ) in seeking to understand the properties of language acquisition , psycholinguistics has roots in debates regarding innate versus acquired behaviors ( both in biology and psychology ) however , with the redefinition of innateness as time progressed , behaviors considered innate could once again be analyzed as behaviors that interacted with the psychological aspect of an individual the theoretical framework for psycholinguistics began to be developed before the end of the 19th century as the '' psychology of language '' the science of psycholinguistics , so called , began in 1936 when jacob kantor , a prominent psychologist at the time , used the term '' psycholinguistic '' as a description within his book an objective psychology of grammar psycholinguistics was used for the first time to talk about an interdisciplinary science '' that could be coherent '' , as well as being the title of psycholinguistics : a survey of theory and research problems , a 1954 book by charles e chomsky posited that humans possess a special , innate ability for language , and that syntactic structures , such as recursion , are '' hard-wired '' in the brain hence , there must be some other innate mechanism that endows humans with the ability to learn language according to the '' innateness hypothesis '' , such a language faculty is what defines human language and makes that faculty different from even the most sophisticated forms of animal communication the view in favor of chomsky still holds that the human ability to use language ( specifically the ability to use recursion ) is qualitatively different from any sort of animal ability the view that language must be learned was especially popular before 1960 and is well represented by the mentalistic theories of jean piaget and the empiricist rudolf carnap with the increase in computer technology since the 1980s , researchers have been able to simulate language acquisition using neural network models these models provide evidence that there may be sufficient information contained in the input to learn language , even syntax experimental research has spawned several theories about the architecture and mechanisms of sentence comprehension language production refers to how people produce language , either in written or spoken form , in a way that conveys meanings comprehensible to others recently , eye tracking has been used to study online language processing the analysis of systematic speech error , as well as the writing and typing of language , can provide evidence of the process that has generated it other examples of computational modelling are mcclelland and elman 's trace model of speech perception and franklin chang 's dual-path model of sentence production two other major subfields of psycholinguistics investigate first language acquisition , the process by which infants acquire language , and second language acquisition

psycholinguistics is an interdisciplinary field that consists of researchers from a variety of different backgrounds , including psychology , cognitive science , linguistics , speech and language pathology , and discourse analysis a researcher interested in language production might study how words are prepared to be spoken starting from the conceptual or semantic level ( this concerns connotation , and possibly can be examined through the conceptual framework concerned with the semantic differential ) developmental linguistics study infants ' and children 's ability to learn and process language psycholinguistics further divide their studies according to the different components that make up human language morphology is the study of word structures , especially between related words ( such as dog and dogs ) and the formation of words based on rules ( such as plural formation ) in seeking to understand the properties of language acquisition , psycholinguistics has roots in debates regarding innate versus acquired behaviors ( both in biology and psychology ) after the diminished popularity of the behaviorism model , ethology reemerged as a leading train of thought within psychology , allowing the subject of language , an innate behavior , to be examined once more within the scope of psychology the theoretical framework for psycholinguistics began to be developed before the end of the 19th century as the '' psychology of language '' however , the term '' psycholinguistics '' only came into widespread usage in 1946 when kantor 's student nicholas pronko published an article entitled '' psycholinguistics : a review '' chomsky posited that humans possess a special , innate ability for language , and that syntactic structures , such as recursion , are '' hard-wired '' in the brain when chomsky asserted that children acquiring a language have a vast search space to explore among all possible human grammars , there was no evidence that children received poverty of the stimulus all the rules of their language according to the '' innateness hypothesis '' , such a language faculty is what defines human language and makes that faculty different from even the most sophisticated forms of animal communication with the increase in computer technology since the 1980s , researchers have been able to simulate language acquisition using neural network models these models provide evidence that there may be sufficient information contained in the input to learn language , even syntax if this is true , then an innate mechanism is no longer necessary to explain language acquisition these theories are typically concerned with the types of information , contained in the sentence , that the reader can use to build meaning , and at what point in reading does that information becomes available to the reader under this theory , as the reader is reading a sentence , he or she creates the simplest structure possible , to minimize effort and cognitive load hence , in the sentence '' the evidence examined by the lawyer turned out to be unreliable '' , by the time the reader gets to the word '' examined '' he or she has committed to a reading of the sentence in which the evidence is examining something because it is the simplest parsing under this '' syntax first '' theory , semantic information is processed at a later stage rather , their language faculty is constantly tapped during the speech production process morphologically complex words are assembled : errors involving blending within a word reflect that there seems to be a rule governing the construction of words in production ( and also likely in mental lexicon ) speech errors tend to occur in the lexeme , morpheme , and phoneme encoding steps of language production , as seen by the ways errors can manifest themselves speech errors will usually occur in the stages that involve lexical , morpheme , or phoneme encoding , and usually not in the first step of semantic encoding where an illness made brain surgery necessary , language researchers had an opportunity to pursue their research two other major subfields of psycholinguistics investigate first language acquisition , the process by which infants acquire language , and second language acquisition

psycholinguistics is an interdisciplinary field that consists of researchers from a variety of different backgrounds , including psychology , cognitive science , linguistics , speech and language pathology , and discourse analysis a researcher interested in language production might study how words are prepared to be spoken starting from the conceptual or semantic level ( this concerns connotation , and possibly can be examined through the conceptual framework concerned with the semantic differential ) developmental linguistics study infants ' and children 's ability to learn and process language psycholinguistics further divide their studies according to the different components that make up human language within psycholinguistics , research focuses on how the brain processes and understands these sounds morphology is the study of word structures , especially between related words ( such as dog and dogs ) and the formation of words based on rules ( such as plural formation ) in seeking to understand the properties of language acquisition , psycholinguistics has roots in debates regarding innate versus acquired behaviors ( both in biology and psychology ) for some time , the concept of an innate trait was something that was not recognized in studying the psychology of the individual however , with the redefinition of innateness as time progressed , behaviors considered innate could once again be analyzed as behaviors that interacted with the psychological aspect of an individual the theoretical framework for psycholinguistics began to be developed before the end of the 19th century as the '' psychology of language '' chomsky posited that humans possess a special , innate ability for language , and that syntactic structures , such as recursion , are '' hard-wired '' in the brain when chomsky asserted that children acquiring a language have a vast search space to explore among all possible human grammars , there was no evidence that children received poverty of the stimulus all the rules of their language hence , there must be some other innate mechanism that endows humans with the ability to learn language according to the '' innateness hypothesis '' , such a language faculty is what defines human language and makes that faculty different from even the most sophisticated forms of animal communication the view in favor of chomsky still holds that the human ability to use language ( specifically the ability to use recursion ) is qualitatively different from any sort of animal ability the view that language can be learned has had a recent resurgence inspired by emergentism with the increase in computer technology since the 1980s , researchers have been able to simulate language acquisition using neural network models if this is true , then an innate mechanism is no longer necessary to explain language acquisition the structures and uses of language are related to the formation of ontological insights this is a common psychological test , where the mind will often skip the second '' the '' , especially when there is a line break in between the two language production refers to how people produce language , either in written or spoken form , in a way that conveys meanings comprehensible to others sometimes the strings would be actual english words requiring a '' yes '' response , and other times they would be non-words requiring a '' no '' response until the recent advent of non-invasive medical techniques , brain surgery was the preferred way for language researchers to discover how language affects the brain two other major subfields of psycholinguistics investigate first language acquisition , the process by which infants acquire language , and second language acquisition it is much more difficult for adults to acquire second languages than it is for infants to learn their first language ( infants are able to learn more than one native language easily )

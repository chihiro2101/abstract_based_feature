psycholinguistics is an interdisciplinary field that consists of researchers from a variety of different backgrounds , including psychology , cognitive science , linguistics , speech and language pathology , and discourse analysis developmental linguistics study infants ' and children 's ability to learn and process language psycholinguistics further divide their studies according to the different components that make up human language within psycholinguistics , research focuses on how the brain processes and understands these sounds morphology is the study of word structures , especially between related words ( such as dog and dogs ) and the formation of words based on rules ( such as plural formation ) in seeking to understand the properties of language acquisition , psycholinguistics has roots in debates regarding innate versus acquired behaviors ( both in biology and psychology ) after the diminished popularity of the behaviorism model , ethology reemerged as a leading train of thought within psychology , allowing the subject of language , an innate behavior , to be examined once more within the scope of psychology however , the term '' psycholinguistics '' only came into widespread usage in 1946 when kantor 's student nicholas pronko published an article entitled '' psycholinguistics : a review '' psycholinguistics was used for the first time to talk about an interdisciplinary science '' that could be coherent '' , as well as being the title of psycholinguistics : a survey of theory and research problems , a 1954 book by charles e hence , there must be some other innate mechanism that endows humans with the ability to learn language the field of linguistics and psycholinguistics has since been defined by pro-and-con reactions to chomsky the view in favor of chomsky still holds that the human ability to use language ( specifically the ability to use recursion ) is qualitatively different from any sort of animal ability likewise , the behaviorist school of psychology puts forth the point of view that language is a behavior shaped by conditioned response ; hence it is learned with the increase in computer technology since the 1980s , researchers have been able to simulate language acquisition using neural network models these models provide evidence that there may be sufficient information contained in the input to learn language , even syntax if this is true , then an innate mechanism is no longer necessary to explain language acquisition '' deferring is normally done for a reason , and a rational person is always disposed to defer if there is good reason one question in the realm of language comprehension is how people understand sentences as they read ( i.e experimental research has spawned several theories about the architecture and mechanisms of sentence comprehension for example , one influential theory of sentence processing , the '' garden-path theory '' , states that syntactic analysis takes place first when reading , saccades can cause the mind to skip over words because it does not see them as important to the sentence , and the mind completely omits it from the sentence or supplies the wrong word in its stead language production refers to how people produce language , either in written or spoken form , in a way that conveys meanings comprehensible to others recently , eye tracking has been used to study online language processing until the recent advent of non-invasive medical techniques , brain surgery was the preferred way for language researchers to discover how language affects the brain psycholinguistics is concerned with the nature of the processes that the brain undergoes in order to comprehend and produce language

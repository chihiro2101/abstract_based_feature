what is commonly called bark includes a number of different tissues cork is an external , secondary tissue that is impermeable to water and gases , and is also called the phellem the cork is produced by the cork cambium which is a layer of meristematically active cells which serve as a lateral meristem for the periderm the cork cambium , which is also called the phellogen , is normally only one cell layer thick and it divides periclinally to the outside producing cork together , the phellem ( cork ) , phellogen ( cork cambium ) and phelloderm constitute the periderm the epidermis is a layer of cells that cover the plant body , including the stems , leaves , flowers and fruits , that protects the plant from the outside world in old stems the epidermal layer , cortex , and primary phloem become separated from the inner tissues by thicker formations of cork this dead layer is the rough corky bark that forms around tree trunks and other stems often a secondary covering called the periderm forms on small woody stems and many non-woody plants , which is composed of cork ( phellem ) , the cork cambium ( phellogen ) , and the phelloderm as the stems grow a layer of cells form under the epidermis , called the cork cambium , these cells produce cork cells that turn into cork the rhytidome is the most familiar part of bark , being the outer layer that covers the trunks of trees bark tissues make up by weight between 10â€“20 % of woody vascular plants and consists of various biopolymers , tannins , lignin , suberin , suberan and polysaccharides this could mean that the concentration and type of lignin units could provide additional resistance to fungal decay for plants protected by bark image : rindenmulch016.jpg thumb right barkdust cork , sometimes confused with bark in colloquial speech , is the outermost layer of a woody stem , derived from the cork cambium the inner bark ( phloem ) of some trees is edible ; in scandinavia , bark bread is made from rye to which the toasted and ground innermost layer of bark of scots pine or birch is added among the commercial products made from bark are cork , cinnamon , quinine duran-reynals , marie louise de ayala file : alder bark and callus.jpg alder bark ( alnus glutinosa ) with characteristic lenticels and abnormal lenticels on callused areas bark beetle bark painting trunk ( botany ) bark isolate bark-binding , a diseased condition of tree bark

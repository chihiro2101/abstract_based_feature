what is commonly called bark includes a number of different tissues cork is an external , secondary tissue that is impermeable to water and gases , and is also called the phellem the cork is produced by the cork cambium which is a layer of meristematically active cells which serve as a lateral meristem for the periderm the phelloderm , which is not always present in all barks , is a layer of cells formed by and interior to the cork cambium together , the phellem ( cork ) , phellogen ( cork cambium ) and phelloderm constitute the periderm in old stems the epidermal layer , cortex , and primary phloem become separated from the inner tissues by thicker formations of cork this dead layer is the rough corky bark that forms around tree trunks and other stems often a secondary covering called the periderm forms on small woody stems and many non-woody plants , which is composed of cork ( phellem ) , the cork cambium ( phellogen ) , and the phelloderm in woody plants the epidermis of newly grown stems is replaced by the periderm later in the year as the stems grow a layer of cells form under the epidermis , called the cork cambium , these cells produce cork cells that turn into cork a limited number of cell layers may form interior to the cork cambium , called the phelloderm within the periderm are lenticels , which form during the production of the first periderm layer the rhytidome is the most familiar part of bark , being the outer layer that covers the trunks of trees up to 40 % of the bark tissue is made of lignin , which forms an important part of a plant , providing structural support by crosslinking between different polysaccharides , such as cellulose in some plants , the bark is substantially thicker , providing further protection and giving the bark a characteristically distinctive structure with deep ridges bark chips generated as a by-product of lumber production are often used in bark mulch in western north america file : bark of an old sycamore.jpg the typical appearance of sycamore bark from an old tree bark beetle bark painting trunk ( botany ) bark isolate bark-binding , a diseased condition of tree bark

what is commonly called bark includes a number of different tissues cork is an external , secondary tissue that is impermeable to water and gases , and is also called the phellem the cork is produced by the cork cambium which is a layer of meristematically active cells which serve as a lateral meristem for the periderm the cork cambium , which is also called the phellogen , is normally only one cell layer thick and it divides periclinally to the outside producing cork the phelloderm , which is not always present in all barks , is a layer of cells formed by and interior to the cork cambium together , the phellem ( cork ) , phellogen ( cork cambium ) and phelloderm constitute the periderm , the cork cambium and the vascular cambium , are the only parts of a woody stem where cell division occurs ; undifferentiated cells in the vascular cambium divide rapidly to produce secondary xylem to the inside and secondary phloem to the outside this dead layer is the rough corky bark that forms around tree trunks and other stems often a secondary covering called the periderm forms on small woody stems and many non-woody plants , which is composed of cork ( phellem ) , the cork cambium ( phellogen ) , and the phelloderm as the stems grow a layer of cells form under the epidermis , called the cork cambium , these cells produce cork cells that turn into cork as the bark develops , new lenticels are formed within the cracks of the cork layers the rhytidome is the most familiar part of bark , being the outer layer that covers the trunks of trees bark tissues make up by weight between 10–20 % of woody vascular plants and consists of various biopolymers , tannins , lignin , suberin , suberan and polysaccharides condensed tannin , which is in fairly high concentration in bark tissue , is thought to inhibit decomposition in the cork oak ( quercus suber ) the bark is thick enough to be harvested as a cork product without killing the tree ; in this species the bark may get very thick ( e.g a number of living organisms live in or on bark , including insects , lieutier , françois file : bark nunniong.jpg eucalypt bark file : close-up of living bark on a tree in england.jpg close-up of living bark on a tree in england file : acer capillipes ( snakebark maple ) bark beetle bark painting trunk ( botany ) bark isolate bark-binding , a diseased condition of tree bark

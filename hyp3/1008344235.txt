what is commonly called bark includes a number of different tissues cork is an external , secondary tissue that is impermeable to water and gases , and is also called the phellem the cork is produced by the cork cambium which is a layer of meristematically active cells which serve as a lateral meristem for the periderm the cork cambium , which is also called the phellogen , is normally only one cell layer thick and it divides periclinally to the outside producing cork the phelloderm , which is not always present in all barks , is a layer of cells formed by and interior to the cork cambium together , the phellem ( cork ) , phellogen ( cork cambium ) and phelloderm constitute the periderm as the stem ages and grows , changes occur that transform the surface of the stem into the bark this dead layer is the rough corky bark that forms around tree trunks and other stems often a secondary covering called the periderm forms on small woody stems and many non-woody plants , which is composed of cork ( phellem ) , the cork cambium ( phellogen ) , and the phelloderm older phellem cells are dead , as is the case with woody stems as the stems grow a layer of cells form under the epidermis , called the cork cambium , these cells produce cork cells that turn into cork as the stem grows , the cork cambium produces new layers of cork which are impermeable to gases and water and the cells outside the periderm , namely the epidermis , cortex and older secondary phloem die as the bark develops , new lenticels are formed within the cracks of the cork layers it is composed mostly of dead cells and is produced by the formation of multiple layers of suberin periderm , cortical and phloem tissue in some plants , the bark is substantially thicker , providing further protection and giving the bark a characteristically distinctive structure with deep ridges bark chips generated as a by-product of lumber production are often used in bark mulch in western north america bark and wood boring insects in living trees in europe , a synthesis bark beetle bark painting trunk ( botany ) bark isolate bark-binding , a diseased condition of tree bark

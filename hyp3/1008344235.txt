what is commonly called bark includes a number of different tissues cork is an external , secondary tissue that is impermeable to water and gases , and is also called the phellem the cork cambium , which is also called the phellogen , is normally only one cell layer thick and it divides periclinally to the outside producing cork together , the phellem ( cork ) , phellogen ( cork cambium ) and phelloderm constitute the periderm in old stems the epidermal layer , cortex , and primary phloem become separated from the inner tissues by thicker formations of cork this dead layer is the rough corky bark that forms around tree trunks and other stems often a secondary covering called the periderm forms on small woody stems and many non-woody plants , which is composed of cork ( phellem ) , the cork cambium ( phellogen ) , and the phelloderm in woody plants the epidermis of newly grown stems is replaced by the periderm later in the year as the bark develops , new lenticels are formed within the cracks of the cork layers the rhytidome is the most familiar part of bark , being the outer layer that covers the trunks of trees the rhytidome is especially well developed in older stems and roots of trees in shrubs , older bark is quickly exfoliated and thick rhytidome accumulates up to 40 % of the bark tissue is made of lignin , which forms an important part of a plant , providing structural support by crosslinking between different polysaccharides , such as cellulose it could be due to this factor that the degradation of lignin is far less pronounced in bark tissue than it is in wood in some plants , the bark is substantially thicker , providing further protection and giving the bark a characteristically distinctive structure with deep ridges bark chips generated as a by-product of lumber production are often used in bark mulch in western north america file : alder bark and callus.jpg alder bark ( alnus glutinosa ) with characteristic lenticels and abnormal lenticels on callused areas bark beetle bark painting trunk ( botany ) bark isolate bark-binding , a diseased condition of tree bark

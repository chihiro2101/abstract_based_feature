cork is an external , secondary tissue that is impermeable to water and gases , and is also called the phellem the cork is produced by the cork cambium which is a layer of meristematically active cells which serve as a lateral meristem for the periderm the cork cambium , which is also called the phellogen , is normally only one cell layer thick and it divides periclinally to the outside producing cork the phelloderm , which is not always present in all barks , is a layer of cells formed by and interior to the cork cambium together , the phellem ( cork ) , phellogen ( cork cambium ) and phelloderm constitute the periderm , the cork cambium and the vascular cambium , are the only parts of a woody stem where cell division occurs ; undifferentiated cells in the vascular cambium divide rapidly to produce secondary xylem to the inside and secondary phloem to the outside the epidermis is a layer of cells that cover the plant body , including the stems , leaves , flowers and fruits , that protects the plant from the outside world often a secondary covering called the periderm forms on small woody stems and many non-woody plants , which is composed of cork ( phellem ) , the cork cambium ( phellogen ) , and the phelloderm as the stems grow a layer of cells form under the epidermis , called the cork cambium , these cells produce cork cells that turn into cork as the stem grows , the cork cambium produces new layers of cork which are impermeable to gases and water and the cells outside the periderm , namely the epidermis , cortex and older secondary phloem die as the bark develops , new lenticels are formed within the cracks of the cork layers the rhytidome is the most familiar part of bark , being the outer layer that covers the trunks of trees this could mean that the concentration and type of lignin units could provide additional resistance to fungal decay for plants protected by bark in some plants , the bark is substantially thicker , providing further protection and giving the bark a characteristically distinctive structure with deep ridges the inner bark ( phloem ) of some trees is edible ; in scandinavia , bark bread is made from rye to which the toasted and ground innermost layer of bark of scots pine or birch is added file : bark nunniong.jpg eucalypt bark file : close-up of living bark on a tree in england.jpg close-up of living bark on a tree in england file : acer capillipes ( snakebark maple ) file : bark of an old sycamore.jpg the typical appearance of sycamore bark from an old tree bark beetle bark painting trunk ( botany ) bark isolate bark-binding , a diseased condition of tree bark

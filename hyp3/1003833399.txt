beryllium copper is a ductile , weldable , and machinable alloy beryllium copper attains the greatest strength ( to of any copper-based alloy c17200 copper has the strength and hardness similar to that of steel and rockwell hardness properties in its peaked age condition are in the range of 200 ksi and rc45 copper alloys in general have always been considered non-sparking c17200 has the strength to withstand the use of a hand and mechanical tools in solid form and as finished objects , beryllium copper presents no known health hazard copper beryllium alloy containing less than 2.5 % beryllium ( in copper ) is not designated as a carcinogen thumb beryllium copper is a non-ferrous alloy used in springs , spring wire , load cells , and other parts that must retain their shape under repeated stress and strain beryllium copper is non-sparking but physically tough and nonmagnetic , fulfilling the requirements of atex directive for zones 0 , 1 , and 2 compared to steel tools , beryllium copper tools are more expensive and not as strong , but the properties of beryllium copper in hazardous environments may outweigh the disadvantages high strength beryllium copper alloys contain as much as 2.7 % beryllium ( cast ) , or 1.6-2 % beryllium with about 0.3 % cobalt ( wrought ) high conductivity beryllium copper alloys contain as much as 0.7 % beryllium with some nickel and cobalt

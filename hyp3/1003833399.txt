beryllium copper is a ductile , weldable , and machinable alloy beryllium copper attains the greatest strength ( to of any copper-based alloy c17200 copper has the strength and hardness similar to that of steel and rockwell hardness properties in its peaked age condition are in the range of 200 ksi and rc45 copper alloys in general have always been considered non-sparking in solid form and as finished objects , beryllium copper presents no known health hazard copper beryllium alloy containing less than 2.5 % beryllium ( in copper ) is not designated as a carcinogen beryllium copper screwdrivers , pliers , wrench , cold chisels , knives , and hammers are available for environments with explosive hazards , such as oil rigs , coal mines , and grain elevators an alternative metal sometimes used for non-sparking tools is aluminium bronze compared to steel tools , beryllium copper tools are more expensive and not as strong , but the properties of beryllium copper in hazardous environments may outweigh the disadvantages beryllium copper wire is produced in many forms : round , square , flat and shaped , in coils , on spools and in straight lengths high strength beryllium copper alloys contain as much as 2.7 % beryllium ( cast ) , or 1.6-2 % beryllium with about 0.3 % cobalt ( wrought ) high conductivity beryllium copper alloys contain as much as 0.7 % beryllium with some nickel and cobalt

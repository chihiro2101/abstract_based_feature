beryllium copper is a ductile , weldable , and machinable alloy beryllium copper attains the greatest strength ( to of any copper-based alloy c17200 copper has the strength and hardness similar to that of steel and rockwell hardness properties in its peaked age condition are in the range of 200 ksi and rc45 c17200 has excellent corrosion resistant properties when exposed to harsh conditions such as sea water , and down-hole environments copper alloys in general have always been considered non-sparking in solid form and as finished objects , beryllium copper presents no known health hazard however , inhalation of dust , mist , or fume containing beryllium can cause the serious lung condition , berylliosis copper beryllium alloy containing less than 2.5 % beryllium ( in copper ) is not designated as a carcinogen beryllium copper screwdrivers , pliers , wrench , cold chisels , knives , and hammers are available for environments with explosive hazards , such as oil rigs , coal mines , and grain elevators compared to steel tools , beryllium copper tools are more expensive and not as strong , but the properties of beryllium copper in hazardous environments may outweigh the disadvantages beryllium copper ( c17200 & c17300 ) is an age-hardening alloy which attains the highest strength of any copper base alloy high strength beryllium copper alloys contain as much as 2.7 % beryllium ( cast ) , or 1.6-2 % beryllium with about 0.3 % cobalt ( wrought )

beryllium copper is a ductile , weldable , and machinable alloy like pure copper , it is resistant to oxidizing acid like hydrochloric acid and carbonic acid , to plastic decomposition products , to abrasive wear , and to galling beryllium copper attains the greatest strength ( to of any copper-based alloy it has a solid melting point of 1590 degrees fahrenheit and 1800 degrees fahrenheit liquid melting point c17200 copper has the strength and hardness similar to that of steel and rockwell hardness properties in its peaked age condition are in the range of 200 ksi and rc45 in solid form and as finished objects , beryllium copper presents no known health hazard copper beryllium alloy containing less than 2.5 % beryllium ( in copper ) is not designated as a carcinogen beryllium copper is non-sparking but physically tough and nonmagnetic , fulfilling the requirements of atex directive for zones 0 , 1 , and 2 compared to steel tools , beryllium copper tools are more expensive and not as strong , but the properties of beryllium copper in hazardous environments may outweigh the disadvantages beryllium copper ( c17200 & c17300 ) is an age-hardening alloy which attains the highest strength of any copper base alloy c17510 and c17500 beryllium copper alloys are age-hardenable and provide good electrical conductivity , physical properties , and endurance high strength beryllium copper alloys contain as much as 2.7 % beryllium ( cast ) , or 1.6-2 % beryllium with about 0.3 % cobalt ( wrought )

beryllium copper is a ductile , weldable , and machinable alloy beryllium copper attains the greatest strength ( to of any copper-based alloy it has a solid melting point of 1590 degrees fahrenheit and 1800 degrees fahrenheit liquid melting point c17200 copper has the strength and hardness similar to that of steel and rockwell hardness properties in its peaked age condition are in the range of 200 ksi and rc45 copper beryllium alloy containing less than 2.5 % beryllium ( in copper ) is not designated as a carcinogen the current osha pels for pure beryllium are 2 micrograms/m3 as an 8-hour twa , 5 micrograms/m3 as a ceiling not to be exceeded for more than 30 minutes at a time , and 25 micrograms/m3 as a peak exposure never to be exceeded beryllium copper is non-sparking but physically tough and nonmagnetic , fulfilling the requirements of atex directive for zones 0 , 1 , and 2 compared to steel tools , beryllium copper tools are more expensive and not as strong , but the properties of beryllium copper in hazardous environments may outweigh the disadvantages ultra-low temperature cryogenic equipment , such as dilution refrigerators , because of its mechanical strength and relatively high thermal conductivity in this temperature range beryllium copper ( c17200 & c17300 ) is an age-hardening alloy which attains the highest strength of any copper base alloy c17510 and c17500 beryllium copper alloys are age-hardenable and provide good electrical conductivity , physical properties , and endurance high strength beryllium copper alloys contain as much as 2.7 % beryllium ( cast ) , or 1.6-2 % beryllium with about 0.3 % cobalt ( wrought )

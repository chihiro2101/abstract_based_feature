beryllium copper is a ductile , weldable , and machinable alloy it can be heat-treated for increased strength , durability , and electrical conductivity beryllium copper attains the greatest strength ( to of any copper-based alloy copper alloys in general have always been considered non-sparking however , inhalation of dust , mist , or fume containing beryllium can cause the serious lung condition , berylliosis the national toxicology program ( ntp ) also lists beryllium as a carcinogen copper beryllium alloy containing less than 2.5 % beryllium ( in copper ) is not designated as a carcinogen thumb beryllium copper is a non-ferrous alloy used in springs , spring wire , load cells , and other parts that must retain their shape under repeated stress and strain compared to steel tools , beryllium copper tools are more expensive and not as strong , but the properties of beryllium copper in hazardous environments may outweigh the disadvantages beryllium copper ( c17200 & c17300 ) is an age-hardening alloy which attains the highest strength of any copper base alloy high strength beryllium copper alloys contain as much as 2.7 % beryllium ( cast ) , or 1.6-2 % beryllium with about 0.3 % cobalt ( wrought ) high conductivity beryllium copper alloys contain as much as 0.7 % beryllium with some nickel and cobalt

the first vehicle powered by wood gas was built by thomas hugh parker in 1901 around 1900 , many cities delivered syngas ( centrally produced , typically from coal ) to residences wood gas vehicles were used during world war ii as a consequence of the rationing of fossil fuels in 1942 , when wood gas had not yet reached the height of its popularity , there were about 73,000 wood gas vehicles in sweden , ekerholm , helena 'cultural meanings of wood gas as automobile fuel in sweden , 1930-1945 ' wood gas vehicles : firewood in the fuel tank low-tech magazine , january 18 , 2010 wood gasifiers are still manufactured in china and russia for automobiles and as power generators for industrial applications wood can be used to power cars with ordinary internal combustion engines if a wood gasifier is attached in more recent times , wood gas has been suggested as a clean and efficient method to heat and cook in developing countries , or even to produce electricity when combined with an internal combustion engine the gasification stage converts about 75 % of fuel energy content into a combustible gas that can be used as a fuel for internal combustion engines this means that of wood combustible matter has been found to be equivalent to of petrol during real transportation in similar driving conditions and with the same , otherwise unmodified , vehicle combustion of wood gas generates no particulates , and the gas renders thus very little carbon black amongst motor oil green hydrogen gas is also extracted from the wood gas which is in turn produced from widely available and carbon neutral biomass the wood gas can then be filtered for tars and soot/ash particles , cooled and directed to an engine or fuel cell it is pointed out that the gas composition is strongly dependent on the gasification process , the gasification medium ( air , oxygen or steam ) and the fuel moisture

natural gas began to be used only in 1930 wood gas vehicles were used during world war ii as a consequence of the rationing of fossil fuels trucks , buses , tractors , motorcycles , ships and trains were equipped with a wood gasification unit in 1942 , when wood gas had not yet reached the height of its popularity , there were about 73,000 wood gas vehicles in sweden , ekerholm , helena 'cultural meanings of wood gas as automobile fuel in sweden , 1930-1945 ' wood can be used to power cars with ordinary internal combustion engines if a wood gasifier is attached in more recent times , wood gas has been suggested as a clean and efficient method to heat and cook in developing countries , or even to produce electricity when combined with an internal combustion engine purification of the gas and feeding it into natural gas pipelines is one variant to link it to the existing refuelling infrastructure the gasification stage converts about 75 % of fuel energy content into a combustible gas that can be used as a fuel for internal combustion engines in power generation , reported demand of fuel is wood combustible matter per kilowatt-hour of electricity exhaust gas emission from an internal combustion engine is significantly lower on wood gas than on petrol another application is the use of producer gas to displace light density fuel oil ( ldo ) in industrial furnaces green hydrogen gas is also extracted from the wood gas which is in turn produced from widely available and carbon neutral biomass it is pointed out that the gas composition is strongly dependent on the gasification process , the gasification medium ( air , oxygen or steam ) and the fuel moisture

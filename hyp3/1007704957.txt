the first vehicle powered by wood gas was built by thomas hugh parker in 1901 wood gas vehicles were used during world war ii as a consequence of the rationing of fossil fuels in 1942 , when wood gas had not yet reached the height of its popularity , there were about 73,000 wood gas vehicles in sweden , ekerholm , helena 'cultural meanings of wood gas as automobile fuel in sweden , 1930-1945 ' wood gas vehicles : firewood in the fuel tank low-tech magazine , january 18 , 2010 wood gasifiers are still manufactured in china and russia for automobiles and as power generators for industrial applications wood can be used to power cars with ordinary internal combustion engines if a wood gasifier is attached in more recent times , wood gas has been suggested as a clean and efficient method to heat and cook in developing countries , or even to produce electricity when combined with an internal combustion engine the gasification stage converts about 75 % of fuel energy content into a combustible gas that can be used as a fuel for internal combustion engines in power generation , reported demand of fuel is wood combustible matter per kilowatt-hour of electricity exhaust gas emission from an internal combustion engine is significantly lower on wood gas than on petrol combustion of wood gas generates no particulates , and the gas renders thus very little carbon black amongst motor oil green hydrogen gas is also extracted from the wood gas which is in turn produced from widely available and carbon neutral biomass all the products of wood gasifier ( charcoal , hydro carbon liquids , methane and carbon monoxide ) can be converted in to hydrogen by steam reforming process without external heat input it is pointed out that the gas composition is strongly dependent on the gasification process , the gasification medium ( air , oxygen or steam ) and the fuel moisture

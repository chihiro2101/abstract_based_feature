the first vehicle powered by wood gas was built by thomas hugh parker in 1901 wood gas vehicles were used during world war ii as a consequence of the rationing of fossil fuels in germany alone , around 500,000 '' producer gas '' vehicles were in use at the end of the war in 1942 , when wood gas had not yet reached the height of its popularity , there were about 73,000 wood gas vehicles in sweden , ekerholm , helena 'cultural meanings of wood gas as automobile fuel in sweden , 1930-1945 ' wood gas vehicles : firewood in the fuel tank low-tech magazine , january 18 , 2010 wood gasifiers are still manufactured in china and russia for automobiles and as power generators for industrial applications wood can be used to power cars with ordinary internal combustion engines if a wood gasifier is attached in more recent times , wood gas has been suggested as a clean and efficient method to heat and cook in developing countries , or even to produce electricity when combined with an internal combustion engine this study also considers all possible losses of the wood gas system , like preheating of the system and carrying of the extra weight of the gas-generating system exhaust gas emission from an internal combustion engine is significantly lower on wood gas than on petrol combustion of wood gas generates no particulates , and the gas renders thus very little carbon black amongst motor oil green hydrogen gas is also extracted from the wood gas which is in turn produced from widely available and carbon neutral biomass , the world war ii gasifiers , can be engineered to produce essentially tar-free gas ( less than 1 & nbsp ; mg/m 3 ) , while single-reactor fluidized bed gasifiers may exceed 50,000 & nbsp ; mg/m 3 tar the heat of combustion of '' producer gas '' & nbsp ; — a term used in the united states meaning wood gas produced for use in a combustion engine & nbsp ; — is rather low compared to other fuels

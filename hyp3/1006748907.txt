left before the hill fort was built , a neolithic causewayed enclosure was constructed on the site dating from around 4000 & nbsp ; bc , it was an oval area enclosed by two ditches , sharples ( 1991a ) , p it is called a causewayed enclosure because the way the ditches were dug meant that there would originally have been gaps & nbsp ; 38–39 these gaps , and the bank being only high , indicate the site would not have been defensive instead the ditches may have been symbolic , separating the interior of the enclosure and its activities from the outside archaeologist niall sharples , who was involved in excavating the hill fort in the 1980s , has identified the hilltop views of the surrounding landscape as a likely factor for the enclosure 's position the site does not appear to have been inhabited , although a grave containing the remains of two children , aged 6–7 , has been discovered the enclosure is the earliest evidence of human activity on the site radiocarbon dating indicates that the enclosure was abandoned around 3,400 & nbsp ; bc arrowheads discovered in the ditches may indicate that activity at the enclosure met a violent end it was a long mound of earth with a ditch on either side ; the parallel ditches were apart many barrows lie over graves and are monuments to the deceased , but as the barrow at maiden castle did not cover any burials , scholars have suggested that it was a boundary marker this would explain the limited human activity on the hilltop for the 500 & nbsp ; years after the bank barrow 's construction & nbsp ; 59–60 around 1,800 & nbsp ; bc , during the early bronze age , the hill was cleared and used to grow crops , but the soil was quickly exhausted and the site abandoned this period of abandonment lasted until the iron age , when the hill fort was built hill forts developed in the late bronze age and early iron age , roughly the start of the 1st millennium bc deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze they would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed , but this was not the only , or even the most significant , factor in their construction '' there are around 31 & nbsp ; hill forts in dorset ; archaeologist sharples , who undertook excavations at maiden castle , proposed that hill forts were used to control agricultural land to support a large community monumental defences such as the ditch at maiden castle indicate that the land was disputed and communities fought each other for control hoards of carefully selected sling stones have been found at both sites & nbsp ; 92–93 constructed on a territorial boundary in about 600 & nbsp ; bc , the first hill fort at maiden castle was a area surrounded by a single ditch the hill it sits on is part of a ridge on the north side of the south winterborne valley , which feeds the river frome the highest point is the neighbouring hog hill , which is only higher the hill projects about above the surrounding countryside , which is about above sea level the defences were high and consisted of the v-shaped ditch and a rampart the site could be accessed by an entrance in the northwest and a double entrance in the east the reason for a double entrance is unclear ; however , archaeologist niall sharples has suggested that it was a form of segregation it is likely that several farming communities lived in the hill fort and wanted different entrances at the same time , the defences around the eastern entrances were made more complex however , nearby poundbury and chalbury date to the same period , so through comparison it is possible to infer the early iron age activity at maiden castle from parallels at these sites , sharples deduces that it was probably densely occupied , with separate areas for habitation and storage image : maiden castle dorset ramparts.jpg thumb left 300px maiden castle 's southern defences were made up of four ramparts and three ditches in the middle iron age , maiden castle was expanded and in the process it became the largest hill fort in britain sharples ( 1991a ) , pp in about 450 & nbsp ; bc , maiden castle was expanded from as some hill forts were expanded , many of the smaller hill forts that had proliferated in the early iron age fell out of use , as was the case in dorset this , and the abandonment of the smaller hill forts in the area when the developed hill forts were built , indicates that these developed hill forts were important & nbsp ; 83–84 & nbsp ; 67–68 the emergence of one dominant hill fort in an area indicates that the inhabitants of a particular hill fort became more important than their contemporaries , possibly through warfare developed hill forts were generally densely occupied ; this is best demonstrated at danebury , where 57 % of the site has been excavated while developed hill forts were of a higher status than their smaller predecessors , they were not all equal cunliffe states that the maiden castle 's monumental defences probably indicate that it was of higher status than other developed hill forts the peaks of the two hills encompassed by the new , larger hill fort were separated by a dry valley the developing industries may have resulted in a shift away from the hill fort elites , whose power was based on agriculture wheeler used the '' war cemetery '' , as he described it , as evidence of a roman attack on maiden castle nearby were two other buildings : a rectangular building with two rooms that may have been a house for a priest , and a circular building that may have been a shrine thomas hardy , who built max gate within sight of it , pite ( 2006 ) , p in 1921 , composer john ireland wrote mai-dun , a symphonic rhapsody , about the hill fort in dorset the first widespread investigation of hill forts was carried out in the second half of the 19th century under the direction of augustus pitt-rivers , cunliffe ( 1983 ) , pp

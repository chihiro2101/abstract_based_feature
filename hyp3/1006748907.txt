left before the hill fort was built , a neolithic causewayed enclosure was constructed on the site dating from around 4000 & nbsp ; bc , it was an oval area enclosed by two ditches , sharples ( 1991a ) , p it is called a causewayed enclosure because the way the ditches were dug meant that there would originally have been gaps these gaps , and the bank being only high , indicate the site would not have been defensive instead the ditches may have been symbolic , separating the interior of the enclosure and its activities from the outside situated on the side of the hill , it would have been visible from several miles away , and when first cut the ditches would have exposed the underlying white chalk and stood out against the green hillside the site does not appear to have been inhabited , although a grave containing the remains of two children , aged 6–7 , has been discovered the purpose of neolithic causewayed enclosures is unclear , and they probably had a variety of functions radiocarbon dating indicates that the enclosure was abandoned around 3,400 & nbsp ; bc arrowheads discovered in the ditches may indicate that activity at the enclosure met a violent end within a period of about 50 & nbsp ; years , a bank barrow was built over the enclosure it was a long mound of earth with a ditch on either side ; the parallel ditches were apart many barrows lie over graves and are monuments to the deceased , but as the barrow at maiden castle did not cover any burials , scholars have suggested that it was a boundary marker around 1,800 & nbsp ; bc , during the early bronze age , the hill was cleared and used to grow crops , but the soil was quickly exhausted and the site abandoned this period of abandonment lasted until the iron age , when the hill fort was built the bank barrow survived into the iron age as a low mound , and throughout this period construction over it was avoided & nbsp ; 94–96 hill forts developed in the late bronze age and early iron age , roughly the start of the 1st millennium bc since the 1960s , the dominant view has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in britain as a result , trading patterns shifted , and the old elites lost their economic and social status they would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed , but this was not the only , or even the most significant , factor in their construction '' there are around 31 & nbsp ; hill forts in dorset ; archaeologist sharples , who undertook excavations at maiden castle , proposed that hill forts were used to control agricultural land to support a large community & nbsp ; 76 , & nbsp ; 82 this is supported by cunliffe , who argues that the elaborate earthworks such as those around the entrances to maiden castle and danebury were used to defend the weakest part of the hill fort sharples ( 1991a ) , p constructed on a territorial boundary in about 600 & nbsp ; bc , the first hill fort at maiden castle was a area surrounded by a single ditch the hill it sits on is part of a ridge on the north side of the south winterborne valley , which feeds the river frome the rampart would probably have been timber-faced around just the entrances the site could be accessed by an entrance in the northwest and a double entrance in the east the double entrance is unique in hill forts in the british isles it is likely that several farming communities lived in the hill fort and wanted different entrances a bank and ditch were built outside the two entrances , and a bank was erected between them sharples believes this would have created an impressive entrance and was a demonstration of the settlement 's high status the early iron age archaeology has been largely destroyed due to later activity on the site however , nearby poundbury and chalbury date to the same period , so through comparison it is possible to infer the early iron age activity at maiden castle not much is known about the material culture and economy of the early iron age , and the paucity of finds from this period at maiden castle makes it difficult to draw conclusions about activity on the site in the middle iron age , maiden castle was expanded and in the process it became the largest hill fort in britain sharples ( 1991a ) , pp the hill fort 's expansion was not unique ; it was one of a series of '' developed hill forts '' in southern england as some hill forts were expanded , many of the smaller hill forts that had proliferated in the early iron age fell out of use , as was the case in dorset the developed hill forts of berkshire , dorset , hampshire , and wiltshire were equally spaced apart , with roughly equal access to resources such as water & nbsp ; 67–68 & nbsp ; 48–49 the emergence of one dominant hill fort in an area indicates that the inhabitants of a particular hill fort became more important than their contemporaries , possibly through warfare developed hill forts were generally densely occupied ; this is best demonstrated at danebury , where 57 % of the site has been excavated almost immediately after the single ditch enclosure was expanded to , work began on making the defences more elaborate at the same time , the eastern entrance was again made more complex through the addition of further earthworks , lengthening the approach to the site although bronze was not produced at maiden castle , there is evidence of it being reworked maiden castle is one of the most important iron production sites from the late iron age in southern britain the eastern part of the hill fort remained in use for at least the first few decades of the roman occupation , although the duration and nature of habitation is uncertain according to the ancient geographer ptolemy , writing in the 2nd century & nbsp ; ad , dunium was the main settlement of the durotriges but it was not until the 1930s that maiden castle was methodically investigated , the first large-scale excavation of the interior of a hill fort it was one of about 80 & nbsp ; hill forts to have been excavated by 1940 , in a period known as '' hill fort mania '' during the 1920s and 1930s history and visitor information from english heritage maiden castle on google arts and culture photos of maiden castle and surrounding area at geograph

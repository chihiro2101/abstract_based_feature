dating from around 4000 & nbsp ; bc , it was an oval area enclosed by two ditches , sharples ( 1991a ) , p it is called a causewayed enclosure because the way the ditches were dug meant that there would originally have been gaps sharples ( 1991a ) , pp these gaps , and the bank being only high , indicate the site would not have been defensive instead the ditches may have been symbolic , separating the interior of the enclosure and its activities from the outside sharples ( 1991a ) , p archaeologist niall sharples , who was involved in excavating the hill fort in the 1980s , has identified the hilltop views of the surrounding landscape as a likely factor for the enclosure 's position situated on the side of the hill , it would have been visible from several miles away , and when first cut the ditches would have exposed the underlying white chalk and stood out against the green hillside the site does not appear to have been inhabited , although a grave containing the remains of two children , aged 6–7 , has been discovered & nbsp ; 35–37 the enclosure is the earliest evidence of human activity on the site the purpose of neolithic causewayed enclosures is unclear , and they probably had a variety of functions arrowheads discovered in the ditches may indicate that activity at the enclosure met a violent end sharples ( 1991a ) , pp within a period of about 50 & nbsp ; years , a bank barrow was built over the enclosure it was a long mound of earth with a ditch on either side ; the parallel ditches were apart this would explain the limited human activity on the hilltop for the 500 & nbsp ; years after the bank barrow 's construction around 1,800 & nbsp ; bc , during the early bronze age , the hill was cleared and used to grow crops , but the soil was quickly exhausted and the site abandoned this period of abandonment lasted until the iron age , when the hill fort was built the bank barrow survived into the iron age as a low mound , and throughout this period construction over it was avoided sharples ( 1991a ) , pp hill forts developed in the late bronze age and early iron age , roughly the start of the 1st millennium bc since the 1960s , the dominant view has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in britain as a result , trading patterns shifted , and the old elites lost their economic and social status those in dorset were situated near expanses of fertile land monumental defences such as the ditch at maiden castle indicate that the land was disputed and communities fought each other for control sharples ( 1991a ) , pp this is supported by cunliffe , who argues that the elaborate earthworks such as those around the entrances to maiden castle and danebury were used to defend the weakest part of the hill fort constructed on a territorial boundary in about 600 & nbsp ; bc , the first hill fort at maiden castle was a area surrounded by a single ditch sharples ( 1991a ) , pp at the eastern end of the ridge and rising above sea level , the site of the first hill fort was not the highest point along the ridge the highest point is the neighbouring hog hill , which is only higher sharples ( 1991a ) , p the hill projects about above the surrounding countryside , which is about above sea level the double entrance is unique in hill forts in the british isles it is likely that several farming communities lived in the hill fort and wanted different entrances from parallels at these sites , sharples deduces that it was probably densely occupied , with separate areas for habitation and storage sharples ( 1991a ) , pp in the middle iron age , maiden castle was expanded and in the process it became the largest hill fort in britain sharples ( 1991a ) , pp the hill fort 's expansion was not unique ; it was one of a series of '' developed hill forts '' in southern england as some hill forts were expanded , many of the smaller hill forts that had proliferated in the early iron age fell out of use , as was the case in dorset the developed hill forts in dorset were spaced widely apart this , and the abandonment of the smaller hill forts in the area when the developed hill forts were built , indicates that these developed hill forts were important sharples ( 1991a ) , pp the developed hill forts of berkshire , dorset , hampshire , and wiltshire were equally spaced apart , with roughly equal access to resources such as water the emergence of developed hill forts has been attributed to iron age society becoming more complex cunliffe states that the maiden castle 's monumental defences probably indicate that it was of higher status than other developed hill forts the presence of granaries suggests that the fort was used to control the area 's food supply maiden castle is one of the most important iron production sites from the late iron age in southern britain however , there is little archaeological evidence to support this version of events , or even that the hill fort was attacked by the romans although dunium has long been thought to refer to maiden castle , hod hill and hengistbury have been identified as two other possible sites for dunium wheeler 's use of the media to disseminate information about the site resulted in maiden castle becoming well known it was one of about 80 & nbsp ; hill forts to have been excavated by 1940 , in a period known as '' hill fort mania '' during the 1920s and 1930s

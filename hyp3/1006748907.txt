left before the hill fort was built , a neolithic causewayed enclosure was constructed on the site dating from around 4000 & nbsp ; bc , it was an oval area enclosed by two ditches , sharples ( 1991a ) , p it is called a causewayed enclosure because the way the ditches were dug meant that there would originally have been gaps & nbsp ; 38–39 these gaps , and the bank being only high , indicate the site would not have been defensive instead the ditches may have been symbolic , separating the interior of the enclosure and its activities from the outside the interior of the enclosure has been disturbed by later habitation and farming the site does not appear to have been inhabited , although a grave containing the remains of two children , aged 6–7 , has been discovered & nbsp ; 35–37 the purpose of neolithic causewayed enclosures is unclear , and they probably had a variety of functions radiocarbon dating indicates that the enclosure was abandoned around 3,400 & nbsp ; bc arrowheads discovered in the ditches may indicate that activity at the enclosure met a violent end sharples ( 1991a ) , p this would explain the limited human activity on the hilltop for the 500 & nbsp ; years after the bank barrow 's construction around 1,800 & nbsp ; bc , during the early bronze age , the hill was cleared and used to grow crops , but the soil was quickly exhausted and the site abandoned this period of abandonment lasted until the iron age , when the hill fort was built hill forts developed in the late bronze age and early iron age , roughly the start of the 1st millennium bc since the 1960s , the dominant view has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in britain deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze there are around 31 & nbsp ; hill forts in dorset ; archaeologist sharples , who undertook excavations at maiden castle , proposed that hill forts were used to control agricultural land to support a large community monumental defences such as the ditch at maiden castle indicate that the land was disputed and communities fought each other for control & nbsp ; 76 , & nbsp ; 82 this is supported by cunliffe , who argues that the elaborate earthworks such as those around the entrances to maiden castle and danebury were used to defend the weakest part of the hill fort they increased the time the attackers took to reach the gateway , which would have left them vulnerable to defenders armed with slings sharples ( 1991a ) , p sharples ( 1991a ) , pp the hill it sits on is part of a ridge on the north side of the south winterborne valley , which feeds the river frome at the eastern end of the ridge and rising above sea level , the site of the first hill fort was not the highest point along the ridge the highest point is the neighbouring hog hill , which is only higher the hill projects about above the surrounding countryside , which is about above sea level the reason for a double entrance is unclear ; however , archaeologist niall sharples has suggested that it was a form of segregation the defences of the first hill fort were rebuilt on at least one occasion ; the ditch was deepened by however , nearby poundbury and chalbury date to the same period , so through comparison it is possible to infer the early iron age activity at maiden castle sharples ( 1991a ) , p not much is known about the material culture and economy of the early iron age , and the paucity of finds from this period at maiden castle makes it difficult to draw conclusions about activity on the site image : maiden castle dorset ramparts.jpg thumb left 300px maiden castle 's southern defences were made up of four ramparts and three ditches in the middle iron age , maiden castle was expanded and in the process it became the largest hill fort in britain sharples ( 1991a ) , pp in about 450 & nbsp ; bc , maiden castle was expanded from the area was initially enclosed by a single bank and ditch , with the bank standing high although the ditch was shallow as some hill forts were expanded , many of the smaller hill forts that had proliferated in the early iron age fell out of use , as was the case in dorset this , and the abandonment of the smaller hill forts in the area when the developed hill forts were built , indicates that these developed hill forts were important & nbsp ; 83–84 the developed hill forts of berkshire , dorset , hampshire , and wiltshire were equally spaced apart , with roughly equal access to resources such as water the emergence of developed hill forts has been attributed to iron age society becoming more complex & nbsp ; 48–49 the emergence of one dominant hill fort in an area indicates that the inhabitants of a particular hill fort became more important than their contemporaries , possibly through warfare however , a general dearth of evidence for destruction and an increase of artefacts associated with crafts and industry suggest that the reason for change was economic while developed hill forts were of a higher status than their smaller predecessors , they were not all equal around 100 & nbsp ; bc , maiden castle 's organised street pattern was replaced by more random habitation on the industrial site , more than of iron slag was discovered in an area of , and it is believed the site produced around of iron although there is a layer of charcoal , it is associated with the iron works , and the main evidence for slighting of defences comes from the collapse of an entranceway to the fort it was one of about 80 & nbsp ; hill forts to have been excavated by 1940 , in a period known as '' hill fort mania '' during the 1920s and 1930s the structure was made a scheduled ancient monument in 1981 , giving maiden castle protection against unauthorised change ; it is now maintained by english heritage

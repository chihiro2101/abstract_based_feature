left before the hill fort was built , a neolithic causewayed enclosure was constructed on the site dating from around 4000 & nbsp ; bc , it was an oval area enclosed by two ditches , sharples ( 1991a ) , p it is called a causewayed enclosure because the way the ditches were dug meant that there would originally have been gaps & nbsp ; 38–39 archaeologist niall sharples , who was involved in excavating the hill fort in the 1980s , has identified the hilltop views of the surrounding landscape as a likely factor for the enclosure 's position the interior of the enclosure has been disturbed by later habitation and farming the site does not appear to have been inhabited , although a grave containing the remains of two children , aged 6–7 , has been discovered sharples ( 1991a ) , pp & nbsp ; 35–37 the enclosure is the earliest evidence of human activity on the site arrowheads discovered in the ditches may indicate that activity at the enclosure met a violent end within a period of about 50 & nbsp ; years , a bank barrow was built over the enclosure many barrows lie over graves and are monuments to the deceased , but as the barrow at maiden castle did not cover any burials , scholars have suggested that it was a boundary marker this would explain the limited human activity on the hilltop for the 500 & nbsp ; years after the bank barrow 's construction around 1,800 & nbsp ; bc , during the early bronze age , the hill was cleared and used to grow crops , but the soil was quickly exhausted and the site abandoned this period of abandonment lasted until the iron age , when the hill fort was built & nbsp ; 65–67 hill forts developed in the late bronze age and early iron age , roughly the start of the 1st millennium bc as a result , trading patterns shifted , and the old elites lost their economic and social status & nbsp ; 71–72 they would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed , but this was not the only , or even the most significant , factor in their construction '' monumental defences such as the ditch at maiden castle indicate that the land was disputed and communities fought each other for control this is supported by cunliffe , who argues that the elaborate earthworks such as those around the entrances to maiden castle and danebury were used to defend the weakest part of the hill fort hoards of carefully selected sling stones have been found at both sites constructed on a territorial boundary in about 600 & nbsp ; bc , the first hill fort at maiden castle was a area surrounded by a single ditch at the eastern end of the ridge and rising above sea level , the site of the first hill fort was not the highest point along the ridge the rampart would probably have been timber-faced around just the entrances the site could be accessed by an entrance in the northwest and a double entrance in the east the double entrance is unique in hill forts in the british isles the spoil from re-digging the ditch was deposited on the back of the rampart at the same time , the defences around the eastern entrances were made more complex the early iron age archaeology has been largely destroyed due to later activity on the site however , nearby poundbury and chalbury date to the same period , so through comparison it is possible to infer the early iron age activity at maiden castle image : maiden castle dorset ramparts.jpg thumb left 300px maiden castle 's southern defences were made up of four ramparts and three ditches in the middle iron age , maiden castle was expanded and in the process it became the largest hill fort in britain sharples ( 1991a ) , pp & nbsp ; 11 , & nbsp ; 83 and one of the largest in europe in about 450 & nbsp ; bc , maiden castle was expanded from the area was initially enclosed by a single bank and ditch , with the bank standing high although the ditch was shallow the hill fort 's expansion was not unique ; it was one of a series of '' developed hill forts '' in southern england as some hill forts were expanded , many of the smaller hill forts that had proliferated in the early iron age fell out of use , as was the case in dorset the developed hill forts of berkshire , dorset , hampshire , and wiltshire were equally spaced apart , with roughly equal access to resources such as water the emergence of one dominant hill fort in an area indicates that the inhabitants of a particular hill fort became more important than their contemporaries , possibly through warfare cunliffe states that the maiden castle 's monumental defences probably indicate that it was of higher status than other developed hill forts the peaks of the two hills encompassed by the new , larger hill fort were separated by a dry valley the four-post structures common in hill forts throughout england are also found in maiden castle their purpose on this site is uncertain however , since at square they have been considered by archaeologists to be too small for dwellings ; as a result , it has been concluded that these structures were probably granaries across britain , many hill forts fell out of use in the 100 & nbsp ; years around the turn of the millennium although 14 & nbsp ; bodies in the cemetery exhibited signs of a violent death , there is no evidence that they died at maiden castle many 1st-century roman artefacts have been discovered near the east entrance and in the centre of the hill fort & nbsp ; 130–131 it was one of about 80 & nbsp ; hill forts to have been excavated by 1940 , in a period known as '' hill fort mania '' during the 1920s and 1930s the structure was made a scheduled ancient monument in 1981 , giving maiden castle protection against unauthorised change ; it is now maintained by english heritage

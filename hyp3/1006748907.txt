left before the hill fort was built , a neolithic causewayed enclosure was constructed on the site dating from around 4000 & nbsp ; bc , it was an oval area enclosed by two ditches , sharples ( 1991a ) , p it is called a causewayed enclosure because the way the ditches were dug meant that there would originally have been gaps & nbsp ; 38–39 these gaps , and the bank being only high , indicate the site would not have been defensive archaeologist niall sharples , who was involved in excavating the hill fort in the 1980s , has identified the hilltop views of the surrounding landscape as a likely factor for the enclosure 's position the site does not appear to have been inhabited , although a grave containing the remains of two children , aged 6–7 , has been discovered & nbsp ; 35–37 the enclosure is the earliest evidence of human activity on the site radiocarbon dating indicates that the enclosure was abandoned around 3,400 & nbsp ; bc arrowheads discovered in the ditches may indicate that activity at the enclosure met a violent end & nbsp ; 54–56 within a period of about 50 & nbsp ; years , a bank barrow was built over the enclosure many barrows lie over graves and are monuments to the deceased , but as the barrow at maiden castle did not cover any burials , scholars have suggested that it was a boundary marker around 1,800 & nbsp ; bc , during the early bronze age , the hill was cleared and used to grow crops , but the soil was quickly exhausted and the site abandoned this period of abandonment lasted until the iron age , when the hill fort was built & nbsp ; 65–67 hill forts developed in the late bronze age and early iron age , roughly the start of the 1st millennium bc since the 1960s , the dominant view has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in britain as a result , trading patterns shifted , and the old elites lost their economic and social status & nbsp ; 71–72 there are around 31 & nbsp ; hill forts in dorset ; archaeologist sharples , who undertook excavations at maiden castle , proposed that hill forts were used to control agricultural land to support a large community monumental defences such as the ditch at maiden castle indicate that the land was disputed and communities fought each other for control & nbsp ; 76 , & nbsp ; 82 this is supported by cunliffe , who argues that the elaborate earthworks such as those around the entrances to maiden castle and danebury were used to defend the weakest part of the hill fort constructed on a territorial boundary in about 600 & nbsp ; bc , the first hill fort at maiden castle was a area surrounded by a single ditch sharples ( 1991a ) , pp at the eastern end of the ridge and rising above sea level , the site of the first hill fort was not the highest point along the ridge the highest point is the neighbouring hog hill , which is only higher the defences were high and consisted of the v-shaped ditch and a rampart the site could be accessed by an entrance in the northwest and a double entrance in the east the double entrance is unique in hill forts in the british isles the reason for a double entrance is unclear ; however , archaeologist niall sharples has suggested that it was a form of segregation the defences of the first hill fort were rebuilt on at least one occasion ; the ditch was deepened by at the same time , the defences around the eastern entrances were made more complex a bank and ditch were built outside the two entrances , and a bank was erected between them the early iron age archaeology has been largely destroyed due to later activity on the site from parallels at these sites , sharples deduces that it was probably densely occupied , with separate areas for habitation and storage & nbsp ; 81–82 image : maiden castle dorset ramparts.jpg thumb left 300px maiden castle 's southern defences were made up of four ramparts and three ditches in the early iron age , maiden castle was generally unexceptional ; it was one of over 100 & nbsp ; hill forts of similar size built around the same time in the area that is now berkshire , dorset , hampshire , and wiltshire in the middle iron age , maiden castle was expanded and in the process it became the largest hill fort in britain sharples ( 1991a ) , pp the area was initially enclosed by a single bank and ditch , with the bank standing high although the ditch was shallow as some hill forts were expanded , many of the smaller hill forts that had proliferated in the early iron age fell out of use , as was the case in dorset this , and the abandonment of the smaller hill forts in the area when the developed hill forts were built , indicates that these developed hill forts were important the developed hill forts of berkshire , dorset , hampshire , and wiltshire were equally spaced apart , with roughly equal access to resources such as water cunliffe states that the maiden castle 's monumental defences probably indicate that it was of higher status than other developed hill forts it appears that houses were not built near the ramparts until after the defences were complete although 14 & nbsp ; bodies in the cemetery exhibited signs of a violent death , there is no evidence that they died at maiden castle this was a characteristic of vespasian 's campaign in the region ; there was military occupation at cadbury castle in somerset , hembury in devon , and hodd hill in dorset but it was not until the 1930s that maiden castle was methodically investigated , the first large-scale excavation of the interior of a hill fort wheeler 's use of the media to disseminate information about the site resulted in maiden castle becoming well known it was one of about 80 & nbsp ; hill forts to have been excavated by 1940 , in a period known as '' hill fort mania '' during the 1920s and 1930s

the word cultivar originated from the need to distinguish between wild plants and those with characteristics that arose in cultivation , presently denominated cultigens the international code of nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants uses as its starting point for modern botanical nomenclature the latin names in linnaeus ' ( 1707–1778 ) species plantarum ( tenth edition ) and genera plantarum ( fifth edition ) from circa the 1900s , cultivated plants in europe were recognised in the scandinavian , germanic , and slavic literature as stamm or sorte , but these words could not be used internationally because , by international agreement , any new denominations had to be in latin liberty hyde bailey of cornell university in new york , united states created the word cultivar in 1923 when he wrote that : the cultigen is a species , or its equivalent , that has appeared under domestication – the plant is cultigenous i now propose another name , cultivar , for a botanical variety , or for a race subordinate to species , that has originated under cultivation ; it is not necessarily , however , referable to a recognized botanical species in that essay , bailey used only the rank of species for the cultigen , but it was obvious to him that many domesticated plants were more like botanical varieties than species , and that realization appears to have motivated the suggestion of the new category of cultivar the first cultivated plant code of 1953 subsequently commended its use , and by 1960 it had achieved common international acceptance the words cultigen and cultivar may be confused with each other a cultigen is any plant that is deliberately selected for or altered in cultivation , as opposed to an indigen ; the cultivated plant code states that cultigens are '' maintained as recognisable entities solely by continued propagation '' cultivated plant code art 2.3 cultigens can have names at any of many taxonomic ranks , including those of grex , species , cultivar group , variety , form , and cultivar ; and they may be plants that have been altered in cultivation , including by genetic modification , but have not been formally denominated therefore , all cultivars are cultigens , because they are cultivated , but not all cultigens are cultivars , because some cultigens have not been formally distinguished and named as cultivars the cultivated plant code notes that the word cultivar is used in two different senses : first , as a '' classification category '' the cultivar is defined in article 2 of the international code of nomenclature for cultivated plants ( 2009 , 8th edition ) as follows : the basic category of cultivated plants whose nomenclature is governed by this code is the cultivar a cultivar is an assemblage of plants that ( a ) & nbsp ; has been selected for a particular character or combination of characters , ( b ) & nbsp ; is distinct , uniform and stable in those characters , and ( c ) & nbsp ; when propagated by appropriate means , retains those characters image : airport orchid.jpg thumb left 220px a cultivar of the orchid genus oncidium which plants are chosen to be named as cultivars is simply a matter of convenience as the category was created to serve the practical needs of horticulture , agriculture , and forestry the cultivated plant code emphasizes that different cultivated plants may be accepted as different cultivars , even if they have the same genome , while cultivated plants with different genomes may be regarded as the same cultivar however , the international code of nomenclature for cultivated plants notes , '' in practice such an assemblage is often marketed from one or more lines or multilines that have been genetically modified '' cultivated plant code , articles 2.19 however , retired transgenic varieties such as the fish tomato , which are no longer being developed , do not run into this obstacle and can be given a cultivar name in addition , cultivars may be associated with commercial marketing names referred to in the cultivated plant code as '' trade designations '' ( see below ) a cultivar name consists of a botanical name ( of a genus , species , infraspecific taxon , interspecific hybrid or intergeneric hybrid ) followed by a cultivar epithet cultivated plant code article 21.3 it is permissible to place a cultivar epithet after a common name provided the common name is botanically unambiguous plants protected by plant breeders ' rights ( pbr ) may have a '' true '' cultivar name – the recognized scientific name in the public domain – and a '' commercial synonym '' – an additional marketing name that is legally protected the main body coordinating plant breeders ' rights is the international union for the protection of new varieties of plants , upov ) and this organization maintains a database of new cultivars protected by pbr in all countries see international cultivar registration authorities new names and other relevant data are collected by and submitted to the icra and in most cases there is no cost

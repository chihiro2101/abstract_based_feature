the word cultivar originated from the need to distinguish between wild plants and those with characteristics that arose in cultivation , presently denominated cultigens in time the need to distinguish between wild plants and those with variations that had been cultivated increased in the nineteenth century many '' garden-derived '' plants were given horticultural names , sometimes in latin and sometimes in a vernacular language liberty hyde bailey of cornell university in new york , united states created the word cultivar in 1923 when he wrote that : the cultigen is a species , or its equivalent , that has appeared under domestication – the plant is cultigenous in that essay , bailey used only the rank of species for the cultigen , but it was obvious to him that many domesticated plants were more like botanical varieties than species , and that realization appears to have motivated the suggestion of the new category of cultivar bailey created the word cultivar , which is generally assumed to be a portmanteau of cultivated and variety a cultigen is any plant that is deliberately selected for or altered in cultivation , as opposed to an indigen ; the cultivated plant code states that cultigens are '' maintained as recognisable entities solely by continued propagation '' 2.3 cultigens can have names at any of many taxonomic ranks , including those of grex , species , cultivar group , variety , form , and cultivar ; and they may be plants that have been altered in cultivation , including by genetic modification , but have not been formally denominated therefore , all cultivars are cultigens , because they are cultivated , but not all cultigens are cultivars , because some cultigens have not been formally distinguished and named as cultivars the cultivated plant code notes that the word cultivar is used in two different senses : first , as a '' classification category '' the cultivar is defined in article 2 of the international code of nomenclature for cultivated plants ( 2009 , 8th edition ) as follows : the basic category of cultivated plants whose nomenclature is governed by this code is the cultivar 2.1 there are two other classification categories for cultigens , the grex cultivated plant code 3 the code then defines a cultivar as a '' taxonomic unit within the classification category of cultivar '' a cultivar is an assemblage of plants that ( a ) & nbsp ; has been selected for a particular character or combination of characters , ( b ) & nbsp ; is distinct , uniform and stable in those characters , and ( c ) & nbsp ; when propagated by appropriate means , retains those characters & nbsp ; tottum cultivars that are produced asexually are genetically identical and known as clones ; this includes plants propagated by division , layering , cuttings , grafts , and budding plants whose distinctive characters are derived from the presence of an intracellular organism may also form a cultivar provided the characters are reproduced reliably from generation to generation in general , asexually propagated cultivars grown from seeds produce highly variable seedling plants , and should not be labelled with , or sold under , the parent cultivar 's name some cultivars are agamospermy plants , which retain their genetic composition and characteristics under reproduction cultivated plant code , articles 2.17–2.18 occasionally cultivars are raised from seed of a specially selected provenance – for example the seed may be taken from plants that are resistant to a particular disease cultivated plant code , articles 2.12–2.16 '' cultivated plant code , articles 2.19 however , retired transgenic varieties such as the fish tomato , which are no longer being developed , do not run into this obstacle and can be given a cultivar name names of cultivars are regulated by the international code of nomenclature for cultivated plants , and may be registered with an international cultivar registration authority ( icra ) a cultivar name consists of a botanical name ( of a genus , species , infraspecific taxon , interspecific hybrid or intergeneric hybrid ) followed by a cultivar epithet the formal scientific name of a cultivar , like solanum tuberosum ‘ king edward ’ , is a way of uniquely designating a particular kind of plant the icra then checks each new epithet to ensure that it has not been used before and that it conforms with the cultivated plant code

the term giant star was first coined by hertzsprung when it became apparent that the majority of stars fell into two distinct regions of the hertzsprung–russell diagram one region contained larger and more luminous stars of spectral types a to m and received the name giant subsequently , as they lacked any measurable parallax , it became apparent that some of these stars were significantly larger and more luminous than the bulk , and the term super-giant arose , quickly adopted as supergiant supergiant stars can be identified on the basis of their spectra , with distinctive lines sensitive to high luminosity and low surface gravity in 1897 , antonia maury had divided stars based on the widths of their spectral lines , with her class '' c '' identifying stars with the narrowest lines although it was not known at the time , these were the most luminous stars in 1943 morgan and keenan formalised the definition of spectral luminosity classes , with class i referring to supergiant stars supergiants occur in every spectral class from young blue class o supergiants to highly evolved red class m supergiants supergiants are also evolved stars with higher levels of heavy elements than main-sequence stars the mk system assigns stars to luminosity classes : ib for supergiants ; ia for luminous supergiants ; and 0 ( zero ) or ia + for hypergiants supergiant spectra are frequently annotated to indicate spectral peculiarities , for example rigel or f5 ipec once these massive stars leave the main sequence , their atmospheres inflate , and they are described as supergiants the phase where these stars have both hydrogen and helium burning shells is referred to as the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , as stars gradually become more and more luminous class m stars there are several categories of evolved stars that are not supergiants in evolutionary terms but may show supergiant spectral features or have luminosities comparable to supergiants specialists studying these stars often refer to them as super agb stars , since they have many properties in common with agb such as thermal pulsing many post-agb stars receive spectral types with supergiant luminosity classes wolf–rayet stars are also high-mass luminous evolved stars , hotter than most supergiants and smaller , visually less bright but often more luminous because of their high temperatures just as the agb stars occur in almost the same region of the hr diagram as red supergiants , wolf–rayet stars can occur in the same region of the hr diagram as the hottest blue supergiants and main-sequence stars the most massive and luminous main-sequence stars are almost indistinguishable from the supergiants they quickly evolve into such early o-type supergiants share many features with wnlh wolf–rayet stars and are sometimes designated as slash stars , intermediates between the two types luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) stars occur in the same region of the hr diagram as blue supergiants but are generally classified separately hypergiants are frequently treated as a different category of star from supergiants , although in all important respects they are just a more luminous category of supergiant some b ( e ) star be stars are supergiants although other be stars are clearly not all supergiants are larger and more luminous than main sequence stars of the same temperature the very hottest supergiants with early o spectral types occur in an extremely narrow range of luminosities above the highly luminous early o main sequence and giant stars the majority of red supergiants were main sequence stars and now have luminosities below , and there are very few bright supergiant ( ia ) m class stars stars more massive than about can not expand into a red supergiant because they burn too quickly and lose their outer layers too quickly , they reach the blue supergiant stage , or perhaps yellow hypergiant , before returning to become hotter stars supergiants are rare and short-lived stars , but their high luminosity means that there are many naked-eye examples , including some of the brightest stars in the sky

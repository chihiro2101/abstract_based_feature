the term giant star was first coined by hertzsprung when it became apparent that the majority of stars fell into two distinct regions of the hertzsprung–russell diagram one region contained larger and more luminous stars of spectral types a to m and received the name giant supergiant stars can be identified on the basis of their spectra , with distinctive lines sensitive to high luminosity and low surface gravity in 1943 morgan and keenan formalised the definition of spectral luminosity classes , with class i referring to supergiant stars supergiants occur in every spectral class from young blue class o supergiants to highly evolved red class m supergiants supergiants are also evolved stars with higher levels of heavy elements than main-sequence stars once these massive stars leave the main sequence , their atmospheres inflate , and they are described as supergiants they can not fuse carbon and heavier elements after the helium is exhausted , so they eventually just lose their outer layers , leaving the core of a white dwarf the phase where these stars have both hydrogen and helium burning shells is referred to as the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , as stars gradually become more and more luminous class m stars stars of may fuse sufficient carbon on the agb to produce an oxygen-neon core and an supernova core collapse , but astrophysicists categorise these as super-agb stars rather than supergiants there are several categories of evolved stars that are not supergiants in evolutionary terms but may show supergiant spectral features or have luminosities comparable to supergiants many post-agb stars receive spectral types with supergiant luminosity classes for example , rv tauri has an ia ( bright supergiant ) luminosity class despite being less massive than the sun some agb stars also receive a supergiant luminosity class , most notably w virginis variables such as w virginis itself , stars that are executing a blue loop triggered by thermal pulse a very small number of mira variables and other late agb stars have supergiant luminosity classes , for example α herculis wolf–rayet stars are also high-mass luminous evolved stars , hotter than most supergiants and smaller , visually less bright but often more luminous because of their high temperatures they have spectra dominated by helium and other heavier elements , usually showing little or no hydrogen , which is a clue to their nature as stars even more evolved than supergiants just as the agb stars occur in almost the same region of the hr diagram as red supergiants , wolf–rayet stars can occur in the same region of the hr diagram as the hottest blue supergiants and main-sequence stars the most massive and luminous main-sequence stars are almost indistinguishable from the supergiants they quickly evolve into they are evolved , expanded , massive and luminous stars like supergiants , but at the most massive and luminous extreme , and with particular additional properties of undergoing high mass-loss due to their extreme luminosities and instability some b ( e ) star be stars are supergiants although other be stars are clearly not there are supergiant stars at all of the main spectral classes and across the whole range of temperatures from mid-m class stars at around 3,400 k to the hottest o class stars over 40,000 k the majority of red supergiants were main sequence stars and now have luminosities below , and there are very few bright supergiant ( ia ) m class stars the majority of agb stars are given giant or bright giant luminosity classes , but particularly unstable stars such as w virginis variables may be given a supergiant classification ( e.g they are usually supergiants or hypergiants , occasionally with wolf-rayet spectra—extremely luminous , massive , evolved stars with expanded outer layers , but they are so distinctive and unusual that they are often treated as a separate category without being referred to as supergiants or given a supergiant spectral type cool supergiants show enhanced helium and nitrogen at the surface due to convection of these fusion products to the surface during the main sequence of very massive stars , to dredge-ups during shell burning , and to the loss of the outer layers of the star o type main-sequence stars and the most massive of the b type blue-white stars become supergiants stars more massive than about can not expand into a red supergiant supergiants are rare and short-lived stars , but their high luminosity means that there are many naked-eye examples , including some of the brightest stars in the sky

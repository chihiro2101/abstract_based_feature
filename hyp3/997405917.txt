supergiant stars can be identified on the basis of their spectra , with distinctive lines sensitive to high luminosity and low surface gravity although it was not known at the time , these were the most luminous stars in 1943 morgan and keenan formalised the definition of spectral luminosity classes , with class i referring to supergiant stars supergiants occur in every spectral class from young blue class o supergiants to highly evolved red class m supergiants because they are enlarged compared to main-sequence and giant stars of the same spectral type , they have lower surface gravities , and changes can be observed in their line profiles supergiants are also evolved stars with higher levels of heavy elements than main-sequence stars this is the basis of the mk luminosity system which assigns stars to luminosity classes purely from observing their spectra the mk system assigns stars to luminosity classes : ib for supergiants ; ia for luminous supergiants ; and 0 ( zero ) or ia + for hypergiants supergiants can also be defined as a specific phase in the evolutionary history of certain stars stars initially under will never form an iron core and in evolutionary terms do not become supergiants , although they can reach luminosities thousands of times the sun 's the phase where these stars have both hydrogen and helium burning shells is referred to as the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , as stars gradually become more and more luminous class m stars there are several categories of evolved stars that are not supergiants in evolutionary terms but may show supergiant spectral features or have luminosities comparable to supergiants many post-agb stars receive spectral types with supergiant luminosity classes a very small number of mira variables and other late agb stars have supergiant luminosity classes , for example α herculis classical cepheid variables typically have supergiant luminosity classes , although only the most luminous and massive will actually go on to develop an iron core the majority of them are intermediate mass stars fusing helium in their cores and will eventually transition to the asymptotic giant branch they have spectra dominated by helium and other heavier elements , usually showing little or no hydrogen , which is a clue to their nature as stars even more evolved than supergiants just as the agb stars occur in almost the same region of the hr diagram as red supergiants , wolf–rayet stars can occur in the same region of the hr diagram as the hottest blue supergiants and main-sequence stars the most massive and luminous main-sequence stars are almost indistinguishable from the supergiants they quickly evolve into such early o-type supergiants share many features with wnlh wolf–rayet stars and are sometimes designated as slash stars , intermediates between the two types they are evolved , expanded , massive and luminous stars like supergiants , but at the most massive and luminous extreme , and with particular additional properties of undergoing high mass-loss due to their extreme luminosities and instability generally only the more evolved supergiants show hypergiant properties , since their instability increases after high mass-loss and some increase in luminosity some b ( e ) star be stars are supergiants although other be stars are clearly not the latter has become more common with the understanding that the be phenomenon arises separately in a number of distinct types of stars , including some that are clearly just a phase in the life of supergiants these intermediate mass stars ' being classified as supergiants during a relatively long-lasting phase of their evolution account for the large number of low luminosity yellow supergiants they are usually supergiants or hypergiants , occasionally with wolf-rayet spectra—extremely luminous , massive , evolved stars with expanded outer layers , but they are so distinctive and unusual that they are often treated as a separate category without being referred to as supergiants or given a supergiant spectral type o type main-sequence stars and the most massive of the b type blue-white stars become supergiants supergiants develop when massive main-sequence stars run out of hydrogen in their cores , at which point they start to expand , just like lower-mass stars supergiants are rare and short-lived stars , but their high luminosity means that there are many naked-eye examples , including some of the brightest stars in the sky

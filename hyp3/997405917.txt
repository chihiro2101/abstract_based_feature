the term giant star was first coined by hertzsprung when it became apparent that the majority of stars fell into two distinct regions of the hertzsprung–russell diagram one region contained larger and more luminous stars of spectral types a to m and received the name giant subsequently , as they lacked any measurable parallax , it became apparent that some of these stars were significantly larger and more luminous than the bulk , and the term super-giant arose , quickly adopted as supergiant in 1897 , antonia maury had divided stars based on the widths of their spectral lines , with her class '' c '' identifying stars with the narrowest lines in 1943 morgan and keenan formalised the definition of spectral luminosity classes , with class i referring to supergiant stars supergiants occur in every spectral class from young blue class o supergiants to highly evolved red class m supergiants supergiants are also evolved stars with higher levels of heavy elements than main-sequence stars the mk system assigns stars to luminosity classes : ib for supergiants ; ia for luminous supergiants ; and 0 ( zero ) or ia + for hypergiants in reality there is much more of a continuum than well defined bands for these classifications , and classifications such as iab are used for intermediate luminosity supergiants the phase where these stars have both hydrogen and helium burning shells is referred to as the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , as stars gradually become more and more luminous class m stars many post-agb stars receive spectral types with supergiant luminosity classes for example , rv tauri has an ia ( bright supergiant ) luminosity class despite being less massive than the sun some agb stars also receive a supergiant luminosity class , most notably w virginis variables such as w virginis itself , stars that are executing a blue loop triggered by thermal pulse a very small number of mira variables and other late agb stars have supergiant luminosity classes , for example α herculis wolf–rayet stars are also high-mass luminous evolved stars , hotter than most supergiants and smaller , visually less bright but often more luminous because of their high temperatures just as the agb stars occur in almost the same region of the hr diagram as red supergiants , wolf–rayet stars can occur in the same region of the hr diagram as the hottest blue supergiants and main-sequence stars they have almost identical temperatures and very similar luminosities , and only the most detailed analyses can distinguish the spectral features that show they have evolved away from the narrow early o-type main-sequence to the nearby area of early o-type supergiants such early o-type supergiants share many features with wnlh wolf–rayet stars and are sometimes designated as slash stars , intermediates between the two types luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) stars occur in the same region of the hr diagram as blue supergiants but are generally classified separately they are evolved , expanded , massive and luminous stars like supergiants , but at the most massive and luminous extreme , and with particular additional properties of undergoing high mass-loss due to their extreme luminosities and instability some b ( e ) star be stars are supergiants although other be stars are clearly not cool luminous supergiants have lower surface gravities , with the most luminous ( and unstable ) stars having log ( g ) around zero although supergiants exist in every class from o to m , the majority are spectral type b , more than at all other spectral classes combined a distinct grouping is made up of high-luminosity supergiants at early b ( b0-2 ) and very late o ( o9.5 ) , more common even than main sequence stars of those spectral types the supergiants lie more or less on a horizontal band occupying the entire upper portion of the hr diagram , but there are some variations at different spectral types all supergiants are larger and more luminous than main sequence stars of the same temperature a b0 main sequence star has an absolute magnitude of about & minus ; 5 , meaning that all b0 supergiants are significantly brighter than absolute magnitude & minus ; 5 o type main-sequence stars and the most massive of the b type blue-white stars become supergiants supergiants develop when massive main-sequence stars run out of hydrogen in their cores , at which point they start to expand , just like lower-mass stars

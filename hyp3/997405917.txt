one region contained larger and more luminous stars of spectral types a to m and received the name giant subsequently , as they lacked any measurable parallax , it became apparent that some of these stars were significantly larger and more luminous than the bulk , and the term super-giant arose , quickly adopted as supergiant supergiant stars can be identified on the basis of their spectra , with distinctive lines sensitive to high luminosity and low surface gravity in 1897 , antonia maury had divided stars based on the widths of their spectral lines , with her class '' c '' identifying stars with the narrowest lines although it was not known at the time , these were the most luminous stars in 1943 morgan and keenan formalised the definition of spectral luminosity classes , with class i referring to supergiant stars supergiants are also evolved stars with higher levels of heavy elements than main-sequence stars the mk system assigns stars to luminosity classes : ib for supergiants ; ia for luminous supergiants ; and 0 ( zero ) or ia + for hypergiants stars initially under will never form an iron core and in evolutionary terms do not become supergiants , although they can reach luminosities thousands of times the sun 's the phase where these stars have both hydrogen and helium burning shells is referred to as the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , as stars gradually become more and more luminous class m stars stars of may fuse sufficient carbon on the agb to produce an oxygen-neon core and an supernova core collapse , but astrophysicists categorise these as super-agb stars rather than supergiants many post-agb stars receive spectral types with supergiant luminosity classes some agb stars also receive a supergiant luminosity class , most notably w virginis variables such as w virginis itself , stars that are executing a blue loop triggered by thermal pulse a very small number of mira variables and other late agb stars have supergiant luminosity classes , for example α herculis classical cepheid variables typically have supergiant luminosity classes , although only the most luminous and massive will actually go on to develop an iron core wolf–rayet stars are also high-mass luminous evolved stars , hotter than most supergiants and smaller , visually less bright but often more luminous because of their high temperatures just as the agb stars occur in almost the same region of the hr diagram as red supergiants , wolf–rayet stars can occur in the same region of the hr diagram as the hottest blue supergiants and main-sequence stars the most massive and luminous main-sequence stars are almost indistinguishable from the supergiants they quickly evolve into such early o-type supergiants share many features with wnlh wolf–rayet stars and are sometimes designated as slash stars , intermediates between the two types luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) stars occur in the same region of the hr diagram as blue supergiants but are generally classified separately they are evolved , expanded , massive and luminous stars like supergiants , but at the most massive and luminous extreme , and with particular additional properties of undergoing high mass-loss due to their extreme luminosities and instability some researchers distinguish the be objects as separate from supergiants , while researchers prefer to define massive evolved be stars as a subgroup of supergiants cool luminous supergiants have lower surface gravities , with the most luminous ( and unstable ) stars having log ( g ) around zero there are supergiant stars at all of the main spectral classes and across the whole range of temperatures from mid-m class stars at around 3,400 k to the hottest o class stars over 40,000 k a b0 main sequence star has an absolute magnitude of about & minus ; 5 , meaning that all b0 supergiants are significantly brighter than absolute magnitude & minus ; 5 the majority of red supergiants were main sequence stars and now have luminosities below , and there are very few bright supergiant ( ia ) m class stars the least luminous stars classified as red supergiants are some of the brightest agb and post-agb stars , highly expanded and unstable low mass stars such as the rv tauri variables o type main-sequence stars and the most massive of the b type blue-white stars become supergiants supergiants are rare and short-lived stars , but their high luminosity means that there are many naked-eye examples , including some of the brightest stars in the sky

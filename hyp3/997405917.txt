the term giant star was first coined by hertzsprung when it became apparent that the majority of stars fell into two distinct regions of the hertzsprung–russell diagram one region contained larger and more luminous stars of spectral types a to m and received the name giant subsequently , as they lacked any measurable parallax , it became apparent that some of these stars were significantly larger and more luminous than the bulk , and the term super-giant arose , quickly adopted as supergiant supergiant stars can be identified on the basis of their spectra , with distinctive lines sensitive to high luminosity and low surface gravity in 1897 , antonia maury had divided stars based on the widths of their spectral lines , with her class '' c '' identifying stars with the narrowest lines although it was not known at the time , these were the most luminous stars in 1943 morgan and keenan formalised the definition of spectral luminosity classes , with class i referring to supergiant stars supergiants occur in every spectral class from young blue class o supergiants to highly evolved red class m supergiants because they are enlarged compared to main-sequence and giant stars of the same spectral type , they have lower surface gravities , and changes can be observed in their line profiles supergiants are also evolved stars with higher levels of heavy elements than main-sequence stars this is the basis of the mk luminosity system which assigns stars to luminosity classes purely from observing their spectra the mk system assigns stars to luminosity classes : ib for supergiants ; ia for luminous supergiants ; and 0 ( zero ) or ia + for hypergiants the phase where these stars have both hydrogen and helium burning shells is referred to as the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , as stars gradually become more and more luminous class m stars there are several categories of evolved stars that are not supergiants in evolutionary terms but may show supergiant spectral features or have luminosities comparable to supergiants many post-agb stars receive spectral types with supergiant luminosity classes a very small number of mira variables and other late agb stars have supergiant luminosity classes , for example α herculis wolf–rayet stars are also high-mass luminous evolved stars , hotter than most supergiants and smaller , visually less bright but often more luminous because of their high temperatures they have spectra dominated by helium and other heavier elements , usually showing little or no hydrogen , which is a clue to their nature as stars even more evolved than supergiants just as the agb stars occur in almost the same region of the hr diagram as red supergiants , wolf–rayet stars can occur in the same region of the hr diagram as the hottest blue supergiants and main-sequence stars the most massive and luminous main-sequence stars are almost indistinguishable from the supergiants they quickly evolve into such early o-type supergiants share many features with wnlh wolf–rayet stars and are sometimes designated as slash stars , intermediates between the two types luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) stars occur in the same region of the hr diagram as blue supergiants but are generally classified separately they are evolved , expanded , massive , and luminous stars , often hypergiants , but they have very specific spectral variability , which defies the assignment of a standard spectral type some b ( e ) star be stars are supergiants although other be stars are clearly not the supergiant luminosity class is assigned on the basis of spectral features that are largely a measure of surface gravity , although such stars are also affected by other properties such as microturbulence there are supergiant stars at all of the main spectral classes and across the whole range of temperatures from mid-m class stars at around 3,400 k to the hottest o class stars over 40,000 k the majority of red supergiants were main sequence stars and now have luminosities below , and there are very few bright supergiant ( ia ) m class stars o type main-sequence stars and the most massive of the b type blue-white stars become supergiants stars more massive than about can not expand into a red supergiant

'' dc '' stands for '' douglas commercial '' the dc-3 was the culmination of a development effort that began after an inquiry from trans world airlines ( twa ) to donald douglas twa asked douglas to design and build an aircraft that would allow twa to compete with united douglas ' design , the 1933 dc-1 , was promising , and led to the dc-2 in 1934 the dc-3 resulted from a marathon telephone call from american airlines ceo c smith to donald douglas , when smith persuaded a reluctant douglas to design a sleeper aircraft based on the dc-2 to replace american 's curtiss condor ii biplanes douglas agreed to go ahead with development only after smith informed him of american 's intention to purchase twenty aircraft the new aircraft was engineered by a team led by chief engineer arthur e its cabin was wide , and a version with 21 seats instead of the 14–16 sleeping berths berths were long ; lowers were wide and uppers were there was no prototype dc-3 , and the first dc-3 built followed seven dsts off the production line for delivery to american airlines the dc-3 and dst popularized air travel in the united states in about 15 hours with three refueling stops while westbound trips against the wind took hours five dc-3s super dc-3s with pratt & whitney r-2000 twin wasps were built in the late 1940s , three of which entered airline service production of dsts ended in mid-1941 and civil dc-3 production ended in early 1943 , although dozens of the dsts and dc-3s ordered by airlines that were produced between 1941 and 1943 were pressed into the us military service while still on the production line the civilian market was flooded with second-hand c-47s , many of which were converted to passenger and cargo versions the prototype super dc-3 served the us navy with the designation yc-129 alongside 100 r4ds that had been upgraded to the super dc-3 specification other conversions featured armstrong siddeley mamba or pratt & whitney pt6a turbines turbo dakota dc-3 '' turbine conversion aircraft '' '' faa supplemental type certificate number sa3820sw '' retrieved march 28 , 2015 turbo dakota dc-3 conversion process , dodson international basler refurbishes c-47s and dc-3s at oshkosh , wisconsin , fitting them with pratt & whitney canada pt6 turboprop engines , lengthening the fuselage by with a fuselage plug ahead of the wing , and some local strengthening of the airframe in total , klm bought 23 dc-3s before the war broke out in europe the dc-2 's right wing was removed , flown to suifu under the belly of another cnac dc-3 , and bolted up to the damaged aircraft after a single test flight , in which it was discovered that it pulled to the right due to the difference in wing sizes , the so-called dc-2½ was flown to safety military versions of the dc-3 were built , under the designations douglas c-47 skytrain the armed forces of many countries used the dc-3 and its military variants for the transport of troops , cargo , and wounded licensed copies of the dc-3 were built in japan as the showa l2d ( 487 aircraft ) ; and in the soviet union as the lisunov li-2 ( 4,937 aircraft ) cubana de aviación became the first latin american airline to offer a scheduled service to miami when it started its first scheduled international service from havana in 1945 with a dc-3 the united states forest service used the dc-3 for smoke jumping and general transportation until the last example was retired in december 2015 perhaps unique among prewar aircraft , the dc-3 continues to fly in active commercial and military service as of 2021 , eighty six years after the type 's first flight in 1935 the very large number of civil and military operators of the dc-3/c-47 and related types makes a listing of all the airlines , air forces and other current operators impracticable ; dc-3a : dc-3 with pratt & whitney r-1830 twin wasp engines ; c-50 : various dc-3 models , fourteen impressed as c-50 , c-50a , c-50b , c-50c , and c-50d ; lxd1 : a single dc-3 supplied for evaluation by the imperial japanese navy air service ( ijnas ) ; mamba-dakota : a single conversion for the ministry of supply , powered by two armstrong-siddeley mamba turboprop engines dc-3/dakota historical society the dc-3 hangar – douglas dc-3 specific site centennial of flight commission on the dc-3

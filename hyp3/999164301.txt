geoid the geoid surface is irregular , unlike the reference ellipsoid ( which is a mathematical idealized representation of the physical earth ) , but is considerably smoother than earth 's physical surface if the ocean were isopycnic ( of constant density ) and undisturbed by tides , currents or weather , its surface would resemble the geoid the permanent deviation between the geoid and mean sea level is called ocean surface topography in reality , the geoid does not have a physical meaning under the continents , but geodesists are able to derive the heights of continental points above this imaginary , yet physically defined , surface by spirit leveling being an equipotential surface , the geoid is , by definition , a surface to which the force of gravity is everywhere perpendicular that is because gps satellites , orbiting about the center of gravity of the earth , can measure heights only relative to a geocentric reference ellipsoid then , they are able to correct the height above wgs ellipsoid to the height above egm96 geoid an oblate spheroid is typically used as the idealized earth , but even if the earth were spherical and did not rotate , the strength of gravity would not be the same everywhere because density varies throughout the planet instead , the water level would be higher or lower with respect to earth 's center , depending on the strength of gravity in that location the geoid rises where the earth material is locally more dense , which is where the earth exerts greater gravitational pull undulation of the geoid is the height of the geoid relative to a given ellipsoid of reference in maps and common use the height over the mean sea level ( such as orthometric height ) is used to indicate the height of elevations while the ellipsoidal height results from the gps system and similar gnss recent satellite missions , such as the gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer ( goce ) and grace , have enabled the study of time-variable geoid signals

geoid the geoid surface is irregular , unlike the reference ellipsoid ( which is a mathematical idealized representation of the physical earth ) , but is considerably smoother than earth 's physical surface if the ocean were isopycnic ( of constant density ) and undisturbed by tides , currents or weather , its surface would resemble the geoid the permanent deviation between the geoid and mean sea level is called ocean surface topography if the continental land masses were crisscrossed by a series of tunnels or canals , the sea level in those canals would also very nearly coincide with the geoid being an equipotential surface , the geoid is , by definition , a surface to which the force of gravity is everywhere perpendicular that means that when traveling by ship , one does not notice the undulation of the geoid ; the local vertical ( plumb line ) is always perpendicular to the geoid and the local horizon tangential to it that is because gps satellites , orbiting about the center of gravity of the earth , can measure heights only relative to a geocentric reference ellipsoid then , they are able to correct the height above wgs ellipsoid to the height above egm96 geoid instead , the water level would be higher or lower with respect to earth 's center , depending on the strength of gravity in that location undulation of the geoid is the height of the geoid relative to a given ellipsoid of reference trimmer , '' gravitational potential expansion to degree 2160 '' , iag international symposium , gravity , geoid and space mission ggsm2004 , porto , portugal , 2004 variations in the height of the geoidal surface are related to density anomalous distributions within the earth recent satellite missions , such as the gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer ( goce ) and grace , have enabled the study of time-variable geoid signals

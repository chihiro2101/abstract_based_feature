geoid the geoid surface is irregular , unlike the reference ellipsoid ( which is a mathematical idealized representation of the physical earth ) , but is considerably smoother than earth 's physical surface if the ocean were isopycnic ( of constant density ) and undisturbed by tides , currents or weather , its surface would resemble the geoid the permanent deviation between the geoid and mean sea level is called ocean surface topography if the continental land masses were crisscrossed by a series of tunnels or canals , the sea level in those canals would also very nearly coincide with the geoid in reality , the geoid does not have a physical meaning under the continents , but geodesists are able to derive the heights of continental points above this imaginary , yet physically defined , surface by spirit leveling being an equipotential surface , the geoid is , by definition , a surface to which the force of gravity is everywhere perpendicular that means that when traveling by ship , one does not notice the undulation of the geoid ; the local vertical ( plumb line ) is always perpendicular to the geoid and the local horizon tangential to it that is because gps satellites , orbiting about the center of gravity of the earth , can measure heights only relative to a geocentric reference ellipsoid then , they are able to correct the height above wgs ellipsoid to the height above egm96 geoid undulation of the geoid is the height of the geoid relative to a given ellipsoid of reference the undulation is not standardized , as different countries use different mean sea levels as reference , but most commonly refers to the egm96 geoid trimmer , '' gravitational potential expansion to degree 2160 '' , iag international symposium , gravity , geoid and space mission ggsm2004 , porto , portugal , 2004 recent satellite missions , such as the gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer ( goce ) and grace , have enabled the study of time-variable geoid signals

geoid the geoid surface is irregular , unlike the reference ellipsoid ( which is a mathematical idealized representation of the physical earth ) , but is considerably smoother than earth 's physical surface the permanent deviation between the geoid and mean sea level is called ocean surface topography if the continental land masses were crisscrossed by a series of tunnels or canals , the sea level in those canals would also very nearly coincide with the geoid that means that when traveling by ship , one does not notice the undulation of the geoid ; the local vertical ( plumb line ) is always perpendicular to the geoid and the local horizon tangential to it on a long voyage , spirit leveling indicates height variations even though the ship is always at sea level ( neglecting the effects of tides ) egm-96 , egm-2008 , egm-2020 ) height over the world geodetic system ( wgs , e.g then , they are able to correct the height above wgs ellipsoid to the height above egm96 geoid the geoid rises where the earth material is locally more dense , which is where the earth exerts greater gravitational pull undulation of the geoid is the height of the geoid relative to a given ellipsoid of reference in maps and common use the height over the mean sea level ( such as orthometric height ) is used to indicate the height of elevations while the ellipsoidal height results from the gps system and similar gnss trimmer , '' gravitational potential expansion to degree 2160 '' , iag international symposium , gravity , geoid and space mission ggsm2004 , porto , portugal , 2004 this is why many handheld gps receivers have built-in undulation lookup tables to determine the height above sea level variations in the height of the geoidal surface are related to density anomalous distributions within the earth

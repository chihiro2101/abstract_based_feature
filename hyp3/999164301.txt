geoid the geoid surface is irregular , unlike the reference ellipsoid ( which is a mathematical idealized representation of the physical earth ) , but is considerably smoother than earth 's physical surface if the ocean were isopycnic ( of constant density ) and undisturbed by tides , currents or weather , its surface would resemble the geoid the permanent deviation between the geoid and mean sea level is called ocean surface topography if the continental land masses were crisscrossed by a series of tunnels or canals , the sea level in those canals would also very nearly coincide with the geoid being an equipotential surface , the geoid is , by definition , a surface to which the force of gravity is everywhere perpendicular then , they are able to correct the height above wgs ellipsoid to the height above egm96 geoid an oblate spheroid is typically used as the idealized earth , but even if the earth were spherical and did not rotate , the strength of gravity would not be the same everywhere because density varies throughout the planet instead , the water level would be higher or lower with respect to earth 's center , depending on the strength of gravity in that location the geoid level coincides with where the water would be undulation of the geoid is the height of the geoid relative to a given ellipsoid of reference software and data is on the earth gravitational model 2008 ( egm2008 ) - wgs 84 version ] page variations in the height of the geoidal surface are related to density anomalous distributions within the earth recent satellite missions , such as the gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer ( goce ) and grace , have enabled the study of time-variable geoid signals

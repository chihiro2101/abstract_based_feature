a satellite modem is not the only device needed to establish a communication channel other equipment that are essential for creating a satellite link include satellite antennas and frequency converters data to be transmitted are transferred to a modem from data terminal equipment ( e.g the modem usually has intermediate frequency ( if ) output ( that is , 50-200 & nbsp ; mhz ) , however , sometimes the signal is modulated directly to l-band a modulated signal is a sequence of symbols , pieces of data represented by a corresponding signal state , e.g the lnb is usually powered by the modem through the signal cable with 13 or 18 v dc the main functions of a satellite modem are modulation and demodulation satellite communication standards also define error correction codes and framing formats a block diagram of a generic satellite modem is shown on the image a digital modulator transforms a digital stream into a radio signal on intermediate frequency ( if ) error correction techniques are essential for satellite communications , because , due to satellite 's limited power a signal to noise ratio at the receiver is usually rather poor satellite modems are often used for home internet access

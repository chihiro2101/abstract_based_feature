a satellite modem is not the only device needed to establish a communication channel other equipment that are essential for creating a satellite link include satellite antennas and frequency converters data to be transmitted are transferred to a modem from data terminal equipment ( e.g similarly , a signal received from a satellite is firstly downconverter ( this is done by a low-noise block converter - lnb ) , then demodulated by a modem , and at last handled by data terminal equipment the lnb is usually powered by the modem through the signal cable with 13 or 18 v dc the main functions of a satellite modem are modulation and demodulation satellite communication standards also define error correction codes and framing formats a block diagram of a generic satellite modem is shown on the image a digital modulator transforms a digital stream into a radio signal on intermediate frequency ( if ) error correction techniques are essential for satellite communications , because , due to satellite 's limited power a signal to noise ratio at the receiver is usually rather poor satellite modems are often used for home internet access there are also industrial satellite modems intended to provide a permanent link

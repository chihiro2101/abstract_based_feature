a satellite modem is not the only device needed to establish a communication channel other equipment that are essential for creating a satellite link include satellite antennas and frequency converters the modem usually has intermediate frequency ( if ) output ( that is , 50-200 & nbsp ; mhz ) , however , sometimes the signal is modulated directly to l-band similarly , a signal received from a satellite is firstly downconverter ( this is done by a low-noise block converter - lnb ) , then demodulated by a modem , and at last handled by data terminal equipment the lnb is usually powered by the modem through the signal cable with 13 or 18 v dc the main functions of a satellite modem are modulation and demodulation satellite communication standards also define error correction codes and framing formats probably the best way of understanding modem 's work is to look at its internal structure a block diagram of a generic satellite modem is shown on the image the input signal for the analog tract is at the intermediate frequency or in the l-band , in the second case it must be firstly converted to if a modulator is generally a much simpler device than a demodulator , because it does n't have to recover symbol and carrier frequencies satellite modems are often used for home internet access

a satellite modem is not the only device needed to establish a communication channel other equipment that are essential for creating a satellite link include satellite antennas and frequency converters the modem usually has intermediate frequency ( if ) output ( that is , 50-200 & nbsp ; mhz ) , however , sometimes the signal is modulated directly to l-band recovering a symbol clock ( making a local symbol clock generator synchronous with the remote one ) is one of the most important tasks of a demodulator similarly , a signal received from a satellite is firstly downconverter ( this is done by a low-noise block converter - lnb ) , then demodulated by a modem , and at last handled by data terminal equipment the lnb is usually powered by the modem through the signal cable with 13 or 18 v dc the main functions of a satellite modem are modulation and demodulation satellite communication standards also define error correction codes and framing formats the purpose of the analog tract in the receiver is to convert signal 's frequency , to adjust its power via an automatic gain control circuit and to get its complex envelope components a digital modulator transforms a digital stream into a radio signal on intermediate frequency ( if ) error correction techniques are essential for satellite communications , because , due to satellite 's limited power a signal to noise ratio at the receiver is usually rather poor ' generally , a demultiplexer is a device which transforms one multiplexed data stream to several streams which it consists of

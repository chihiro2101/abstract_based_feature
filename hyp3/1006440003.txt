they generally use the intermediate value theorem , which asserts that if a continuous function has values of opposite signs at the end points of an interval , then the function has at least one root in the interval therefore , they require to start with an interval such that the function takes opposite signs at the end points of the interval however , in the case of polynomials there are other methods ( descartes ' rule of signs , budan 's theorem and sturm 's theorem ) for getting information on the number of roots in an interval they lead to efficient algorithms for real-root isolation of polynomials , which ensure finding all real roots with a guaranteed accuracy let be a continuous function , for which one knows an interval such that and have opposite signs ( a bracket ) if the given polynomial only has real coefficients , one may wish to avoid computations with complex numbers the splitting circle method uses fft-based polynomial transformations to find large-degree factors corresponding to clusters of roots most root-finding algorithms can find some real roots , but can not certify having found all the roots methods for finding all complex roots , such as aberth method can provide the real roots most root-finding algorithms behave badly when there are multiple roots or very close roots list of root finding algorithms gnu scientific library th root algorithm

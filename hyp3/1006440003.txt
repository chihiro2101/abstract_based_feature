bracketing methods determine successively smaller intervals ( brackets ) that contain a root they generally use the intermediate value theorem , which asserts that if a continuous function has values of opposite signs at the end points of an interval , then the function has at least one root in the interval therefore , they require to start with an interval such that the function takes opposite signs at the end points of the interval however , in the case of polynomials there are other methods ( descartes ' rule of signs , budan 's theorem and sturm 's theorem ) for getting information on the number of roots in an interval they lead to efficient algorithms for real-root isolation of polynomials , which ensure finding all real roots with a guaranteed accuracy the simplest root-finding algorithm is the bisection method let be a continuous function , for which one knows an interval such that and have opposite signs ( a bracket ) if the given polynomial only has real coefficients , one may wish to avoid computations with complex numbers applying vieta 's formulas , one obtains easy approximations for the modulus of the roots , and with some more effort , for the roots themselves methods for finding all complex roots , such as aberth method can provide the real roots both implementations can routinely find the real roots of polynomials of degree higher than 1,000

they generally use the intermediate value theorem , which asserts that if a continuous function has values of opposite signs at the end points of an interval , then the function has at least one root in the interval however , in the case of polynomials there are other methods ( descartes ' rule of signs , budan 's theorem and sturm 's theorem ) for getting information on the number of roots in an interval they lead to efficient algorithms for real-root isolation of polynomials , which ensure finding all real roots with a guaranteed accuracy the simplest root-finding algorithm is the bisection method let be a continuous function , for which one knows an interval such that and have opposite signs ( a bracket ) although the bisection method is robust , it gains one and only one bit of accuracy with each iteration finding roots in pairs applying vieta 's formulas , one obtains easy approximations for the modulus of the roots , and with some more effort , for the roots themselves methods for finding all complex roots , such as aberth method can provide the real roots with these improvements they reach a computational complexity that is similar to that of the best algorithms for computing all the roots ( even when all roots are real ) most root-finding algorithms behave badly when there are multiple roots or very close roots

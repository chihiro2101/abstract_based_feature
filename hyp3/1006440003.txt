they generally use the intermediate value theorem , which asserts that if a continuous function has values of opposite signs at the end points of an interval , then the function has at least one root in the interval however , in the case of polynomials there are other methods ( descartes ' rule of signs , budan 's theorem and sturm 's theorem ) for getting information on the number of roots in an interval they lead to efficient algorithms for real-root isolation of polynomials , which ensure finding all real roots with a guaranteed accuracy although the bisection method is robust , it gains one and only one bit of accuracy with each iteration to that effect , one has to find quadratic factors for pairs of conjugate complex roots all these methods involve finding the coefficients of shifted and scaled versions of the polynomial the splitting circle method uses fft-based polynomial transformations to find large-degree factors corresponding to clusters of roots finding the real roots of a polynomial with real coefficients is a problem that has received much attention since the beginning of 19th century , and is still an active domain of research most root-finding algorithms can find some real roots , but can not certify having found all the roots most root-finding algorithms behave badly when there are multiple roots or very close roots this method , called square-free factorization , is based on the multiple roots of a polynomial being the roots of the greatest common divisor of the polynomial and its derivative

when the interval is small enough , then a root has been found they lead to efficient algorithms for real-root isolation of polynomials , which ensure finding all real roots with a guaranteed accuracy the simplest root-finding algorithm is the bisection method let be a continuous function , for which one knows an interval such that and have opposite signs ( a bracket ) then either and , or and have opposite signs , and one has divided by two the size of the interval if the given polynomial only has real coefficients , one may wish to avoid computations with complex numbers to that effect , one has to find quadratic factors for pairs of conjugate complex roots most root-finding algorithms can find some real roots , but can not certify having found all the roots methods for finding all complex roots , such as aberth method can provide the real roots most root-finding algorithms behave badly when there are multiple roots or very close roots list of root finding algorithms gnu scientific library th root algorithm

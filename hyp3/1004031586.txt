nasmyth was born at 47 york place , edinburgh where his father alexander nasmyth was a landscape and portrait painter one of alexander 's hobbies was mechanics and he employed nearly all his spare time in his workshop where he encouraged his youngest son to work with him in all sorts of materials in 1820 he left the high school and again made great use of his father 's workshop where at the age of 17 , he made his first steam engine from 1821 to 1826 , nasmyth regularly attended the edinburgh school of arts ( today heriot-watt university , making him one of the first students of the institution ) he had heard of the fame of henry maudslay 's workshop and resolved to get employment there ; unfortunately his father could not afford to place him as an apprentice at maudslay 's works nasmyth therefore decided instead to show maudslay examples of his skills and produced a complete working model of a high-pressure steam engine , creating the working drawings and constructing the components himself in may 1829 , nasmyth visited maudslay in london , and after showing him his work was engaged as an assistant workman at 10 shillings a week when nasmyth was 23 years old , having saved the sum of £69 , he decided to set up in business on his own he moved to patricroft , an area of the town of eccles , lancashire , where in august 1836 , he and his business partner holbrook gaskell opened the bridgewater foundry , where they traded as nasmyth , gaskell and company in march 1838 james was making a journey by coach from sheffield to york in a snowstorm , when he spied some ironwork furnaces in the distance nasmyth made a sketch of his steam hammer design dated 24 november 1839 , but the immediate need disappeared when the practicality of screw propellers was demonstrated and the great britain was converted to that design however , the schneiders hesitated to build bourdon 's radical new machine bourdon and eugène schneider visited the nasmyth works in england in the middle of 1840 , where they were shown nasmyth 's sketch in 1840 bourdon built the first steam hammer in the world at the schneider & cie works at le creusot nasmyth said '' there it was , in truth & ndash ; a thumping child of my brain ! '' nasmyth patented his design in june 1842 using money borrowed from anne nasmyth 's husband william bennett apart from the steam hammer , nasmyth created several other important machine tools , including the shaper , an adaptation of the planer which is still used in tool and die making he built his own 20-inch nasmyth telescope , in the process inventing the nasmyth focus , and made detailed observations of the moon in memory of his renowned contribution to the discipline of mechanical engineering , the department of mechanical engineering building at heriot-watt university , in his birthplace of edinburgh , is called the james nasmyth building

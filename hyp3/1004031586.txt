nasmyth was born at 47 york place , edinburgh where his father alexander nasmyth was a landscape and portrait painter one of alexander 's hobbies was mechanics and he employed nearly all his spare time in his workshop where he encouraged his youngest son to work with him in all sorts of materials james was sent to the royal high school where he had as a friend , jimmy patterson , the son of a local iron founder being already interested in mechanics he spent much of his time at the foundry and there he gradually learned to work and turn in wood , brass , iron , and steel in 1820 he left the high school and again made great use of his father 's workshop where at the age of 17 , he made his first steam engine from 1821 to 1826 , nasmyth regularly attended the edinburgh school of arts ( today heriot-watt university , making him one of the first students of the institution ) nasmyth therefore decided instead to show maudslay examples of his skills and produced a complete working model of a high-pressure steam engine , creating the working drawings and constructing the components himself in may 1829 , nasmyth visited maudslay in london , and after showing him his work was engaged as an assistant workman at 10 shillings a week unfortunately , maudslay died two years later , whereupon nasmyth was taken on by maudslay 's partner as a draughtsman he moved to patricroft , an area of the town of eccles , lancashire , where in august 1836 , he and his business partner holbrook gaskell opened the bridgewater foundry , where they traded as nasmyth , gaskell and company concentrated on producing a wide range of machine tools in large numbers nasmyth made a sketch of his steam hammer design dated 24 november 1839 , but the immediate need disappeared when the practicality of screw propellers was demonstrated and the great britain was converted to that design bourdon and eug√®ne schneider visited the nasmyth works in england in the middle of 1840 , where they were shown nasmyth 's sketch in april 1842 nasmyth visited france with a view to supplying the french arsenals and dockyards with tools and while he was there took the opportunity to visit the le creusot works a larger nasmyth & wilson steam hammer stands in the campus of the university of bolton nasmyth was also one of the first toolmakers to offer a standardised range of machine tools ; before this , manufacturers constructed tools according to individual clients ' specifications with little regard to standardisation , which caused compatibility problems he settled down near penshurst , kent , where he renamed his retirement home '' hammerfield '' and happily pursued his various hobbies including astronomy in memory of his renowned contribution to the discipline of mechanical engineering , the department of mechanical engineering building at heriot-watt university , in his birthplace of edinburgh , is called the james nasmyth building

the key elements of the hpa axis are : the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus , which contains neuroendocrine neurons which synthesize and secrete vasopressin and corticotropin-releasing hormone ( crh ) acth in turn acts on : the adrenal cortex , which produces glucocorticoid hormones ( mainly cortisol in humans ) in response to stimulation by acth glucocorticoids in turn act back on the hypothalamus and pituitary ( to suppress crh and acth production ) in a negative feedback cycle one important target of glucocorticoids is the hypothalamus , which is a major controlling centre of the hpa axis important to the function of the hpa axis are some of the feedback loops : cortisol produced in the adrenal cortex will negatively feedback to inhibit both the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland release of corticotropin-releasing hormone ( crh ) from the hypothalamus is influenced by stress , physical activity , illness , by blood levels of cortisol and by the sleep/wake cycle ( circadian rhythm ) the hpa axis has a central role in regulating many homeostatic systems in the body , including the metabolic system , cardiovascular system , immune system , reproductive system and central nervous system anatomical connections between brain areas such as the amygdala , hippocampus , prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus facilitate activation of the hpa axis at the hypothalamus , fear-signaling impulses activate both the sympathetic nervous system and the modulating systems of the hpa axis as well as directly increasing glucose availability , cortisol also suppresses the highly demanding metabolic processes of the immune system , resulting in further availability of glucose there is bi-directional communication and feedback between the hpa axis and the immune system a number of cytokines , such as il-1 , il-6 , il-10 and tnf-alpha can activate the hpa axis , although il-1 is the most potent the hpa axis in turn modulates the immune response , with high levels of cortisol resulting in a suppression of immune and inflammatory reactions the cns regulates the immune system through neuroendocrine pathways , such as the hpa axis the hpa axis is responsible for modulating inflammation that occur throughout the body during an immune response , proinflammatory cytokines ( e.g interactions between the proinflammatory cytokines and the brain can alter the metabolic activity of neurotransmitters and cause symptoms such as fatigue , depression , and mood changes deficiencies in the hpa axis may play a role in allergies and inflammatory/ autoimmune diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis il-1 , tnf alpha , and ifn gamma ) and increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines ( e.g antidepressants , which are routinely prescribed for many of these illnesses , serve to regulate hpa axis function specifically in rodents , females show greater activation of the hpa axis following stress than males oestrogen functions to enhance stress-activated acth and cort secretion while testosterone functions to decrease hpa axis activation and works to inhibit both acth and cort responses to stress however , more studies are required to better understand the underlying basis of these sex differences experimental studies have investigated many different types of stress , and their effects on the hpa axis in many different circumstances in post-traumatic stress disorder there appears to be lower-than-normal cortisol release , and it is thought that a blunted hormonal response to stress may predispose a person to develop ptsd exposure to mild or moderate stressors early in life has been shown to enhance hpa regulation and promote a lifelong resilience to stress another possibility is that the effects of early-life stress on hpa functioning are mediated by maternal care though animal models allow for more control of experimental manipulation , the effects of early life stress on hpa axis function in humans has also been studied in this manner , maternal care negatively regulates stress response in the neonate , thereby shaping his/her susceptibility to stress in later life in contemporary society , the endurance of the hpa axis and early life programming will have important implications for counseling expecting and new mothers , as well as individuals who may have experienced significant early life adversity mind-body-health.net page on hpa axis hpa axis : explanation of the body 's central stress response system w/diagram

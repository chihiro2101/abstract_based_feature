the key elements of the hpa axis are : the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus , which contains neuroendocrine neurons which synthesize and secrete vasopressin and corticotropin-releasing hormone ( crh ) acth in turn acts on : the adrenal cortex , which produces glucocorticoid hormones ( mainly cortisol in humans ) in response to stimulation by acth glucocorticoids in turn act back on the hypothalamus and pituitary ( to suppress crh and acth production ) in a negative feedback cycle cortisol is a major stress hormone and has effects on many tissues in the body , including the brain in the brain , cortisol acts on two types of receptor – mineralocorticoid receptors and glucocorticoid receptors , and these are expressed by many different types of neurons one important target of glucocorticoids is the hypothalamus , which is a major controlling centre of the hpa axis vasopressin can be thought of as '' water conservation hormone '' and is also known as '' antidiuretic hormone important to the function of the hpa axis are some of the feedback loops : cortisol produced in the adrenal cortex will negatively feedback to inhibit both the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland e/ne will positively feedback to the pituitary and increase the breakdown of pomcs into acth and β-endorphins release of corticotropin-releasing hormone ( crh ) from the hypothalamus is influenced by stress , physical activity , illness , by blood levels of cortisol and by the sleep/wake cycle ( circadian rhythm ) the hpa axis has a central role in regulating many homeostatic systems in the body , including the metabolic system , cardiovascular system , immune system , reproductive system and central nervous system at the hypothalamus , fear-signaling impulses activate both the sympathetic nervous system and the modulating systems of the hpa axis the hpa axis in turn modulates the immune response , with high levels of cortisol resulting in a suppression of immune and inflammatory reactions the cns regulates the immune system through neuroendocrine pathways , such as the hpa axis il-1 ) are released into the peripheral circulation system and can pass through the blood brain barrier where they can interact with the brain and activate the hpa axis deficiencies in the hpa axis may play a role in allergies and inflammatory/ autoimmune diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis when the hpa axis is activated by stressors , such as an immune response , high levels of glucocorticoids are released into the body and suppress immune response by inhibiting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines ( e.g by constantly activating the hpa axis , this could lead to higher instances of stress and disorders that would only get worse with chronic stress specifically in rodents , females show greater activation of the hpa axis following stress than males oestrogen functions to enhance stress-activated acth and cort secretion while testosterone functions to decrease hpa axis activation and works to inhibit both acth and cort responses to stress stressors can be of many different types—in experimental studies in rats , a distinction is often made between '' social stress '' and '' physical stress '' , but both types activate the hpa axis , though via different pathways there is evidence that an increase in oxytocin , resulting for instance from positive social interactions , acts to suppress the hpa axis and thereby counteracts stress , promoting positive health effects such as wound healing studies on people show that the hpa axis is activated in different ways during chronic stress depending on the type of stressor , the person 's response to the stressor and other factors in animal experiments , exposure to prenatal stress has been shown to cause a hyper-reactive hpa stress response there is no clear indication that hpa dysregulation caused by prenatal stress can alter adult behavior exposure to mild or moderate stressors early in life has been shown to enhance hpa regulation and promote a lifelong resilience to stress there may be a critical period during development during which the level of stress hormones in the bloodstream contribute to the permanent calibration of the hpa axis one experiment has shown that , even in the absence of any environmental stressors , early-life exposure to moderate levels of corticosterone was associated with stress resilience in adult rats , whereas exposure to high doses was associated with stress vulnerability whereas maternal care improves cardiac response , sleep/wake rhythm , and growth hormone secretion in the neonate , it also suppresses hpa axis activity conversely , if an individual is exposed to significant early life adversity , heightened hpa axis reactivity may “ mismatch ” him/her in an environment characterized by low stress ;

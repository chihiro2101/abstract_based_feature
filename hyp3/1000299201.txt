the key elements of the hpa axis are : the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus , which contains neuroendocrine neurons which synthesize and secrete vasopressin and corticotropin-releasing hormone ( crh ) these two peptides regulate : the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland acth in turn acts on : the adrenal cortex , which produces glucocorticoid hormones ( mainly cortisol in humans ) in response to stimulation by acth glucocorticoids in turn act back on the hypothalamus and pituitary ( to suppress crh and acth production ) in a negative feedback cycle crh is transported to the anterior pituitary through the portal blood vessel system of the hypophyseal stalk and vasopressin is transported by axonal transport to the posterior pituitary acth is transported by the blood to the adrenal cortex of the adrenal gland , where it rapidly stimulates biosynthesis of corticosteroids such as cortisol from cholesterol cortisol is a major stress hormone and has effects on many tissues in the body , including the brain one important target of glucocorticoids is the hypothalamus , which is a major controlling centre of the hpa axis important to the function of the hpa axis are some of the feedback loops : cortisol produced in the adrenal cortex will negatively feedback to inhibit both the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland epinephrine and norepinephrine ( e/ne ) are produced by the adrenal medulla through sympathetic stimulation and the local effects of cortisol ( upregulation enzymes to make e/ne ) an abnormally flattened circadian cortisol cycle has been linked with chronic fatigue syndrome , insomnia and burnout the hpa axis has a central role in regulating many homeostatic systems in the body , including the metabolic system , cardiovascular system , immune system , reproductive system and central nervous system the hpa axis integrates physical and psychosocial influences in order to allow an organism to adapt effectively to its environment , use resources , and optimize survival at the hypothalamus , fear-signaling impulses activate both the sympathetic nervous system and the modulating systems of the hpa axis as well as directly increasing glucose availability , cortisol also suppresses the highly demanding metabolic processes of the immune system , resulting in further availability of glucose glucocorticoids have many important functions , including modulation of stress reactions , but in excess they can be damaging there is bi-directional communication and feedback between the hpa axis and the immune system the cns regulates the immune system through neuroendocrine pathways , such as the hpa axis il-1 ) are released into the peripheral circulation system and can pass through the blood brain barrier where they can interact with the brain and activate the hpa axis interactions between the proinflammatory cytokines and the brain can alter the metabolic activity of neurotransmitters and cause symptoms such as fatigue , depression , and mood changes deficiencies in the hpa axis may play a role in allergies and inflammatory/ autoimmune diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis when the hpa axis is activated by stressors , such as an immune response , high levels of glucocorticoids are released into the body and suppress immune response by inhibiting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines ( e.g antidepressants , which are routinely prescribed for many of these illnesses , serve to regulate hpa axis function specifically in rodents , females show greater activation of the hpa axis following stress than males several monoamine neurotransmitters are important in regulating the hpa axis , especially dopamine , serotonin and norepinephrine ( noradrenaline ) the hpa axis is a feature of mammals and other vertebrates there is evidence shown that the hpa axis hormones can be linked to certain stress related skin diseases and skin tumors though animal models allow for more control of experimental manipulation , the effects of early life stress on hpa axis function in humans has also been studied with repeated exposure to stress , the sensitized hpa axis may continue to hypersecrete crf from the hypothalamus the hpa axis plays a clear role in the production of corticosteroids , which govern many facets of brain development and responses to ongoing environmental stress ; other major neuroendocrine systems hypothalamic–neurohypophyseal system hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis ; related topics conditions : addison 's disease adrenal insufficiency cushing 's syndrome

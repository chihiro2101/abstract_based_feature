the key elements of the hpa axis are : the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus , which contains neuroendocrine neurons which synthesize and secrete vasopressin and corticotropin-releasing hormone ( crh ) acth in turn acts on : the adrenal cortex , which produces glucocorticoid hormones ( mainly cortisol in humans ) in response to stimulation by acth glucocorticoids in turn act back on the hypothalamus and pituitary ( to suppress crh and acth production ) in a negative feedback cycle crh is transported to the anterior pituitary through the portal blood vessel system of the hypophyseal stalk and vasopressin is transported by axonal transport to the posterior pituitary cortisol is a major stress hormone and has effects on many tissues in the body , including the brain in the brain , cortisol acts on two types of receptor – mineralocorticoid receptors and glucocorticoid receptors , and these are expressed by many different types of neurons one important target of glucocorticoids is the hypothalamus , which is a major controlling centre of the hpa axis important to the function of the hpa axis are some of the feedback loops : cortisol produced in the adrenal cortex will negatively feedback to inhibit both the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland release of corticotropin-releasing hormone ( crh ) from the hypothalamus is influenced by stress , physical activity , illness , by blood levels of cortisol and by the sleep/wake cycle ( circadian rhythm ) in healthy individuals , cortisol rises rapidly after wakening , reaching a peak within 30–45 minutes the hpa axis has a central role in regulating many homeostatic systems in the body , including the metabolic system , cardiovascular system , immune system , reproductive system and central nervous system anatomical connections between brain areas such as the amygdala , hippocampus , prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus facilitate activation of the hpa axis sensory information arriving at the lateral aspect of the amygdala is processed and conveyed to the amygdala 's central nucleus , which then projects out to several parts of the brain involved in responses to fear at the hypothalamus , fear-signaling impulses activate both the sympathetic nervous system and the modulating systems of the hpa axis glucocorticoids have many important functions , including modulation of stress reactions , but in excess they can be damaging atrophy of the hippocampus in humans and animals exposed to severe stress is believed to be caused by prolonged exposure to high concentrations of glucocorticoids there is bi-directional communication and feedback between the hpa axis and the immune system the hpa axis in turn modulates the immune response , with high levels of cortisol resulting in a suppression of immune and inflammatory reactions the cns regulates the immune system through neuroendocrine pathways , such as the hpa axis the hpa axis is responsible for modulating inflammation that occur throughout the body il-1 ) are released into the peripheral circulation system and can pass through the blood brain barrier where they can interact with the brain and activate the hpa axis deficiencies in the hpa axis may play a role in allergies and inflammatory/ autoimmune diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis when the hpa axis is activated by stressors , such as an immune response , high levels of glucocorticoids are released into the body and suppress immune response by inhibiting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines ( e.g il-1 , tnf alpha , and ifn gamma ) and increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines ( e.g il-4 , il-10 , and il-13 ) in immune cells , such as monocytes and neutrophils the relationship between chronic stress and its concomitant activation of the hpa axis , and dysfunction of the immune system is unclear ; studies have found both immunosuppression and hyperactivation of the immune response antidepressants , which are routinely prescribed for many of these illnesses , serve to regulate hpa axis function the role of early life stress in programming the hpa axis has been well-studied in animal models a blunted acth response is common in depression , so the authors of this work posit that this pattern is likely to be due to the participant 's depression and not their exposure to early life stress with repeated exposure to stress , the sensitized hpa axis may continue to hypersecrete crf from the hypothalamus in contemporary society , the endurance of the hpa axis and early life programming will have important implications for counseling expecting and new mothers , as well as individuals who may have experienced significant early life adversity ; other major neuroendocrine systems hypothalamic–neurohypophyseal system hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis ; related topics conditions : addison 's disease adrenal insufficiency cushing 's syndrome

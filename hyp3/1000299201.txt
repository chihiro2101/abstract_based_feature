the key elements of the hpa axis are : the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus , which contains neuroendocrine neurons which synthesize and secrete vasopressin and corticotropin-releasing hormone ( crh ) acth in turn acts on : the adrenal cortex , which produces glucocorticoid hormones ( mainly cortisol in humans ) in response to stimulation by acth glucocorticoids in turn act back on the hypothalamus and pituitary ( to suppress crh and acth production ) in a negative feedback cycle crh is transported to the anterior pituitary through the portal blood vessel system of the hypophyseal stalk and vasopressin is transported by axonal transport to the posterior pituitary acth is transported by the blood to the adrenal cortex of the adrenal gland , where it rapidly stimulates biosynthesis of corticosteroids such as cortisol from cholesterol cortisol is a major stress hormone and has effects on many tissues in the body , including the brain one important target of glucocorticoids is the hypothalamus , which is a major controlling centre of the hpa axis important to the function of the hpa axis are some of the feedback loops : cortisol produced in the adrenal cortex will negatively feedback to inhibit both the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland release of corticotropin-releasing hormone ( crh ) from the hypothalamus is influenced by stress , physical activity , illness , by blood levels of cortisol and by the sleep/wake cycle ( circadian rhythm ) in healthy individuals , cortisol rises rapidly after wakening , reaching a peak within 30–45 minutes the hpa axis has a central role in regulating many homeostatic systems in the body , including the metabolic system , cardiovascular system , immune system , reproductive system and central nervous system the hpa axis integrates physical and psychosocial influences in order to allow an organism to adapt effectively to its environment , use resources , and optimize survival at the hypothalamus , fear-signaling impulses activate both the sympathetic nervous system and the modulating systems of the hpa axis a number of cytokines , such as il-1 , il-6 , il-10 and tnf-alpha can activate the hpa axis , although il-1 is the most potent the hpa axis in turn modulates the immune response , with high levels of cortisol resulting in a suppression of immune and inflammatory reactions the cns regulates the immune system through neuroendocrine pathways , such as the hpa axis il-1 ) are released into the peripheral circulation system and can pass through the blood brain barrier where they can interact with the brain and activate the hpa axis deficiencies in the hpa axis may play a role in allergies and inflammatory/ autoimmune diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis when the hpa axis is activated by stressors , such as an immune response , high levels of glucocorticoids are released into the body and suppress immune response by inhibiting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines ( e.g il-4 , il-10 , and il-13 ) in immune cells , such as monocytes and neutrophils the relationship between chronic stress and its concomitant activation of the hpa axis , and dysfunction of the immune system is unclear ; studies have found both immunosuppression and hyperactivation of the immune response antidepressants , which are routinely prescribed for many of these illnesses , serve to regulate hpa axis function by constantly activating the hpa axis , this could lead to higher instances of stress and disorders that would only get worse with chronic stress stressors can be of many different types—in experimental studies in rats , a distinction is often made between '' social stress '' and '' physical stress '' , but both types activate the hpa axis , though via different pathways there is evidence that an increase in oxytocin , resulting for instance from positive social interactions , acts to suppress the hpa axis and thereby counteracts stress , promoting positive health effects such as wound healing for example , biologists studying stress in fish showed that subordinate leads to chronic stress , related to reduced aggression interactions , to impulsivity , and to the constant threat imposed by dominant fish in post-traumatic stress disorder there appears to be lower-than-normal cortisol release , and it is thought that a blunted hormonal response to stress may predispose a person to develop ptsd the programming of the hpa axis is strongly influenced by the perinatal and early juvenile environment , or “ early-life environment in this manner , maternal care negatively regulates stress response in the neonate , thereby shaping his/her susceptibility to stress in later life , early life adversity ) , this will program his/her hpa axis to be more reactive to stress in contemporary society , the endurance of the hpa axis and early life programming will have important implications for counseling expecting and new mothers , as well as individuals who may have experienced significant early life adversity mind-body-health.net page on hpa axis hpa axis : explanation of the body 's central stress response system w/diagram

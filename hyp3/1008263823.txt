ventricular fibrillation is a cause of cardiac arrest left untreated , ventricular fibrillation is rapidly fatal as the vital organs of the body , including the heart , are starved of oxygen , and as a result patients in this rhythm will not be conscious or responsive to stimuli prior to cardiac arrest , patients may complain of varying symptoms depending on the underlying cause coarse v-fib may be more responsive to defibrillation , while fine v-fib can mimic the appearance of asystole on a defibrillator or cardiac monitor set to a low gain ventricular fibrillation has been described as '' chaotic asynchronous fractionated activity of the heart '' ( moe et al a more complete definition is that ventricular fibrillation is a '' turbulent , disorganized electrical activity of the heart in such a way that the recorded electrocardiogramic deflections continuously change in shape , magnitude and direction '' ventricular fibrillation most commonly occurs within diseased hearts , and , in the vast majority of cases , is a manifestation of underlying ischemic heart disease ventricular fibrillation is also seen in those with cardiomyopathy , myocarditis , and other heart pathologies in addition , it is seen with electrolyte imbalance , overdoses of cardiotoxic drugs , and following near drowning or major trauma it is also notable that ventricular fibrillation occurs where there is no discernible heart pathology or other evident cause , the so-called idiopathic ventricular fibrillation idiopathic ventricular fibrillation occurs with a reputed incidence of approximately 1 % of all cases of out-of-hospital arrest , as well as 3â€“9 % of the cases of ventricular fibrillation unrelated to myocardial infarction , and 14 % of all ventricular fibrillation resuscitations in patients under the age of 40 recently described syndromes such as the brugada syndrome may give clues to the underlying mechanism of ventricular arrhythmias the relevance of this is that theories of the underlying pathophysiology and electrophysiology must account for the occurrence of fibrillation in the apparent '' healthy '' heart investigators are exploring new techniques of detecting and understanding the underlying mechanisms of sudden cardiac death in these patients without pathological evidence of underlying heart disease familial conditions that predispose individuals to developing ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death are often the result of gene mutations that affect cellular transmembrane ion channels in certain forms of long qt syndrome , the potassium inward rectifier channel is affected scar and dying tissue is inexcitable , but around these areas usually lies a penumbra of hypoxic tissue that is excitable ventricular excitability may generate re-entry ventricular arrhythmia therefore , the substrate of ventricular fibrillation is transient or permanent conduction block defibrillation is the definitive treatment of ventricular fibrillation , whereby an electrical current is applied to the ventricular mass either directly or externally through pads or paddles , with the aim of depolarising enough of the myocardium for coordinated contractions to occur again national institute for health and clinical excellence guidelines 2000 the majority of these deaths are due to ventricular fibrillation secondary to myocardial infarction , or '' heart attack '' bender in 1922 , who produced an electrocardiogram showing ventricular tachycardia evolving into ventricular fibrillation atrial fibrillation electric shock flatline osborn wave re-entry ventricular arrhythmia ventricular flutter

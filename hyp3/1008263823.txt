ventricular fibrillation is a cause of cardiac arrest left untreated , ventricular fibrillation is rapidly fatal as the vital organs of the body , including the heart , are starved of oxygen , and as a result patients in this rhythm will not be conscious or responsive to stimuli prior to cardiac arrest , patients may complain of varying symptoms depending on the underlying cause patients may exhibit signs of agonal breathing , which to a layperson can look like normal spontaneous breathing , but is a sign of hypoperfusion of the brainstem coarse v-fib may be more responsive to defibrillation , while fine v-fib can mimic the appearance of asystole on a defibrillator or cardiac monitor set to a low gain ventricular fibrillation has been described as '' chaotic asynchronous fractionated activity of the heart '' ( moe et al a more complete definition is that ventricular fibrillation is a '' turbulent , disorganized electrical activity of the heart in such a way that the recorded electrocardiogramic deflections continuously change in shape , magnitude and direction '' ventricular fibrillation is also seen in those with cardiomyopathy , myocarditis , and other heart pathologies it is also notable that ventricular fibrillation occurs where there is no discernible heart pathology or other evident cause , the so-called idiopathic ventricular fibrillation idiopathic ventricular fibrillation occurs with a reputed incidence of approximately 1 % of all cases of out-of-hospital arrest , as well as 3â€“9 % of the cases of ventricular fibrillation unrelated to myocardial infarction , and 14 % of all ventricular fibrillation resuscitations in patients under the age of 40 it follows then that , on the basis of the fact that ventricular fibrillation itself is common , idiopathic ventricular fibrillation accounts for an appreciable mortality the relevance of this is that theories of the underlying pathophysiology and electrophysiology must account for the occurrence of fibrillation in the apparent '' healthy '' heart investigators are exploring new techniques of detecting and understanding the underlying mechanisms of sudden cardiac death in these patients without pathological evidence of underlying heart disease familial conditions that predispose individuals to developing ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death are often the result of gene mutations that affect cellular transmembrane ion channels most myocardial cells with an associated increased propensity to arrhythmia development have an associated loss of membrane potential they were both able to show that , if a ring of excitable tissue was stimulated at a single point , the subsequent waves of depolarisation would pass around the ring in practice , this may be an area of ischemic or infarcted myocardium , or underlying scar tissue factors that promote re-entry would include a slow-propagation velocity , a short refractory period with a sufficient size of ring of conduction tissue block due either to areas of damaged or refractory tissue leads to areas of myocardium for initiation and perpetuation of fibrillation through the phenomenon of re-entry defibrillation is the definitive treatment of ventricular fibrillation , whereby an electrical current is applied to the ventricular mass either directly or externally through pads or paddles , with the aim of depolarising enough of the myocardium for coordinated contractions to occur again the significance and clinical importance of these observations and descriptions possibly of ventricular fibrillation were not recognised until john erichsen in 1842 described ventricular fibrillation following the ligation of a coronary artery ( erichsen je 1842 ) bender in 1922 , who produced an electrocardiogram showing ventricular tachycardia evolving into ventricular fibrillation atrial fibrillation electric shock flatline osborn wave re-entry ventricular arrhythmia ventricular flutter

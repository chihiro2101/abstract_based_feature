ventricular fibrillation is a cause of cardiac arrest prior to cardiac arrest , patients may complain of varying symptoms depending on the underlying cause ventricular fibrillation has been described as '' chaotic asynchronous fractionated activity of the heart '' ( moe et al a more complete definition is that ventricular fibrillation is a '' turbulent , disorganized electrical activity of the heart in such a way that the recorded electrocardiogramic deflections continuously change in shape , magnitude and direction '' ventricular fibrillation most commonly occurs within diseased hearts , and , in the vast majority of cases , is a manifestation of underlying ischemic heart disease ventricular fibrillation is also seen in those with cardiomyopathy , myocarditis , and other heart pathologies in addition , it is seen with electrolyte imbalance , overdoses of cardiotoxic drugs , and following near drowning or major trauma it is also notable that ventricular fibrillation occurs where there is no discernible heart pathology or other evident cause , the so-called idiopathic ventricular fibrillation idiopathic ventricular fibrillation occurs with a reputed incidence of approximately 1 % of all cases of out-of-hospital arrest , as well as 3â€“9 % of the cases of ventricular fibrillation unrelated to myocardial infarction , and 14 % of all ventricular fibrillation resuscitations in patients under the age of 40 it follows then that , on the basis of the fact that ventricular fibrillation itself is common , idiopathic ventricular fibrillation accounts for an appreciable mortality recently described syndromes such as the brugada syndrome may give clues to the underlying mechanism of ventricular arrhythmias in the brugada syndrome , changes may be found in the resting ecg with evidence of right bundle branch block ( rbbb ) and st elevation in the chest leads v1-v3 , with an underlying propensity to sudden cardiac death the relevance of this is that theories of the underlying pathophysiology and electrophysiology must account for the occurrence of fibrillation in the apparent '' healthy '' heart investigators are exploring new techniques of detecting and understanding the underlying mechanisms of sudden cardiac death in these patients without pathological evidence of underlying heart disease familial conditions that predispose individuals to developing ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death are often the result of gene mutations that affect cellular transmembrane ion channels ventricular excitability may generate re-entry ventricular arrhythmia that is , the maximum diastolic potential is less negative and therefore exists closer to the threshold potential in conditions such as myocardial ischaemia , possible mechanism of arrhythmia generation include the resulting decreased internal k + concentration , the increased external k + concentration , norepinephrine release and acidosis image : cardiac myofiberbreak-up -- very high mag.jpg thumb right micrograph showing myofibre break-up with squared nuclei , a morphologic correlate of ventricular fibrillation defibrillation is the definitive treatment of ventricular fibrillation , whereby an electrical current is applied to the ventricular mass either directly or externally through pads or paddles , with the aim of depolarising enough of the myocardium for coordinated contractions to occur again 1940 spontaneous conversion of ventricular fibrillation to a more benign rhythm is rare in all but small animals defibrillation is the process that converts ventricular fibrillation to a more benign rhythm atrial fibrillation electric shock flatline osborn wave re-entry ventricular arrhythmia ventricular flutter

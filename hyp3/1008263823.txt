ventricular fibrillation is a cause of cardiac arrest the ventricular muscle twitches randomly rather than contracting in a co-ordinated fashion ( from the apex of the heart to the outflow of the ventricles ) , and so the ventricles fail to pump blood around the body – because of this , it is classified as a cardiac arrest rhythm , and patients in v-fib should be treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) and prompt defibrillation prior to cardiac arrest , patients may complain of varying symptoms depending on the underlying cause patients may exhibit signs of agonal breathing , which to a layperson can look like normal spontaneous breathing , but is a sign of hypoperfusion of the brainstem coarse v-fib may be more responsive to defibrillation , while fine v-fib can mimic the appearance of asystole on a defibrillator or cardiac monitor set to a low gain some clinicians may attempt to defibrillate fine v-fib in the hope that it can be reverted to a cardiac rhythm compatible with life , whereas others will deliver cpr and sometimes drugs as described in the advanced cardiac life support protocols in an attempt to increase its amplitude and the odds of successful defibrillation ventricular fibrillation has been described as '' chaotic asynchronous fractionated activity of the heart '' ( moe et al a more complete definition is that ventricular fibrillation is a '' turbulent , disorganized electrical activity of the heart in such a way that the recorded electrocardiogramic deflections continuously change in shape , magnitude and direction '' ventricular fibrillation most commonly occurs within diseased hearts , and , in the vast majority of cases , is a manifestation of underlying ischemic heart disease ventricular fibrillation is also seen in those with cardiomyopathy , myocarditis , and other heart pathologies it is also notable that ventricular fibrillation occurs where there is no discernible heart pathology or other evident cause , the so-called idiopathic ventricular fibrillation idiopathic ventricular fibrillation occurs with a reputed incidence of approximately 1 % of all cases of out-of-hospital arrest , as well as 3–9 % of the cases of ventricular fibrillation unrelated to myocardial infarction , and 14 % of all ventricular fibrillation resuscitations in patients under the age of 40 it follows then that , on the basis of the fact that ventricular fibrillation itself is common , idiopathic ventricular fibrillation accounts for an appreciable mortality recently described syndromes such as the brugada syndrome may give clues to the underlying mechanism of ventricular arrhythmias the relevance of this is that theories of the underlying pathophysiology and electrophysiology must account for the occurrence of fibrillation in the apparent '' healthy '' heart investigators are exploring new techniques of detecting and understanding the underlying mechanisms of sudden cardiac death in these patients without pathological evidence of underlying heart disease familial conditions that predispose individuals to developing ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death are often the result of gene mutations that affect cellular transmembrane ion channels cellular depolarisation can be due to a raised external concentration of potassium ions k + , a decreased intracellular concentration of sodium ions na + , increased permeability to na + , or a decreased permeability to k + in clinical practice , therefore , factors that would lead to the right conditions to favour such re-entry mechanisms include increased heart size through hypertrophy or dilatation , drugs which alter the length of the refractory period and areas of cardiac disease it states : '' when the heart is diseased , its work is imperfectly performed : the vessels proceeding from the heart become inactive , so that you can not feel them … if the heart trembles , has little power and sinks , the disease is advanced and death is near subsequent to this in 1850 , fibrillation was described by ludwig and hoffa when they demonstrated the provocation of ventricular fibrillation in an animal by applying a '' faradic '' ( electrical ) current to the heart bender in 1922 , who produced an electrocardiogram showing ventricular tachycardia evolving into ventricular fibrillation defibrillation is the process that converts ventricular fibrillation to a more benign rhythm

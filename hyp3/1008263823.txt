ventricular fibrillation is a cause of cardiac arrest left untreated , ventricular fibrillation is rapidly fatal as the vital organs of the body , including the heart , are starved of oxygen , and as a result patients in this rhythm will not be conscious or responsive to stimuli prior to cardiac arrest , patients may complain of varying symptoms depending on the underlying cause patients may exhibit signs of agonal breathing , which to a layperson can look like normal spontaneous breathing , but is a sign of hypoperfusion of the brainstem coarse v-fib may be more responsive to defibrillation , while fine v-fib can mimic the appearance of asystole on a defibrillator or cardiac monitor set to a low gain ventricular fibrillation has been described as '' chaotic asynchronous fractionated activity of the heart '' ( moe et al a more complete definition is that ventricular fibrillation is a '' turbulent , disorganized electrical activity of the heart in such a way that the recorded electrocardiogramic deflections continuously change in shape , magnitude and direction '' ventricular fibrillation most commonly occurs within diseased hearts , and , in the vast majority of cases , is a manifestation of underlying ischemic heart disease ventricular fibrillation is also seen in those with cardiomyopathy , myocarditis , and other heart pathologies it is also notable that ventricular fibrillation occurs where there is no discernible heart pathology or other evident cause , the so-called idiopathic ventricular fibrillation idiopathic ventricular fibrillation occurs with a reputed incidence of approximately 1 % of all cases of out-of-hospital arrest , as well as 3â€“9 % of the cases of ventricular fibrillation unrelated to myocardial infarction , and 14 % of all ventricular fibrillation resuscitations in patients under the age of 40 it follows then that , on the basis of the fact that ventricular fibrillation itself is common , idiopathic ventricular fibrillation accounts for an appreciable mortality recently described syndromes such as the brugada syndrome may give clues to the underlying mechanism of ventricular arrhythmias investigators are exploring new techniques of detecting and understanding the underlying mechanisms of sudden cardiac death in these patients without pathological evidence of underlying heart disease familial conditions that predispose individuals to developing ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death are often the result of gene mutations that affect cellular transmembrane ion channels ventricular excitability may generate re-entry ventricular arrhythmia cellular depolarisation can be due to a raised external concentration of potassium ions k + , a decreased intracellular concentration of sodium ions na + , increased permeability to na + , or a decreased permeability to k + in conditions such as myocardial ischaemia , possible mechanism of arrhythmia generation include the resulting decreased internal k + concentration , the increased external k + concentration , norepinephrine release and acidosis with ik1 suppressed , an hyperpolarizing effect is lost and therefore there can be activation of funny current even in myocardial cells ( which is normally suppressed by the hyperpolarizing effect of coexisting potassium currents ) defibrillation is the definitive treatment of ventricular fibrillation , whereby an electrical current is applied to the ventricular mass either directly or externally through pads or paddles , with the aim of depolarising enough of the myocardium for coordinated contractions to occur again 1995 during ventricular fibrillation , cardiac output drops to zero , and , unless remedied promptly , death usually ensues within minutes subsequent to this in 1850 , fibrillation was described by ludwig and hoffa when they demonstrated the provocation of ventricular fibrillation in an animal by applying a '' faradic '' ( electrical ) current to the heart atrial fibrillation electric shock flatline osborn wave re-entry ventricular arrhythmia ventricular flutter

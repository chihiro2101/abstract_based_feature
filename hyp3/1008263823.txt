ventricular fibrillation is a cause of cardiac arrest left untreated , ventricular fibrillation is rapidly fatal as the vital organs of the body , including the heart , are starved of oxygen , and as a result patients in this rhythm will not be conscious or responsive to stimuli prior to cardiac arrest , patients may complain of varying symptoms depending on the underlying cause it has an appearance on electrocardiography of irregular electrical activity with no discernable pattern coarse v-fib may be more responsive to defibrillation , while fine v-fib can mimic the appearance of asystole on a defibrillator or cardiac monitor set to a low gain ventricular fibrillation has been described as '' chaotic asynchronous fractionated activity of the heart '' ( moe et al a more complete definition is that ventricular fibrillation is a '' turbulent , disorganized electrical activity of the heart in such a way that the recorded electrocardiogramic deflections continuously change in shape , magnitude and direction '' ventricular fibrillation most commonly occurs within diseased hearts , and , in the vast majority of cases , is a manifestation of underlying ischemic heart disease ventricular fibrillation is also seen in those with cardiomyopathy , myocarditis , and other heart pathologies in addition , it is seen with electrolyte imbalance , overdoses of cardiotoxic drugs , and following near drowning or major trauma it is also notable that ventricular fibrillation occurs where there is no discernible heart pathology or other evident cause , the so-called idiopathic ventricular fibrillation it follows then that , on the basis of the fact that ventricular fibrillation itself is common , idiopathic ventricular fibrillation accounts for an appreciable mortality recently described syndromes such as the brugada syndrome may give clues to the underlying mechanism of ventricular arrhythmias investigators are exploring new techniques of detecting and understanding the underlying mechanisms of sudden cardiac death in these patients without pathological evidence of underlying heart disease familial conditions that predispose individuals to developing ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death are often the result of gene mutations that affect cellular transmembrane ion channels in certain forms of long qt syndrome , the potassium inward rectifier channel is affected scar and dying tissue is inexcitable , but around these areas usually lies a penumbra of hypoxic tissue that is excitable ventricular excitability may generate re-entry ventricular arrhythmia in conditions such as myocardial ischaemia , possible mechanism of arrhythmia generation include the resulting decreased internal k + concentration , the increased external k + concentration , norepinephrine release and acidosis image : cardiac myofiberbreak-up -- very high mag.jpg thumb right micrograph showing myofibre break-up with squared nuclei , a morphologic correlate of ventricular fibrillation '' macwilliam spent many years working on ventricular fibrillation and was one of the first to show that ventricular fibrillation could be terminated by a series of induction shocks through the heart he described ventricular fibrillation as '' an incoordinate type of contraction which , despite a high metabolic rate of the myocardium , produces no useful beats atrial fibrillation electric shock flatline osborn wave re-entry ventricular arrhythmia ventricular flutter

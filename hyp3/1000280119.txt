the first known idea for a guided surface-to-air missile was in 1925 , when a beam riding system was proposed whereby a rocket would follow a searchlight beam onto a target a selenium cell was mounted on the tip of each of the rocket 's four tail fins , with the cells facing backwards '' evolution of the guided missile '' flight , may 4 , 1951 , p when one selenium cell was no longer in the light beam , it would be steered in the opposite direction back into the beam the first historical mention of a concept and design of a surface-to-air missile in which a drawing was presented , was by inventor gustav rasmus in 1931 , who proposed a design that would home in on the sound of an aircraft 's engines during world war ii , efforts were started to develop surface-to-air missiles as it was generally considered that flak was of little use against bombers of ever-increasing performance in order to attack a target , guns fire continually while the aircraft are in range in order to launch as many shells as possible , increasing the chance that one of these will end up within the lethal range against the boeing b-17 , which operated just within the range of the numerous german eighty-eights , an average of 2,805 rounds had to be fired per bomber destroyed faster aircraft fly out of range more quickly , reducing the number of rounds fired against them the first serious consideration of a sam development project was a series of conversations that took place in germany during 1941 in february , friederich halder proposed a '' flak rocket '' concept , which led walter dornberger to ask wernher von braun to prepare a study on a guided missile able to reach between altitude the directors of the luftwaffe flak arm were not interested in manned aircraft , and the resulting disagreements between the teams delayed serious consideration of a sam for two years by this point serious studies by the peenemünde team had been prepared , and several rocket designs had been proposed , including 1940 's feuerlilie , and 1941 's wasserfall and henschel hs 117 schmetterling none of these projects saw any real development until 1943 , when the first large-scale raids by the allied air forces started as the urgency of the problem grew , new designs were added , including enzian and rheintochter , as well as the unguided taifun which was designed to be launched in waves , raf museum in general , these designs could be split into two groups both types used radio control for guidance , either by eye , or by comparing the returns of the missile and target on a single radar screen navy launched operation bumblebee to develop a ramjet-powered missile to destroy the launching aircraft at long range the initial performance goal was to target an intercept at a horizontal range of and altitude , with a 300 to 600 pound warhead for a 30 to 60 percent kill probability the end of the war led to the british efforts being used strictly for research and development throughout their lifetime in the immediate post-war era , sam developments were under way around the world , with several of these entering service in the early- and mid-1950s coming to the same conclusions as the germans regarding flak , the u.s led by bell labs , the nike ajax was tested in production form in 1952 , becoming the first operational sam system when it was activated in march 1954 but never entered operational service the rsd 58 used beam riding guidance , which has limited performance against high-speed aircraft , as the missile is unable to '' lead '' the target to a collision point this emerged in 1957 as the famous s-75 dvina ( sa-2 ) , a portable system , with very high performance , that remained in operation into the 2000s the early british developments with stooge and brakemine were successful , but further development was curtailed in the post-war era two competing designs were proposed for '' stage 1 '' , based on common radar and control units , and these emerged as the raf 's bristol bloodhound in 1958 , '' bloodhound : the sagw system of the royal air force the vietnam war was the first modern war in which guided antiaircraft missiles seriously challenged highly advanced supersonic jet aircraft during the course of the air defense of north vietnam in 1966–1967 , one russian sam operator , lieutenant vadim petrovich shcherbakov , was credited with destroying 12 u.s by the time of operation linebacker ii in 1972 , the americans had gained critical information about the performance and operations of the s-75 ( by arab 's s-75 systems were captured by israel ) , and used these missions as a way to demonstrate the capability of strategic bombers to operate in a sam saturated environment steven zaloga , '' red sam : the sa-2 guideline anti-aircraft missile '' , osprey publishing , 2007 , p as aircraft moved ever lower , and missile performance continued to improve , eventually it became possible to build an effective man-portable anti-aircraft missile by the 1990s , even these roles were being encroached on by new manpads and similar short-range weapons , like the rim-116 rolling airframe missile in comparison , sarh systems require the tracking radar to illuminate the target , which may require them to be exposed through the attack systems combining an infrared seeker as a terminal guidance system on a missile using sarh are also known , like the mim-46 mauler , but these are generally rare long-range systems generally use radar systems for target detection , and depending on the generation of system , may '' hand off '' to a separate tracking radar for attack

the first known idea for a guided surface-to-air missile was in 1925 , when a beam riding system was proposed whereby a rocket would follow a searchlight beam onto a target '' evolution of the guided missile '' flight , may 4 , 1951 , p the first historical mention of a concept and design of a surface-to-air missile in which a drawing was presented , was by inventor gustav rasmus in 1931 , who proposed a design that would home in on the sound of an aircraft 's engines during world war ii , efforts were started to develop surface-to-air missiles as it was generally considered that flak was of little use against bombers of ever-increasing performance in order to attack a target , guns fire continually while the aircraft are in range in order to launch as many shells as possible , increasing the chance that one of these will end up within the lethal range against the boeing b-17 , which operated just within the range of the numerous german eighty-eights , an average of 2,805 rounds had to be fired per bomber destroyed this potential was already obvious by 1942 , when walther von axthelm outlined the growing problems with flak defences that he predicted would soon be dealing with '' aircraft speeds and flight altitudes that will gradually reach and between this was seen generally ; in november 1943 the director of gunnery division of the royal navy concluded that guns would be useless against jets , stating '' no projectile of which control is lost when it leaves the ship can be of any use to us in this matter the first serious consideration of a sam development project was a series of conversations that took place in germany during 1941 in february , friederich halder proposed a '' flak rocket '' concept , which led walter dornberger to ask wernher von braun to prepare a study on a guided missile able to reach between altitude von braun became convinced a better solution was a manned rocket interceptor , and said as much to the director of the t-amt , roluf lucht , in july the directors of the luftwaffe flak arm were not interested in manned aircraft , and the resulting disagreements between the teams delayed serious consideration of a sam for two years as the urgency of the problem grew , new designs were added , including enzian and rheintochter , as well as the unguided taifun which was designed to be launched in waves development of all these systems was carried out at the same time , and the war ended before any of them was ready for combat use some extreme fighter designs , like the komet and natter , also overlapped with sams in their intended uses albert speer was especially supportive of missile development the initial performance goal was to target an intercept at a horizontal range of and altitude , with a 300 to 600 pound warhead for a 30 to 60 percent kill probability in the immediate post-war era , sam developments were under way around the world , with several of these entering service in the early- and mid-1950s led by bell labs , the nike ajax was tested in production form in 1952 , becoming the first operational sam system when it was activated in march 1954 '' the boeing im-99/cim-10 bomarc '' , national air defense radar museum development of oerlikon 's rsd 58 '' swiss guided missile '' flight , 7 january 1955 , p the rsd 58 used beam riding guidance , which has limited performance against high-speed aircraft , as the missile is unable to '' lead '' the target to a collision point this led to the s-25 berkut system ( sa-1 in nato terminology ) , which was designed , developed and deployed in a rush program early units entered operational service on 7 may 1955 , and the entire system ringing moscow was completely activated by june 1956 the early british developments with stooge and brakemine were successful , but further development was curtailed in the post-war era two competing designs were proposed for '' stage 1 '' , based on common radar and control units , and these emerged as the raf 's bristol bloodhound in 1958 , '' bloodhound : the sagw system of the royal air force the vietnam war was the first modern war in which guided antiaircraft missiles seriously challenged highly advanced supersonic jet aircraft 1-4 nearly 17,000 soviet missile technicians and operator/instructors deployed to north vietnam in 1965 to help defend hanoi against american bombers , while north vietnamese missilemen completed their six to nine months of sam training in the soviet union jet aircraft shot down by sa-2s over north vietnam were downed by soviet missile men marshall michel , '' the christmas bombing '' , air and space , january 2001 by the conclusion of the linebacker ii campaign , the shootdown rate of the s-75 against the b-52s was 7.52 % ( 15 b-52s were shot down , 5 b-52s were heavily damaged for 266 missiles ) zaloga , steven j the way to avoid this was to fly lower , below the line-of-sight of missile 's radar systems shorter ranges meant the missiles could be much smaller , which aided them in terms of mobility much of this performance increase is due to improved rocket fuels and ever-smaller electronics in the guidance systems many of these designs were mounted on armoured vehicles , allowing them to keep pace with mobile operations in a conventional war once a major group onto itself , medium-range designs have seen less development since the 1990s , as the focus has changed to unconventional warfare modern warships may carry all three types ( from long-range to short-range ) of sams as a part of their multi-layered air defence smaller missiles , especially manpads , generally use infrared homing guidance systems long-range systems generally use radar systems for target detection , and depending on the generation of system , may '' hand off '' to a separate tracking radar for attack

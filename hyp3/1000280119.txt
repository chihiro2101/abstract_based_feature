the first known idea for a guided surface-to-air missile was in 1925 , when a beam riding system was proposed whereby a rocket would follow a searchlight beam onto a target '' evolution of the guided missile '' flight , may 4 , 1951 , p when one selenium cell was no longer in the light beam , it would be steered in the opposite direction back into the beam the first historical mention of a concept and design of a surface-to-air missile in which a drawing was presented , was by inventor gustav rasmus in 1931 , who proposed a design that would home in on the sound of an aircraft 's engines during world war ii , efforts were started to develop surface-to-air missiles as it was generally considered that flak was of little use against bombers of ever-increasing performance this greatly increases the cost of the system , and ( generally ) slows the rate of fire faster aircraft fly out of range more quickly , reducing the number of rounds fired against them against late-war designs like the boeing b-29 superfortress or jet-powered designs like the arado ar 234 , flak would be essentially useless this potential was already obvious by 1942 , when walther von axthelm outlined the growing problems with flak defences that he predicted would soon be dealing with '' aircraft speeds and flight altitudes that will gradually reach and between in february , friederich halder proposed a '' flak rocket '' concept , which led walter dornberger to ask wernher von braun to prepare a study on a guided missile able to reach between altitude the directors of the luftwaffe flak arm were not interested in manned aircraft , and the resulting disagreements between the teams delayed serious consideration of a sam for two years von axthelm published his concerns in 1942 , and the subject saw serious consideration for the first time ; initial development programs for liquid- and solid-fuel rockets became part of the flak development program of 1942 none of these projects saw any real development until 1943 , when the first large-scale raids by the allied air forces started one set of designs would be boosted to altitude in front of the bombers and then flown towards them on a head-on approach at low speeds comparable to manned aircraft the second group were high-speed missiles , typically supersonic , that flew directly towards their targets from below development of all these systems was carried out at the same time , and the war ended before any of them was ready for combat use the infighting between various groups in the military also delayed development albert speer was especially supportive of missile development in his opinion , had they been consistently developed from the start , the large scale bomber raids of 1944 would have been impossible the british developed unguided antiaircraft rockets ( operated under the name z battery ) close to the start of world war ii , but the air superiority usually held by the allies meant that the demand for similar weapons was not as acute when several allied ships were sunk in 1943 by henschel hs 293 and fritz x glide bombs , allied interest changed phillip hays , '' history of the talos missile '' heavy shipping losses to kamikaze attacks during the liberation of the philippines and the battle of okinawa provided additional incentive for guided missile development the end of the war led to the british efforts being used strictly for research and development throughout their lifetime in the immediate post-war era , sam developments were under way around the world , with several of these entering service in the early- and mid-1950s coming to the same conclusions as the germans regarding flak , the u.s led by bell labs , the nike ajax was tested in production form in 1952 , becoming the first operational sam system when it was activated in march 1954 '' the boeing im-99/cim-10 bomarc '' , national air defense radar museum development of oerlikon 's rsd 58 '' swiss guided missile '' flight , 7 january 1955 , p the rsd 58 used beam riding guidance , which has limited performance against high-speed aircraft , as the missile is unable to '' lead '' the target to a collision point this led to the s-25 berkut system ( sa-1 in nato terminology ) , which was designed , developed and deployed in a rush program early units entered operational service on 7 may 1955 , and the entire system ringing moscow was completely activated by june 1956 '' s-75 '' , encyclopedia astronautica the soviet union remained at the forefront of sam development throughout its history ; and russia has followed suit these efforts picked up again with the opening of the cold war , following the '' stage plan '' of improving uk air defences with new radars , fighters and missiles the vietnam war was the first modern war in which guided antiaircraft missiles seriously challenged highly advanced supersonic jet aircraft red sam : the sa-2 guideline anti-aircraft missile this leads to three '' natural '' classes of sam systems ; heavy long-range systems that are fixed or semi-mobile , medium-range vehicle-mounted systems that can fire on the move , and short-range man-portable air-defense systems ( manpads ) ship-based anti-aircraft missiles are also considered to be sams , although in practice it is expected that they would be more widely used against sea skimming missiles rather than aircraft long-range systems generally use radar systems for target detection , and depending on the generation of system , may '' hand off '' to a separate tracking radar for attack

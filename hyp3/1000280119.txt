the first known idea for a guided surface-to-air missile was in 1925 , when a beam riding system was proposed whereby a rocket would follow a searchlight beam onto a target '' evolution of the guided missile '' flight , may 4 , 1951 , p the first historical mention of a concept and design of a surface-to-air missile in which a drawing was presented , was by inventor gustav rasmus in 1931 , who proposed a design that would home in on the sound of an aircraft 's engines during world war ii , efforts were started to develop surface-to-air missiles as it was generally considered that flak was of little use against bombers of ever-increasing performance the lethal radius of a flak shell is fairly small , and the chance of delivering a '' hit '' is essentially a fixed percentage per round against late-war designs like the boeing b-29 superfortress or jet-powered designs like the arado ar 234 , flak would be essentially useless the first serious consideration of a sam development project was a series of conversations that took place in germany during 1941 the directors of the luftwaffe flak arm were not interested in manned aircraft , and the resulting disagreements between the teams delayed serious consideration of a sam for two years von axthelm published his concerns in 1942 , and the subject saw serious consideration for the first time ; initial development programs for liquid- and solid-fuel rockets became part of the flak development program of 1942 by this point serious studies by the peenem√ºnde team had been prepared , and several rocket designs had been proposed , including 1940 's feuerlilie , and 1941 's wasserfall and henschel hs 117 schmetterling none of these projects saw any real development until 1943 , when the first large-scale raids by the allied air forces started development of all these systems was carried out at the same time , and the war ended before any of them was ready for combat use the infighting between various groups in the military also delayed development in his opinion , had they been consistently developed from the start , the large scale bomber raids of 1944 would have been impossible these weapons were released from stand-off distances , with the bomber remaining outside the range of the ship 's antiaircraft guns , and the missiles themselves were too small and fast to be attacked effectively this led to the british fairey stooge and brakemine efforts , flight 1947 , p.345 and the u.s in the immediate post-war era , sam developments were under way around the world , with several of these entering service in the early- and mid-1950s led by bell labs , the nike ajax was tested in production form in 1952 , becoming the first operational sam system when it was activated in march 1954 '' the boeing im-99/cim-10 bomarc '' , national air defense radar museum development of oerlikon 's rsd 58 '' swiss guided missile '' flight , 7 january 1955 , p early versions of the missile were available for purchase as early as 1952 , '' guided missiles '' , flight , 7 december 1956 , p the rsd 58 used beam riding guidance , which has limited performance against high-speed aircraft , as the missile is unable to '' lead '' the target to a collision point examples were purchased by several nations for testing and training purposes , but no operational sales were made the soviet union began development of a sam system in earnest with the opening of the cold war joseph stalin was worried that moscow would be subjected to american and british air raids , like those against berlin , and , in 1951 , he demanded that a missile system to counter a 900 bomber raid be built as quickly as possible early units entered operational service on 7 may 1955 , and the entire system ringing moscow was completely activated by june 1956 the vietnam war was the first modern war in which guided antiaircraft missiles seriously challenged highly advanced supersonic jet aircraft it would also be the first and only time that the latest and most modern air defense technologies of the soviet union and the most modern jet fighter planes and bombers of the united states confronted each other in combat jet aircraft shot down by sa-2s over north vietnam were downed by soviet missile men red sam : the sa-2 guideline anti-aircraft missile all of these early systems were '' heavyweight '' designs with limited mobility and requiring considerable set-up time the way to avoid this was to fly lower , below the line-of-sight of missile 's radar systems this leads to three '' natural '' classes of sam systems ; heavy long-range systems that are fixed or semi-mobile , medium-range vehicle-mounted systems that can fire on the move , and short-range man-portable air-defense systems ( manpads ) some very long-range systems remain , notably the russian s-400 , which has a range of 400 & nbsp ; km sam systems generally fall into two broad groups based on their guidance systems , those using radar and those using some other means systems combining an infrared seeker as a terminal guidance system on a missile using sarh are also known , like the mim-46 mauler , but these are generally rare all sam systems from the smallest to the largest generally include identified as friend or foe ( iff ) systems to help identify the target before being engaged rest-of-world missile systems from the federation of american scientists website

the first known idea for a guided surface-to-air missile was in 1925 , when a beam riding system was proposed whereby a rocket would follow a searchlight beam onto a target a selenium cell was mounted on the tip of each of the rocket 's four tail fins , with the cells facing backwards '' evolution of the guided missile '' flight , may 4 , 1951 , p when one selenium cell was no longer in the light beam , it would be steered in the opposite direction back into the beam the first historical mention of a concept and design of a surface-to-air missile in which a drawing was presented , was by inventor gustav rasmus in 1931 , who proposed a design that would home in on the sound of an aircraft 's engines during world war ii , efforts were started to develop surface-to-air missiles as it was generally considered that flak was of little use against bombers of ever-increasing performance the lethal radius of a flak shell is fairly small , and the chance of delivering a '' hit '' is essentially a fixed percentage per round this was seen generally ; in november 1943 the director of gunnery division of the royal navy concluded that guns would be useless against jets , stating '' no projectile of which control is lost when it leaves the ship can be of any use to us in this matter the first serious consideration of a sam development project was a series of conversations that took place in germany during 1941 the directors of the luftwaffe flak arm were not interested in manned aircraft , and the resulting disagreements between the teams delayed serious consideration of a sam for two years von axthelm published his concerns in 1942 , and the subject saw serious consideration for the first time ; initial development programs for liquid- and solid-fuel rockets became part of the flak development program of 1942 none of these projects saw any real development until 1943 , when the first large-scale raids by the allied air forces started , raf museum in general , these designs could be split into two groups one set of designs would be boosted to altitude in front of the bombers and then flown towards them on a head-on approach at low speeds comparable to manned aircraft the second group were high-speed missiles , typically supersonic , that flew directly towards their targets from below these included wasserfall and rheintochter development of all these systems was carried out at the same time , and the war ended before any of them was ready for combat use these weapons were released from stand-off distances , with the bomber remaining outside the range of the ship 's antiaircraft guns , and the missiles themselves were too small and fast to be attacked effectively the initial performance goal was to target an intercept at a horizontal range of and altitude , with a 300 to 600 pound warhead for a 30 to 60 percent kill probability phillip hays , '' history of the talos missile '' heavy shipping losses to kamikaze attacks during the liberation of the philippines and the battle of okinawa provided additional incentive for guided missile development in the immediate post-war era , sam developments were under way around the world , with several of these entering service in the early- and mid-1950s led by bell labs , the nike ajax was tested in production form in 1952 , becoming the first operational sam system when it was activated in march 1954 army air forces had also considered collision-course weapons ( like the german radio-controlled concepts ) and launched project thumper in 1946 '' the boeing im-99/cim-10 bomarc '' , national air defense radar museum development of oerlikon 's rsd 58 '' swiss guided missile '' flight , 7 january 1955 , p early versions of the missile were available for purchase as early as 1952 , '' guided missiles '' , flight , 7 december 1956 , p this led to the s-25 berkut system ( sa-1 in nato terminology ) , which was designed , developed and deployed in a rush program this emerged in 1957 as the famous s-75 dvina ( sa-2 ) , a portable system , with very high performance , that remained in operation into the 2000s the vietnam war was the first modern war in which guided antiaircraft missiles seriously challenged highly advanced supersonic jet aircraft it would also be the first and only time that the latest and most modern air defense technologies of the soviet union and the most modern jet fighter planes and bombers of the united states confronted each other in combat jet aircraft shot down by sa-2s over north vietnam were downed by soviet missile men steven zaloga , '' red sam : the sa-2 guideline anti-aircraft missile '' , osprey publishing , 2007 , p israel 's david 's sling stunner missile is designed to intercept the newest generation of tactical ballistic missiles at low altitude against fixed wing aircraft , they can be very effective , forcing them to fly outside the missile 's envelope and thereby greatly reducing their effectiveness in ground-attack roles sam systems generally fall into two broad groups based on their guidance systems , those using radar and those using some other means systems combining an infrared seeker as a terminal guidance system on a missile using sarh are also known , like the mim-46 mauler , but these are generally rare a few older designs use purely optical tracking and command guidance , perhaps the best known example of this is the british rapier system , which was initially an all-optical system with high accuracy long-range systems generally use radar systems for target detection , and depending on the generation of system , may '' hand off '' to a separate tracking radar for attack

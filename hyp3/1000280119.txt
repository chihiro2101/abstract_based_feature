the first known idea for a guided surface-to-air missile was in 1925 , when a beam riding system was proposed whereby a rocket would follow a searchlight beam onto a target '' evolution of the guided missile '' flight , may 4 , 1951 , p when one selenium cell was no longer in the light beam , it would be steered in the opposite direction back into the beam the first historical mention of a concept and design of a surface-to-air missile in which a drawing was presented , was by inventor gustav rasmus in 1931 , who proposed a design that would home in on the sound of an aircraft 's engines during world war ii , efforts were started to develop surface-to-air missiles as it was generally considered that flak was of little use against bombers of ever-increasing performance against the boeing b-17 , which operated just within the range of the numerous german eighty-eights , an average of 2,805 rounds had to be fired per bomber destroyed against late-war designs like the boeing b-29 superfortress or jet-powered designs like the arado ar 234 , flak would be essentially useless this potential was already obvious by 1942 , when walther von axthelm outlined the growing problems with flak defences that he predicted would soon be dealing with '' aircraft speeds and flight altitudes that will gradually reach and between in february , friederich halder proposed a '' flak rocket '' concept , which led walter dornberger to ask wernher von braun to prepare a study on a guided missile able to reach between altitude the directors of the luftwaffe flak arm were not interested in manned aircraft , and the resulting disagreements between the teams delayed serious consideration of a sam for two years von axthelm published his concerns in 1942 , and the subject saw serious consideration for the first time ; initial development programs for liquid- and solid-fuel rockets became part of the flak development program of 1942 by this point serious studies by the peenemünde team had been prepared , and several rocket designs had been proposed , including 1940 's feuerlilie , and 1941 's wasserfall and henschel hs 117 schmetterling as the urgency of the problem grew , new designs were added , including enzian and rheintochter , as well as the unguided taifun which was designed to be launched in waves one set of designs would be boosted to altitude in front of the bombers and then flown towards them on a head-on approach at low speeds comparable to manned aircraft both types used radio control for guidance , either by eye , or by comparing the returns of the missile and target on a single radar screen development of all these systems was carried out at the same time , and the war ended before any of them was ready for combat use some extreme fighter designs , like the komet and natter , also overlapped with sams in their intended uses this weapon did not emerge for 16 years , when it entered operation as the rim-8 talos phillip hays , '' history of the talos missile '' heavy shipping losses to kamikaze attacks during the liberation of the philippines and the battle of okinawa provided additional incentive for guided missile development this led to the british fairey stooge and brakemine efforts , flight 1947 , p.345 and the u.s in the immediate post-war era , sam developments were under way around the world , with several of these entering service in the early- and mid-1950s early versions of the missile were available for purchase as early as 1952 , '' guided missiles '' , flight , 7 december 1956 , p the soviet union began development of a sam system in earnest with the opening of the cold war early units entered operational service on 7 may 1955 , and the entire system ringing moscow was completely activated by june 1956 the s-25 was a static system , but efforts were also put into a smaller design that would be much more mobile this emerged in 1957 as the famous s-75 dvina ( sa-2 ) , a portable system , with very high performance , that remained in operation into the 2000s the early british developments with stooge and brakemine were successful , but further development was curtailed in the post-war era a third design followed the american bumblebee efforts in terms of role and timeline , and entered service in 1961 as the sea slug it would also be the first and only time that the latest and most modern air defense technologies of the soviet union and the most modern jet fighter planes and bombers of the united states confronted each other in combat 1-4 nearly 17,000 soviet missile technicians and operator/instructors deployed to north vietnam in 1965 to help defend hanoi against american bombers , while north vietnamese missilemen completed their six to nine months of sam training in the soviet union during the course of the air defense of north vietnam in 1966–1967 , one russian sam operator , lieutenant vadim petrovich shcherbakov , was credited with destroying 12 u.s as their targets were now being forced to fly lower due to the presence of the larger missiles , engagements would necessarily be at short ranges , and occur quickly '' seacat – the guided missile to defend small ships '' , flight international , 5 september 1963 , p sam systems generally fall into two broad groups based on their guidance systems , those using radar and those using some other means early sam systems generally used tracking radars and fed guidance information to the missile using radio control concepts , referred to in the field as command guidance long-range systems generally use radar systems for target detection , and depending on the generation of system , may '' hand off '' to a separate tracking radar for attack vietnam air losses , united states air force , navy , and marine corps fixed-wing aircraft losses in southeast asia 1961–1973

the knx standard has been built on the osi-based eib protocol stack extended with the physical layers , configuration modes and application experience of batibus and ehs knx installations can use several physical communication media : twisted pair wiring ( inherited from the eib standard ( the before inherited batibus communication medium ( tp0 ) is no longer part of the knx specifications ( the before inherited ehs communication medium ( pl132 ) is no longer part of the knx specifications ) radio ( knx-rf ) ip ( also referred to as eibnet/ip or knxnet/ip ) knx is not based on a specific hardware platform and a network can be controlled by anything from an 8-bit microcontroller to a pc , according to the demands of a particular building the current vendor list can be found at knx.org : this is a royalty-free open standard and thus access to the knx specifications is unrestricted knx devices are commonly connected by a twisted pair bus and can be modified from a controller the bus is routed in parallel to the electrical power supply to all devices and systems on the network linking : sensors ( e.g application software , together with system topology and commissioning software , is loaded onto the devices via a system interface component installed systems can be accessed via lan , point to point links , or phone networks for central or distributed control of the system via computers , tablets and touch screens , and smartphones the common kernel sits on top of the physical layers and the medium-specific data link layer and is shared by all the devices on the knx network configuration may be achieved through a combination of local activity on the devices ( such pushing a button ) , and active network management communication over the bus ( peer-to-peer , or more centralized master-slave ) devices may be identified and subsequently accessed throughout the network either by their individual address , or by their unique serial number , depending on the configuration mode an installation based on knxnet/ip allows the integration of knx sub networks via ip as the knx address structure is similar to an ip address knx telegrams can be signed or encrypted thanks to the extension of the protocol that was developed starting in 2013 , knx data secure for securing telegrams on the traditional knx media tp and rf and knx ip secure for securing knx telegrams tunnelled via ip

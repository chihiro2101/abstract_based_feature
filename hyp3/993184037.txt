the knx standard has been built on the osi-based eib protocol stack extended with the physical layers , configuration modes and application experience of batibus and ehs knx installations can use several physical communication media : twisted pair wiring ( inherited from the eib standard ) power-line networking ( inherited from eib standard the most common form of installation is over twisted pair medium knx devices are commonly connected by a twisted pair bus and can be modified from a controller the bus is routed in parallel to the electrical power supply to all devices and systems on the network linking : sensors ( e.g application software , together with system topology and commissioning software , is loaded onto the devices via a system interface component the standardised containers for these datapoints are group objects and interface object properties the common kernel sits on top of the physical layers and the medium-specific data link layer and is shared by all the devices on the knx network an installation has to be configured at the network topology level and at individual nodes or devices a knx installation always consists of a set of devices connected to the bus or network selv power is distributed via the same pair for low-power devices knx powerline is aimed at smart white goods , but the take-up has been low ignoring any preamble for medium-specific access and collision control , a frame format is generally : knx data secure became an en standard ( en 50090-3-4 ) in 2018 , knx ip secure an iso standard ( iso 22510 ) in 2019

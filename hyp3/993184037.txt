the knx standard has been built on the osi-based eib protocol stack extended with the physical layers , configuration modes and application experience of batibus and ehs knx installations can use several physical communication media : twisted pair wiring ( inherited from the eib standard ( the before inherited batibus communication medium ( tp0 ) is no longer part of the knx specifications ( the before inherited ehs communication medium ( pl132 ) is no longer part of the knx specifications ) radio ( knx-rf ) ip ( also referred to as eibnet/ip or knxnet/ip ) knx is not based on a specific hardware platform and a network can be controlled by anything from an 8-bit microcontroller to a pc , according to the demands of a particular building knx devices are commonly connected by a twisted pair bus and can be modified from a controller the bus is routed in parallel to the electrical power supply to all devices and systems on the network linking : sensors ( e.g application software , together with system topology and commissioning software , is loaded onto the devices via a system interface component installed systems can be accessed via lan , point to point links , or phone networks for central or distributed control of the system via computers , tablets and touch screens , and smartphones central to the knx architecture concepts are datapoints ( inputs , outputs , parameters , and diagnostic data ) which represent process and control variables in the system configuration may be achieved through a combination of local activity on the devices ( such pushing a button ) , and active network management communication over the bus ( peer-to-peer , or more centralized master-slave ) knx encompasses tools for project engineering tasks such as linking a series of individual devices into a functioning installation and integrating different media and configuration modes a knx installation always consists of a set of devices connected to the bus or network an installation based on knxnet/ip allows the integration of knx sub networks via ip as the knx address structure is similar to an ip address knx data secure became an en standard ( en 50090-3-4 ) in 2018 , knx ip secure an iso standard ( iso 22510 ) in 2019

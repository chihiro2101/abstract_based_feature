the knx standard has been built on the osi-based eib protocol stack extended with the physical layers , configuration modes and application experience of batibus and ehs knx installations can use several physical communication media : twisted pair wiring ( inherited from the eib standard ( the before inherited batibus communication medium ( tp0 ) is no longer part of the knx specifications ) power-line networking ( inherited from eib standard ( the before inherited ehs communication medium ( pl132 ) is no longer part of the knx specifications the most common form of installation is over twisted pair medium the knx association had 443 registered hardware and software vendor members from 44 nations as at 1 july 2018 knx devices are commonly connected by a twisted pair bus and can be modified from a controller the bus is routed in parallel to the electrical power supply to all devices and systems on the network linking : sensors ( e.g central to the knx architecture concepts are datapoints ( inputs , outputs , parameters , and diagnostic data ) which represent process and control variables in the system the common kernel sits on top of the physical layers and the medium-specific data link layer and is shared by all the devices on the knx network an installation has to be configured at the network topology level and at individual nodes or devices devices may be identified and subsequently accessed throughout the network either by their individual address , or by their unique serial number , depending on the configuration mode an installation based on knxnet/ip allows the integration of knx sub networks via ip as the knx address structure is similar to an ip address knx data secure became an en standard ( en 50090-3-4 ) in 2018 , knx ip secure an iso standard ( iso 22510 ) in 2019

the knx standard has been built on the osi-based eib protocol stack extended with the physical layers , configuration modes and application experience of batibus and ehs knx installations can use several physical communication media : twisted pair wiring ( inherited from the eib standard ( the before inherited batibus communication medium ( tp0 ) is no longer part of the knx specifications ) power-line networking ( inherited from eib standard ( the before inherited ehs communication medium ( pl132 ) is no longer part of the knx specifications the current vendor list can be found at knx.org : this is a royalty-free open standard and thus access to the knx specifications is unrestricted knx devices are commonly connected by a twisted pair bus and can be modified from a controller the bus is routed in parallel to the electrical power supply to all devices and systems on the network linking : sensors ( e.g central to the knx architecture concepts are datapoints ( inputs , outputs , parameters , and diagnostic data ) which represent process and control variables in the system the common kernel sits on top of the physical layers and the medium-specific data link layer and is shared by all the devices on the knx network configuration may be achieved through a combination of local activity on the devices ( such pushing a button ) , and active network management communication over the bus ( peer-to-peer , or more centralized master-slave ) a knx installation always consists of a set of devices connected to the bus or network an installation based on knxnet/ip allows the integration of knx sub networks via ip as the knx address structure is similar to an ip address a deprecated specification , tp0 , running at a slower signalling speed of , has been retained from the batibus standard but knx products can not exchange information with batibus devices knx data secure became an en standard ( en 50090-3-4 ) in 2018 , knx ip secure an iso standard ( iso 22510 ) in 2019

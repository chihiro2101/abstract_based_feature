the knx standard has been built on the osi-based eib protocol stack extended with the physical layers , configuration modes and application experience of batibus and ehs knx installations can use several physical communication media : twisted pair wiring ( inherited from the eib standard ( the before inherited batibus communication medium ( tp0 ) is no longer part of the knx specifications ) radio ( knx-rf ) ip ( also referred to as eibnet/ip or knxnet/ip ) knx is not based on a specific hardware platform and a network can be controlled by anything from an 8-bit microcontroller to a pc , according to the demands of a particular building the current vendor list can be found at knx.org : this is a royalty-free open standard and thus access to the knx specifications is unrestricted knx devices are commonly connected by a twisted pair bus and can be modified from a controller the bus is routed in parallel to the electrical power supply to all devices and systems on the network linking : sensors ( e.g application software , together with system topology and commissioning software , is loaded onto the devices via a system interface component central to the knx architecture concepts are datapoints ( inputs , outputs , parameters , and diagnostic data ) which represent process and control variables in the system the common kernel sits on top of the physical layers and the medium-specific data link layer and is shared by all the devices on the knx network an installation has to be configured at the network topology level and at individual nodes or devices knx encompasses tools for project engineering tasks such as linking a series of individual devices into a functioning installation and integrating different media and configuration modes a knx wired network can be formed with tree , line and star topologies , which can be mixed as needed ; ring topologies are not supported a deprecated specification , tp0 , running at a slower signalling speed of , has been retained from the batibus standard but knx products can not exchange information with batibus devices knx data secure became an en standard ( en 50090-3-4 ) in 2018 , knx ip secure an iso standard ( iso 22510 ) in 2019

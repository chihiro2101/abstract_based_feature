recumbents can be categorized by their wheelbase , wheel sizes , steering system , faired or unfaired , and front-wheel or rear-wheel drive long-wheelbase ( lwb ) models have the pedals located between the front and rear wheels ; short-wheelbase ( swb ) models have the pedals in front of the front wheel ; compact long-wheelbase ( clwb ) models have the pedals either very close to the front wheel or above it within these categories are variations , intermediate types , and even convertible designs ( lwb to clwb ) â€“ there is no '' standard '' recumbent the rear wheel of a recumbent is usually behind the rider and may be any size , from around to the 700c ( or 27 '' on some older models , as on upright road bikes of that time ) of an upright racing cycle the front wheel is commonly smaller than the rear , although a number of recumbents feature dual 26-inch ( iso 559 ) , iso 571 ( 650c ) , iso 622 ( 700c ) , or even 29 x 4 '' oversize all-terrain tires larger diameter wheels generally have lower rolling resistance but a higher profile leading to higher air resistance high-racer aficionados also claim that they are more stable , and although it is easier to balance a bicycle with a higher center of mass , the wide variety of recumbent designs makes such generalizations unreliable one common arrangement is an iso 559 ( 26-inch ) rear wheel and an iso 406 or iso 451 ( 20-inch ) front wheel the small front wheel and large rear wheel combination is used to keep the pedals and front wheel clear of each other , avoiding the problem on a short wheelbase recumbent called '' heel strike '' ( where the rider 's heels catch the wheel in tight turns ) a pivoting-boom front-wheel drive ( pbfwd aka moving bottom bracket recumbent ) configuration also overcomes heel strike since the pedals and front wheel turn together pbfwd bikes may have dual wheels or larger steering for recumbent bikes can be generally categorized as over-seat ( oss ) or above seat steering ( ass ) ; under-seat ( uss ) ; or center steering or pivot steering however , due to the proximity of the crank to the front wheel , front wheel drive ( fwd ) can be an option , and it allows for a much shorter chain in addition to the much shorter chain , the advantages to pbfwd are use of a larger front wheel for lower rolling resistance without heel strike ( you can pedal while turning ) and use of the upper body when sprinting or climbing this mainly affects off-road riders , and can be ameliorated by shifting the weight forward , applying steady pressure to the pedals , and using tires with more aggressive tread another disadvantage of pbfwd for some riders is a slightly longer '' learning curve '' due to adaptation to the pedal-steer effect ( forces applied to the pedal can actually steer the bike ) after adaptation , a pbfwd recumbent can be ridden in as straight a line as any other bike , and can even be steered accurately with the feet only cruzbike is the only pbfwd recumbent currently in production , and features a traditional steering axis similar to most standard and recumbent bikes modern recumbent bikes are increasingly being fitted with front and rear suspension systems for increased comfort and traction on rough surfaces the maturation of fully suspended conventional mountain bikes has aided the development of these designs , which often use many of the same parts , suitably modified for recumbent use the seats themselves are either of mesh stretched tightly over a frame or foam cushions over hard shells like the stinger pictured , which might be moulded or assembled from sheet materials this necessitates a higher bottom bracket than on a lowracer so that the rider 's legs are above the front wheel , and this in turn requires a higher seat '' racer '' in the name implies that this will often be the case , since these bikes strive for speed highracers are generally more maneuverable than lowracers since their higher center of mass make them easier to balance at lower speeds bicycles that use positions intermediate between a conventional upright and a recumbent are called semi-recumbent or crank forward designs just as with upright bicycles , recumbents are built and marketed with more than one seat , thus combining the advantages of recumbents with those of tandem bicycles in order to keep the wheelbase from being any longer than absolutely necessary , tandem recumbents often place the stoker 's crankset under the captain 's seat there are also hybrid recumbent designs such as the hase pino allround that utilize a recumbent stoker in the front , and an upright pilot in the rear for quadracycles with only one seat the stability improvements of the fourth wheel offer only a marginal advantage over a tadpole recumbent tricycle stationary recumbents almost always have a fairly upright seat and the pedal crank is lower than the level of the seat before the shape of the bicycle settled down following starley 's safety bicycle , there was a good deal of experimentation with various arrangements , and this included designs which might be considered recumbent although recumbent designs continued to crop up over the years they were mainly the work of lone enthusiasts and numbers remained insignificant until the 1970s over distances recumbent bicycles outperform upright bicycles as evidenced by their dominance in ultra-distance events like 24 hours at sebring the uci no longer considers the bike chris boardman rode for his 1996 record to be in compliance with its definition of an upright bicycle

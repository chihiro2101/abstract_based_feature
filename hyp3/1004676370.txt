recumbents can be categorized by their wheelbase , wheel sizes , steering system , faired or unfaired , and front-wheel or rear-wheel drive long-wheelbase ( lwb ) models have the pedals located between the front and rear wheels ; short-wheelbase ( swb ) models have the pedals in front of the front wheel ; compact long-wheelbase ( clwb ) models have the pedals either very close to the front wheel or above it within these categories are variations , intermediate types , and even convertible designs ( lwb to clwb ) – there is no '' standard '' recumbent the rear wheel of a recumbent is usually behind the rider and may be any size , from around to the 700c ( or 27 '' on some older models , as on upright road bikes of that time ) of an upright racing cycle the front wheel is commonly smaller than the rear , although a number of recumbents feature dual 26-inch ( iso 559 ) , iso 571 ( 650c ) , iso 622 ( 700c ) , or even 29 x 4 '' oversize all-terrain tires larger diameter wheels generally have lower rolling resistance but a higher profile leading to higher air resistance high-racer aficionados also claim that they are more stable , and although it is easier to balance a bicycle with a higher center of mass , the wide variety of recumbent designs makes such generalizations unreliable one common arrangement is an iso 559 ( 26-inch ) rear wheel and an iso 406 or iso 451 ( 20-inch ) front wheel the small front wheel and large rear wheel combination is used to keep the pedals and front wheel clear of each other , avoiding the problem on a short wheelbase recumbent called '' heel strike '' ( where the rider 's heels catch the wheel in tight turns ) steering for recumbent bikes can be generally categorized as over-seat ( oss ) or above seat steering ( ass ) ; under-seat ( uss ) ; or center steering or pivot steering most recumbents have the cranks attached to a boom fixed to the frame , with a long drive chain for rear wheel drive however , due to the proximity of the crank to the front wheel , front wheel drive ( fwd ) can be an option , and it allows for a much shorter chain another style , pivoting-boom fwd ( pbfwd ) , has the crankset connected to and moving with the front fork after adaptation , a pbfwd recumbent can be ridden in as straight a line as any other bike , and can even be steered accurately with the feet only cruzbike is the only pbfwd recumbent currently in production , and features a traditional steering axis similar to most standard and recumbent bikes flevobike formerly produced a center-steered fwd bike similar to the python lowracer modern recumbent bikes are increasingly being fitted with front and rear suspension systems for increased comfort and traction on rough surfaces coil , elastomer , and air-sprung suspension systems have all been used on recumbent bikes , with oil or air-damping in the forks and rear shock absorbers the maturation of fully suspended conventional mountain bikes has aided the development of these designs , which often use many of the same parts , suitably modified for recumbent use with the right equipment and design , recumbent bikes can be used for riding unpaved roads and offroad , just as with conventional mountain bikes the extreme reclined position , and the fact that the rider is sitting in line with the wheels rather than atop them , makes this type the most aerodynamic of unfaired recumbents given the same seating position they may be faster than lowracers , since it is widely believed that rolling resistance is inversely proportional to wheel diameter hip and elbow injuries are more common on highracers than on lowracers due to the greater height from which the rider can fall there are also hybrid recumbent designs such as the hase pino allround that utilize a recumbent stoker in the front , and an upright pilot in the rear in order to accommodate paraplegics and other individuals with little or no use of their legs , many manufacturers have designed and released hand-powered recumbent trikes , or handcycles they usually follow a delta design with front wheels driven by standard dérailleur gearing powered by hand cranks recumbent cycles offer the possibility of combined hand and foot power inputs , and thus the potential for a full-body workout , and the option for persons with a weak or missing leg ( s ) to power a cycle there are also hybrids between a handcycle , a recumbent bike and a tricycle ; these bikes enable cycling by use of legs , despite a spinal cord injury for quadracycles with only one seat the stability improvements of the fourth wheel offer only a marginal advantage over a tadpole recumbent tricycle the fourth wheel is only of the most benefit to the single-seat rider when going off-road stationary recumbents almost always have a fairly upright seat and the pedal crank is lower than the level of the seat to demonstrate the speed of his recumbent bicycle , mochet had the design ratified by the uci and uvf and enlisted cyclist francis faure , a category 2 racer , to ride it in races it was featured in the 1983 film brainstorm , ridden by christopher walken , and in the popular cycling reference richard 's bicycle book by richard ballantine official speed records for recumbents are governed by the rules of the international human powered vehicle association

recumbents can be categorized by their wheelbase , wheel sizes , steering system , faired or unfaired , and front-wheel or rear-wheel drive long-wheelbase ( lwb ) models have the pedals located between the front and rear wheels ; short-wheelbase ( swb ) models have the pedals in front of the front wheel ; compact long-wheelbase ( clwb ) models have the pedals either very close to the front wheel or above it within these categories are variations , intermediate types , and even convertible designs ( lwb to clwb ) – there is no '' standard '' recumbent the rear wheel of a recumbent is usually behind the rider and may be any size , from around to the 700c ( or 27 '' on some older models , as on upright road bikes of that time ) of an upright racing cycle given the higher rolling resistance of the smaller front wheel , loss of steering and control are somewhat more likely attempting sharp or quick changes of direction while crossing over patches of loose dirt , sand or pebbles high-racer aficionados also claim that they are more stable , and although it is easier to balance a bicycle with a higher center of mass , the wide variety of recumbent designs makes such generalizations unreliable one common arrangement is an iso 559 ( 26-inch ) rear wheel and an iso 406 or iso 451 ( 20-inch ) front wheel the small front wheel and large rear wheel combination is used to keep the pedals and front wheel clear of each other , avoiding the problem on a short wheelbase recumbent called '' heel strike '' ( where the rider 's heels catch the wheel in tight turns ) a pivoting-boom front-wheel drive ( pbfwd aka moving bottom bracket recumbent ) configuration also overcomes heel strike since the pedals and front wheel turn together steering for recumbent bikes can be generally categorized as over-seat ( oss ) or above seat steering ( ass ) ; under-seat ( uss ) ; or center steering or pivot steering however , due to the proximity of the crank to the front wheel , front wheel drive ( fwd ) can be an option , and it allows for a much shorter chain another style , pivoting-boom fwd ( pbfwd ) , has the crankset connected to and moving with the front fork in addition to the much shorter chain , the advantages to pbfwd are use of a larger front wheel for lower rolling resistance without heel strike ( you can pedal while turning ) and use of the upper body when sprinting or climbing the main disadvantage to all fwd designs is '' wheelspin '' when climbing steep hills covered with loose gravel , wet grass , etc coil , elastomer , and air-sprung suspension systems have all been used on recumbent bikes , with oil or air-damping in the forks and rear shock absorbers these can reduce aerodynamic drag and help keep the rider warmer and drier in cold and wet weather with the right equipment and design , recumbent bikes can be used for riding unpaved roads and offroad , just as with conventional mountain bikes crank forward designs that facilitate climbing out of the saddle , such as the rans dynamik , also can be used off-road lowracers are a type of recumbent more common in europe among racing enthusiasts highracers are distinguished by using two large wheels ( usually iso 559 , 650c or 700c ) this necessitates a higher bottom bracket than on a lowracer so that the rider 's legs are above the front wheel , and this in turn requires a higher seat given the same seating position they may be faster than lowracers , since it is widely believed that rolling resistance is inversely proportional to wheel diameter bicycles that use positions intermediate between a conventional upright and a recumbent are called semi-recumbent or crank forward designs there are also hybrid recumbent designs such as the hase pino allround that utilize a recumbent stoker in the front , and an upright pilot in the rear in order to accommodate paraplegics and other individuals with little or no use of their legs , many manufacturers have designed and released hand-powered recumbent trikes , or handcycles brake levers are usually mounted on the hand holds , which are usually set with no offset rather than the 180° of pedal cranks the entire crank assembly and the front wheel turn together , allowing the rider to steer and crank simultaneously although arms are weaker than legs , many hand cyclists are able to make use of the power of the whole upper body for quadracycles with only one seat the stability improvements of the fourth wheel offer only a marginal advantage over a tadpole recumbent tricycle when two and sometimes four riders want to ride together in a sociable configuration the four-wheel recumbent cycle is a viable option as with upright bikes , there is a subculture of recumbent builders who design and build home-built recumbents to demonstrate the speed of his recumbent bicycle , mochet had the design ratified by the uci and uvf and enlisted cyclist francis faure , a category 2 racer , to ride it in races in 1938 , faure and mochet 's son , georges , began adding fairings to the velocar in hopes of bettering the world record of one hour for a bicycle with aerodynamic components the current record is , set by sebastiaan bowier of the netherlands in a fully faired front-wheel-drive recumbent lowracer bicycle designed by the delft university of technology and the vu university amsterdam

recumbents can be categorized by their wheelbase , wheel sizes , steering system , faired or unfaired , and front-wheel or rear-wheel drive long-wheelbase ( lwb ) models have the pedals located between the front and rear wheels ; short-wheelbase ( swb ) models have the pedals in front of the front wheel ; compact long-wheelbase ( clwb ) models have the pedals either very close to the front wheel or above it within these categories are variations , intermediate types , and even convertible designs ( lwb to clwb ) â€“ there is no '' standard '' recumbent the rear wheel of a recumbent is usually behind the rider and may be any size , from around to the 700c ( or 27 '' on some older models , as on upright road bikes of that time ) of an upright racing cycle the front wheel is commonly smaller than the rear , although a number of recumbents feature dual 26-inch ( iso 559 ) , iso 571 ( 650c ) , iso 622 ( 700c ) , or even 29 x 4 '' oversize all-terrain tires given the higher rolling resistance of the smaller front wheel , loss of steering and control are somewhat more likely attempting sharp or quick changes of direction while crossing over patches of loose dirt , sand or pebbles high-racer aficionados also claim that they are more stable , and although it is easier to balance a bicycle with a higher center of mass , the wide variety of recumbent designs makes such generalizations unreliable one common arrangement is an iso 559 ( 26-inch ) rear wheel and an iso 406 or iso 451 ( 20-inch ) front wheel the small front wheel and large rear wheel combination is used to keep the pedals and front wheel clear of each other , avoiding the problem on a short wheelbase recumbent called '' heel strike '' ( where the rider 's heels catch the wheel in tight turns ) a pivoting-boom front-wheel drive ( pbfwd aka moving bottom bracket recumbent ) configuration also overcomes heel strike since the pedals and front wheel turn together steering for recumbent bikes can be generally categorized as over-seat ( oss ) or above seat steering ( ass ) ; under-seat ( uss ) ; or center steering or pivot steering most recumbents have the cranks attached to a boom fixed to the frame , with a long drive chain for rear wheel drive after adaptation , a pbfwd recumbent can be ridden in as straight a line as any other bike , and can even be steered accurately with the feet only cruzbike is the only pbfwd recumbent currently in production , and features a traditional steering axis similar to most standard and recumbent bikes the maturation of fully suspended conventional mountain bikes has aided the development of these designs , which often use many of the same parts , suitably modified for recumbent use with the right equipment and design , recumbent bikes can be used for riding unpaved roads and offroad , just as with conventional mountain bikes because of their longer wheelbase and the manner in which the rider is confined to the seat , recumbents are not as easy to use on tight , curving unpaved singletrack crank forward designs that facilitate climbing out of the saddle , such as the rans dynamik , also can be used off-road these typically have two 20 '' wheels or a 26 '' wheel at the rear and 20 '' wheel at the front the extreme reclined position , and the fact that the rider is sitting in line with the wheels rather than atop them , makes this type the most aerodynamic of unfaired recumbents highracers are distinguished by using two large wheels ( usually iso 559 , 650c or 700c ) this necessitates a higher bottom bracket than on a lowracer so that the rider 's legs are above the front wheel , and this in turn requires a higher seat given the same seating position they may be faster than lowracers , since it is widely believed that rolling resistance is inversely proportional to wheel diameter bicycles that use positions intermediate between a conventional upright and a recumbent are called semi-recumbent or crank forward designs just as with upright bicycles , recumbents are built and marketed with more than one seat , thus combining the advantages of recumbents with those of tandem bicycles in order to keep the wheelbase from being any longer than absolutely necessary , tandem recumbents often place the stoker 's crankset under the captain 's seat a common configuration for two riders in the recumbent position is the sociable tandem , wherein the two riders ride side by side there are also hybrid recumbent designs such as the hase pino allround that utilize a recumbent stoker in the front , and an upright pilot in the rear recumbent tricycles ( trikes ) are closely related to recumbent bicycles , but have three wheels instead of two recumbent bicycle designs date back to the middle of the 19th century before the shape of the bicycle settled down following starley 's safety bicycle , there was a good deal of experimentation with various arrangements , and this included designs which might be considered recumbent when the union cycliste internationale ( uci ) met in february 1934 , manufacturers of 'upright ' bicycles lobbied to have faure 's one-hour record declared invalid in 1974 , they also nucleated the international human power speed championship in long beach , california , from which the ihpva grew official speed records for recumbents are governed by the rules of the international human powered vehicle association

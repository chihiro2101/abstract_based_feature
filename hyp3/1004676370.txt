recumbents can be categorized by their wheelbase , wheel sizes , steering system , faired or unfaired , and front-wheel or rear-wheel drive long-wheelbase ( lwb ) models have the pedals located between the front and rear wheels ; short-wheelbase ( swb ) models have the pedals in front of the front wheel ; compact long-wheelbase ( clwb ) models have the pedals either very close to the front wheel or above it within these categories are variations , intermediate types , and even convertible designs ( lwb to clwb ) – there is no '' standard '' recumbent the rear wheel of a recumbent is usually behind the rider and may be any size , from around to the 700c ( or 27 '' on some older models , as on upright road bikes of that time ) of an upright racing cycle given the higher rolling resistance of the smaller front wheel , loss of steering and control are somewhat more likely attempting sharp or quick changes of direction while crossing over patches of loose dirt , sand or pebbles larger diameter wheels generally have lower rolling resistance but a higher profile leading to higher air resistance high-racer aficionados also claim that they are more stable , and although it is easier to balance a bicycle with a higher center of mass , the wide variety of recumbent designs makes such generalizations unreliable the small front wheel and large rear wheel combination is used to keep the pedals and front wheel clear of each other , avoiding the problem on a short wheelbase recumbent called '' heel strike '' ( where the rider 's heels catch the wheel in tight turns ) a pivoting-boom front-wheel drive ( pbfwd aka moving bottom bracket recumbent ) configuration also overcomes heel strike since the pedals and front wheel turn together steering for recumbent bikes can be generally categorized as over-seat ( oss ) or above seat steering ( ass ) ; under-seat ( uss ) ; or center steering or pivot steering uss is usually indirect—the bars link to the headset through a system of rods or cables and possibly a bell crank they can provide good maneuverability at low speeds , but have been reported to be potentially unstable at speeds above most recumbents have the cranks attached to a boom fixed to the frame , with a long drive chain for rear wheel drive however , due to the proximity of the crank to the front wheel , front wheel drive ( fwd ) can be an option , and it allows for a much shorter chain beginner riders tend to swerve along a serpentine path until they adapt a balanced pedal motion after adaptation , a pbfwd recumbent can be ridden in as straight a line as any other bike , and can even be steered accurately with the feet only modern recumbent bikes are increasingly being fitted with front and rear suspension systems for increased comfort and traction on rough surfaces the maturation of fully suspended conventional mountain bikes has aided the development of these designs , which often use many of the same parts , suitably modified for recumbent use the seats themselves are either of mesh stretched tightly over a frame or foam cushions over hard shells like the stinger pictured , which might be moulded or assembled from sheet materials with the right equipment and design , recumbent bikes can be used for riding unpaved roads and offroad , just as with conventional mountain bikes because of their longer wheelbase and the manner in which the rider is confined to the seat , recumbents are not as easy to use on tight , curving unpaved singletrack crank forward designs that facilitate climbing out of the saddle , such as the rans dynamik , also can be used off-road lowracers are a type of recumbent more common in europe among racing enthusiasts these typically have two 20 '' wheels or a 26 '' wheel at the rear and 20 '' wheel at the front the extreme reclined position , and the fact that the rider is sitting in line with the wheels rather than atop them , makes this type the most aerodynamic of unfaired recumbents highracers are distinguished by using two large wheels ( usually iso 559 , 650c or 700c ) bicycles that use positions intermediate between a conventional upright and a recumbent are called semi-recumbent or crank forward designs just as with upright bicycles , recumbents are built and marketed with more than one seat , thus combining the advantages of recumbents with those of tandem bicycles for quadracycles with only one seat the stability improvements of the fourth wheel offer only a marginal advantage over a tadpole recumbent tricycle recumbent bicycle designs date back to the middle of the 19th century on 1 april 1934 , the uci published a new definition of a racing bicycle that specified how high the bottom bracket could be above the ground , how far it could be in front of the seat and how close it could be to the front wheel a study by bussolari and nadel ( 1989 ) led them to pick a recumbent riding position for the daedalus flight even though the english channel crossing was accomplished in the gossamer albatross with an upright position official speed records for recumbents are governed by the rules of the international human powered vehicle association the uci no longer considers the bike chris boardman rode for his 1996 record to be in compliance with its definition of an upright bicycle

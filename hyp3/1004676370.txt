recumbents can be categorized by their wheelbase , wheel sizes , steering system , faired or unfaired , and front-wheel or rear-wheel drive long-wheelbase ( lwb ) models have the pedals located between the front and rear wheels ; short-wheelbase ( swb ) models have the pedals in front of the front wheel ; compact long-wheelbase ( clwb ) models have the pedals either very close to the front wheel or above it the rear wheel of a recumbent is usually behind the rider and may be any size , from around to the 700c ( or 27 '' on some older models , as on upright road bikes of that time ) of an upright racing cycle the front wheel is commonly smaller than the rear , although a number of recumbents feature dual 26-inch ( iso 559 ) , iso 571 ( 650c ) , iso 622 ( 700c ) , or even 29 x 4 '' oversize all-terrain tires given the higher rolling resistance of the smaller front wheel , loss of steering and control are somewhat more likely attempting sharp or quick changes of direction while crossing over patches of loose dirt , sand or pebbles high-racer aficionados also claim that they are more stable , and although it is easier to balance a bicycle with a higher center of mass , the wide variety of recumbent designs makes such generalizations unreliable one common arrangement is an iso 559 ( 26-inch ) rear wheel and an iso 406 or iso 451 ( 20-inch ) front wheel the small front wheel and large rear wheel combination is used to keep the pedals and front wheel clear of each other , avoiding the problem on a short wheelbase recumbent called '' heel strike '' ( where the rider 's heels catch the wheel in tight turns ) steering for recumbent bikes can be generally categorized as over-seat ( oss ) or above seat steering ( ass ) ; under-seat ( uss ) ; or center steering or pivot steering most recumbents have the cranks attached to a boom fixed to the frame , with a long drive chain for rear wheel drive however , due to the proximity of the crank to the front wheel , front wheel drive ( fwd ) can be an option , and it allows for a much shorter chain this mainly affects off-road riders , and can be ameliorated by shifting the weight forward , applying steady pressure to the pedals , and using tires with more aggressive tread the maturation of fully suspended conventional mountain bikes has aided the development of these designs , which often use many of the same parts , suitably modified for recumbent use because of their longer wheelbase and the manner in which the rider is confined to the seat , recumbents are not as easy to use on tight , curving unpaved singletrack these typically have two 20 '' wheels or a 26 '' wheel at the rear and 20 '' wheel at the front the extreme reclined position , and the fact that the rider is sitting in line with the wheels rather than atop them , makes this type the most aerodynamic of unfaired recumbents highracers are distinguished by using two large wheels ( usually iso 559 , 650c or 700c ) this necessitates a higher bottom bracket than on a lowracer so that the rider 's legs are above the front wheel , and this in turn requires a higher seat the seating position may be otherwise identical to that on a lowracer allowing similar aerodynamics given the same seating position they may be faster than lowracers , since it is widely believed that rolling resistance is inversely proportional to wheel diameter the reasoning is that the riders body is in line with the wheels , reducing drag hip and elbow injuries are more common on highracers than on lowracers due to the greater height from which the rider can fall in order to keep the wheelbase from being any longer than absolutely necessary , tandem recumbents often place the stoker 's crankset under the captain 's seat there are also hybrid recumbent designs such as the hase pino allround that utilize a recumbent stoker in the front , and an upright pilot in the rear they usually follow a delta design with front wheels driven by standard d√©railleur gearing powered by hand cranks recumbent cycles offer the possibility of combined hand and foot power inputs , and thus the potential for a full-body workout , and the option for persons with a weak or missing leg ( s ) to power a cycle in one recumbent tricycle design the user makes the two front wheels change direction by shifting his center of weight , and moves forward by rotating the rear wheel there are also hybrids between a handcycle , a recumbent bike and a tricycle ; these bikes enable cycling by use of legs , despite a spinal cord injury the fourth wheel is only of the most benefit to the single-seat rider when going off-road as with upright bikes , there is a subculture of recumbent builders who design and build home-built recumbents it is possible to add couplers either during manufacturing or as a retrofit so that the frame can be disassembled into smaller pieces to facilitate packing and travel as well as road-going recumbent bicycles with wheels , stationary versions also exist official speed records for recumbents are governed by the rules of the international human powered vehicle association the equivalent record for an upright bicycle is , set by victor campenaerts in 2019

the holsten gate is composed of a south tower , a north tower and a central building it has four floors , except for the ground floor of the central block , where the gate 's passageway is located the side facing west ( away from the city ) is called the '' field side '' , the side facing the city the '' city side '' the two towers and the central block appear as one construction when viewed from the city side on the field side , the three units can be clearly differentiated the towers have conical roofs ; the central block has a pediment the passageway once had two gates on the field side , which have not survived instead , there was once a so-called '' pipe organ '' at this location , with individual bars which could be lowered separately rather than together as a set this inscription was modeled on the roman '' spqr '' ( latin senatus populusque romanus - the senate and people of rome ) and stands for senatus populusque lubecensis it would also have been pointless , since the view of the lower parts of the holsten gate from the city side was obscured by high walls there is another inscription on the field side functionally , the field and the city side have very different designs while the city side is richly decorated with windows , this would be inappropriate on the field side considering the possibility of combat situations also , the wall thickness on the field side is greater than on the city side : 3.5 metres compared to less than 1 metre the reasoning during construction may have been to be able to quickly destroy the gate from the city side in an emergency , so that it would not fall into enemy hands as a bulwark in each tower there were three gun chambers , one each on the ground , first and second floors the new tiles approximate the former design , although liberties were taken during the restoration an old view on an altarpiece in the lübeck fortress monastery shows a holsten gate with five pediment towers the ground floor and first upper story have the highest ceilings , while the floors above are much lower today there are guns in the chambers of the second floor , but they are not originals and were placed there at a late date above the gun chambers are hooks from which chains were suspended and attached to the cannon to cushion the recoil after firing the higher gun chambers of the first upper storey could only be accessed with ladders three gates gave access to the city : the citadel gate in the north , mill gate in the south , and the holsten gate in the west the gate now known as the citadel gate is the former interior citadel gate ; the middle and outer citadel gates no longer exist the names of the individual gates changed as a matter of course as their components emerged and disappeared the middle holsten gate was once the outer holsten gate before the gates on either side were constructed one had to leave the city through this gate in order to get to the holsten bridge , which crossed the river historical records indicate that the holsten bridge and holsten gate were renewed in 1376 there is good evidence for the appearance of the gate erected at that time in a woodcut of a view of the city of lübeck produced by elias diebel although this is a city view from the eastern , wakenitz side of the old inner city hill , the artist has folded out essential parts of the gate 's west side , so that they too become visible at an unknown date in the 17th century , the inner holsten gate was replaced by a smaller , simple half-timbered gate—possibly because no point was seen in having a strong inner gate in light of the strong outer fortifications which had been erected in the meantime if it existed , it was torn down before or after the construction of the middle holsten gate it was decided to build another gate—the outer holsten gate , later known as the middle holsten gate and today only as the holsten gate its foregate was small compared with the approximately one hundred years older middle holsten gate , but much more richly decorated on the field side in 1808 the second outer holsten gate was demolished , in 1828 the inner holsten gate , and in 1853 the outer holsten gate the lowest loopholes were already 50 centimetres below ground , and the inclination of the entire gate was beginning to be dangerous changes were , however , also made which did not correspond with the original character of the gate , including the above-mentioned merging of north tower floors the holsten gate square ( '' holstentorplatz '' ) is enclosed on one side by a branch of the deutsche bundesbank ; with new construction extending the original reichsbank building to the rear

the holsten gate is composed of a south tower , a north tower and a central building it has four floors , except for the ground floor of the central block , where the gate 's passageway is located the side facing west ( away from the city ) is called the '' field side '' , the side facing the city the '' city side '' the two towers and the central block appear as one construction when viewed from the city side the passageway once had two gates on the field side , which have not survived thus it was possible to first lower all but one or two rods , leaving a small gap for their own men to slip through later there is an inscription over the passageway on both the city side and the field side it would also have been pointless , since the view of the lower parts of the holsten gate from the city side was obscured by high walls the text is '' concordia domi foris pax '' ( '' harmony within , peace without '' ) functionally , the field and the city side have very different designs while the city side is richly decorated with windows , this would be inappropriate on the field side considering the possibility of combat situations the reasoning during construction may have been to be able to quickly destroy the gate from the city side in an emergency , so that it would not fall into enemy hands as a bulwark the windows above the passage were also designed for dousing invaders with pitch or boiling water it has the form of a heraldic shield and bears either the lübeck heraldic eagle or a stylized tree the new tiles approximate the former design , although liberties were taken during the restoration the pediment was also not faithfully restored , but this is not the fault of the restorers , since in the 19th century it had long been gone and its original appearance was unknown today , three towers crown the pediment , but they are visible only from the city side three gates gave access to the city : the citadel gate in the north , mill gate in the south , and the holsten gate in the west to the east , the city was protected by the dammed wakenitz river here , the less martial hüxter gate led out of the city these city gates were initially simple gates which were repeatedly strengthened over time so that they eventually all had an outer , middle and inner gate the gate now known as the citadel gate is the former interior citadel gate ; the middle and outer citadel gates no longer exist the oldest holsten gate guarded the nearby banks of the trave river one had to leave the city through this gate in order to get to the holsten bridge , which crossed the river the holsten bridge was first mentioned in a 1216 deed signed by the king of denmark the designations '' holsten bridge '' ( and '' holsten gate '' ) are simply a consequence of the fact that the city 's western exit was in the direction of holstein historical records indicate that the holsten bridge and holsten gate were renewed in 1376 there is good evidence for the appearance of the gate erected at that time in a woodcut of a view of the city of lübeck produced by elias diebel although this is a city view from the eastern , wakenitz side of the old inner city hill , the artist has folded out essential parts of the gate 's west side , so that they too become visible the inner holsten tor was connected to the dwelling of the tollkeeper , who guarded the access to the city at this location it is likely that there was a gate also on the opposite bank of the trave at an early date it was decided to build another gate—the outer holsten gate , later known as the middle holsten gate and today only as the holsten gate funding was secured by a legacy of the councilman john broling amounting to 4,000 lübeck marks the builder of the renaissance gate was probably the city architect hermann von rode , who designed the front following dutch prototypes at the beginning of the 17th century new city walls were built in front of the city moat , under the supervision of military engineer johhann von brüssel it was then considered to be only as a matter of time before the middle holsten gate , the only remaining of the four gates , would be torn down for safety reasons the gate had been obscured during restoration by a high resolution depiction of the gate before work had begun , printed on scaffolding tarpaulins as of 2006 , the museum has been managed by the cultural foundation of the hanseatic city of lübeck

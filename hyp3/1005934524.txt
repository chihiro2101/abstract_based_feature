the holsten gate is composed of a south tower , a north tower and a central building it has four floors , except for the ground floor of the central block , where the gate 's passageway is located the side facing west ( away from the city ) is called the '' field side '' , the side facing the city the '' city side '' the two towers and the central block appear as one construction when viewed from the city side the towers have conical roofs ; the central block has a pediment thus it was possible to first lower all but one or two rods , leaving a small gap for their own men to slip through later there is an inscription over the passageway on both the city side and the field side it would also have been pointless , since the view of the lower parts of the holsten gate from the city side was obscured by high walls functionally , the field and the city side have very different designs also , the wall thickness on the field side is greater than on the city side : 3.5 metres compared to less than 1 metre those on the ground floor have not been preserved since the building has subsided over the centuries , they are now 50 centimetres below ground level , and even below the new flooring on the first upper storey there are , in addition to the aforementioned chambers , two slits for small guns which were above and between the three chambers the windows above the passage were also designed for dousing invaders with pitch or boiling water it has the form of a heraldic shield and bears either the lübeck heraldic eagle or a stylized tree the terracotta stripes were repaired during restoration work between 1865 and 1870 an old view on an altarpiece in the lübeck fortress monastery shows a holsten gate with five pediment towers but since this picture shows the holstentor gate in the middle of a fantasy landscape of mountains and forests the credibility of the representation is disputed today , three towers crown the pediment , but they are visible only from the city side to the east , the city was protected by the dammed wakenitz river here , the less martial hüxter gate led out of the city the gate now known as the citadel gate is the former interior citadel gate ; the middle and outer citadel gates no longer exist the middle holsten gate was once the outer holsten gate before the gates on either side were constructed the oldest holsten gate guarded the nearby banks of the trave river it is not known when a gate was erected here for the first time the holsten bridge was first mentioned in a 1216 deed signed by the king of denmark it is likely that already at that time there was a gate and a city wall along the trave river the designations '' holsten bridge '' ( and '' holsten gate '' ) are simply a consequence of the fact that the city 's western exit was in the direction of holstein historical records indicate that the holsten bridge and holsten gate were renewed in 1376 although this is a city view from the eastern , wakenitz side of the old inner city hill , the artist has folded out essential parts of the gate 's west side , so that they too become visible it was a rectangular tower with a wooden gallery on the upper part it was decided to build another gate—the outer holsten gate , later known as the middle holsten gate and today only as the holsten gate for more history of the middle holsten gate see the section on demolition and restoration below the exterior holsten gate was also known as the renaissance gate , the foregate or the crooked gate at the beginning of the 17th century new city walls were built in front of the city moat , under the supervision of military engineer johhann von brüssel in 1808 the second outer holsten gate was demolished , in 1828 the inner holsten gate , and in 1853 the outer holsten gate meanwhile , the gate was in very bad condition , since every year it had sunk a few centimetres further into the ground since 1926 there has been a stylization of the holsten gate in the emblem of the german association of cities ( deutscher städtetag dst )

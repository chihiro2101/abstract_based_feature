the holsten gate is composed of a south tower , a north tower and a central building it has four floors , except for the ground floor of the central block , where the gate 's passageway is located the side facing west ( away from the city ) is called the '' field side '' , the side facing the city the '' city side '' the two towers and the central block appear as one construction when viewed from the city side on the field side , the three units can be clearly differentiated here the two towers form semicircles which at their widest point extend 3.5 metres beyond the central block the passageway once had two gates on the field side , which have not survived thus it was possible to first lower all but one or two rods , leaving a small gap for their own men to slip through later there is an inscription over the passageway on both the city side and the field side this inscription was modeled on the roman '' spqr '' ( latin senatus populusque romanus - the senate and people of rome ) and stands for senatus populusque lubecensis it would also have been pointless , since the view of the lower parts of the holsten gate from the city side was obscured by high walls the text is '' concordia domi foris pax '' ( '' harmony within , peace without '' ) functionally , the field and the city side have very different designs on the field side there are accordingly only a few small windows also , the wall thickness on the field side is greater than on the city side : 3.5 metres compared to less than 1 metre the reasoning during construction may have been to be able to quickly destroy the gate from the city side in an emergency , so that it would not fall into enemy hands as a bulwark in each tower there were three gun chambers , one each on the ground , first and second floors it has the form of a heraldic shield and bears either the l端beck heraldic eagle or a stylized tree the ground floor and first upper story have the highest ceilings , while the floors above are much lower three gates gave access to the city : the citadel gate in the north , mill gate in the south , and the holsten gate in the west these city gates were initially simple gates which were repeatedly strengthened over time so that they eventually all had an outer , middle and inner gate the gate now known as the citadel gate is the former interior citadel gate ; the middle and outer citadel gates no longer exist so the history of the holsten gate is actually the history of four consecutive gates , although only one of them is left the middle holsten gate was once the outer holsten gate before the gates on either side were constructed one had to leave the city through this gate in order to get to the holsten bridge , which crossed the river there is good evidence for the appearance of the gate erected at that time in a woodcut of a view of the city of l端beck produced by elias diebel although this is a city view from the eastern , wakenitz side of the old inner city hill , the artist has folded out essential parts of the gate 's west side , so that they too become visible the inner holsten tor was connected to the dwelling of the tollkeeper , who guarded the access to the city at this location in the 15th century the entire gate construction was considered to be inadequate the exterior holsten gate was also known as the renaissance gate , the foregate or the crooked gate the outer holsten gate was completed in 1585 the new gate obstructed the view of the middle holsten gate since its eastern exit was located only 20 metres from that construction as part of this construction a fourth holsten gate was built in 1621 in 1808 the second outer holsten gate was demolished , in 1828 the inner holsten gate , and in 1853 the outer holsten gate afterwards there was a change in the relationship of the l端beck population to the holsten gate but the holsten gate had never contained anything like that as of 2006 , the museum has been managed by the cultural foundation of the hanseatic city of l端beck on the other side there is the brick expressionist holsten gate hall ( '' holstentorhalle '' ) between the historic salt warehouses and the dgb 's house of trade unions ( '' gewerkschaftshaus '' )

the holsten gate is composed of a south tower , a north tower and a central building it has four floors , except for the ground floor of the central block , where the gate 's passageway is located the side facing west ( away from the city ) is called the '' field side '' , the side facing the city the '' city side '' the two towers and the central block appear as one construction when viewed from the city side on the field side , the three units can be clearly differentiated the towers have conical roofs ; the central block has a pediment the passageway once had two gates on the field side , which have not survived there is an inscription over the passageway on both the city side and the field side it would also have been pointless , since the view of the lower parts of the holsten gate from the city side was obscured by high walls there is another inscription on the field side functionally , the field and the city side have very different designs while the city side is richly decorated with windows , this would be inappropriate on the field side considering the possibility of combat situations also , the wall thickness on the field side is greater than on the city side : 3.5 metres compared to less than 1 metre the windows above the passage were also designed for dousing invaders with pitch or boiling water it has the form of a heraldic shield and bears either the lübeck heraldic eagle or a stylized tree today , three towers crown the pediment , but they are visible only from the city side the ground floor and first upper story have the highest ceilings , while the floors above are much lower the ceiling of the north tower 's second floor has been removed , so that today the second and third upper storeys there share a common space above the gun chambers are hooks from which chains were suspended and attached to the cannon to cushion the recoil after firing the rich and wealthy hanseatic city of lübeck felt the need in the course of the centuries to protect itself from outside threats with ever stronger walls and fortifications today , only fragments remain of these ancient city gates the gate now known as the citadel gate is the former interior citadel gate ; the middle and outer citadel gates no longer exist so the history of the holsten gate is actually the history of four consecutive gates , although only one of them is left the middle holsten gate was once the outer holsten gate before the gates on either side were constructed one had to leave the city through this gate in order to get to the holsten bridge , which crossed the river the holsten bridge was first mentioned in a 1216 deed signed by the king of denmark it is likely that already at that time there was a gate and a city wall along the trave river historical records indicate that the holsten bridge and holsten gate were renewed in 1376 it was decided to build another gate—the outer holsten gate , later known as the middle holsten gate and today only as the holsten gate for more history of the middle holsten gate see the section on demolition and restoration below the exterior holsten gate was also known as the renaissance gate , the foregate or the crooked gate the city side was by contrast left plain this gate existed for about 250 years and was in the end sacrificed to the railway ; it was demolished in 1853 to make room for the first lübeck train station and tracks in 1808 the second outer holsten gate was demolished , in 1828 the inner holsten gate , and in 1853 the outer holsten gate indeed , in 1855 , lübeck citizens petitioned the senate to finally demolish the remaining gate , since it hindered the extension of the railway facilities as of 2006 , the museum has been managed by the cultural foundation of the hanseatic city of lübeck the holsten gate square ( '' holstentorplatz '' ) is enclosed on one side by a branch of the deutsche bundesbank ; with new construction extending the original reichsbank building to the rear since 1926 there has been a stylization of the holsten gate in the emblem of the german association of cities ( deutscher städtetag dst )

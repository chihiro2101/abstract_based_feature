the holsten gate is composed of a south tower , a north tower and a central building it has four floors , except for the ground floor of the central block , where the gate 's passageway is located the side facing west ( away from the city ) is called the '' field side '' , the side facing the city the '' city side '' the two towers and the central block appear as one construction when viewed from the city side on the field side , the three units can be clearly differentiated the passageway once had two gates on the field side , which have not survived thus it was possible to first lower all but one or two rods , leaving a small gap for their own men to slip through later there is an inscription over the passageway on both the city side and the field side it would also have been pointless , since the view of the lower parts of the holsten gate from the city side was obscured by high walls on the field side there are accordingly only a few small windows also , the wall thickness on the field side is greater than on the city side : 3.5 metres compared to less than 1 metre the reasoning during construction may have been to be able to quickly destroy the gate from the city side in an emergency , so that it would not fall into enemy hands as a bulwark it has the form of a heraldic shield and bears either the lübeck heraldic eagle or a stylized tree the pediment was also not faithfully restored , but this is not the fault of the restorers , since in the 19th century it had long been gone and its original appearance was unknown today , three towers crown the pediment , but they are visible only from the city side the ground floor and first upper story have the highest ceilings , while the floors above are much lower two narrow spiral staircases wind their way upwards , in each case between the central building and the adjacent tower the ceiling of the north tower 's second floor has been removed , so that today the second and third upper storeys there share a common space above the gun chambers are hooks from which chains were suspended and attached to the cannon to cushion the recoil after firing three gates gave access to the city : the citadel gate in the north , mill gate in the south , and the holsten gate in the west here , the less martial hüxter gate led out of the city today , only fragments remain of these ancient city gates the names of the individual gates changed as a matter of course as their components emerged and disappeared the middle holsten gate was once the outer holsten gate before the gates on either side were constructed one had to leave the city through this gate in order to get to the holsten bridge , which crossed the river it is likely that already at that time there was a gate and a city wall along the trave river the designations '' holsten bridge '' ( and '' holsten gate '' ) are simply a consequence of the fact that the city 's western exit was in the direction of holstein there is good evidence for the appearance of the gate erected at that time in a woodcut of a view of the city of lübeck produced by elias diebel at an unknown date in the 17th century , the inner holsten gate was replaced by a smaller , simple half-timbered gate—possibly because no point was seen in having a strong inner gate in light of the strong outer fortifications which had been erected in the meantime the inner holsten tor was connected to the dwelling of the tollkeeper , who guarded the access to the city at this location it was decided to build another gate—the outer holsten gate , later known as the middle holsten gate and today only as the holsten gate 525 in 1464 the city 's architect , hinrich helmstede , began construction , which was completed in 1478 the new gate obstructed the view of the middle holsten gate since its eastern exit was located only 20 metres from that construction as early as 1901 , the marzipan manufacturer niederegger used the holsten gate in its company trademark from march 2005 to december 2006 , the holsten gate was again restored they were originally placed in front of the house built in 1840 by the lübeck merchant and art collector john daniel jacobj ( 1798-1847 ) at große petersgrube 18 on the other side there is the brick expressionist holsten gate hall ( '' holstentorhalle '' ) between the historic salt warehouses and the dgb 's house of trade unions ( '' gewerkschaftshaus '' ) since 1926 there has been a stylization of the holsten gate in the emblem of the german association of cities ( deutscher städtetag dst )

festinger was born in brooklyn new york on may 8 , 1919 to russian-jewish immigrants alex festinger and sara solomon festinger his father , an embroidery manufacturer , had '' left russia a radical and atheist and remained faithful to these views throughout his life 99 festinger attended boys ' high school in brooklyn , and received his bs degree in psychology from the city college of new york in 1939 100 he proceeded to study under kurt lewin at the university of iowa , where festinger received his ma in 1940 and phd in 1942 in the field of child behavior festinger , 1980 , p 237 however , festinger continued to pursue his original interests , studying level of aspiration , festinger , 1942 working on statistics , festinger , 1943a festinger , 1943b developing a quantitative model of decision making , carlsmith & festinger , 1943 and even publishing a laboratory study on rats festinger , 1943c explaining his lack of interest in social psychology at the time , festinger stated , '' the looser methodology of the social psychology studies , and the vagueness of relation of the data to lewinian concepts and theories , all seemed unappealing to me in my youthful penchant for rigor 237 festinger considered himself to be a freethinker and an atheist '' festinger , a professed atheist , was an original thinker and a restless , highly motivated individual with ( in his words ) '' little tolerance for boredom '' in 1943 , festinger married mary oliver ballou , a pianist , '' deaths : mary ballou festinger , '' 2006 with whom he had three children , catherine , richard , and kurt 545 festinger and ballou were later divorced , and festinger married trudy bradley , currently a professor of social work at new york university , faculty profile , n.d in 1945 , festinger joined lewin 's newly formed research center for group dynamics at the massachusetts institute of technology as an assistant professor it was at mit that festinger , in his own words , '' became , by fiat , a social psychologist , and immersed myself in the field with all its difficulties , vaguenesses , and challenges '' festinger , 1980 , p 237 it was also at mit that festinger began his foray into social communication and pressures in groups that marked a turning point in his own research '' festinger , 1980 , pp 237–238 indeed , stanley schachter , festinger 's student and research assistant at the time , states , '' i was lucky enough to work with festinger at this time , and i think of it as one of the high points of my scientific life 101 while festinger was conducting a study on the impact of architectural and ecological factors on student housing satisfaction for the university xiii thus raising unexpected questions regarding communication within social groups and the development of group standards of attitudes and behaviors festinger , schachter , & back , 1950 indeed , festinger 's seminal 1950 paper on informal social communication as a function of pressures toward attitude uniformity within a group cites findings from this seemingly unrelated housing satisfaction study multiple times festinger , 1950 after lewin 's death in 1947 , festinger moved with the research center to the university of michigan in 1948 he then moved to the university of minnesota in 1951 , and then on to stanford university in 1955 festinger , 1954 following this , in 1957 , festinger published his theory of cognitive dissonance , arguably his most famous and influential contribution to the field of social psychology festinger , 1957 some also view this as an extension of festinger 's prior work on group pressures toward resolving discrepancies in attitudes and abilities within social groups to how the individual resolves discrepancies at the cognitive level 248 he turned his attention to the visual system , focusing on human eye movement and color perception '' festinger , 1983 , p and even worse , from a broader point of view we do not seem to have been working on many of the important problems gazzaniga , 2006 , pp 91–92 his efforts eventually culminated in the book , the human legacy , which examined how humans evolved and developed complex societies festinger , 1983 although seemingly the product of a disillusioned , wholesale abandonment of the field of psychology , festinger considered this research as a return to the fundamental concerns of psychology 92 however , festinger was diagnosed with cancer before he was able to publish this material in other words , people simply tend to befriend their neighbors for example , in a two-storey apartment building , people living on the lower floor next to a stairway are functionally closer to upper-floor residents than are others living on the same lower floor , brief meetings made as a result of going to and from home within the student housing community ) and that such passive contacts are more likely to occur given closer physical and functional distance between people in his 1950 paper , festinger postulated that one of the major pressures to communicate arises from uniformity within a group , which in turn arises from two sources : social reality and group locomotion festinger labeled communications arising from such pressures toward uniformity as '' instrumental communication '' in that the communication is not an end in itself but a means to reduce discrepancies between the communicator and others in the group specifically , people will seek out others who are close to one 's own opinions and abilities for comparison because accurate comparisons are difficult when others are too divergent from those of oneself to use festinger 's example , a chess novice does not compare his chess abilities to those of recognized chess masters , festinger , 1954 , p people will , moreover , take action to reduce discrepancies in attitudes , whether by changing others to bring them closer to oneself or by changing one 's own attitudes to bring them closer to others there exists , in the human organism , a drive to evaluate his opinion and abilities to the extent that objective , nonsocial means are available , people evaluate their opinions and abilities by comparison respectively with the opinions and abilities of others the tendency to compare oneself with some other specific person decreases as the difference between his opinion or ability and one 's own increases there are nonsocial restraints which make it difficult or even impossible to change one 's ability the cessation of comparison with others is accompanied by hostility or derogation to the extent that continued comparison with those persons implies unpleasant consequences when there is a range of opinion or ability in a group , the relative strength of the three manifestations of pressures toward uniformity will be different for those who are close to the mode of the group than those who are distant from the mode specifically , those close to the mode of the group will have stronger tendencies to change the positions of others , relatively weaker tendencies to narrow the range of comparison , and much weaker tendencies to change their position compared to those who are distant from the mode of the group the group studied a small apocalyptic cult led by dorothy martin ( under the pseudonym marian keech in the book ) , a suburban housewife ' the messages purportedly said that a flood spreading to form an inland sea stretching from the arctic circle to the gulf of mexico would destroy the world on december 21 , 1954 when doomsday came and went , martin claimed that the world had been spared because of the '' force of good and light '' festinger , riecken , & schachter , 1956 , p festinger and his co-authors concluded that the following conditions lead to increased conviction in beliefs following disconfirmation : :1 the belief must be held with deep conviction and be relevant to the believer 's actions or behavior the believer must have social support from other believers , increased proselytizing reduced dissonance by producing the knowledge that others also accepted their beliefs ) and its application to understanding complex , mass phenomena festinger , 1957 , pp festinger 's seminal 1957 work integrated existing research literature on influence and social communication under his theory of cognitive dissonance 236–239 the rumors functioned to reduce the inconsistency of people 's feelings of fear despite not directly experiencing the effects of the earthquake by giving people a reason to be fearful festinger described the basic hypotheses of cognitive dissonance as follows : :1 the existence of dissonance or inconsistency , being psychologically uncomfortable , will motivate the person to try to reduce the dissonance and achieve consonance or consistency when dissonance is present , in addition to trying to reduce it , the person will actively avoid situations and information which would likely increase the dissonance festinger , 1957 , p carlsmith published their classic cognitive dissonance experiment in 1959 festinger & carlsmith , 1959 in the experiment , subjects were asked to perform an hour of boring and monotonous tasks ( i.e social comparison theory and cognitive dissonance have been described by other psychologists as '' the two most fruitful theories in social psychology 215 cognitive dissonance has been variously described as '' social psychology 's most notable achievement , '' zukier , 1989 , p xiv an obituary published by the american psychologist stated that it was '' doubtful that experimental psychology would exist at all '' without festinger '' festinger , 1953 , p 11 he '' became a symbol of the tough-minded , theory-oriented , pure experimental scientist , '' while ron lippitt , a fellow faculty member at lewin 's research center for group dynamics with whom festinger often clashed , '' became a symbol of the fuzzy-minded , do-gooder , practitioner of applied social

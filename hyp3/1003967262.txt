in 1939 schacter , 1994 , p 100 he proceeded to study under kurt lewin at the university of iowa , where festinger received his ma in 1940 and phd in 1942 in the field of child behavior festinger ,

quantitative model of decision making , carlsmith & festinger , 1943 and even publishing a laboratory study on rats '' festinger , 1980 , p '' franz samelson : '' festinger , leon '' , american national biography online , feb 2000 ( accessed april 28 , 2008 ) after graduating , festinger worked as a research associate at iowa from 1941 to 1943 , and then as a statistician for the committee on selection and training of aircraft pilots at the university of rochester from 1943 to 1945 during world war ii in 1943 , festinger married mary oliver ballou , a pianist , '' deaths : mary ballou

social work at new york university , faculty profile , n.d in 1945 , festinger joined lewin 's newly formed research center for group dynamics at the massachusetts institute of technology as an assistant professor it was at mit that festinger , in his own words , '' became , by fiat , a social psychologist , and immersed myself in the field with all its difficulties , vaguenesses , and challenges '' festinger , 1980 , p 237 it was also at mit that festinger began his foray into social communication and pressures in groups that marked a turning point in his own research '' festinger , 1980 , pp 237–238 indeed , stanley schachter , festinger 's student and research assistant at the time , states , '' i was lucky enough to work with festinger at this time , and i think of it as one of the high points of my scientific life 101 while festinger was conducting a study on the impact of architectural and ecological factors on student housing satisfaction for the university festinger , 1950 after lewin 's death in 1947 , festinger moved with the research center to the university of michigan in 1948 he then moved to the university of minnesota in 1951 , and then on to stanford university in 1955 festinger , 1954 following this , in 1957 , festinger published his theory of cognitive dissonance , arguably his most famous and influential contribution to the field of social psychology festinger , 1957 some also view this as an extension of festinger 's prior work on group pressures toward resolving discrepancies in attitudes and abilities within social groups to how the individual resolves discrepancies at the cognitive level '' festinger , 1980 , p 248 he turned his attention to the visual system , focusing on human eye movement and color perception '' festinger , 1983 , p and even worse , from a broader point of view we do not seem to have been working on many of the important problems festinger , 1983 , p festinger , 1983 although seemingly the product of a disillusioned , wholesale abandonment of the field of psychology , festinger considered this research as a return to the fundamental concerns of psychology schachter , 1994 , p in other words , people simply tend to befriend their neighbors for example , in a two-storey apartment building , people living on the lower floor next to a stairway are functionally closer to upper-floor residents than are others living on the same lower floor in his 1950 paper , festinger postulated that one of the major pressures to communicate arises from uniformity within a group , which in turn arises from two sources : social reality and group locomotion festinger , 1950 festinger argued that people depend on social reality to determine the subjective validity of their attitudes and opinions , and that they look to their reference group to establish social reality ; an opinion or attitude is therefore valid to the extent that it is similar to that of the reference group festinger labeled communications arising from such pressures toward uniformity as '' instrumental communication '' in that the communication is not an end in itself but a means to reduce discrepancies between the communicator and others in the group instrumental communication is contrasted with '' consummatory communication '' where communication is the end , such as emotional expression festinger , 1950 , p festinger 's influential social comparison theory ( 1954 ) can be viewed as an extension of his prior theory related to the reliance on social reality for evaluating attitudes and opinions to the realm of abilities specifically , people will seek out others who are close to one 's own opinions and abilities for comparison because accurate comparisons are difficult when others are too divergent from those of oneself to use festinger 's example , a chess novice does not compare his chess abilities to those of recognized chess masters , festinger , 1954 , p they will likewise take action to reduce discrepancies in abilities , for which there is an upward drive to improve one 's abilities 138 festinger also discussed implications of social comparison theory for society , hypothesizing that the tendency for people to move into groups that hold opinions which agree with their own and abilities that are near their own results in the segmentation of society into groups which are relatively alike in his 1954 paper , festinger again systematically set forth a series of hypotheses , corollaries , and derivations , and he cited existing experimental evidence where available any factors which increase the importance of some particular group as a comparison group for some particular opinion or ability will increase the pressure toward uniformity concerning that ability or opinion within that group if persons who are very divergent from one 's own opinion or ability are perceived as different from oneself on attributes consistent with the divergence , the tendency to narrow the range of comparability becomes stronger festinger , riecken , & schachter , 1956 mooney , 2011 martin claimed to have received messages from '' the guardians , '' a group of superior beings from another planet called 'clarion ' the messages purportedly said that a flood spreading to form an inland sea stretching from the arctic circle to the gulf of mexico would destroy the world on december 21 , 1954 the team observed the group firsthand for months before and after the predicted apocalypse when doomsday came and went , martin claimed that the world had been spared because of the '' force of good and light '' festinger , riecken , & schachter , 1956 , p rather than abandoning their discredited beliefs , group members adhered to them even more strongly and began proselytizing with fervor the belief must be held with deep conviction and be relevant to the believer 's actions or behavior 4 festinger also later described the increased conviction and proselytizing by cult members after disconfirmation as a specific instantiation of cognitive dissonance ( i.e , increased proselytizing reduced dissonance by producing the knowledge that others also accepted their beliefs ) and its application to understanding complex , mass phenomena festinger 's seminal 1957 work integrated existing research literature on influence and social communication under his theory of cognitive dissonance although seemingly counter-intuitive that people would choose to believe '' fear-provoking '' rumors , festinger reasoned that these rumors were actually '' fear-justifying '' festinger , 1957 , p , smoking is not as bad for your health as others claim ) , or by acquiring knowledge pointing to the positive effects of smoking ( e.g festinger , 1957 , p carlsmith published their classic cognitive dissonance experiment in 1959 dissonance was created for the subjects performing the favor , as the task was in fact boring as predicted by festinger and carlsmith , those paid 1 reported the task to be more enjoyable than those paid 20 those paid 1 were forced to reduce dissonance by changing their opinions of the task to produce consonance with their behavior of reporting that the task was enjoyable 215 cognitive dissonance has been variously described as '' social psychology 's most notable achievement , '' zukier , 1989 , p xxi '' the most important development in social psychology to date , '' as cited in aronson , 1991 , p 214 and a theory without which '' social psychology would not be what it is today 661 cognitive dissonance spawned decades of related research , from studies focused on further theoretical refinement and development greenwald & ronis , 1978 to domains as varied as decision making , the socialization of children , and color preference 661 yet it seems that festinger was wary about burdensome demands for greater empirical precision '' festinger , 1989 , p '' festinger , 1953 , p journal of experimental psychology , 32 ( 3

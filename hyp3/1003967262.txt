festinger was born in brooklyn new york on may 8 , 1919 to russian-jewish immigrants alex festinger and sara solomon festinger '' schachter , 1994 , p 99 festinger attended boys ' high school in brooklyn , and received his bs degree in psychology from the city college of new york in 1939 100 he proceeded to study under kurt lewin at the university of iowa , where festinger received his ma in 1940 and phd in 1942 in the field of child behavior 784 by his own admission , he was not interested in social psychology when he arrived at iowa , and did not take a single course in social psychology during his entire time there ; instead , he was interested in lewin 's earlier work on tension systems , but lewin 's focus had shifted to social psychology by the time festinger arrived at iowa festinger , 1980 , p 237 however , festinger continued to pursue his original interests , studying level of aspiration , festinger , 1942 working on statistics , festinger , 1943a festinger , 1943b developing a quantitative model of decision making , carlsmith & festinger , 1943 and even publishing a laboratory study on rats festinger , 1943c explaining his lack of interest in social psychology at the time , festinger stated , '' the looser methodology of the social psychology studies , and the vagueness of relation of the data to lewinian concepts and theories , all seemed unappealing to me in my youthful penchant for rigor '' festinger , 1980 , p '' festinger , a professed atheist , was an original thinker and a restless , highly motivated individual with ( in his words ) '' little tolerance for boredom '' '' franz samelson : '' festinger , leon '' , american national biography online , feb in 1943 , festinger married mary oliver ballou , a pianist , '' deaths

professor of social work at new york university , faculty profile , n.d it was at mit that festinger , in his own words , '' became , by fiat , a social psychologist , and immersed myself in the field with all its difficulties , vaguenesses , and challenges '' festinger , 1980 , p 237 it was also at mit that festinger began his foray into social communication and pressures in groups that marked a turning point in his own research as festinger himself recalls , '' the years at m.i.t '' festinger , 1980 , pp although the proximity effect ( or propinquity ) was an important direct finding from the study , festinger and his collaborators also noticed correlations between the degree of friendship within a group of residents and the similarity of opinions within the group , zukier , 1989 , p xiii thus raising unexpected questions regarding communication within social groups and the development of group standards of attitudes and behaviors festinger , schachter , & back , 1950 indeed , festinger 's seminal 1950 paper on informal social communication as a function of pressures toward attitude uniformity within a group cites findings from this seemingly unrelated housing satisfaction study multiple times festinger , 1954 following this , in 1957 , festinger published his theory of cognitive dissonance , arguably his most famous and influential contribution to the field of social psychology festinger , 1957 some also view this as an extension of festinger 's prior work on group pressures toward resolving discrepancies in attitudes and abilities within social groups to how the individual resolves discrepancies at the cognitive level 103 despite such recognition , festinger left the field of social psychology in 1964 , attributing his decision to '' a conviction that had been growing in me at the time that i , personally , was in a rut and needed an injection of intellectual stimulation from new sources to continue to be productive '' festinger , 1980 , p ix festinger subsequently began exploring prehistoric archaeological data , meeting with stephen jay gould to discuss ideas and visiting archaeological sites to investigate primitive toolmaking firsthand festinger , 1983 although seemingly the product of a disillusioned , wholesale abandonment of the field of psychology , festinger considered this research as a return to the fundamental concerns of psychology he described the goal of his new research interests as “ seeing what can be inferred from different vantage points , from different data realms , about the nature , the characteristics , of this species we call human , ” festinger , 1980 , p 253 and felt bemused when fellow psychologists asked him how his new research interests were related to psychology 92 however , festinger was diagnosed with cancer before he was able to publish this material in other words , people simply tend to befriend their neighbors for example , in a two-storey apartment building , people living on the lower floor next to a stairway are functionally closer to upper-floor residents than are others living on the same lower floor festinger labeled communications arising from such pressures toward uniformity as '' instrumental communication '' in that the communication is not an end in itself but a means to reduce discrepancies between the communicator and others in the group festinger 's influential social comparison theory ( 1954 ) can be viewed as an extension of his prior theory related to the reliance on social reality for evaluating attitudes and opinions to the realm of abilities specifically , people will seek out others who are close to one 's own opinions and abilities for comparison because accurate comparisons are difficult when others are too divergent from those of oneself they will likewise take action to reduce discrepancies in abilities , for which there is an upward drive to improve one 's abilities thus festinger suggested that the '' social influence processes and some kinds of competitive behavior are both manifestations of the same socio-psychological process.namely , the drive for self evaluation and the necessity for such evaluation being based on comparison with other persons '' festinger , 1954 , p in his 1954 paper , festinger again systematically set forth a series of hypotheses , corollaries , and derivations , and he cited existing experimental evidence where available any factors which increase the importance of some particular group as a comparison group for some particular opinion or ability will increase the pressure toward uniformity concerning that ability or opinion within that group if persons who are very divergent from one 's own opinion or ability are perceived as different from oneself on attributes consistent with the divergence , the tendency to narrow the range of comparability becomes stronger festinger and his collaborators , henry riecken and stanley schachter , examined conditions under which disconfirmation of beliefs leads to increased conviction in such beliefs in the 1956 book when prophecy fails the group studied a small apocalyptic cult led by dorothy martin ( under the pseudonym marian keech in the book ) , a suburban housewife ' the messages purportedly said that a flood spreading to form an inland sea stretching from the arctic circle to the gulf of mexico would destroy the world on december 21 , 1954 when doomsday came and went , martin claimed that the world had been spared because of the '' force of good and light '' festinger , riecken , & schachter , 1956 , p rather than abandoning their discredited beliefs , group members adhered to them even more strongly and began proselytizing with fervor , increased proselytizing reduced dissonance by producing the knowledge that others also accepted their beliefs ) and its application to understanding complex , mass phenomena festinger , 1957 , pp festinger 's seminal 1957 work integrated existing research literature on influence and social communication under his theory of cognitive dissonance 236–239 the rumors functioned to reduce the inconsistency of people 's feelings of fear despite not directly experiencing the effects of the earthquake by giving people a reason to be fearful festinger described the basic hypotheses of cognitive dissonance as follows : :1 when dissonance is present , in addition to trying to reduce it , the person will actively avoid situations and information which would likely increase the dissonance festinger , 1957 , p festinger & carlsmith , 1959 in the experiment , subjects were asked to perform an hour of boring and monotonous tasks ( i.e , repeatedly filling and emptying a tray with 12 spools and turning 48 square pegs in a board clockwise ) some subjects , who were led to believe that their participation in the experiment had concluded , were then asked to perform a favor for the experimenter by telling the next participant , who was actually a confederate , that the task was extremely enjoyable those paid 1 were forced to reduce dissonance by changing their opinions of the task to produce consonance with their behavior of reporting that the task was enjoyable social comparison theory and cognitive dissonance have been described by other psychologists as '' the two most fruitful theories in social psychology 215 cognitive dissonance has been variously described as '' social psychology 's most notable achievement , '' zukier , 1989 , p 661 cognitive dissonance spawned decades of related research , from studies focused on further theoretical refinement and development greenwald & ronis , 1978 to domains as varied as decision making , the socialization of children , and color preference 11 in addition , festinger is credited with the ascendancy of laboratory experimentation in social psychology as one who '' converted the experiment into a powerful scientific instrument with a central role in the search for knowledge xiv an obituary published by the american psychologist stated that it was '' doubtful that experimental psychology would exist at all '' without festinger 661 yet it seems that festinger was wary about burdensome demands for greater empirical precision 253 he also stressed that laboratory experimentation '' can not exist by itself , '' but that '' there should be an active interrelation between laboratory experimentation and the study of real-life situations 11 perhaps one of the greatest impacts of festinger 's studies lies in their '' depiction of social behavior as the responses of a thinking organism continually acting to bring order into his world , rather than as the blind impulses of a creature of emotion and habit , '' as cited in his distinguished scientific contribution award 784 behaviorism , which had dominated psychology until that time , characterized man as a creature of habit conditioned by stimulus-response reinforcement processes festinger & carlsmith , 1959 with festinger 's theories and the research that they generated , '' the monolithic grip that reinforcement theory had held on social psychology was effectively and permanently broken '' aronson , 1991 , p , & festinger , l journal of abnormal and social psychology , 47 ( 2 ) , 382–389 , & festinger , l tendencies toward group comparability in competitive

festinger was born in brooklyn new york on may 8 , 1919 to russian-jewish immigrants alex festinger and sara solomon festinger his father , an embroidery manufacturer , had '' left russia a radical and atheist and remained faithful to these views throughout his life 99 festinger attended boys ' high school in brooklyn , and received his bs degree in psychology from the city college of new york in 1939 100 he proceeded to study under kurt lewin at the university of iowa , where festinger received his ma in 1940 and phd in 1942 in the field of child behavior 784 by his own admission , he was not interested in social psychology when he arrived at iowa , and did not take a single course in social psychology during his entire time there ; instead , he was interested in lewin 's earlier work on tension systems , but lewin 's focus had shifted to social psychology by the time festinger arrived at iowa festinger , 1980 , p 237 however , festinger continued to pursue his original interests , studying level of aspiration , festinger , 1942 working on statistics , festinger , 1943a festinger , 1943b developing a quantitative model of decision making , carlsmith & festinger , 1943 and even publishing a laboratory study on rats '' franz samelson : '' festinger , leon '' , american national biography online , feb in 1943 , festinger married mary oliver ballou , a pianist , '' deaths : mary ballou festinger , '' 2006 with whom he had three children , catherine , richard , and kurt 545 festinger and ballou were later divorced , and festinger married trudy bradley , currently a professor of social work at new york university , faculty profile , n.d '' festinger , 1980 , p as festinger himself recalls , '' the years at m.i.t 102 yet , this endeavor '' started as almost an accident '' schachter , 1994 , p 101 while festinger was conducting a study on the impact of architectural and ecological factors on student housing satisfaction for the university xiii thus raising unexpected questions regarding communication within social groups and the development of group standards of attitudes and behaviors festinger , 1950 after lewin 's death in 1947 , festinger moved with the research center to the university of michigan in 1948 during this time , festinger published his highly influential paper on social comparison theory , extending his prior theory regarding the evaluation of attitudes in social groups to the evaluation of abilities in social groups festinger , 1954 following this , in 1957 , festinger published his theory of cognitive dissonance , arguably his most famous and influential contribution to the field of social psychology '' festinger , 1980 , p 248 he turned his attention to the visual system , focusing on human eye movement and color perception festinger , 1983 , p festinger , 1983 although seemingly the product of a disillusioned , wholesale abandonment of the field of psychology , festinger considered this research as a return to the fundamental concerns of psychology he described the goal of his new research interests as “ seeing what can be inferred from different vantage points , from different data realms , about the nature , the characteristics , of this species we call human , ” festinger , 1980 , p 106 festinger 's next and final enterprise was to understand why an idea is accepted or rejected by a culture , and he decided that examining why new technology was adopted quickly in the west but not in the eastern byzantine empire would illuminate the issue he decided not to pursue treatment , and died on february 11 , 1989 festinger , stanley schachter , and kurt back examined the choice of friends among college students living in married student housing at mit the team showed that the formation of ties was predicted by propinquity , the physical proximity between where students lived , and not just by similar tastes or beliefs as conventional wisdom assumed for example , in a two-storey apartment building , people living on the lower floor next to a stairway are functionally closer to upper-floor residents than are others living on the same lower floor festinger and his collaborators viewed these findings as evidence that friendships often develop based on passive contacts ( e.g , brief meetings made as a result of going to and from home within the student housing community ) and that such passive contacts are more likely to occur given closer physical and functional distance between people festinger , schachter , & beck , 1950 in his 1950 paper , festinger postulated that one of the major pressures to communicate arises from uniformity within a group , which in turn arises from two sources : social reality and group locomotion festinger , 1950 festinger argued that people depend on social reality to determine the subjective validity of their attitudes and opinions , and that they look to their reference group to establish social reality ; an opinion or attitude is therefore valid to the extent that it is similar to that of the reference group festinger labeled communications arising from such pressures toward uniformity as '' instrumental communication '' in that the communication is not an end in itself but a means to reduce discrepancies between the communicator and others in the group festinger 's influential social comparison theory ( 1954 ) can be viewed as an extension of his prior theory related to the reliance on social reality for evaluating attitudes and opinions to the realm of abilities starting with the premise that humans have an innate drive to accurately evaluate their opinions and abilities , festinger postulated that people will seek to evaluate their opinions and abilities by comparing them with those of others to use festinger 's example , a chess novice does not compare his chess abilities to those of recognized chess masters , festinger , 1954 , p '' festinger , 1954 , p there exists , in the human organism , a drive to evaluate his opinion and abilities to the extent that objective , nonsocial means are available , people evaluate their opinions and abilities by comparison respectively with the opinions and abilities of others the tendency to compare oneself with some other specific person decreases as the difference between his opinion or ability and one 's own increases there are nonsocial restraints which make it difficult or even impossible to change one 's ability festinger and his collaborators , henry riecken and stanley schachter , examined conditions under which disconfirmation of beliefs leads to increased conviction in such beliefs in the 1956 book when prophecy fails many of the group members quit their jobs and disposed of their possessions in preparation for the apocalypse 169 that the group members had spread the belief must be held with deep conviction and be relevant to the believer 's actions or behavior the belief must have produced actions that are arguably difficult to undo the belief must be sufficiently specific and concerned with the real world such that it can be clearly disconfirmed festinger , riecken , & schachter , 1956 , p 4 festinger also later described the increased conviction and proselytizing by cult members after disconfirmation as a specific instantiation of cognitive dissonance ( i.e , increased proselytizing reduced dissonance by producing the knowledge that others also accepted their beliefs ) and its application to understanding complex , mass phenomena festinger 's seminal 1957 work integrated existing research literature on influence and social communication under his theory of cognitive dissonance among people who felt the shock but sustained no damage from the earthquake , rumors were widely circulated and accepted about even worse disasters to come '' festinger , 1957 , p 236–239 the rumors functioned to reduce the inconsistency of people 's feelings of fear despite not directly experiencing the effects of the earthquake by giving people a reason to be fearful festinger described the basic hypotheses of cognitive dissonance as follows : :1 the existence of dissonance or inconsistency , being psychologically uncomfortable , will motivate the person to try to reduce the dissonance and achieve consonance or consistency when dissonance is present , in addition to trying to reduce it , the person will actively avoid situations and information which would likely increase the dissonance festinger , 1957 , p 6 or selectively acquiring new information or opinions to use festinger 's example of a smoker who has knowledge that smoking is bad for his health , the smoker may reduce dissonance by choosing to quit smoking , by changing his thoughts about the effects of smoking ( e.g as predicted by festinger and carlsmith , those paid 1 reported the task to be more enjoyable than those paid 20 those paid 1 were forced to reduce dissonance by changing their opinions of the task to produce consonance with their behavior of reporting that the task was enjoyable the subjects paid 20 experienced less dissonance , as the large payment provided consonance with their behavior ; they therefore rated the task as less enjoyable and their ratings were similar to those who were not asked to perform the dissonance-causing favor xxi '' the most important development in social psychology to date , '' as cited in aronson , 1991 , p 214 and a theory without which '' social psychology would not be what it is today 661 cognitive dissonance spawned decades of related research , from studies focused on further theoretical refinement and development greenwald & ronis , 1978 to domains as varied as decision making , the socialization of children , and color preference xiv an obituary published by the american psychologist stated that it was '' doubtful that experimental psychology would exist at all '' without festinger 661 yet it seems that festinger was wary about burdensome demands for greater empirical precision 253 he also stressed that laboratory experimentation '' can not exist by itself , '' but that '' there should be an active interrelation between laboratory experimentation and the study of real-life situations '' festinger , 1953 , p journal of abnormal and social psychology , 49 ( 4 ) , 513–522 belief perseverance cognitive dissonance elliot aronson kurt lewin propinquity social comparison theory social psychology stanley schachter the great disappointment when prophecy fails

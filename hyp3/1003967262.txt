festinger was born in brooklyn new york on may 8 , 1919 to russian-jewish immigrants alex festinger and sara solomon festinger his father , an embroidery manufacturer , had '' left russia a radical and atheist and remained faithful to these views throughout his life 99 festinger attended boys ' high school in brooklyn , and received his bs degree in psychology from the city college of new york in 1939 100 he proceeded to study under kurt lewin at the university of iowa , where festinger received his ma in 1940 and phd in 1942 in the field of child behavior american , 1959 , p 237 however , festinger continued to pursue his original interests , studying level of aspiration , festinger , 1942 working on statistics , festinger , 1943a festinger , 1943b developing a quantitative model of decision making , carlsmith & festinger , 1943 and even publishing a laboratory study on rats festinger , 1943c explaining his lack of interest in social psychology at the time , festinger stated , '' the looser methodology of the social psychology studies , and the vagueness of relation of the data to lewinian concepts and theories , all seemed unappealing to me in my youthful penchant for rigor '' festinger , 1980 , p '' festinger , a professed atheist , was an original thinker and a restless , highly motivated individual with ( in his words ) '' little tolerance for boredom '' '' franz samelson : '' festinger , leon '' , american national biography online , feb 2000 ( accessed april 28 , 2008 ) after graduating , festinger worked as a research associate at iowa from 1941 to 1943 , and then as a statistician for the committee on selection and training of aircraft pilots at the university of rochester from 1943 to 1945 during world war ii in 1943 , festinger married mary oliver ballou , a pianist , '' deaths : mary ballou festinger , '' 2006 with whom he had three children , catherine , richard , and kurt 545 festinger and ballou were later divorced , and festinger married trudy bradley , currently a professor of social work at new york university , faculty profile , n.d in 1945 , festinger joined lewin 's newly formed research center for group dynamics at the massachusetts institute of technology as an assistant professor it was at mit that festinger , in his own words , '' became , by fiat , a social psychologist , and immersed myself in the field with all its difficulties , vaguenesses , and challenges 237 it was also at mit that festinger began his foray into social communication and pressures in groups that marked a turning point in his own research sic seemed to us all to be momentous , ground breaking , the new beginning of something important '' festinger , 1980 , pp 237–238 indeed , stanley schachter , festinger 's student and research assistant at the time , states , '' i was lucky enough to work with festinger at this time , and i think of it as one of the high points of my scientific life xiii thus raising unexpected questions regarding communication within social groups and the development of group standards of attitudes and behaviors during this time , festinger published his highly influential paper on social comparison theory , extending his prior theory regarding the evaluation of attitudes in social groups to the evaluation of abilities in social groups festinger , 1957 some also view this as an extension of festinger 's prior work on group pressures toward resolving discrepancies in attitudes and abilities within social groups to how the individual resolves discrepancies at the cognitive level 103 despite such recognition , festinger left the field of social psychology in 1964 , attributing his decision to '' a conviction that had been growing in me at the time that i , personally , was in a rut and needed an injection of intellectual stimulation from new sources to continue to be productive '' festinger , 1980 , p 248 he turned his attention to the visual system , focusing on human eye movement and color perception in 1968 , festinger returned to his native new york city , continuing his perception research at the new school , then known as the new school for social research '' festinger , 1983 , p festinger , 1983 although seemingly the product of a disillusioned , wholesale abandonment of the field of psychology , festinger considered this research as a return to the fundamental concerns of psychology 253 and felt bemused when fellow psychologists asked him how his new research interests were related to psychology 106 festinger 's next and final enterprise was to understand why an idea is accepted or rejected by a culture , and he decided that examining why new technology was adopted quickly in the west but not in the eastern byzantine empire would illuminate the issue festinger , stanley schachter , and kurt back examined the choice of friends among college students living in married student housing at mit the team showed that the formation of ties was predicted by propinquity , the physical proximity between where students lived , and not just by similar tastes or beliefs as conventional wisdom assumed they also found that functional distance predicted social ties as well in his 1950 paper , festinger postulated that one of the major pressures to communicate arises from uniformity within a group , which in turn arises from two sources : social reality and group locomotion festinger labeled communications arising from such pressures toward uniformity as '' instrumental communication '' in that the communication is not an end in itself but a means to reduce discrepancies between the communicator and others in the group festinger , 1950 , p they will likewise take action to reduce discrepancies in abilities , for which there is an upward drive to improve one 's abilities '' festinger , 1954 , p in his 1954 paper , festinger again systematically set forth a series of hypotheses , corollaries , and derivations , and he cited existing experimental evidence where available to the extent that objective , nonsocial means are available , people evaluate their opinions and abilities by comparison respectively with the opinions and abilities of others there is a unidirectional drive upward in the case of abilities which is largely absent in opinions if persons who are very divergent from one 's own opinion or ability are perceived as different from oneself on attributes consistent with the divergence , the tendency to narrow the range of comparability becomes stronger when there is a range of opinion or ability in a group , the relative strength of the three manifestations of pressures toward uniformity will be different for those who are close to the mode of the group than those who are distant from the mode festinger and his collaborators , henry riecken and stanley schachter , examined conditions under which disconfirmation of beliefs leads to increased conviction in such beliefs in the 1956 book when prophecy fails the group studied a small apocalyptic cult led by dorothy martin ( under the pseudonym marian keech in the book ) , a suburban housewife the team observed the group firsthand for months before and after the predicted apocalypse many of the group members quit their jobs and disposed of their possessions in preparation for the apocalypse when doomsday came and went , martin claimed that the world had been spared because of the '' force of good and light '' festinger , riecken , & schachter , 1956 , p rather than abandoning their discredited beliefs , group members adhered to them even more strongly and began proselytizing with fervor the belief must have produced actions that are arguably difficult to undo festinger , riecken , & schachter , 1956 , p 4 festinger also later described the increased conviction and proselytizing by cult members after disconfirmation as a specific instantiation of cognitive dissonance ( i.e , increased proselytizing reduced dissonance by producing the knowledge that others also accepted their beliefs ) and its application to understanding complex , mass phenomena festinger , 1957 the theory was motivated by a study of rumors immediately following a severe earthquake in india in 1934 the existence of dissonance or inconsistency , being psychologically uncomfortable , will motivate the person to try to reduce the dissonance and achieve consonance or consistency festinger , 1957 , p festinger , 1957 , p carlsmith published their classic cognitive dissonance experiment in 1959 festinger & carlsmith , 1959 in the experiment , subjects were asked to perform an hour of boring and monotonous tasks ( i.e as predicted by festinger and carlsmith , those paid 1 reported the task to be more enjoyable than those paid 20 those paid 1 were forced to reduce dissonance by changing their opinions of the task to produce consonance with their behavior of reporting that the task was enjoyable 215 cognitive dissonance has been variously described as '' social psychology 's most notable achievement , '' zukier , 1989 , p 214 and a theory without which '' social psychology would not be what it is today 661 cognitive dissonance spawned decades of related research , from studies focused on further theoretical refinement and development greenwald & ronis , 1978 to domains as varied as decision making , the socialization of children , and color preference 11 in addition , festinger is credited with the ascendancy of laboratory experimentation in social psychology as one who '' converted the experiment into a powerful scientific instrument with a central role in the search for knowledge 661 yet it seems that festinger was wary about burdensome demands for greater empirical precision festinger & carlsmith , 1959 with festinger 's theories and the research that they generated , '' the monolithic grip that reinforcement theory had held on social psychology was effectively and permanently broken

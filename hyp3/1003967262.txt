festinger was born in brooklyn new york on may 8 , 1919 to russian-jewish immigrants alex festinger and sara solomon festinger his father , an embroidery manufacturer , had '' left russia a radical and atheist and remained faithful to these views throughout his life 99 festinger attended boys ' high school in brooklyn , and received his bs degree in psychology from the city college of new york in 1939 100 he proceeded to study under kurt lewin at the university of iowa , where festinger received his ma in 1940 and phd in 1942 in the field of child behavior festinger , 1980 , p 237 however , festinger continued to pursue his original interests , studying level of aspiration , festinger , 1942 working on statistics , festinger , 1943a festinger , 1943b developing a quantitative model of decision making , carlsmith & festinger , 1943 and even publishing a laboratory study on rats festinger , 1943c explaining his lack of interest in social psychology at the time , festinger stated , '' the looser methodology of the social psychology studies , and the vagueness of relation of the data to lewinian concepts and theories , all seemed unappealing to me in my youthful penchant for rigor '' festinger , 1980 , p '' franz samelson : '' festinger , leon '' , american national biography online , feb 545 festinger and ballou were later divorced , and festinger married trudy bradley , currently a professor of social work at new york university , faculty profile , n.d in 1945 , festinger joined lewin 's newly formed research center for group dynamics at the massachusetts institute of technology as an assistant professor 237 it was also at mit that festinger began his foray into social communication and pressures in groups that marked a turning point in his own research sic seemed to us all to be momentous , ground breaking , the new beginning of something important '' festinger , 1980 , pp 237–238 indeed , stanley schachter , festinger 's student and research assistant at the time , states , '' i was lucky enough to work with festinger at this time , and i think of it as one of the high points of my scientific life 101 while festinger was conducting a study on the impact of architectural and ecological factors on student housing satisfaction for the university festinger , 1950 after lewin 's death in 1947 , festinger moved with the research center to the university of michigan in 1948 he then moved to the university of minnesota in 1951 , and then on to stanford university in 1955 during this time , festinger published his highly influential paper on social comparison theory , extending his prior theory regarding the evaluation of attitudes in social groups to the evaluation of abilities in social groups festinger , 1954 following this , in 1957 , festinger published his theory of cognitive dissonance , arguably his most famous and influential contribution to the field of social psychology festinger , 1957 some also view this as an extension of festinger 's prior work on group pressures toward resolving discrepancies in attitudes and abilities within social groups to how the individual resolves discrepancies at the cognitive level '' festinger , 1980 , p in 1968 , festinger returned to his native new york city , continuing his perception research at the new school , then known as the new school for social research 91–92 his efforts eventually culminated in the book , the human legacy , which examined how humans evolved and developed complex societies he described the goal of his new research interests as “ seeing what can be inferred from different vantage points , from different data realms , about the nature , the characteristics , of this species we call human , ” festinger , 1980 , p 92 however , festinger was diagnosed with cancer before he was able to publish this material he decided not to pursue treatment , and died on february 11 , 1989 festinger , stanley schachter , and kurt back examined the choice of friends among college students living in married student housing at mit the team showed that the formation of ties was predicted by propinquity , the physical proximity between where students lived , and not just by similar tastes or beliefs as conventional wisdom assumed the lower-floor residents near the stairs are more likely than their lower-floor neighbors to befriend those living on the upper floor in his 1950 paper , festinger postulated that one of the major pressures to communicate arises from uniformity within a group , which in turn arises from two sources : social reality and group locomotion festinger , 1950 festinger argued that people depend on social reality to determine the subjective validity of their attitudes and opinions , and that they look to their reference group to establish social reality ; an opinion or attitude is therefore valid to the extent that it is similar to that of the reference group festinger 's influential social comparison theory ( 1954 ) can be viewed as an extension of his prior theory related to the reliance on social reality for evaluating attitudes and opinions to the realm of abilities starting with the premise that humans have an innate drive to accurately evaluate their opinions and abilities , festinger postulated that people will seek to evaluate their opinions and abilities by comparing them with those of others to use festinger 's example , a chess novice does not compare his chess abilities to those of recognized chess masters , festinger , 1954 , p thus festinger suggested that the '' social influence processes and some kinds of competitive behavior are both manifestations of the same socio-psychological process.namely , the drive for self evaluation and the necessity for such evaluation being based on comparison with other persons '' festinger , 1954 , p he stated his main set of hypotheses as follows : :1 there exists , in the human organism , a drive to evaluate his opinion and abilities the tendency to compare oneself with some other specific person decreases as the difference between his opinion or ability and one 's own increases there is a unidirectional drive upward in the case of abilities which is largely absent in opinions there are nonsocial restraints which make it difficult or even impossible to change one 's ability these nonsocial restraints are largely absent for opinions the cessation of comparison with others is accompanied by hostility or derogation to the extent that continued comparison with those persons implies unpleasant consequences if persons who are very divergent from one 's own opinion or ability are perceived as different from oneself on attributes consistent with the divergence , the tendency to narrow the range of comparability becomes stronger when there is a range of opinion or ability in a group , the relative strength of the three manifestations of pressures toward uniformity will be different for those who are close to the mode of the group than those who are distant from the mode festinger and his collaborators , henry riecken and stanley schachter , examined conditions under which disconfirmation of beliefs leads to increased conviction in such beliefs in the 1956 book when prophecy fails ' the messages purportedly said that a flood spreading to form an inland sea stretching from the arctic circle to the gulf of mexico would destroy the world on december 21 , 1954 the team observed the group firsthand for months before and after the predicted apocalypse many of the group members quit their jobs and disposed of their possessions in preparation for the apocalypse when doomsday came and went , martin claimed that the world had been spared because of the '' force of good and light '' festinger , riecken , & schachter , 1956 , p rather than abandoning their discredited beliefs , group members adhered to them even more strongly and began proselytizing with fervor festinger and his co-authors concluded that the following conditions lead to increased conviction in beliefs following disconfirmation : :1 the believer must have social support from other believers 4 festinger also later described the increased conviction and proselytizing by cult members after disconfirmation as a specific instantiation of cognitive dissonance ( i.e festinger 's seminal 1957 work integrated existing research literature on influence and social communication under his theory of cognitive dissonance festinger , 1957 the theory was motivated by a study of rumors immediately following a severe earthquake in india in 1934 although seemingly counter-intuitive that people would choose to believe '' fear-provoking '' rumors , festinger reasoned that these rumors were actually '' fear-justifying '' festinger , 1957 , p festinger described the basic hypotheses of cognitive dissonance as follows : :1 the existence of dissonance or inconsistency , being psychologically uncomfortable , will motivate the person to try to reduce the dissonance and achieve consonance or consistency when dissonance is present , in addition to trying to reduce it , the person will actively avoid situations and information which would likely increase the dissonance to use festinger 's example of a smoker who has knowledge that smoking is bad for his health , the smoker may reduce dissonance by choosing to quit smoking , by changing his thoughts about the effects of smoking ( e.g carlsmith published their classic cognitive dissonance experiment in 1959 some subjects , who were led to believe that their participation in the experiment had concluded , were then asked to perform a favor for the experimenter by telling the next participant , who was actually a confederate , that the task was extremely enjoyable those paid 1 were forced to reduce dissonance by changing their opinions of the task to produce consonance with their behavior of reporting that the task was enjoyable the subjects paid 20 experienced less dissonance , as the large payment provided consonance with their behavior ; they therefore rated the task as less enjoyable and their ratings were similar to those who were not asked to perform the dissonance-causing favor social comparison theory and cognitive dissonance have been described by other psychologists as '' the two most fruitful theories in social psychology xxi '' the most important development in social psychology to date , '' as cited in aronson , 1991 , p 214 and a theory without which '' social psychology would not be what it is today cognitive consequences of

schwann cells are a variety of glial cells that keep peripheral nerve fibres ( both myelinated and unmyelinated ) alive in myelinated axons , schwann cells form the myelin sheath individual myelinating schwann cells cover about 100 μm of an axon—equating to about 10,000 schwann cells along a 1-m length of the axon st8sia1 ganglioside is an acetylated glycolipid which is found in the cell membranes of many types of vertebrate cells during peripheral nerve regeneration , 9-o-acetyl gd3 is expressed by schwann cells however , unlike oligodendrocytes , each myelinating schwann cell provides insulation to only one axon ( see image ) myelinating schwann cells begin to form the myelin sheath in mammals during fetal development and work by spiraling around the axon , sometimes with as many as 100 revolutions schwann cells are known for their roles in supporting nerve regeneration nerves in the pns consist of many axons myelinated by schwann cells if damage occurs to a nerve , the schwann cells aid in digestion of its axons ( phagocytosis ) following this process , the schwann cells can guide regeneration by forming a type of tunnel that leads toward the target neurons this tunnel is known as band of büngner , a guidance track for the regenerating axons , which behaves like an endoneural tube schwann cells are essential for the maintenance of healthy axons several important transcription factors are also expressed and involved at various stages in development changing the features on the schwann cells from an immature to mature state

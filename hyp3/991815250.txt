schwann cells are a variety of glial cells that keep peripheral nerve fibres ( both myelinated and unmyelinated ) alive in myelinated axons , schwann cells form the myelin sheath individual myelinating schwann cells cover about 100 μm of an axon—equating to about 10,000 schwann cells along a 1-m length of the axon the gaps between adjacent schwann cells are called nodes of ranvier during peripheral nerve regeneration , 9-o-acetyl gd3 is expressed by schwann cells the vertebrate nervous system relies on the myelin sheath for insulation and as a method of decreasing membrane capacitance in the axon the action potential jumps from node to node , in a process called saltatory conduction , which can increase conduction velocity up to 10 times , without an increase in axonal diameter in this sense , schwann cells are the pns 's analogues of the central nervous system 's oligodendrocytes however , unlike oligodendrocytes , each myelinating schwann cell provides insulation to only one axon ( see image ) this arrangement permits saltatory conduction of action potentials with repropagation at the nodes of ranvier some group around smaller axons ( external image here ) and form remak bundles myelinating schwann cells begin to form the myelin sheath in mammals during fetal development and work by spiraling around the axon , sometimes with as many as 100 revolutions schwann cells are known for their roles in supporting nerve regeneration nerves in the pns consist of many axons myelinated by schwann cells

schwann cells are a variety of glial cells that keep peripheral nerve fibres ( both myelinated and unmyelinated ) alive in myelinated axons , schwann cells form the myelin sheath individual myelinating schwann cells cover about 100 μm of an axon—equating to about 10,000 schwann cells along a 1-m length of the axon during peripheral nerve regeneration , 9-o-acetyl gd3 is expressed by schwann cells the vertebrate nervous system relies on the myelin sheath for insulation and as a method of decreasing membrane capacitance in the axon nonmyelinating schwann cells are involved in maintenance of axons and are crucial for neuronal survival myelinating schwann cells begin to form the myelin sheath in mammals during fetal development and work by spiraling around the axon , sometimes with as many as 100 revolutions a well-developed schwann cell is shaped like a rolled-up sheet of paper , with layers of myelin between each coil schwann cells are known for their roles in supporting nerve regeneration nerves in the pns consist of many axons myelinated by schwann cells following this process , the schwann cells can guide regeneration by forming a type of tunnel that leads toward the target neurons if schwann cells are prevented from associating with axons , the axons die regenerating axons will not reach any target unless schwann cells are there to support them and guide them schwann cells are essential for the maintenance of healthy axons

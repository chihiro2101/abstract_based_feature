schwann cells are a variety of glial cells that keep peripheral nerve fibres ( both myelinated and unmyelinated ) alive in myelinated axons , schwann cells form the myelin sheath individual myelinating schwann cells cover about 100 μm of an axon—equating to about 10,000 schwann cells along a 1-m length of the axon the gaps between adjacent schwann cells are called nodes of ranvier during peripheral nerve regeneration , 9-o-acetyl gd3 is expressed by schwann cells however , unlike oligodendrocytes , each myelinating schwann cell provides insulation to only one axon ( see image ) a well-developed schwann cell is shaped like a rolled-up sheet of paper , with layers of myelin between each coil schwann cells are known for their roles in supporting nerve regeneration nerves in the pns consist of many axons myelinated by schwann cells following this process , the schwann cells can guide regeneration by forming a type of tunnel that leads toward the target neurons regenerating axons will not reach any target unless schwann cells are there to support them and guide them schwann cells are essential for the maintenance of healthy axons it is also an essential axon-derived survival factor and a mitogen for schwann cell precursors in mice that lack the transmembrane iii isoform , schwann cell precursors are eventually eliminated from spinal nerves

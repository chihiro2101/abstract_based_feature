schwann cells are a variety of glial cells that keep peripheral nerve fibres ( both myelinated and unmyelinated ) alive in myelinated axons , schwann cells form the myelin sheath individual myelinating schwann cells cover about 100 μm of an axon—equating to about 10,000 schwann cells along a 1-m length of the axon the gaps between adjacent schwann cells are called nodes of ranvier during peripheral nerve regeneration , 9-o-acetyl gd3 is expressed by schwann cells in this sense , schwann cells are the pns 's analogues of the central nervous system 's oligodendrocytes however , unlike oligodendrocytes , each myelinating schwann cell provides insulation to only one axon ( see image ) nonmyelinating schwann cells are involved in maintenance of axons and are crucial for neuronal survival nerves in the pns consist of many axons myelinated by schwann cells because of their ability to impact regeneration of axons , schwann cells have been connected to preferential motor reinnervation , as well schwann cells are essential for the maintenance of healthy axons when sox10 is inactivated in mice , satellite glia and schwann cell precursors fail to develop , though neurons are generated normally without issue it is also an essential axon-derived survival factor and a mitogen for schwann cell precursors in this way , in krox-20 double knock out mice , it has been recorded that hindbrain segmentation is affected as well as myelination of schwann cell associated axons

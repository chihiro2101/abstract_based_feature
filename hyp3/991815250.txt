schwann cells are a variety of glial cells that keep peripheral nerve fibres ( both myelinated and unmyelinated ) alive in myelinated axons , schwann cells form the myelin sheath individual myelinating schwann cells cover about 100 μm of an axon—equating to about 10,000 schwann cells along a 1-m length of the axon during peripheral nerve regeneration , 9-o-acetyl gd3 is expressed by schwann cells in this sense , schwann cells are the pns 's analogues of the central nervous system 's oligodendrocytes however , unlike oligodendrocytes , each myelinating schwann cell provides insulation to only one axon ( see image ) nonmyelinating schwann cells are involved in maintenance of axons and are crucial for neuronal survival myelinating schwann cells begin to form the myelin sheath in mammals during fetal development and work by spiraling around the axon , sometimes with as many as 100 revolutions schwann cells are known for their roles in supporting nerve regeneration if damage occurs to a nerve , the schwann cells aid in digestion of its axons ( phagocytosis ) following this process , the schwann cells can guide regeneration by forming a type of tunnel that leads toward the target neurons if schwann cells are prevented from associating with axons , the axons die during embryonic development , nrg1 inhibits the formation of neurons from neural crest cells , instead contributing to neural crest cells being led down a path to gliogenesis it is also an essential axon-derived survival factor and a mitogen for schwann cell precursors

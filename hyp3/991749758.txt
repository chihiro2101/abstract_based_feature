some chaperone systems work as foldase : they support the folding of proteins in an atp-dependent manner ( for example , the groel/groes or the dnak/dnaj/grpe system ) although most newly synthesized proteins can fold in absence of chaperones , a minority strictly requires them for the same other chaperones work as holdase : they bind folding intermediates to prevent their aggregation , for example dnaj or hsp33 some chaperones can assist in protein degradation , leading proteins to protease systems , such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system in eukaryotes many chaperones are heat shock proteins , that is , proteins expressed in response to elevated temperatures or other cellular stresses the crowded environment of the cytosol can accelerate the folding process , since a compact folded protein will occupy less volume than an unfolded protein chain however , crowding can reduce the yield of correctly folded protein by increasing protein aggregation crowding may also increase the effectiveness of the chaperone proteins such as groel , which could counteract this reduction in folding efficiency other types of chaperones are involved in transport across membranes , for example membranes of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) in eukaryotes in the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) there are general , lectin- and non-classical molecular chaperones helping to fold proteins the prefix '' hsp '' designates that the protein is a heat shock protein the hsp70 proteins are aided by hsp40 proteins ( dnaj in e hsp70 also acts as a mitochondrial and chloroplastic molecular chaperone in eukaryotes heat shock protein 90 ( hsp90 ) is a molecular chaperone essential for activating many signaling proteins in the eukaryotic cell these proteins are thought to function as chaperones by processively threading client proteins through a small 20 Ã¥ ( 2 nm ) pore , thereby giving each client protein a second chance to fold 1998 ; 63 ( 4 ) :399-406 chaperone gp40 participates in the assembly of gp20 , thus aiding in the formation of the connector complex that initiates head procapsid assembly doi:10.1016/j.virol.2020.01.008 during overall tail assembly , chaperone proteins gp26 and gp51 are necessary for baseplate hub assembly the chaperone protein gp38 is also required for the proper folding of gp37 doi:10.1007/s12551-017-0348-5 chaperone proteins gp63 and gpwac are employed in attachment of the long tail fibers to the tail baseplate

some chaperone systems work as foldase : they support the folding of proteins in an atp-dependent manner ( for example , the groel/groes or the dnak/dnaj/grpe system ) although most newly synthesized proteins can fold in absence of chaperones , a minority strictly requires them for the same other chaperones work as holdase : they bind folding intermediates to prevent their aggregation , for example dnaj or hsp33 chaperones can also work as disaggregases , i.e some chaperones can assist in protein degradation , leading proteins to protease systems , such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system in eukaryotes many chaperones are heat shock proteins , that is , proteins expressed in response to elevated temperatures or other cellular stresses the reason for this behaviour is that protein folding is severely affected by heat and , therefore , some chaperones act to prevent or correct damage caused by misfolding however , crowding can reduce the yield of correctly folded protein by increasing protein aggregation crowding may also increase the effectiveness of the chaperone proteins such as groel , which could counteract this reduction in folding efficiency more information on the various types and mechanisms of a subset of chaperones that encapsulate their folding substrates ( e.g chaperones are found in , for example , the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) , since protein synthesis often occurs in this area in the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) there are general , lectin- and non-classical molecular chaperones helping to fold proteins for this reason , the term '' heat shock protein '' has historically been used to name these chaperones the hsp70 proteins are aided by hsp40 proteins ( dnaj in e heat shock protein 90 ( hsp90 ) is a molecular chaperone essential for activating many signaling proteins in the eukaryotic cell these gps were gp26 , gp31 , gp38 , gp51 , gp28 , and gp4 gene 4 is synonomous with genes 50 and 65 , and thus the gp can be designated gp4 ( 50 ) ( 65 ) doi:10.1016/j.virol.2020.01.008 during overall tail assembly , chaperone proteins gp26 and gp51 are necessary for baseplate hub assembly synthesis of the long tail fibers depends on the chaperone protein gp57a that is needed for the trimerization of gp34 and gp37 , the major structural proteins of the tail fibers the term '' molecular chaperone '' appeared first in the literature in 1978 , and was invented by ron laskey to describe the ability of a nuclear protein called nucleoplasmin to prevent the aggregation of folded histone proteins with dna during the assembly of nucleosomes

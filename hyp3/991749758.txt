some chaperone systems work as foldase : they support the folding of proteins in an atp-dependent manner ( for example , the groel/groes or the dnak/dnaj/grpe system ) although most newly synthesized proteins can fold in absence of chaperones , a minority strictly requires them for the same other chaperones work as holdase : they bind folding intermediates to prevent their aggregation , for example dnaj or hsp33 some chaperones can assist in protein degradation , leading proteins to protease systems , such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system in eukaryotes many chaperones are heat shock proteins , that is , proteins expressed in response to elevated temperatures or other cellular stresses the reason for this behaviour is that protein folding is severely affected by heat and , therefore , some chaperones act to prevent or correct damage caused by misfolding the crowded environment of the cytosol can accelerate the folding process , since a compact folded protein will occupy less volume than an unfolded protein chain however , crowding can reduce the yield of correctly folded protein by increasing protein aggregation crowding may also increase the effectiveness of the chaperone proteins such as groel , which could counteract this reduction in folding efficiency chaperones are found in , for example , the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) , since protein synthesis often occurs in this area nomenclature and examples of bacterial and archaeal chaperones there are many different families of chaperones ; each family acts to aid protein folding in a different way for this reason , the term '' heat shock protein '' has historically been used to name these chaperones the prefix '' hsp '' designates that the protein is a heat shock protein hsp70 also acts as a mitochondrial and chloroplastic molecular chaperone in eukaryotes heat shock protein 90 ( hsp90 ) is a molecular chaperone essential for activating many signaling proteins in the eukaryotic cell doi:10.1016/j.virol.2020.01.008 during overall tail assembly , chaperone proteins gp26 and gp51 are necessary for baseplate hub assembly the chaperone protein gp38 is also required for the proper folding of gp37 john ellis in 1987 to describe proteins that mediated the post-translational assembly of protein complexes

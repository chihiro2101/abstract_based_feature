some chaperone systems work as foldase : they support the folding of proteins in an atp-dependent manner ( for example , the groel/groes or the dnak/dnaj/grpe system ) although most newly synthesized proteins can fold in absence of chaperones , a minority strictly requires them for the same other chaperones work as holdase : they bind folding intermediates to prevent their aggregation , for example dnaj or hsp33 chaperones can also work as disaggregases , i.e some chaperones can assist in protein degradation , leading proteins to protease systems , such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system in eukaryotes many chaperones are heat shock proteins , that is , proteins expressed in response to elevated temperatures or other cellular stresses the reason for this behaviour is that protein folding is severely affected by heat and , therefore , some chaperones act to prevent or correct damage caused by misfolding the crowded environment of the cytosol can accelerate the folding process , since a compact folded protein will occupy less volume than an unfolded protein chain however , crowding can reduce the yield of correctly folded protein by increasing protein aggregation chaperones are found in , for example , the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) , since protein synthesis often occurs in this area in the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) there are general , lectin- and non-classical molecular chaperones helping to fold proteins nomenclature and examples of bacterial and archaeal chaperones there are many different families of chaperones ; each family acts to aid protein folding in a different way coli , many of these proteins are highly expressed under conditions of high stress , for example , when the bacterium is placed in high temperatures for this reason , the term '' heat shock protein '' has historically been used to name these chaperones the prefix '' hsp '' designates that the protein is a heat shock protein chaperones in bacteriophage t4 assembly the chaperone protein gp38 is also required for the proper folding of gp37 john ellis in 1987 to describe proteins that mediated the post-translational assembly of protein complexes

thumb the geforce 2 architecture is similar to the previous geforce 256 line but with various improvements some say the second tmu was there in the original geforce nsr ( nvidia shading rasterizer ) but dual-texturing was disabled due to a hardware bug ; nsr 's unique ability to do single-cycle trilinear texture filtering supports this suggestion in opengl games ( such as quake iii ) , the card outperforms the radeon r100 and 3dfx voodoo 5 cards in both 16 bpp and 32 bpp display modes the geforce 2 architecture is quite memory bandwidth constrained the later nv17 revision of the nv11 design , used for the geforce 4 mx , was more efficient the first models to arrive after the original geforce 2 gts was the geforce 2 ultra and geforce2 mx , launched on september 7 , 2000 the geforce 2 pro , introduced shortly after the ultra , was an alternative to the expensive top-line ultra and is faster than the gts the mx series also provided dual-display support , something not found in the regular geforce 256 and geforce 2 nvidia has ceased driver support for geforce 2 series , ending with gts , pro , ti and ultra models in 2005 and then with mx models in 2007 geforce 2 gts , geforce 2 pro , geforce 2 ti and geforce 2 ultra : windows 9x & windows me : 71.84 released on march 11 , 2005 ; download ; : product support list windows 95/98/me â€“ 71.84

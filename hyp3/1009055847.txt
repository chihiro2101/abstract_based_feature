thumb the geforce 2 architecture is similar to the previous geforce 256 line but with various improvements compared to the 220 nm geforce 256 , geforce 2 is built on a 180 & nbsp ; nm manufacturing process , making the silicon more dense and allowing for more transistors and a higher clock speed the geforce 2 also formally introduces the nsr ( nvidia shading rasterizer ) , a primitive type of programmable pixel pipeline that is somewhat similar to later pixel shaders in opengl games ( such as quake iii ) , the card outperforms the radeon r100 and 3dfx voodoo 5 cards in both 16 bpp and 32 bpp display modes the first models to arrive after the original geforce 2 gts was the geforce 2 ultra and geforce2 mx , launched on september 7 , 2000 this mid-range geforce 2 release was replaced by the geforce 4 mx series as the budget/performance choice in january 2002 the mx series also provided dual-display support , something not found in the regular geforce 256 and geforce 2 however , the radeon sdr lacked multi-monitor support and debuted at a considerable higher price point than the geforce 2 mx later , the entire geforce 2 line was replaced with the geforce 4 mx geforce 2 gts , geforce 2 pro , geforce 2 ti and geforce 2 ultra : windows 9x & windows me : 71.84 released on march 11 , 2005 ; download ; : product support list windows 95/98/me â€“ 71.84

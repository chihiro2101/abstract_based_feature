thumb the geforce 2 architecture is similar to the previous geforce 256 line but with various improvements compared to the 220 nm geforce 256 , geforce 2 is built on a 180 & nbsp ; nm manufacturing process , making the silicon more dense and allowing for more transistors and a higher clock speed because of the inefficient nature of the geforce 2 gpus , they could not approach their theoretical performance potential and the radeon , even with its significantly less powerful 3d architecture , offered strong competition the later nv17 revision of the nv11 design , used for the geforce 4 mx , was more efficient the first models to arrive after the original geforce 2 gts was the geforce 2 ultra and geforce2 mx , launched on september 7 , 2000 faster than the gts and pro but slower than the ultra , the geforce 2 ti performed competitively against the radeon r100 , although the 7500 had the advantage of dual-display support in order to create a better low-end option , nvidia created the geforce 2 mx series , which offered a set of standard features , specific to the entire geforce 2 generation , limited only by categorical tier however , the radeon sdr lacked multi-monitor support and debuted at a considerable higher price point than the geforce 2 mx later , the entire geforce 2 line was replaced with the geforce 4 mx geforce 2 gts , geforce 2 pro , geforce 2 ti and geforce 2 ultra : windows 9x & windows me : 71.84 released on march 11 , 2005 ; download ; : product support list windows 95/98/me â€“ 71.84

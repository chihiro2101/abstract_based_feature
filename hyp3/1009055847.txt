thumb the geforce 2 architecture is similar to the previous geforce 256 line but with various improvements compared to the 220 nm geforce 256 , geforce 2 is built on a 180 & nbsp ; nm manufacturing process , making the silicon more dense and allowing for more transistors and a higher clock speed this doubles the texture fillrate per clock compared to the previous generation and is the reasoning behind the geforce 2 gts 's naming suffix : gigatexel shader ( gts ) the geforce 2 also formally introduces the nsr ( nvidia shading rasterizer ) , a primitive type of programmable pixel pipeline that is somewhat similar to later pixel shaders because of the inefficient nature of the geforce 2 gpus , they could not approach their theoretical performance potential and the radeon , even with its significantly less powerful 3d architecture , offered strong competition the first models to arrive after the original geforce 2 gts was the geforce 2 ultra and geforce2 mx , launched on september 7 , 2000 however , the ultra loses its lead when anti-aliasing is enabled , because of the geforce 3 's new memory bandwidth/fillrate efficiency mechanisms ; plus the geforce 3 has a superior next-generation feature set with programmable vertex and pixel shaders for directx 8.0 games on their 2001 product web page , nvidia initially placed the ultra as a separate offering from the rest of the geforce 2 lineup ( gts , pro , ti ) , however by late 2002 with the geforce 2 considered a discontinued product line , the ultra was included along the gts , pro , and ti in the geforce 2 information page the non-mx geforce 2 line was reduced in price and saw the addition of the geforce 2 ti , in order to offer a mid-range alternative to the high-end geforce 3 product geforce 2 gts , geforce 2 pro , geforce 2 ti and geforce 2 ultra : windows 9x & windows me : 71.84 released on march 11 , 2005 ; download ; : product support list windows 95/98/me â€“ 71.84

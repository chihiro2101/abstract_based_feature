thumb the geforce 2 architecture is similar to the previous geforce 256 line but with various improvements the geforce 2 also formally introduces the nsr ( nvidia shading rasterizer ) , a primitive type of programmable pixel pipeline that is somewhat similar to later pixel shaders the first models to arrive after the original geforce 2 gts was the geforce 2 ultra and geforce2 mx , launched on september 7 , 2000 the ultra model actually outperforms the first geforce 3 products in some cases , due to initial geforce 3 cards having significantly lower fillrate faster than the gts and pro but slower than the ultra , the geforce 2 ti performed competitively against the radeon r100 , although the 7500 had the advantage of dual-display support the mx series also provided dual-display support , something not found in the regular geforce 256 and geforce 2 the successor to the geforce 2 ( non-mx ) line is the geforce 3 the non-mx geforce 2 line was reduced in price and saw the addition of the geforce 2 ti , in order to offer a mid-range alternative to the high-end geforce 3 product geforce 2 gts , geforce 2 pro , geforce 2 ti and geforce 2 ultra : windows 9x & windows me : 71.84 released on march 11 , 2005 ; download ; : product support list windows 95/98/me – 71.84 linux 32-bit : 71.86.15 released on august 17 , 2011 ; download ; geforce 2 mx & mx x00 series : windows 9x & windows me : 81.98 released on december 21 , 2005 ; download ; : product support list windows 95/98/me – 81.98

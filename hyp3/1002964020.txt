also in ex- situ conservation , all of which house whole , protected specimens for breeding and reintroduction into the wild when necessary and possible these facilities provide not only housing and care for specimens of endangered species , but also have an educational value they inform the public of the threatened status of endangered species and of those factors which cause the threat , with the hope of creating public interest in stopping and reversing those factors which jeopardize a species ' survival in the first place cryopreservation is also used for the conservation of livestock genetics through cryoconservation of animal genetic resources an extensive open-air planting used maintain genetic diversity of wild , agricultural , or forestry species field gene banks may also be used grow and select progeny of species stored by other ex situ techniques image : liquid nitrogen tank.jpg thumb 150px a tank of liquid nitrogen , used to supply a cryogenic freezer ( for storing laboratory samples at a temperature of about −150 °c ) endangered animal species and breeds are preserved using similar techniques a potential technique for aiding in reproduction of endangered species is interspecific pregnancy , implanting embryos of an endangered species into the womb of a female of a related species , carrying it to term captive populations are subject to problems such as inbreeding depression , loss of genetic diversity and adaptations to captivity it is important to manage captive populations in a way that minimizes these issues so that the individuals to be introduced will resemble the original founders as closely as possible , which will increase the chances of successful reintroductions once the target population size is reached , the focus shifts to maintaining the population and avoiding genetic issues within the captive population managing populations based on minimizing mean kinship values is often an effective way to increase genetic diversity and to avoid inbreeding within captive populations maximizing the captive population size and the effective population size can decrease the loss of genetic diversity by minimizing the random loss of alleles due to genetic drift genetic disorders are often an issue within captive populations due to the fact that the populations are usually established from a small number of founders further inbreeding within the captive population may also increase the likelihood that deleterious alleles will be expressed due to increasing zygosity within the population preventing certain individuals from the breeding also reduces the effective population size , which is associated with problems such as the loss of genetic diversity and increased inbreeding it is to be used as a last resort , or as a supplement to in situ conservation because it can not recreate the habitat as a whole : the entire genetic variation of a species , its symbiosis counterparts , or those elements which , over time , might help a species adapt to its changing surroundings these factors , combined with the specific environmental needs of many species , some of which are nearly impossible to recreate by man , make ex situ conservation impossible for a great number of the world 's endangered flora and fauna

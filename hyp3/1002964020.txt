also in ex- situ conservation , all of which house whole , protected specimens for breeding and reintroduction into the wild when necessary and possible these facilities provide not only housing and care for specimens of endangered species , but also have an educational value they inform the public of the threatened status of endangered species and of those factors which cause the threat , with the hope of creating public interest in stopping and reversing those factors which jeopardize a species ' survival in the first place they are the most publicly visited ex-situ conservation sites , with the wzcs ( world zoo conservation strategy ) estimating that the 1100 organized zoos in the world receive more than 600 million visitors annually similarly there are approximately 2,000 botanical gardens in 148 counties cultivating or storing an estimated 80,000 taxa of plants this method can be used for virtually indefinite storage of material without deterioration over a much greater time-period relative to all other methods of ex situ conservation cryopreservation is also used for the conservation of livestock genetics through cryoconservation of animal genetic resources an extensive open-air planting used maintain genetic diversity of wild , agricultural , or forestry species field gene banks may also be used grow and select progeny of species stored by other ex situ techniques plants under horticulture care in a constructed landscape , typically a botanic garden or arboreta this technique is similar to a field gene bank in that plants are maintained in the ambient environment , but the collections are typically not as genetically diverse or extensive species that can not be conserved by other ex situ techniques are often included in cultivated collections plants are under horticulture care , but the environment is managed to near natural conditions animal species can be preserved in genebanks , which consist of cryogenic facilities used to store living sperm , ovum , or embryos a potential technique for aiding in reproduction of endangered species is interspecific pregnancy , implanting embryos of an endangered species into the womb of a female of a related species , carrying it to term maximizing the captive population size and the effective population size can decrease the loss of genetic diversity by minimizing the random loss of alleles due to genetic drift seeds were harvested and the species grown in ex situ facilities the downside to this is that , when re-released , the species may lack the genetic adaptations and mutations which would allow it to thrive in its ever-changing natural habitat diseases and pests foreign to the species , to which the species has no natural defense , may also cripple crops of protected plants in ex situ plantations and in animals living in ex situ breeding grounds

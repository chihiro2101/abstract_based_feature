also in ex- situ conservation , all of which house whole , protected specimens for breeding and reintroduction into the wild when necessary and possible they are the most publicly visited ex-situ conservation sites , with the wzcs ( world zoo conservation strategy ) estimating that the 1100 organized zoos in the world receive more than 600 million visitors annually this method can be used for virtually indefinite storage of material without deterioration over a much greater time-period relative to all other methods of ex situ conservation cryopreservation is also used for the conservation of livestock genetics through cryoconservation of animal genetic resources an extensive open-air planting used maintain genetic diversity of wild , agricultural , or forestry species typically species that are either difficult or impossible to conserve in seed banks are conserved in field gene banks field gene banks may also be used grow and select progeny of species stored by other ex situ techniques species that can not be conserved by other ex situ techniques are often included in cultivated collections endangered animal species and breeds are preserved using similar techniques a potential technique for aiding in reproduction of endangered species is interspecific pregnancy , implanting embryos of an endangered species into the womb of a female of a related species , carrying it to term captive populations are subject to problems such as inbreeding depression , loss of genetic diversity and adaptations to captivity the target population size is the number of individuals that are required to maintain appropriate levels of genetic diversity , which is generally considered to by 90 % of the current genetic diversity after 100 years the loss of genetic diversity due to the founder effect can be minimized by ensuring that the founder population is large enough and genetically representative of the wild population maximizing the captive population size and the effective population size can decrease the loss of genetic diversity by minimizing the random loss of alleles due to genetic drift minimizing the number of generations in captivity is another effective method for reducing the loss of genetic diversity in captive populations preventing certain individuals from the breeding also reduces the effective population size , which is associated with problems such as the loss of genetic diversity and increased inbreeding it is to be used as a last resort , or as a supplement to in situ conservation because it can not recreate the habitat as a whole : the entire genetic variation of a species , its symbiosis counterparts , or those elements which , over time , might help a species adapt to its changing surroundings diseases and pests foreign to the species , to which the species has no natural defense , may also cripple crops of protected plants in ex situ plantations and in animals living in ex situ breeding grounds the second report on the state of the world 's animal genetic resources for food and agriculture

also in ex- situ conservation , all of which house whole , protected specimens for breeding and reintroduction into the wild when necessary and possible these facilities provide not only housing and care for specimens of endangered species , but also have an educational value they inform the public of the threatened status of endangered species and of those factors which cause the threat , with the hope of creating public interest in stopping and reversing those factors which jeopardize a species ' survival in the first place this method can be used for virtually indefinite storage of material without deterioration over a much greater time-period relative to all other methods of ex situ conservation cryopreservation is also used for the conservation of livestock genetics through cryoconservation of animal genetic resources an extensive open-air planting used maintain genetic diversity of wild , agricultural , or forestry species field gene banks may also be used grow and select progeny of species stored by other ex situ techniques this technique is similar to a field gene bank in that plants are maintained in the ambient environment , but the collections are typically not as genetically diverse or extensive image : liquid nitrogen tank.jpg thumb 150px a tank of liquid nitrogen , used to supply a cryogenic freezer ( for storing laboratory samples at a temperature of about −150 °c ) endangered animal species and breeds are preserved using similar techniques animal species can be preserved in genebanks , which consist of cryogenic facilities used to store living sperm , ovum , or embryos it is important to manage captive populations in a way that minimizes these issues so that the individuals to be introduced will resemble the original founders as closely as possible , which will increase the chances of successful reintroductions during the initial growth phase , the population size is rapidly expanded until a target population size is reached minimizing the loss of genetic diversity within the captive population is an important component of ex situ conservation and is critical for successful reintroductions and the long term success of the species , since more diverse populations have higher adaptive potential this is often difficult because removing large numbers of individuals from the wild populations may further reduce the genetic diversity of a species that is already of conservation concern maximizing the captive population size and the effective population size can decrease the loss of genetic diversity by minimizing the random loss of alleles due to genetic drift minimizing the number of generations in captivity is another effective method for reducing the loss of genetic diversity in captive populations seeds were harvested and the species grown in ex situ facilities diseases and pests foreign to the species , to which the species has no natural defense , may also cripple crops of protected plants in ex situ plantations and in animals living in ex situ breeding grounds

also in ex- situ conservation , all of which house whole , protected specimens for breeding and reintroduction into the wild when necessary and possible they inform the public of the threatened status of endangered species and of those factors which cause the threat , with the hope of creating public interest in stopping and reversing those factors which jeopardize a species ' survival in the first place this method can be used for virtually indefinite storage of material without deterioration over a much greater time-period relative to all other methods of ex situ conservation cryopreservation is also used for the conservation of livestock genetics through cryoconservation of animal genetic resources an extensive open-air planting used maintain genetic diversity of wild , agricultural , or forestry species typically species that are either difficult or impossible to conserve in seed banks are conserved in field gene banks field gene banks may also be used grow and select progeny of species stored by other ex situ techniques this technique is similar to a field gene bank in that plants are maintained in the ambient environment , but the collections are typically not as genetically diverse or extensive these collections are susceptible to hybridization , artificial selection , genetic drift , and disease transmission species that can not be conserved by other ex situ techniques are often included in cultivated collections for example , the zoological society of san diego has established a '' frozen zoo '' to store such samples using cryopreservation techniques from more than 355 species , including mammals , reptiles , and birds captive populations are subject to problems such as inbreeding depression , loss of genetic diversity and adaptations to captivity the target population size is the number of individuals that are required to maintain appropriate levels of genetic diversity , which is generally considered to by 90 % of the current genetic diversity after 100 years once the target population size is reached , the focus shifts to maintaining the population and avoiding genetic issues within the captive population managing populations based on minimizing mean kinship values is often an effective way to increase genetic diversity and to avoid inbreeding within captive populations minimizing the loss of genetic diversity within the captive population is an important component of ex situ conservation and is critical for successful reintroductions and the long term success of the species , since more diverse populations have higher adaptive potential the high occurrence of genetic disorders within a captive population can threaten both the survival of the captive population and its eventual reintroduction back into the wild seeds were harvested and the species grown in ex situ facilities diseases and pests foreign to the species , to which the species has no natural defense , may also cripple crops of protected plants in ex situ plantations and in animals living in ex situ breeding grounds

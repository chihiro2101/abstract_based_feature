botanical gardens , and zoos are the most conventional methods of ex-situ conservation also in ex- situ conservation , all of which house whole , protected specimens for breeding and reintroduction into the wild when necessary and possible they inform the public of the threatened status of endangered species and of those factors which cause the threat , with the hope of creating public interest in stopping and reversing those factors which jeopardize a species ' survival in the first place additionally many private collectors or other not-for-profit groups hold animals and they engage in conservation or reintroduction efforts this method can be used for virtually indefinite storage of material without deterioration over a much greater time-period relative to all other methods of ex situ conservation cryopreservation is also used for the conservation of livestock genetics through cryoconservation of animal genetic resources taxa with recalcitrant seeds that do not tolerate desiccation are typically not held in seed banks for extended periods of time field gene banks may also be used grow and select progeny of species stored by other ex situ techniques this technique is similar to a field gene bank in that plants are maintained in the ambient environment , but the collections are typically not as genetically diverse or extensive these collections are susceptible to hybridization , artificial selection , genetic drift , and disease transmission species that can not be conserved by other ex situ techniques are often included in cultivated collections plants are under horticulture care , but the environment is managed to near natural conditions a potential technique for aiding in reproduction of endangered species is interspecific pregnancy , implanting embryos of an endangered species into the womb of a female of a related species , carrying it to term the target population size is the number of individuals that are required to maintain appropriate levels of genetic diversity , which is generally considered to by 90 % of the current genetic diversity after 100 years once the target population size is reached , the focus shifts to maintaining the population and avoiding genetic issues within the captive population this is often difficult because removing large numbers of individuals from the wild populations may further reduce the genetic diversity of a species that is already of conservation concern in this management strategy , the captive population is split into several sub-populations or fragments which are maintained separately the downside to this is that , when re-released , the species may lack the genetic adaptations and mutations which would allow it to thrive in its ever-changing natural habitat diseases and pests foreign to the species , to which the species has no natural defense , may also cripple crops of protected plants in ex situ plantations and in animals living in ex situ breeding grounds

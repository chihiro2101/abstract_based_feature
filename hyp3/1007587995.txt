he was born georgios in constantinople in c following his tutelage under the famous john chortasmenos ( '' didaskalos '' of the patriarchal school ) , manuel-mark might have then recommended him to study under his own previous master , georgios gemistus pletho ( d however , his studies under pletho are a matter of speculation and , at any rate , would have been more likely attendance at pletho 's lectures at mistra scholarius had been a teacher of philosophy before entering the service of the emperor john viii palaeologus as a theological advisor in fact , in 1437 – in anticipation of the council of ferrara-florence – the emperor formally studied nilus cabasilas 's works along with mark of ephesus and gennadius scholarius curiously , the trio also formally studied the works of john duns scotus ( d 1308 ) because of his rejection of the filioque in thomistic metaphysics , as well as scotus ' doctrine of a '' formal distinction '' between the persons and essence of god , as well as god 's attributes ( or '' energies '' ) it was for this reason that scholarius wrote an academic refutation of the first eighteen of mark of ephesus ' '' syllogistic chapters against the latins '' from this , we can surmise that scholarius was likely writing an academic exercise to inform his former master that thomas aquinas ' opinions did not constitute a universally latin approach to questions on the trinity georgios scholarius became historically important when , as judge in the civil courts under john viii ( 1425–1448 ) , he accompanied his emperor to the council of ferrara-florence , held in 1438–1439 in ferrara and florence the object of this endeavor was bringing a union between the greek and latin churches , which he supported at that time despite his initial advocacy of the union ( and berating many of the orthodox bishops for their lack of theological learnedness ) , georgios scholarius soured on union during the council , and left it early in june 1440 at the behest of his mentor mark of ephesus , who converted him completely to anti-latin orthodoxy , till his death , georgios scholarius was known ( with mark of ephesus ) as the most uncompromising enemy of the union however , he initially mitigates total condemnation of aquinas , noting that later scholastics ( like hervaeus natalis ) interpret aquinas in a more orthodox light this point marks scholarius ' increasing theological distance from aquinas , where he begins to be more theologically condemnatory of him in later works ( e.g marcus plested observes that scholarios ' '' love and esteem for thomas was to continue undimmed throughout his career '' '' although he would often accentuate the note of caution in later works gibbon , decline and fall , lxviii , note 41 after the death of john viii in 1448 , georgios entered the zeyrek mosque in constantinople under constantine xi ( 1448–1453 ) and took , according to the invariable custom , a new name : gennadius he and mark of ephesus were the leaders of the anti-latin party in 1444 , mark of ephesus on his deathbed praised gennadius 's irreconcilable attitude towards the latins and the union patrologia graeca , clx ,

wished to assure the loyalty of the greek population and above all avoid them appealing to the west for liberation , potentially sparking a new round of crusades mehmed therefore sought the most anti-western cleric he could find as a figure of unity for the greeks under turkish rule – and gennadius as leading anti-union figure was a natural choice on 1 june 1453 , just three days after the fall of the city , the new patriarch 's procession passed through the streets where mehmed received gennadius graciously and himself invested him with the signs of his office – the crosier ( dikanikion ) and mantle as was normal when a monk or lay scholar was appointed patriarch , gennadius was consecutively ordained , first as a deacon , then as a priest , then finally as a bishop before being appointed patriarch while holding the episcopal office gennadius drew up , apparently for the use of mehmed , a confession or exposition of the christian faith , which was translated into turkish by ahmed , qadi of berrhoea ( and first printed by a for the different scholars ' suggestions about the second and third terms of gennadius see the list of patriarchs of constantinople the

he was born georgios in constantinople in c for mark of ephesus ’ death , see j in fact , in 1437 – in anticipation of the council of ferrara-florence – the emperor formally studied nilus cabasilas 's works along with mark of ephesus and gennadius scholarius curiously , the trio also formally studied the works of john duns scotus ( d 1308 ) because of his rejection of the filioque in thomistic metaphysics , as well as scotus ' doctrine of a '' formal distinction '' between the persons and essence of god , as well as god 's attributes ( or '' energies '' ) it was for this reason that scholarius wrote an academic refutation of the first eighteen of mark of ephesus ' '' syllogistic chapters against the latins '' from this , we can surmise that scholarius was likely writing an academic exercise to inform his former master that thomas aquinas ' opinions did not constitute a universally latin approach to questions on the trinity georgios scholarius became historically important when , as judge in the civil courts under john viii ( 1425–1448 ) , he accompanied his emperor to the council of ferrara-florence , held in 1438–1439 in ferrara and florence the object of this endeavor was bringing a union between the greek and latin churches , which he supported at that time at the same council appeared the celebrated platonist , gemistus pletho , the most powerful opponent of the then dominant aristotelianism , and consequently an antagonist of scholarius despite his initial advocacy of the union ( and berating many of the orthodox bishops for their lack of theological learnedness ) , georgios scholarius soured on union during the council , and left it early in june 1440 at the behest of his mentor mark of ephesus , who converted him completely to anti-latin orthodoxy , till his death , georgios scholarius was known ( with mark of ephesus ) as the most uncompromising enemy of the union however , he initially mitigates total condemnation of aquinas , noting that later scholastics ( like hervaeus natalis ) interpret aquinas in a more orthodox light this point marks scholarius ' increasing theological distance from aquinas , where he begins to be more theologically condemnatory of him in later works ( e.g marcus plested observes that scholarios ' '' love and esteem for thomas was to continue undimmed throughout his career '' '' although he would often accentuate the note of caution in later works 128,129 despite his cautions , scholarios writes of thomas '' we love this divinely-inspired and wise man before the fall of the city he was already well known as a bitter opponent of the union patrologia graeca , clx , 529 it was to gennadius that the angry people went after seeing the uniate services in the great church of hagia sophia it is said that he hid himself , but left a notice on the door of his cell : '' o unhappy romans , why have you forsaken the truth ? why do you not trust in god , instead of in the italians ? in losing your faith you will lose your city in administering his new conquest , 21-year-old conquering sultan mehmed ii wished to assure the loyalty of the greek population and above all avoid them appealing to the west for liberation , potentially sparking a new round of crusades mehmed therefore sought the most anti-western cleric he could find as a figure of unity for the greeks under turkish rule – and gennadius as leading anti-union figure was a natural choice the patriarch was appointed the official head or ethnarch of the greek millet , which was used as the ottomans as a source for imperial administrators in the spring of 1454 he was consecrated by the metropolitan of heraclea perinthus , but , since both the church of hagia sophia and the palace of the patriarch were now in the hands of the ottomans , he took up his residence successively in two monastery of the city while holding the episcopal office gennadius drew up , apparently for the use of mehmed , a confession or exposition of the christian faith , which was translated into turkish by ahmed , qadi of berrhoea ( and first printed by a he was later called two times to guide the christian community as patriarch during the turbulent period that followed the patriarchate of isidore ii marcus plested observes that scholarios ' '' love and esteem for thomas was to continued undimmed throughout his career '' '' although he would often accentuate the note of caution in later works 129 there are also various philosophical treatises of which the chief is a defence of aristotle ( antilepseis hyper aristotelous ) against the neoplatonist , gemistus pletho there exists an arrangement of this confession in the form of a dialogue in which mehmed asks questions ( '' what is god ?

he was born georgios in constantinople in c following his tutelage under the famous john chortasmenos ( '' didaskalos '' of the patriarchal school ) , manuel-mark might have then recommended him to study under his own previous master , georgios gemistus pletho ( d scholarius had been a teacher of philosophy before entering the service of the emperor john viii palaeologus as a theological advisor in fact , in 1437 – in anticipation of the council of ferrara-florence – the emperor formally studied nilus cabasilas 's works along with mark of ephesus and gennadius scholarius it was for this reason that scholarius wrote an academic refutation of the first eighteen of mark of ephesus ' '' syllogistic chapters against the latins '' from this , we can surmise that scholarius was likely writing an academic exercise to inform his former master that thomas aquinas ' opinions did not constitute a universally latin approach to questions on the trinity georgios scholarius became historically important when , as judge in the civil courts under john viii ( 1425–1448 ) , he accompanied his emperor to the council of ferrara-florence , held in 1438–1439 in ferrara and florence despite his initial advocacy of the union ( and berating many of the orthodox bishops for their lack of theological learnedness ) , georgios scholarius soured on union during the council , and left it early in june 1440 at the behest of his mentor mark of ephesus , who converted him completely to anti-latin orthodoxy , till his death , georgios scholarius was known ( with mark of ephesus ) as the most uncompromising enemy of the union however , he initially mitigates total condemnation of aquinas , noting that later scholastics ( like hervaeus natalis ) interpret aquinas in a more orthodox light this point marks scholarius ' increasing theological distance from aquinas , where he begins to be more theologically condemnatory of him in later works ( e.g 128,129 despite his cautions , scholarios writes of thomas '' we love this divinely-inspired and wise man ( 1928-36 ) oeuvres complètes de georges scholarios , 8 vols gibbon , decline and fall , lxviii , note 41 after the death of john viii in 1448 , georgios entered the zeyrek mosque in constantinople under constantine xi ( 1448–1453 ) and took , according to the invariable custom , a new name : gennadius before the fall of the city he was already well known as a bitter opponent of the union patrologia graeca , clx , 529 it was to gennadius that the angry people went after seeing the uniate services in the great church of hagia sophia the city 's famous patriarchal basilica , the hagia sophia , had already been converted into a mosque by the conquerors , so gennadius established his seat at the church of the holy apostles three years later the edifice , which was in a dilapidated state ( in 1461 it was demolished by the ottomans to make way for the fatih mosque ) , müller-wiener , wolfgang ( 1977 ) bildlexikon zur topographie istanbuls : byzantion , konstantinupolis , istanbul bis zum beginn d , 406 was abandoned by the patriarch , who moved again to the pammakaristos church the ottomans divided their empire into millets or subject nations , of which the greeks were the largest , known as the rum millet as was normal when a monk or lay scholar was appointed patriarch , gennadius was consecutively ordained , first as a deacon , then as a priest , then finally as a bishop before being appointed patriarch while holding the episcopal office gennadius drew up , apparently for the use of mehmed , a confession or exposition of the christian faith , which was translated into turkish by ahmed , qadi of berrhoea ( and first printed by a gennadius was unhappy as patriarch , and tried to abdicate his position at least twice , in 1456 he resigned for the different scholars ' suggestions about the second and third terms of gennadius see the list of patriarchs of constantinople thomas aquinas , and polemical treatises against his theology by gennadius are still unedited , as is also his work against the barlaamites there exists an arrangement of this confession in the form of a dialogue in which mehmed asks questions ( '' what is god ? '' – '' why is he called theos ? '' – '' and how many gods are there ?

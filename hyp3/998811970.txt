the distinction between acquiring and learning was made by stephen krashen ( 1982 ) as part of his monitor theory according to krashen , the acquisition of a language is a natural process ; whereas learning a language is a conscious one not all educators in second language agree to this distinction ; however , the study of how a second language is learned/acquired is referred to as second-language acquisition ( sla ) focuses on the developing knowledge and use of a language by children and adults who already know at least one other language many psychological theories , on the other hand , hypothesize that cognitive mechanisms , responsible for much of human learning , process language most language teachers do not use one singular style , but will use a mix in their teaching the defining difference between a first language ( l1 ) and a second language ( l2 ) is the age the person learned the language after that age , l2 learners could get near-native-like-ness but their language would , while consisting of few actual errors , have enough errors to set them apart from the l1 group as we are learning more and more about the brain , there is a hypothesis that when a child is going through puberty , that is the time that accents start acquiring a second language can be a lifelong learning process for many in the first language , children do not respond to systematic correction furthermore , children who have limited input still acquire the first language , which is a significant difference between input and output error correction does not seem to have a direct influence on learning a second language in the learning of a second language the correction of errors remains a controversial topic with many differing schools of thought throughout the last century much advancement has been made in research on the correction of students ' errors in this same decade terrell ( 1977 ) did studies that showed that there were more factors to be considered in the classroom than the cognitive processing of the students ( russell , 2009 ) his studies in 2002 showed that students learn better when teachers help students recognize and correct their own errors ( russell , 2009 ) it is inevitable that all people will learn a first language and with few exceptions , they will be fully successful the handbook of second language acquisition ( 2004 ) second language learning theories , 2nd edition

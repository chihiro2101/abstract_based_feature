the distinction between acquiring and learning was made by stephen krashen ( 1982 ) as part of his monitor theory according to krashen , the acquisition of a language is a natural process ; whereas learning a language is a conscious one in the latter , error correction is present , as is the study of grammatical rules isolated from natural language not all educators in second language agree to this distinction ; however , the study of how a second language is learned/acquired is referred to as second-language acquisition ( sla ) focuses on the developing knowledge and use of a language by children and adults who already know at least one other language and a knowledge of second-language acquisition may help educational policy makers set more realistic goals for programmes for both foreign language courses and the learning of the majority language by minority language children and adults most language teachers do not use one singular style , but will use a mix in their teaching the defining difference between a first language ( l1 ) and a second language ( l2 ) is the age the person learned the language for example , linguist eric lenneberg used second language to mean language acquisition or used by its speaker after puberty in most cases , people never achieve the same level of fluency and comprehension in their second languages as in their first language as for the fluency , it is better to do foreign language education at an early age , but being exposed to a foreign language since an early age causes a “ weak identification ” ( billiet , maddens and beerten 241 ) acquiring a second language can be a lifelong learning process for many despite persistent efforts , most learners of a second language will never become fully native-like in it , although with practice considerable fluency can be achieved however , children by around the age of 5 have more or less mastered their first language with the exception of vocabulary and a few grammar structures , and the process is relatively very fast because language is a very complex skill moreover , if children start to learn a second language when they are 7 years old or younger , they will also be fully fluent with their second language in a faster speed comparing to the speed of learning by adults who start to learn a second language later in their life furthermore , children who have limited input still acquire the first language , which is a significant difference between input and output researchers asserted that correction was often unnecessary and that instead of furthering students ’ learning it was hindering them ( russell , 2009 ) his studies in 2002 showed that students learn better when teachers help students recognize and correct their own errors ( russell , 2009 ) it is inevitable that all people will learn a first language and with few exceptions , they will be fully successful ( 2004 ) second language learning theories , 2nd edition

the distinction between acquiring and learning was made by stephen krashen ( 1982 ) as part of his monitor theory according to krashen , the acquisition of a language is a natural process ; whereas learning a language is a conscious one in the latter , error correction is present , as is the study of grammatical rules isolated from natural language not all educators in second language agree to this distinction ; however , the study of how a second language is learned/acquired is referred to as second-language acquisition ( sla ) focuses on the developing knowledge and use of a language by children and adults who already know at least one other language and a knowledge of second-language acquisition may help educational policy makers set more realistic goals for programmes for both foreign language courses and the learning of the majority language by minority language children and adults many psychological theories , on the other hand , hypothesize that cognitive mechanisms , responsible for much of human learning , process language most language teachers do not use one singular style , but will use a mix in their teaching the defining difference between a first language ( l1 ) and a second language ( l2 ) is the age the person learned the language for example , linguist eric lenneberg used second language to mean language acquisition or used by its speaker after puberty as we are learning more and more about the brain , there is a hypothesis that when a child is going through puberty , that is the time that accents start also , “ older children acquire faster than younger children do ( again , in early stages of morphological and syntactic development where time and exposure are held constant ) ” ( 573 ) in other words , adults and older children are fast learners when it comes to the initial stage of foreign language education as for the fluency , it is better to do foreign language education at an early age , but being exposed to a foreign language since an early age causes a “ weak identification ” ( billiet , maddens and beerten 241 ) due to such factors , learning foreign languages at an early age may incur one ’ s perspective of his or her native country however , children by around the age of 5 have more or less mastered their first language with the exception of vocabulary and a few grammar structures , and the process is relatively very fast because language is a very complex skill moreover , if children start to learn a second language when they are 7 years old or younger , they will also be fully fluent with their second language in a faster speed comparing to the speed of learning by adults who start to learn a second language later in their life furthermore , children who have limited input still acquire the first language , which is a significant difference between input and output foreign language writing aid foreign language reading aid computer-assisted language learning diglossia language education the handbook of second language acquisition

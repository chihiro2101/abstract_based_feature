the distinction between acquiring and learning was made by stephen krashen ( 1982 ) as part of his monitor theory according to krashen , the acquisition of a language is a natural process ; whereas learning a language is a conscious one in the latter , error correction is present , as is the study of grammatical rules isolated from natural language not all educators in second language agree to this distinction ; however , the study of how a second language is learned/acquired is referred to as second-language acquisition ( sla ) focuses on the developing knowledge and use of a language by children and adults who already know at least one other language and a knowledge of second-language acquisition may help educational policy makers set more realistic goals for programmes for both foreign language courses and the learning of the majority language by minority language children and adults one of the dominant linguistic theories hypothesizes that a device or module of sorts in the brain contains innate knowledge many psychological theories , on the other hand , hypothesize that cognitive mechanisms , responsible for much of human learning , process language the defining difference between a first language ( l1 ) and a second language ( l2 ) is the age the person learned the language for example , linguist eric lenneberg used second language to mean language acquisition or used by its speaker after puberty before a child goes through puberty , the chemical processes in the brain are more geared towards language and social communication such issue leads to a '' double sense of national belonging , '' that makes one not sure of where he or she belongs to because according to brian a due to such factors , learning foreign languages at an early age may incur one ’ s perspective of his or her native country however , children by around the age of 5 have more or less mastered their first language with the exception of vocabulary and a few grammar structures , and the process is relatively very fast because language is a very complex skill moreover , if children start to learn a second language when they are 7 years old or younger , they will also be fully fluent with their second language in a faster speed comparing to the speed of learning by adults who start to learn a second language later in their life in the first language , children do not respond to systematic correction furthermore , children who have limited input still acquire the first language , which is a significant difference between input and output mackey , gas and mcdonough had similar findings in 2000 and attributed the success of this method to the student ’ s active participation in the corrective processes foreign language writing aid foreign language reading aid computer-assisted language learning diglossia language education ( 2004 ) second language learning theories , 2nd edition

according to krashen , the acquisition of a language is a natural process ; whereas learning a language is a conscious one not all educators in second language agree to this distinction ; however , the study of how a second language is learned/acquired is referred to as second-language acquisition ( sla ) focuses on the developing knowledge and use of a language by children and adults who already know at least one other language and a knowledge of second-language acquisition may help educational policy makers set more realistic goals for programmes for both foreign language courses and the learning of the majority language by minority language children and adults the defining difference between a first language ( l1 ) and a second language ( l2 ) is the age the person learned the language for example , linguist eric lenneberg used second language to mean language acquisition or used by its speaker after puberty after that age , l2 learners could get near-native-like-ness but their language would , while consisting of few actual errors , have enough errors to set them apart from the l1 group as far as the relationship between age and eventual attainment in sla is concerned , krashen , long , and scarcella , say that people who encounter foreign language in early age , begin natural exposure to second languages and obtain better proficiency than those who learn the second language as an adult however , when it comes to the relationship between age and rate sla , “ adults proceed through early stages of syntactic and morphological development faster than children ( where time and exposure are held constant ) ” ( krashen , long , scarcella 573 ) also , “ older children acquire faster than younger children do ( again , in early stages of morphological and syntactic development where time and exposure are held constant ) ” ( 573 ) gauthier and genesee ( 2011 ) have done a research which mainly focuses on the second language acquisition of internationally adopted children and results show that early experiences of one language of children can affect their ability to acquire a second language , and usually children learn their second language slower and weaker even during the critical period as for the fluency , it is better to do foreign language education at an early age , but being exposed to a foreign language since an early age causes a “ weak identification ” ( billiet , maddens and beerten 241 ) such issue leads to a '' double sense of national belonging , '' that makes one not sure of where he or she belongs to because according to brian a and as children learn more and more foreign languages , children start to adapt , and get absorbed into the foreign culture that they “ undertake to describe themselves in ways that engage with representations others have made ” ( pratt 35 ) acquiring a second language can be a lifelong learning process for many despite persistent efforts , most learners of a second language will never become fully native-like in it , although with practice considerable fluency can be achieved moreover , if children start to learn a second language when they are 7 years old or younger , they will also be fully fluent with their second language in a faster speed comparing to the speed of learning by adults who start to learn a second language later in their life children are exposed to a language environment of errors and lack of correction but they end up having the capacity to figure out the grammatical rules for second language learners , success is not guaranteed foreign language writing aid foreign language reading aid computer-assisted language learning diglossia language education

the technician found a defective fuel quantity indication system , so he disabled the defective channel and made an entry in the logbook since the fqis was operating on a single channel , a dripstick reading was taken to obtain a second measurement of fuel quantity weir converted the dripstick reading from centimetres to litres to kilograms , finding that it agreed with the fqis at montreal , captain bob pearson and first officer maurice quintal took over the airplane for flight 143 to ottawa and edmonton during the handover , weir told pearson that there was a problem with the fqis , and pearson decided to take on enough fuel to fly to edmonton without refueling in ottawa while waiting for the fuel truck , he enabled the defective channel and performed an fqis self-test pearson entered the cockpit to find the fqis blank , as he expected after taking a dripstick measurement , pearson converted the reading from centimetres to litres to kilograms since the fqis was not operational , he entered the reading into the flight management computer ( fmc ) , which tracked the amount of fuel remaining in kilograms since the aircraft appeared to have enough fuel to reach edmonton , no fuel was loaded at ottawa cdt , the aircraft 's cockpit warning system sounded , indicating a fuel pressure problem on the aircraft 's left side assuming that a fuel pump had failed , the pilots turned off the alarm , knowing that the engine could be gravity-fed in level flight as they communicated their intentions to controllers in winnipeg and tried to restart the left engine , the cockpit warning system sounded again with the '' all engines out '' sound , a sharp '' bong '' that no one in the cockpit could recall having heard before the 767 was one of the first airliners to include an electronic flight instrument system , which operated on the electricity generated by the aircraft 's jet engines in line with their planned diversion to winnipeg , the pilots were already descending through accident description aviation-safety.net ( accessed july 24 , 2008 ) when the second engine shut down they immediately searched their emergency checklist for the section on flying the aircraft with both engines out , only to find that no such section existed captain pearson was an experienced glider pilot , so he was familiar with flying techniques almost never used in commercial flight first officer maurice quintal began to calculate whether they could reach winnipeg in the aircraft lost , giving a glide ratio of approximately 12:1 ( dedicated glider planes reach ratios of 50:1 to 70:1 ) unbeknownst to quintal or to the air traffic controller , a part of the facility had been converted to a race track complex , now known as gimli motorsports park the unlocked nose wheel collapsed and was forced back into its well , causing the aircraft 's nose to slam into , bounce off , and then scrape along the ground it noted that air canada '' neglected to assign clearly and specifically the responsibility for calculating the fuel load in an abnormal situation '' it further found that the airline had failed to reallocate the task of checking fuel load ( which had been the responsibility of the flight engineer on older aircraft flown with a crew of three ) in the event of one failing , the other could still operate alone , but in that case , the indicated quantity was required to be cross-checked against a floatstick measurement before departure in the event of both channels failing , there would be no fuel display in the cockpit , and the aircraft would be considered non-serviceable and not authorized to fly an engineer in edmonton duly did so when the aircraft arrived from toronto following a trouble-free flight the day before the incident this reports that the fuel gauges were blank and that the second fqis channel was disabled , but does not make clear that the latter fixed the former the fqis was now completely unserviceable and the fuel gauges were blank the boeing 767 belonged to a new generation of aircraft that flew with only a pilot and co-pilot , but air canada had not clearly assigned responsibility for supervising the fueling since the fqis was not working , captain pearson decided to take on enough fuel to reach edmonton without refueling at ottawa the fueler reported that the density of jet fuel at the time was 1.77 , which was in pounds/litre since other air canada aircraft used pounds the aircraft was temporarily repaired at gimli and flew out two days later to be fully repaired at a maintenance base in winnipeg flight ac7067 was captained by jean-marc b√©langer , a former head of the air canada pilots association , while captains robert pearson and maurice quintal were on board to oversee the flight from montreal to california 's mojave airport

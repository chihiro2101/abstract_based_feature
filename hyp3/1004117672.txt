on july & nbsp ; 22 , 1983 , air canada boeing 767 underwent routine checks in edmonton the technician found a defective fuel quantity indication system , so he disabled the defective channel and made an entry in the logbook since the fqis was operating on a single channel , a dripstick reading was taken to obtain a second measurement of fuel quantity during the handover , weir told pearson that there was a problem with the fqis , and pearson decided to take on enough fuel to fly to edmonton without refueling in ottawa while waiting for the fuel truck , he enabled the defective channel and performed an fqis self-test distracted by the arrival of the fuel truck , he left the channel enabled after the fqis failed the self-test pearson entered the cockpit to find the fqis blank , as he expected since the fqis was not operational , he entered the reading into the flight management computer ( fmc ) , which tracked the amount of fuel remaining in kilograms the airplane flew to ottawa without incident , where another dripstick measurement was taken and converted using the density in pounds/litre since the aircraft appeared to have enough fuel to reach edmonton , no fuel was loaded at ottawa cdt , the aircraft 's cockpit warning system sounded , indicating a fuel pressure problem on the aircraft 's left side a few seconds later , the fuel pressure alarm also sounded for the right engine seconds later , the right-side engine also stopped and the 767 lost all power the 767 was one of the first airliners to include an electronic flight instrument system , which operated on the electricity generated by the aircraft 's jet engines on the boeing 767 , the control surfaces are so large that the pilots can not move them with muscle power alone captain pearson was an experienced glider pilot , so he was familiar with flying techniques almost never used in commercial flight to have the maximum range and therefore the largest choice of possible landing sites , he needed to fly the 767 at the optimum glide speed first officer maurice quintal began to calculate whether they could reach winnipeg in the aircraft lost , giving a glide ratio of approximately 12:1 ( dedicated glider planes reach ratios of 50:1 to 70:1 ) a canadian automobile sport clubs-sanctioned sports car race hosted by the winnipeg sports car club was underway at the time of the incident and the area around the decommissioned runway was full of cars and campers as the aircraft slowed on approach to landing , the reduced power generated by the ram air turbine rendered the aircraft increasingly difficult to control as the plane drew near the runway , it became apparent that the aircraft was coming in too high and fast , raising the danger of the 767 running off the runway before it could be stopped '' it further found that the airline had failed to reallocate the task of checking fuel load ( which had been the responsibility of the flight engineer on older aircraft flown with a crew of three ) while conducting this check , the fqis failed and the cockpit fuel gauges went blank the engineer had encountered the same problem earlier in the month when this same aircraft had arrived from toronto with an fqis fault in the absence of any spares he simply repeated this temporary fix by pulling and tagging the circuit breaker the flight to montreal proceeded uneventfully with fuel gauges operating correctly on the single channel the outgoing pilot informed captain pearson and first officer quintal of the problem with the fqis and passed along his mistaken belief that the aircraft had flown the previous day with this problem while the aircraft was being prepared for its return to edmonton , a maintenance worker decided to investigate the problem with the faulty fqis to calculate how much fuel the airplane had to take on , he needed to convert the volume ( litres ) to mass ( kilograms ) , subtract that figure from 22,300 & nbsp ; kg , and convert the result back into volume the fueler reported that the density of jet fuel at the time was 1.77 , which was in pounds/litre since other air canada aircraft used pounds following a successful appeal against their suspensions , pearson and quintal were assigned as crew members aboard another air canada flight the discovery channel canada / national geographic tv series mayday covered the incident in a 2008 episode titled '' gimli glider ''

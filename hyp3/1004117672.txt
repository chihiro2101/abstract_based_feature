on july & nbsp ; 22 , 1983 , air canada boeing 767 underwent routine checks in edmonton the technician found a defective fuel quantity indication system , so he disabled the defective channel and made an entry in the logbook since the fqis was operating on a single channel , a dripstick reading was taken to obtain a second measurement of fuel quantity weir converted the dripstick reading from centimetres to litres to kilograms , finding that it agreed with the fqis at montreal , captain bob pearson and first officer maurice quintal took over the airplane for flight 143 to ottawa and edmonton during the handover , weir told pearson that there was a problem with the fqis , and pearson decided to take on enough fuel to fly to edmonton without refueling in ottawa meanwhile , an avionics technician had entered the cockpit and read the logbook while waiting for the fuel truck , he enabled the defective channel and performed an fqis self-test distracted by the arrival of the fuel truck , he left the channel enabled after the fqis failed the self-test pearson entered the cockpit to find the fqis blank , as he expected after taking a dripstick measurement , pearson converted the reading from centimetres to litres to kilograms the airplane flew to ottawa without incident , where another dripstick measurement was taken and converted using the density in pounds/litre since the aircraft appeared to have enough fuel to reach edmonton , no fuel was loaded at ottawa cdt , the aircraft 's cockpit warning system sounded , indicating a fuel pressure problem on the aircraft 's left side assuming that a fuel pump had failed , the pilots turned off the alarm , knowing that the engine could be gravity-fed in level flight while these provided sufficient information to land the aircraft , the backup instruments did not include a vertical speed indicator that could be used to determine how far the aircraft could glide at this point , quintal proposed landing at the former rcaf station gimli , a closed air force base where he had once served as a pilot for the royal canadian air force the main gear locked into position , but the nose wheel did not ; this later turned out to be advantageous as the plane drew near the runway , it became apparent that the aircraft was coming in too high and fast , raising the danger of the 767 running off the runway before it could be stopped as soon as the wheels touched down on the runway , pearson braked hard , skidding and promptly blowing out two of the aircraft 's tires the aviation safety board of canada ( predecessor of the modern transportation safety board of canada ) reported that air canada management was responsible for '' corporate and equipment deficiencies '' it noted that air canada '' neglected to assign clearly and specifically the responsibility for calculating the fuel load in an abnormal situation '' it further found that the airline had failed to reallocate the task of checking fuel load ( which had been the responsibility of the flight engineer on older aircraft flown with a crew of three ) the safety board also said that air canada needed to keep more spare parts , including replacements for the defective fuel quantity indicator , in its maintenance inventory as well as provide better , more thorough training on the metric system to its pilots and fuelling personnel the amount of fuel in the tanks of a boeing 767 is computed by the fuel quantity indication system ( fqis ) and displayed in the cockpit an engineer in edmonton duly did so when the aircraft arrived from toronto following a trouble-free flight the day before the incident the engineer had encountered the same problem earlier in the month when this same aircraft had arrived from toronto with an fqis fault he found then that disabling the second channel by pulling the circuit breaker in the cockpit restored the fuel gauges to working order albeit with only the single fqis channel operative since the fqis was not working , captain pearson decided to take on enough fuel to reach edmonton without refueling at ottawa the fueler reported that the density of jet fuel at the time was 1.77 , which was in pounds/litre since other air canada aircraft used pounds it is normally updated automatically by the fqis , but the fuel quantity can also be entered manually the fueler at edmonton knew the density of jet fuel in kg/l , and he calculated the correct number of litres to pump into the tanks following a successful appeal against their suspensions , pearson and quintal were assigned as crew members aboard another air canada flight

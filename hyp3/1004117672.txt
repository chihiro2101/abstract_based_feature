on july & nbsp ; 22 , 1983 , air canada boeing 767 underwent routine checks in edmonton the technician found a defective fuel quantity indication system , so he disabled the defective channel and made an entry in the logbook since the fqis was operating on a single channel , a dripstick reading was taken to obtain a second measurement of fuel quantity weir converted the dripstick reading from centimetres to litres to kilograms , finding that it agreed with the fqis at montreal , captain bob pearson and first officer maurice quintal took over the airplane for flight 143 to ottawa and edmonton during the handover , weir told pearson that there was a problem with the fqis , and pearson decided to take on enough fuel to fly to edmonton without refueling in ottawa while waiting for the fuel truck , he enabled the defective channel and performed an fqis self-test distracted by the arrival of the fuel truck , he left the channel enabled after the fqis failed the self-test pearson entered the cockpit to find the fqis blank , as he expected however , he did his calculation with the density of jet fuel in pounds/litre instead of kilograms/litre since the fqis was not operational , he entered the reading into the flight management computer ( fmc ) , which tracked the amount of fuel remaining in kilograms since the aircraft appeared to have enough fuel to reach edmonton , no fuel was loaded at ottawa cdt , the aircraft 's cockpit warning system sounded , indicating a fuel pressure problem on the aircraft 's left side assuming that a fuel pump had failed , the pilots turned off the alarm , knowing that the engine could be gravity-fed in level flight a few seconds later , the fuel pressure alarm also sounded for the right engine to have the maximum range and therefore the largest choice of possible landing sites , he needed to fly the 767 at the optimum glide speed gimli motorsports park website it included a road race course , a go-kart track , and a dragstrip as the aircraft slowed on approach to landing , the reduced power generated by the ram air turbine rendered the aircraft increasingly difficult to control a minor fire in the nose area was extinguished by racers and course workers equipped with portable fire extinguishers the amount of fuel in the tanks of a boeing 767 is computed by the fuel quantity indication system ( fqis ) and displayed in the cockpit an engineer in edmonton duly did so when the aircraft arrived from toronto following a trouble-free flight the day before the incident while conducting this check , the fqis failed and the cockpit fuel gauges went blank he found then that disabling the second channel by pulling the circuit breaker in the cockpit restored the fuel gauges to working order albeit with only the single fqis channel operative this reports that the fuel gauges were blank and that the second fqis channel was disabled , but does not make clear that the latter fixed the former on the day of the incident , the aircraft flew from edmonton to montreal the outgoing pilot informed captain pearson and first officer quintal of the problem with the fqis and passed along his mistaken belief that the aircraft had flown the previous day with this problem in a further misunderstanding , captain pearson believed that he was also being told that the fqis had been completely unserviceable since then while the aircraft was being prepared for its return to edmonton , a maintenance worker decided to investigate the problem with the faulty fqis the flight plan showed that of fuel was required for the flight from montreal to ottawa to edmonton the fueler at edmonton knew the density of jet fuel in kg/l , and he calculated the correct number of litres to pump into the tanks following a successful appeal against their suspensions , pearson and quintal were assigned as crew members aboard another air canada flight also on board were three of the six flight attendants who were on flight 143 according to a website dedicated to saving the aircraft , the gimli glider was scrapped in early 2014

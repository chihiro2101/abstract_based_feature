on july & nbsp ; 22 , 1983 , air canada boeing 767 underwent routine checks in edmonton the technician found a defective fuel quantity indication system , so he disabled the defective channel and made an entry in the logbook since the fqis was operating on a single channel , a dripstick reading was taken to obtain a second measurement of fuel quantity weir converted the dripstick reading from centimetres to litres to kilograms , finding that it agreed with the fqis the plane flew to toronto and then montreal without incident at montreal , captain bob pearson and first officer maurice quintal took over the airplane for flight 143 to ottawa and edmonton during the handover , weir told pearson that there was a problem with the fqis , and pearson decided to take on enough fuel to fly to edmonton without refueling in ottawa distracted by the arrival of the fuel truck , he left the channel enabled after the fqis failed the self-test pearson entered the cockpit to find the fqis blank , as he expected since the fqis was not operational , he entered the reading into the flight management computer ( fmc ) , which tracked the amount of fuel remaining in kilograms the airplane flew to ottawa without incident , where another dripstick measurement was taken and converted using the density in pounds/litre since the aircraft appeared to have enough fuel to reach edmonton , no fuel was loaded at ottawa cdt , the aircraft 's cockpit warning system sounded , indicating a fuel pressure problem on the aircraft 's left side assuming that a fuel pump had failed , the pilots turned off the alarm , knowing that the engine could be gravity-fed in level flight within seconds , the left engine failed and the pilots began preparing for a single-engine landing the 767 was one of the first airliners to include an electronic flight instrument system , which operated on the electricity generated by the aircraft 's jet engines captain pearson was an experienced glider pilot , so he was familiar with flying techniques almost never used in commercial flight he used the altitude from one of the mechanical backup instruments , while the distance travelled was supplied by the air traffic controllers in winnipeg , measured by the aircraft 's radar echo observed at winnipeg in the aircraft lost , giving a glide ratio of approximately 12:1 ( dedicated glider planes reach ratios of 50:1 to 70:1 ) unbeknownst to quintal or to the air traffic controller , a part of the facility had been converted to a race track complex , now known as gimli motorsports park the pilots briefly considered a 360-degree turn to reduce speed and altitude , but they decided that they did not have enough altitude for the manoeuvre complicating matters yet further was the fact that with both of its engines out , the plane made virtually no noise during its approach air canada flight 143 came to a final stop on the ground 17 minutes after running out of fuel the aviation safety board of canada ( predecessor of the modern transportation safety board of canada ) reported that air canada management was responsible for '' corporate and equipment deficiencies '' '' it further found that the airline had failed to reallocate the task of checking fuel load ( which had been the responsibility of the flight engineer on older aircraft flown with a crew of three ) the amount of fuel in the tanks of a boeing 767 is computed by the fuel quantity indication system ( fqis ) and displayed in the cockpit because inconsistencies had been found with the fqis in other 767s , boeing had issued a service bulletin for the routine checking of this system the outgoing pilot informed captain pearson and first officer quintal of the problem with the fqis and passed along his mistaken belief that the aircraft had flown the previous day with this problem the fqis was now completely unserviceable and the fuel gauges were blank in older aircraft that flew with a three-person crew , the flight engineer kept a fuel log and supervised the fueling the fueler reported that the density of jet fuel at the time was 1.77 , which was in pounds/litre since other air canada aircraft used pounds four years after the incident , canada post issued a postage stamp commemorating air canada also on board were three of the six flight attendants who were on flight 143

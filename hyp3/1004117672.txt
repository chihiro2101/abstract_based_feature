on july & nbsp ; 22 , 1983 , air canada boeing 767 underwent routine checks in edmonton the technician found a defective fuel quantity indication system , so he disabled the defective channel and made an entry in the logbook since the fqis was operating on a single channel , a dripstick reading was taken to obtain a second measurement of fuel quantity weir converted the dripstick reading from centimetres to litres to kilograms , finding that it agreed with the fqis at montreal , captain bob pearson and first officer maurice quintal took over the airplane for flight 143 to ottawa and edmonton during the handover , weir told pearson that there was a problem with the fqis , and pearson decided to take on enough fuel to fly to edmonton without refueling in ottawa while waiting for the fuel truck , he enabled the defective channel and performed an fqis self-test distracted by the arrival of the fuel truck , he left the channel enabled after the fqis failed the self-test after taking a dripstick measurement , pearson converted the reading from centimetres to litres to kilograms since the fqis was not operational , he entered the reading into the flight management computer ( fmc ) , which tracked the amount of fuel remaining in kilograms the airplane flew to ottawa without incident , where another dripstick measurement was taken and converted using the density in pounds/litre since the aircraft appeared to have enough fuel to reach edmonton , no fuel was loaded at ottawa cdt , the aircraft 's cockpit warning system sounded , indicating a fuel pressure problem on the aircraft 's left side assuming that a fuel pump had failed , the pilots turned off the alarm , knowing that the engine could be gravity-fed in level flight while these provided sufficient information to land the aircraft , the backup instruments did not include a vertical speed indicator that could be used to determine how far the aircraft could glide they immediately searched their emergency checklist for the section on flying the aircraft with both engines out , only to find that no such section existed in the aircraft lost , giving a glide ratio of approximately 12:1 ( dedicated glider planes reach ratios of 50:1 to 70:1 ) unbeknownst to quintal or to the air traffic controller , a part of the facility had been converted to a race track complex , now known as gimli motorsports park as the aircraft slowed on approach to landing , the reduced power generated by the ram air turbine rendered the aircraft increasingly difficult to control as soon as the wheels touched down on the runway , pearson braked hard , skidding and promptly blowing out two of the aircraft 's tires air canada flight 143 came to a final stop on the ground 17 minutes after running out of fuel the aviation safety board of canada ( predecessor of the modern transportation safety board of canada ) reported that air canada management was responsible for '' corporate and equipment deficiencies '' '' it further found that the airline had failed to reallocate the task of checking fuel load ( which had been the responsibility of the flight engineer on older aircraft flown with a crew of three ) the amount of fuel in the tanks of a boeing 767 is computed by the fuel quantity indication system ( fqis ) and displayed in the cockpit the fqis on the aircraft was a dual-processor channel , each independently calculating the fuel load and cross-checking with the other because inconsistencies had been found with the fqis in other 767s , boeing had issued a service bulletin for the routine checking of this system the engineer had encountered the same problem earlier in the month when this same aircraft had arrived from toronto with an fqis fault he found then that disabling the second channel by pulling the circuit breaker in the cockpit restored the fuel gauges to working order albeit with only the single fqis channel operative this reports that the fuel gauges were blank and that the second fqis channel was disabled , but does not make clear that the latter fixed the former on entering the cockpit , captain pearson saw what he was expecting to see : blank fuel gauges and a tagged circuit breaker the flight plan showed that of fuel was required for the flight from montreal to ottawa to edmonton following the full repair , the aircraft was returned to service with air canada following a successful appeal against their suspensions , pearson and quintal were assigned as crew members aboard another air canada flight

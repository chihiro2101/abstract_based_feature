talmon 's 1952 book the origins of totalitarian democracy discusses the transformation of a state in which traditional values and articles of faith shape the role of government into one in which social utility takes absolute precedence in the social contract , rousseau contends that the interests of the individual and the state are one and the same , and it is the state 's responsibility to implement the '' general will '' the philosophy of totalitarian democracy , according to talmon , is based on a top-down view of society , which sees an absolute and perfect political truth to which all reasonable humans are driven moreover , any public or private activities that do not forward this goal have no useful purpose , sap time , money and energy from those that do , and must be eliminated he posits that totalitarian democracy , or what he terms '' equality-oriented democracy , '' is founded on the idea that it is possible , and necessary , that the complete rights and freedoms of people ought not be held hostage to traditions and social arrangements a totalitarian democracy , says talmon , accepts '' exclusive territorial sovereignty '' as its right liberal democrats , who see political strength as growing from the bottom up ( cf : '' grass roots '' ) , reject in principle the idea of coercion in shaping political will , but the totalitarian democratic state holds it as an ongoing imperative a totalitarian democratic state is said to maximize its control over the lives of its citizens by using the dual rationale of general will ( i.e it can approach the condition of totalitarianism ; totalitarian states can also approach the condition of democracy , or at least majoritarianism citizens of a totalitarian democratic state , even when aware of their true powerlessness , may support their government according to talmon , totalitarian democracy sees freedom as something achieved only in the long term , and only through collective effort ; the political goal of ultimate order and ultimate harmony brings ultimate freedom in addressing every aspect of the lives of its citizens , the totalitarian democratic state has the power to ensure that all material needs are met from cradle to grave , and all that is required of the citizen is to carry out his role , whatever it may be , to the best of his ability he argues that while equality-oriented democracy stresses the value of equality over individual freedoms , the reverse is true for freedom-oriented democracy , and in each case , the state will move either to ensure equality by limiting individual freedom , or to ensure individual freedom by giving up equality in full spectrum dominance : totalitarian democracy and the new world order , engdahl focuses on the american drive to achieve global hegemony through military and economic means

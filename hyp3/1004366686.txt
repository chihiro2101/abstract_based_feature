talmon 's 1952 book the origins of totalitarian democracy discusses the transformation of a state in which traditional values and articles of faith shape the role of government into one in which social utility takes absolute precedence his work is a criticism of the ideas of jean-jacques rousseau , whose political philosophy greatly influenced the french revolution , the growth of the enlightenment across europe , as well the overall development of modern political and educational thought in the social contract , rousseau contends that the interests of the individual and the state are one and the same , and it is the state 's responsibility to implement the '' general will '' also derives from talmon 's introduction to this work : : indeed , from the vantage point of the mid twentieth century the history of the last hundred and fifty years looks like a systematic preparation for the headlong collision between empirical and liberal democracy on the one hand , and totalitarian messianic democracy on the other , in which the world crisis of to-day consists the philosophy of totalitarian democracy , according to talmon , is based on a top-down view of society , which sees an absolute and perfect political truth to which all reasonable humans are driven moreover , any public or private activities that do not forward this goal have no useful purpose , sap time , money and energy from those that do , and must be eliminated he posits that totalitarian democracy , or what he terms '' equality-oriented democracy , '' is founded on the idea that it is possible , and necessary , that the complete rights and freedoms of people ought not be held hostage to traditions and social arrangements he sees the proponents of liberal democracy ( or '' western '' democracy ) as holding a negative attitude to the word and believing that force is not an appropriate way to achieve a goal no matter the value of that goal liberal democrats , who see political strength as growing from the bottom up ( cf : '' grass roots '' ) , reject in principle the idea of coercion in shaping political will , but the totalitarian democratic state holds it as an ongoing imperative it is mao shoulong 's contention that '' equality-oriented democracy recognises the value of freedom but holds that it ca n't be attained by individual efforts , '' but rather , by collective efforts he argues that while equality-oriented democracy stresses the value of equality over individual freedoms , the reverse is true for freedom-oriented democracy , and in each case , the state will move either to ensure equality by limiting individual freedom , or to ensure individual freedom by giving up equality this is in contrast to a totalitarian democracy , with the state as a total institution , where the individual is truly not free without constant participation in their '' democratic '' government ; and thus , the individual in the totalitarian democracy must be '' forced to be free '' if the totalitarian democracy is not to become a totalitarian oligarchy according to him , u.s state objectives have led to internal conditions that resemble totalitarianism : '' it is a power establishment that over the course of the cold war has spun out of control and now threatens not only the fundamental institutions of democracy , but even of life on the planet through the growing risk of nuclear war by miscalculation '' engdahl , full spectrum dominance , pg wolin cites phenomena such as the lack of involvement of citizens in a narrow political framework ( due to the influence of money ) , the privatization of social security , and massive increases in military spending and spending on surveillance as examples of the push away from public and towards private-controlled government

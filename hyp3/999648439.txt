'' oxidation damage to cellular contents caused by free radicals is believed to contribute to aging as well oxford university press , usa , , the longest documented human lifespan is 122 years , the case of jeanne calment who according to records was born in 1875 and died in 1997 , whereas the maximum lifespan of a wildtype mouse , commonly used as a model in research on aging , is about three years genetic differences between humans and mice that may account for these different aging rates include differences in efficiency of dna repair , antioxidant defenses , energy metabolism , proteostasis maintenance , and recycling mechanisms such as autophagy extension of expected lifespan can often be achieved by access to improved medical care , vaccinations , good diet , exercise and avoidance of hazards such as smoking widely recognized methods of extending maximum lifespan in model organisms such as nematodes , fruit flies , and mice include caloric restriction , gene manipulation , and administration of pharmaceuticals much life extension research focuses on nutrition—diets or supplements— although there is little evidence that they have an effect in some studies calorie restriction has been shown to extend the life of mice , yeast , and rhesus monkeys the free-radical theory of aging suggests that antioxidant supplements might extend human life reviews , however , have found that vitamin a ( as β-carotene ) and vitamin e supplements may increase mortality while growth hormone ( gh ) decreases with age , the evidence for use of growth hormone as an anti-aging therapy is mixed and based mostly on animal studies there are mixed reports that gh or igf-1 modulates the aging process in humans and about whether the direction of its effect is positive or negative he cites francis bacon ( 1561–1626 ) as an advocate of using science and reason to extend human life , noting bacon 's novel new atlantis , wherein scientists worked toward delaying aging and prolonging life robert boyle ( 1627–1691 ) , founding member of the royal society , also hoped that science would make substantial progress with life extension , according to hughes , and proposed such experiments as '' to replace the blood of the old with the blood of the young '' regulatory and legal struggles between the food and drug administration ( fda ) and the life extension organization included seizure of merchandise and court action west emphasised the potential role of embryonic stem cells in life extension in 2003 , aubrey de grey and david gobel formed the methuselah foundation , which gives financial grants to anti-aging research projects in 2009 , de grey and several others founded the sens research foundation , a california-based scientific research organization which conducts research into aging and funds other anti-aging research projects at various universities sens foundation in 2013 , google announced calico , a new company based in san francisco that will harness new technologies to increase scientific understanding of the biology of aging university researchers have made a number of breakthroughs in extending the lives of mice and insects by reversing certain aspects of aging for example , leonard hayflick , who determined that fibroblasts are limited to around 50 & nbsp ; cell divisions , reasons that aging is an unavoidable consequence of entropy hayflick and fellow biogerontologists jay olshansky and bruce carnes have strongly criticized the anti-aging industry in response to what they see as unscrupulous profiteering from the sale of unproven anti-aging supplements they aimed to provide political support to radical life extension research and technologies , and ensure the fastest possible and at the same time soft transition of society to the next step – life without aging and with radical life extension , and to provide access to such technologies to most currently living people transhumanist philosopher nick bostrom has argued that any technological advances in life extension must be equitably distributed and not restricted to a privileged few in the fable , after a lengthy debate between those who believe the dragon is a fact of life and those who believe the dragon can and should be destroyed , the dragon is finally killed controversy about life extension is due to fear of overpopulation and possible effects on society biogerontologist aubrey de grey counters the overpopulation critique by pointing out that the therapy could postpone or eliminate menopause , allowing women to space out their pregnancies over more years and thus decreasing the yearly population growth rate a spring 2013 pew research poll in the united states found that 38 % of americans would want life extension treatments , and 56 % would reject it 41 % of americans believed that radical life extension ( rle ) would be good for society , while 51 % said they believed it would be bad for society religious people are no more likely to oppose life extension than the unaffiliated , though some variation exists between religious denominations theoretically , extension of maximum lifespan in humans could be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage by tissue engineering , molecular repair or rejuvenation of deteriorated cells and tissues , reversal of harmful epigenetic changes , or the enhancement of enzyme telomerase activity research geared towards life extension strategies in various organisms is currently under way at a number of academic and private institutions since 2009 , investigators have found ways to increase the lifespan of nematode worms and yeast by 10-fold ; the record in nematodes was achieved through genetic engineering and the extension in yeast by a combination of genetic engineering and caloric restriction one notable direction of research has been research into the possibility of using the enzyme telomerase in order to counter the process of telomere shortening according to richard feynman , it was his former graduate student and collaborator albert hibbs who originally suggested to him ( circa 1959 ) the idea of a medical use for feynman 's theoretical nanomachines ( see biological machine ) another proposed life extension technology would combine existing and predicted future biochemical and genetic techniques their study suggests that high levels of iron in the blood likely reduce , and genes involved in metabolising iron likely increase healthy years of life in humans the approach is based on parabiosis studies such as irina conboy do on mice , but conboy says young blood does not reverse aging ( even in mice ) and that those who offer those treatments have misunderstood her research

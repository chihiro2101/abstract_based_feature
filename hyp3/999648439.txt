during the process of aging , an organism accumulates damage to its macromolecules , cells , tissues , and organs '' oxidation damage to cellular contents caused by free radicals is believed to contribute to aging as well the average lifespan in a population is lowered by infant and child mortality , which are frequently linked to infectious diseases or nutrition problems later in life , vulnerability to accidents and age-related chronic disease such as cancer or cardiovascular disease play an increasing role in mortality maximum lifespan is determined by the rate of aging for a species inherent in its genes and by environmental factors widely recognized methods of extending maximum lifespan in model organisms such as nematodes , fruit flies , and mice include caloric restriction , gene manipulation , and administration of pharmaceuticals much life extension research focuses on nutrition—diets or supplements— although there is little evidence that they have an effect in humans the long-term health effects of moderate caloric restriction with sufficient nutrients are unknown the free-radical theory of aging suggests that antioxidant supplements might extend human life reviews , however , have found that vitamin a ( as β-carotene ) and vitamin e supplements may increase mortality there are mixed reports that gh or igf-1 modulates the aging process in humans and about whether the direction of its effect is positive or negative sociologist james hughes claims that science has been tied to a cultural narrative of conquering death since the age of enlightenment he cites francis bacon ( 1561–1626 ) as an advocate of using science and reason to extend human life , noting bacon 's novel new atlantis , wherein scientists worked toward delaying aging and prolonging life regulatory and legal struggles between the food and drug administration ( fda ) and the life extension organization included seizure of merchandise and court action '' william faloon '' , lifeboatfoundation in 2003 , doubleday published '' the immortal cell : one scientist 's quest to solve the mystery of human aging , '' by michael d west emphasised the potential role of embryonic stem cells in life extension in 1991 , the american academy of anti-aging medicine ( a4m ) was formed in 2003 , aubrey de grey and david gobel formed the methuselah foundation , which gives financial grants to anti-aging research projects sens foundation in 2013 , google announced calico , a new company based in san francisco that will harness new technologies to increase scientific understanding of the biology of aging aside from private initiatives , aging research is being conducted in university laboratories , and includes universities such as harvard and ucla university researchers have made a number of breakthroughs in extending the lives of mice and insects by reversing certain aspects of aging '' harvard researchers find protein that could reverse the aging process '' hayflick and fellow biogerontologists jay olshansky and bruce carnes have strongly criticized the anti-aging industry in response to what they see as unscrupulous profiteering from the sale of unproven anti-aging supplements the research shows that when consumers pursue a hoped-for self , it is expectations of success that most strongly drive their motivation to use the product by 2012 , in russia , the united states , israel , and the netherlands , the longevity political parties started a spring 2013 pew research poll in the united states found that 38 % of americans would want life extension treatments , and 56 % would reject it religious people are no more likely to oppose life extension than the unaffiliated , though some variation exists between religious denominations david sinclair says : '' i & nbsp ; do n't see aging as a disease , but as a collection of quite predictable diseases caused by the deterioration of the body '' david gems , assistant director of the institute of healthy ageing , argues that aging should be viewed as a disease one view is , this would stimulate pharmaceutical companies to develop life extension therapies and in the united states of america , it would also increase the regulation of the anti-aging market by the fda anti-aging now falls under the regulations for cosmetic medicine which are less tight than those for drugs research geared towards life extension strategies in various organisms is currently under way at a number of academic and private institutions however , there are potential dangers in this , since some research has also linked telomerase to cancer and to tumor growth and formation future advances in nanomedicine could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging however , critics argue that the uploaded mind would simply be a clone and not a true continuation of a person 's consciousness the approach is based on parabiosis studies such as irina conboy do on mice , but conboy says young blood does not reverse aging ( even in mice ) and that those who offer those treatments have misunderstood her research aubrey de grey : 'we will be able to live to 1,000' v : life extension the fable of the dragon tyrant by philosopher nick bostrom - arguing for life extension research

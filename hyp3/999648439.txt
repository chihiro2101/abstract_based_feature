during the process of aging , an organism accumulates damage to its macromolecules , cells , tissues , and organs '' oxidation damage to cellular contents caused by free radicals is believed to contribute to aging as well oxford university press , usa , , the longest documented human lifespan is 122 years , the case of jeanne calment who according to records was born in 1875 and died in 1997 , whereas the maximum lifespan of a wildtype mouse , commonly used as a model in research on aging , is about three years genetic differences between humans and mice that may account for these different aging rates include differences in efficiency of dna repair , antioxidant defenses , energy metabolism , proteostasis maintenance , and recycling mechanisms such as autophagy later in life , vulnerability to accidents and age-related chronic disease such as cancer or cardiovascular disease play an increasing role in mortality extension of expected lifespan can often be achieved by access to improved medical care , vaccinations , good diet , exercise and avoidance of hazards such as smoking widely recognized methods of extending maximum lifespan in model organisms such as nematodes , fruit flies , and mice include caloric restriction , gene manipulation , and administration of pharmaceuticals some animals such as hydra , planarian , and certain sponges , corals , and jellyfish do not die of old age and exhibit potential immortality much life extension research focuses on nutrition—diets or supplements— although there is little evidence that they have an effect however , a more recent study did not find calorie restriction to improve survival in rhesus monkeys reviews , however , have found that vitamin a ( as β-carotene ) and vitamin e supplements may increase mortality while growth hormone ( gh ) decreases with age , the evidence for use of growth hormone as an anti-aging therapy is mixed and based mostly on animal studies there are mixed reports that gh or igf-1 modulates the aging process in humans and about whether the direction of its effect is positive or negative he cites francis bacon ( 1561–1626 ) as an advocate of using science and reason to extend human life , noting bacon 's novel new atlantis , wherein scientists worked toward delaying aging and prolonging life regulatory and legal struggles between the food and drug administration ( fda ) and the life extension organization included seizure of merchandise and court action andrew zaleski , article in '' is there any truth to anti-aging schemes ? '' , popular sciencejune 12 , 2018 in 1991 , saul kent and bill faloon , the principals of the organization , were jailed for four hours and were released on 850,000 bond each west emphasised the potential role of embryonic stem cells in life extension sens foundation in 2013 , google announced calico , a new company based in san francisco that will harness new technologies to increase scientific understanding of the biology of aging university researchers have made a number of breakthroughs in extending the lives of mice and insects by reversing certain aspects of aging '' harvard researchers find protein that could reverse the aging process '' hayflick and fellow biogerontologists jay olshansky and bruce carnes have strongly criticized the anti-aging industry in response to what they see as unscrupulous profiteering from the sale of unproven anti-aging supplements the research shows that when consumers pursue a hoped-for self , it is expectations of success that most strongly drive their motivation to use the product though many scientists state that life extension and radical life extension are possible , there are still no international or national programs focused on radical life extension in the fable , after a lengthy debate between those who believe the dragon is a fact of life and those who believe the dragon can and should be destroyed , the dragon is finally killed controversy about life extension is due to fear of overpopulation and possible effects on society a spring 2013 pew research poll in the united states found that 38 % of americans would want life extension treatments , and 56 % would reject it however , it also found that 68 % believed most people would want it and that only 4 % consider an '' ideal lifespan '' to be more than 120 years the median '' ideal lifespan '' was 91 years of age and the majority of the public ( 63 % ) viewed medical advances aimed at prolonging life as generally good religious people are no more likely to oppose life extension than the unaffiliated , though some variation exists between religious denominations david sinclair says : '' i & nbsp ; do n't see aging as a disease , but as a collection of quite predictable diseases caused by the deterioration of the body '' theoretically , extension of maximum lifespan in humans could be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage by tissue engineering , molecular repair or rejuvenation of deteriorated cells and tissues , reversal of harmful epigenetic changes , or the enhancement of enzyme telomerase activity research geared towards life extension strategies in various organisms is currently under way at a number of academic and private institutions since 2009 , investigators have found ways to increase the lifespan of nematode worms and yeast by 10-fold ; the record in nematodes was achieved through genetic engineering and the extension in yeast by a combination of genetic engineering and caloric restriction as of 2013 , the longest extension of life caused by a single gene manipulation was roughly 50 % in mice and 10-fold in nematode worms one hypothetical future strategy that , as some suggest , '' eliminates '' the complications related to a physical body , involves the copying or transferring ( e.g the approach is based on parabiosis studies such as irina conboy do on mice , but conboy says young blood does not reverse aging ( even in mice ) and that those who offer those treatments have misunderstood her research aubrey de grey : 'we will be able to live to 1,000' v : life extension the fable of the dragon tyrant by philosopher nick bostrom - arguing for life extension research

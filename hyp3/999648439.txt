during the process of aging , an organism accumulates damage to its macromolecules , cells , tissues , and organs '' oxidation damage to cellular contents caused by free radicals is believed to contribute to aging as well oxford university press , usa , , the longest documented human lifespan is 122 years , the case of jeanne calment who according to records was born in 1875 and died in 1997 , whereas the maximum lifespan of a wildtype mouse , commonly used as a model in research on aging , is about three years genetic differences between humans and mice that may account for these different aging rates include differences in efficiency of dna repair , antioxidant defenses , energy metabolism , proteostasis maintenance , and recycling mechanisms such as autophagy the average lifespan in a population is lowered by infant and child mortality , which are frequently linked to infectious diseases or nutrition problems later in life , vulnerability to accidents and age-related chronic disease such as cancer or cardiovascular disease play an increasing role in mortality extension of expected lifespan can often be achieved by access to improved medical care , vaccinations , good diet , exercise and avoidance of hazards such as smoking maximum lifespan is determined by the rate of aging for a species inherent in its genes and by environmental factors widely recognized methods of extending maximum lifespan in model organisms such as nematodes , fruit flies , and mice include caloric restriction , gene manipulation , and administration of pharmaceuticals much life extension research focuses on nutrition—diets or supplements— although there is little evidence that they have an effect in some studies calorie restriction has been shown to extend the life of mice , yeast , and rhesus monkeys the free-radical theory of aging suggests that antioxidant supplements might extend human life the anti-aging industry offers several hormone therapies while growth hormone ( gh ) decreases with age , the evidence for use of growth hormone as an anti-aging therapy is mixed and based mostly on animal studies there are mixed reports that gh or igf-1 modulates the aging process in humans and about whether the direction of its effect is positive or negative he cites francis bacon ( 1561–1626 ) as an advocate of using science and reason to extend human life , noting bacon 's novel new atlantis , wherein scientists worked toward delaying aging and prolonging life regulatory and legal struggles between the food and drug administration ( fda ) and the life extension organization included seizure of merchandise and court action west emphasised the potential role of embryonic stem cells in life extension in 2009 , de grey and several others founded the sens research foundation , a california-based scientific research organization which conducts research into aging and funds other anti-aging research projects at various universities sens foundation in 2013 , google announced calico , a new company based in san francisco that will harness new technologies to increase scientific understanding of the biology of aging levinson , and its research team includes scientists such as hal v aside from private initiatives , aging research is being conducted in university laboratories , and includes universities such as harvard and ucla '' harvard researchers find protein that could reverse the aging process '' for example , leonard hayflick , who determined that fibroblasts are limited to around 50 & nbsp ; cell divisions , reasons that aging is an unavoidable consequence of entropy research by sobh and martin ( 2011 ) suggests that people buy anti-aging products to obtain a hoped-for self ( e.g the research also shows why doing badly when trying to avoid a feared self is more motivating than doing well when product use is seen to fail it is more motivating than success when consumers seek to avoid a feared-self though many scientists state that life extension and radical life extension are possible , there are still no international or national programs focused on radical life extension transhumanist philosopher nick bostrom has argued that any technological advances in life extension must be equitably distributed and not restricted to a privileged few a spring 2013 pew research poll in the united states found that 38 % of americans would want life extension treatments , and 56 % would reject it the median '' ideal lifespan '' was 91 years of age and the majority of the public ( 63 % ) viewed medical advances aimed at prolonging life as generally good 41 % of americans believed that radical life extension ( rle ) would be good for society , while 51 % said they believed it would be bad for society research geared towards life extension strategies in various organisms is currently under way at a number of academic and private institutions recently , the us department of defense initiated a program to research the possibility of growing human body parts on mice replacement of biological ( susceptible to diseases ) organs with mechanical ones could extend life a large array of genetic modifications have been found to increase lifespan in model organisms such as yeast , nematode worms , fruit flies , and mice aubrey de grey : 'we will be able to live to 1,000' v : life extension the fable of the dragon tyrant by philosopher nick bostrom - arguing for life extension research

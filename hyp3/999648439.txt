average and maximum lifespan during the process of aging , an organism accumulates damage to its macromolecules , cells , tissues , and organs '' oxidation damage to cellular contents caused by free radicals is believed to contribute to aging as well the average lifespan in a population is lowered by infant and child mortality , which are frequently linked to infectious diseases or nutrition problems later in life , vulnerability to accidents and age-related chronic disease such as cancer or cardiovascular disease play an increasing role in mortality extension of expected lifespan can often be achieved by access to improved medical care , vaccinations , good diet , exercise and avoidance of hazards such as smoking maximum lifespan is determined by the rate of aging for a species inherent in its genes and by environmental factors some animals such as hydra , planarian , and certain sponges , corals , and jellyfish do not die of old age and exhibit potential immortality much life extension research focuses on nutrition—diets or supplements— although there is little evidence that they have an effect in some studies calorie restriction has been shown to extend the life of mice , yeast , and rhesus monkeys in humans the long-term health effects of moderate caloric restriction with sufficient nutrients are unknown the free-radical theory of aging suggests that antioxidant supplements might extend human life the anti-aging industry offers several hormone therapies for example , the american medical association has been critical of some anti-aging hormone therapies while growth hormone ( gh ) decreases with age , the evidence for use of growth hormone as an anti-aging therapy is mixed and based mostly on animal studies biologist alexis carrel ( 1873–1944 ) was inspired by a belief in indefinite human lifespan that he developed after experimenting with cells , says hughes regulatory and legal struggles between the food and drug administration ( fda ) and the life extension organization included seizure of merchandise and court action west emphasised the potential role of embryonic stem cells in life extension , a company dedicated to scientific research to end aging through genomics and cell therapy '' harvard researchers find protein that could reverse the aging process '' for example , leonard hayflick , who determined that fibroblasts are limited to around 50 & nbsp ; cell divisions , reasons that aging is an unavoidable consequence of entropy the research also shows why doing badly when trying to avoid a feared self is more motivating than doing well though many scientists state that life extension and radical life extension are possible , there are still no international or national programs focused on radical life extension there are political forces staying for and against life extension leon kass ( chairman of the us president 's council on bioethics from 2001 to 2005 ) has questioned whether potential exacerbation of overpopulation problems would make life extension unethical in an extended metaphor entitled '' the fable of the dragon-tyrant '' , bostrom envisions death as a monstrous dragon who demands human sacrifices in the fable , after a lengthy debate between those who believe the dragon is a fact of life and those who believe the dragon can and should be destroyed , the dragon is finally killed moreover , the philosopher and futurist max more argues that , given the fact the worldwide population growth rate is slowing down and is projected to eventually stabilize and begin falling , superlongevity would be unlikely to contribute to overpopulation a spring 2013 pew research poll in the united states found that 38 % of americans would want life extension treatments , and 56 % would reject it the median '' ideal lifespan '' was 91 years of age and the majority of the public ( 63 % ) viewed medical advances aimed at prolonging life as generally good 41 % of americans believed that radical life extension ( rle ) would be good for society , while 51 % said they believed it would be bad for society longevity gains from dietary restriction , or from mutations studied previously , yield smaller benefits to drosophila than to nematodes , and smaller still to mammals future advances in nanomedicine could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging their study suggests that high levels of iron in the blood likely reduce , and genes involved in metabolising iron likely increase healthy years of life in humans one hypothetical future strategy that , as some suggest , '' eliminates '' the complications related to a physical body , involves the copying or transferring ( e.g the approach is based on parabiosis studies such as irina conboy do on mice , but conboy says young blood does not reverse aging ( even in mice ) and that those who offer those treatments have misunderstood her research aubrey de grey : 'we will be able to live to 1,000' v : life extension the fable of the dragon tyrant by philosopher nick bostrom - arguing for life extension research

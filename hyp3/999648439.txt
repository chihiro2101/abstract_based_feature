average and maximum lifespan during the process of aging , an organism accumulates damage to its macromolecules , cells , tissues , and organs '' oxidation damage to cellular contents caused by free radicals is believed to contribute to aging as well the average lifespan in a population is lowered by infant and child mortality , which are frequently linked to infectious diseases or nutrition problems later in life , vulnerability to accidents and age-related chronic disease such as cancer or cardiovascular disease play an increasing role in mortality extension of expected lifespan can often be achieved by access to improved medical care , vaccinations , good diet , exercise and avoidance of hazards such as smoking maximum lifespan is determined by the rate of aging for a species inherent in its genes and by environmental factors widely recognized methods of extending maximum lifespan in model organisms such as nematodes , fruit flies , and mice include caloric restriction , gene manipulation , and administration of pharmaceuticals another technique uses evolutionary pressures such as breeding from only older members or altering levels of extrinsic mortality much life extension research focuses on nutrition—diets or supplements— although there is little evidence that they have an effect however , a more recent study did not find calorie restriction to improve survival in rhesus monkeys the free-radical theory of aging suggests that antioxidant supplements might extend human life for example , the american medical association has been critical of some anti-aging hormone therapies while growth hormone ( gh ) decreases with age , the evidence for use of growth hormone as an anti-aging therapy is mixed and based mostly on animal studies biologist alexis carrel ( 1873–1944 ) was inspired by a belief in indefinite human lifespan that he developed after experimenting with cells , says hughes '' william faloon '' , lifeboatfoundation in 2003 , doubleday published '' the immortal cell : one scientist 's quest to solve the mystery of human aging , '' by michael d west emphasised the potential role of embryonic stem cells in life extension sens foundation in 2013 , google announced calico , a new company based in san francisco that will harness new technologies to increase scientific understanding of the biology of aging university researchers have made a number of breakthroughs in extending the lives of mice and insects by reversing certain aspects of aging hayflick and fellow biogerontologists jay olshansky and bruce carnes have strongly criticized the anti-aging industry in response to what they see as unscrupulous profiteering from the sale of unproven anti-aging supplements research by sobh and martin ( 2011 ) suggests that people buy anti-aging products to obtain a hoped-for self ( e.g the research shows that when consumers pursue a hoped-for self , it is expectations of success that most strongly drive their motivation to use the product the research also shows why doing badly when trying to avoid a feared self is more motivating than doing well though many scientists state that life extension and radical life extension are possible , there are still no international or national programs focused on radical life extension some tech innovators and silicon valley entrepreneurs have invested heavily into anti-aging research leon kass ( chairman of the us president 's council on bioethics from 2001 to 2005 ) has questioned whether potential exacerbation of overpopulation problems would make life extension unethical in an extended metaphor entitled '' the fable of the dragon-tyrant '' , bostrom envisions death as a monstrous dragon who demands human sacrifices in the fable , after a lengthy debate between those who believe the dragon is a fact of life and those who believe the dragon can and should be destroyed , the dragon is finally killed moreover , the philosopher and futurist max more argues that , given the fact the worldwide population growth rate is slowing down and is projected to eventually stabilize and begin falling , superlongevity would be unlikely to contribute to overpopulation one possibility for why 56 % of americans claim they would reject life extension treatments may be due to the cultural perception that living longer would result in a longer period of decrepitude , and that the elderly in our current society are unhealthy religious people are no more likely to oppose life extension than the unaffiliated , though some variation exists between religious denominations since 2009 , investigators have found ways to increase the lifespan of nematode worms and yeast by 10-fold ; the record in nematodes was achieved through genetic engineering and the extension in yeast by a combination of genetic engineering and caloric restriction a 2009 review of longevity research noted : '' extrapolation from worms to mammals is risky at best , and it can not be assumed that interventions will result in comparable life extension factors another proposed life extension technology would combine existing and predicted future biochemical and genetic techniques however , critics argue that the uploaded mind would simply be a clone and not a true continuation of a person 's consciousness the approach is based on parabiosis studies such as irina conboy do on mice , but conboy says young blood does not reverse aging ( even in mice ) and that those who offer those treatments have misunderstood her research aubrey de grey : 'we will be able to live to 1,000' v : life extension the fable of the dragon tyrant by philosopher nick bostrom - arguing for life extension research

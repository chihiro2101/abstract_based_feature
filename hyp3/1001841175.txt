the global average and combined land and ocean surface temperature , show a warming of 0.85 0.65 to 1.06 °c , in the period 1880 to 2012 , based on multiple independently produced datasets the trend is faster for land than ocean , faster for arctic regions , and faster since the 1970s than the longer period warming in the instrumental temperature record , in some of the temperature variations over this time period may also be due to ocean circulation patterns attribution of the temperature change to natural or anthropogenic ( i.e , human-induced ) factors is an important question : see global warming and attribution of recent climate change land air temperatures are rising faster than sea surface temperatures ipcc ar5 wg1 chapter 2 page 187 and page 192 for 1979 to 2012 , the linear warming trend for combined land and sea temperatures has been 0.155 & nbsp ; °c ( 0.122 to 0.188 & nbsp ; °c ) per decade , according to ar5 uncertainties in the temperature record , e.g , the urban heat island effect , are discussed further in a later section this marked the third consecutive year reaching a new record temperature , the first time since the current warming trend began in the 1970s that three years in a row were record highs 2016 's record meant that 16 of the 17 warmest years have occurred since 2000 , 2017 being the third-hottest year on record meant that 17 of the last 18 warmest years have occurred since 2000 '' of the 2015 and 2016 records , schmidt stated that the 2014–16 el niño event was '' a factor el niño generally tends to increase global temperatures el niño is the warm phase of the el niño–southern oscillation ( enso ) and la niña the cold phase records of global average surface temperature are usually presented as anomalies rather than as absolute temperatures a temperature anomaly is measured against a reference value or long-term average for example , if the reference value is 15 & nbsp ; °c , and the measured temperature is 17 & nbsp ; °c , then the temperature anomaly is +2 & nbsp ; °c ( i.e temperature anomalies are useful for deriving average surface temperatures because they tend to be highly correlated over large distances ( of the order of 1000 & nbsp ; km ) by comparison , absolute temperatures vary markedly over even short distances given the difference in uncertainties between this absolute value and any annual anomaly , it 's not valid to add them together to imply a precise absolute value for a specific year the period for which reasonably reliable instrumental records of near-surface temperature exist with quasi-global coverage is generally considered to begin around 1850 the temperature data for the record come from measurements from land stations and ships the sea record consists of surface ships taking sea temperature measurements from engine inlets or buckets png thumb upright 1.35 alt refer to caption this graph shows how short-term variations occur in the global temperature record even accounting for the presence of internal climate variability , recent years rank among the warmest on record also , noaa 's national climatic data center ( ncdc ) ncdc state of the climate global analysis , april 2010 of surface temperature measurements maintains a global temperature record since 1880

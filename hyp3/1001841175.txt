the global average and combined land and ocean surface temperature , show a warming of 0.85 0.65 to 1.06 °c , in the period 1880 to 2012 , based on multiple independently produced datasets this gives a trend of 0.064 ± 0.015 & nbsp ; °c per decade over that period the trend is faster for land than ocean , faster for arctic regions , and faster since the 1970s than the longer period warming in the instrumental temperature record , in some of the temperature variations over this time period may also be due to ocean circulation patterns , human-induced ) factors is an important question : see global warming and attribution of recent climate change this marked the third consecutive year reaching a new record temperature , the first time since the current warming trend began in the 1970s that three years in a row were record highs 2016 's record meant that 16 of the 17 warmest years have occurred since 2000 , 2017 being the third-hottest year on record meant that 17 of the last 18 warmest years have occurred since 2000 while record-breaking years can attract considerable public interest , individual years are less significant than the overall trend but both 2015 and 2016 would have been records even without it '' ; he attributed about 90 % of the warming in 2016 to global warming '' arndt also stated that the '' long-term warming is driven almost entirely by greenhouse gases this long-term trend is the main cause for the record warmth of 2015 and 2016 , surpassing all previous years—even ones with strong el niño events greenhouse gases trap outgoing radiation warming the atmosphere which in turn warms the land el niño generally tends to increase global temperatures el niño is the warm phase of the el niño–southern oscillation ( enso ) and la niña the cold phase for example , if the reference value is 15 & nbsp ; °c , and the measured temperature is 17 & nbsp ; °c , then the temperature anomaly is +2 & nbsp ; °c ( i.e in other words , anomalies are representative of temperature changes over large areas and distances the temperature data for the record come from measurements from land stations and ships on land , temperature sensors are kept in a stevenson screen or a mmts ( meteorology ) centers such as ecmwf show instantaneous map of their coverage ; or the hadley centre show the coverage for the average of the year 2000 coverage for earlier in the 20th and 19th centuries would be significantly less while temperature changes vary both in size and direction from one location to another , the numbers from different locations are combined to produce an estimate of a global average change however , the graph still shows a long-term trend of global warming temperature trends from 1901 are positive over most of the world 's surface except for atlantic ocean south of greenland , the southeastern united states , and parts of bolivia 3 , observations : atmospheric surface and climate change , section 3.2.2.2 : urban heat islands and land use effects , p 95 % of the stations displayed a warming trend after land use/land cover changes took place , and the authors noted '' this does not necessarily imply that the changes are the causative factor a study in 2013 also found that urban bias can be accounted for , and when all available station data is divided into rural and urban , that both temperature sets are broadly consistent

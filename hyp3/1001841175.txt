the global average and combined land and ocean surface temperature , show a warming of 0.85 0.65 to 1.06 °c , in the period 1880 to 2012 , based on multiple independently produced datasets this gives a trend of 0.064 ± 0.015 & nbsp ; °c per decade over that period the trend is faster for land than ocean , faster for arctic regions , and faster since the 1970s than the longer period warming in the instrumental temperature record , in some of the temperature variations over this time period may also be due to ocean circulation patterns attribution of the temperature change to natural or anthropogenic ( i.e , human-induced ) factors is an important question : see global warming and attribution of recent climate change land air temperatures are rising faster than sea surface temperatures this marked the third consecutive year reaching a new record temperature , the first time since the current warming trend began in the 1970s that three years in a row were record highs '' of the 2015 and 2016 records , schmidt stated that the 2014–16 el niño event was '' a factor but both 2015 and 2016 would have been records even without it '' ; he attributed about 90 % of the warming in 2016 to global warming el niño generally tends to increase global temperatures la niña , on the other hand , usually causes years which are cooler than the short-term average records of global average surface temperature are usually presented as anomalies rather than as absolute temperatures temperature anomalies are useful for deriving average surface temperatures because they tend to be highly correlated over large distances ( of the order of 1000 & nbsp ; km ) in other words , anomalies are representative of temperature changes over large areas and distances by comparison , absolute temperatures vary markedly over even short distances the temperature data for the record come from measurements from land stations and ships on land , temperature sensors are kept in a stevenson screen or a mmts ( meteorology ) the sea record consists of surface ships taking sea temperature measurements from engine inlets or buckets standardization of methods is organized through the world meteorological organization ( and formerly through its predecessor , the international meteorological organization ) there is a scientific opinion on climate change and that greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver the scientific consensus is reflected , for example , by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) , an international body which summarizes existing science , and the u.s temperature trends from 1901 are positive over most of the world 's surface except for atlantic ocean south of greenland , the southeastern united states , and parts of bolivia 3 , observations : atmospheric surface and climate change , section 3.2.2.2 : urban heat islands and land use effects , p surface stations ; results indicate relatively few significant temperature trends , and these are generally evenly divided between warming and cooling trends . global surface and ocean datasets

the global average and combined land and ocean surface temperature , show a warming of 0.85 0.65 to 1.06 °c , in the period 1880 to 2012 , based on multiple independently produced datasets this gives a trend of 0.064 ± 0.015 & nbsp ; °c per decade over that period the trend is faster for land than ocean , faster for arctic regions , and faster since the 1970s than the longer period warming in the instrumental temperature record , in some of the temperature variations over this time period may also be due to ocean circulation patterns , human-induced ) factors is an important question : see global warming and attribution of recent climate change land air temperatures are rising faster than sea surface temperatures this marked the third consecutive year reaching a new record temperature , the first time since the current warming trend began in the 1970s that three years in a row were record highs 2016 's record meant that 16 of the 17 warmest years have occurred since 2000 , 2017 being the third-hottest year on record meant that 17 of the last 18 warmest years have occurred since 2000 but both 2015 and 2016 would have been records even without it '' ; he attributed about 90 % of the warming in 2016 to global warming el niño generally tends to increase global temperatures el niño is the warm phase of the el niño–southern oscillation ( enso ) and la niña the cold phase land use change like deforestation can increase greenhouse gases through burning biomass records of global average surface temperature are usually presented as anomalies rather than as absolute temperatures temperature anomalies are useful for deriving average surface temperatures because they tend to be highly correlated over large distances ( of the order of 1000 & nbsp ; km ) in other words , anomalies are representative of temperature changes over large areas and distances by comparison , absolute temperatures vary markedly over even short distances the period for which reasonably reliable instrumental records of near-surface temperature exist with quasi-global coverage is generally considered to begin around 1850 on land , temperature sensors are kept in a stevenson screen or a mmts ( meteorology ) the sea record consists of surface ships taking sea temperature measurements from engine inlets or buckets centers such as ecmwf show instantaneous map of their coverage ; or the hadley centre show the coverage for the average of the year 2000 , see edited quote from public-domain source : this view ignores the presence of internal climate variability file:20190909 stacked country warming stripes and global average ( 1901- ) temperature trends from 1901 are positive over most of the world 's surface except for atlantic ocean south of greenland , the southeastern united states , and parts of bolivia the antarctic peninsula has warmed by 2.5 & nbsp ; °c ( 4.5 & nbsp ; °f ) in the past five decades at bellingshausen station surface stations ; results indicate relatively few significant temperature trends , and these are generally evenly divided between warming and cooling trends . global surface and ocean datasets

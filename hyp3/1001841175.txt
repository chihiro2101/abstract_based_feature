the global average and combined land and ocean surface temperature , show a warming of 0.85 0.65 to 1.06 °c , in the period 1880 to 2012 , based on multiple independently produced datasets this gives a trend of 0.064 ± 0.015 & nbsp ; °c per decade over that period the trend is faster for land than ocean , faster for arctic regions , and faster since the 1970s than the longer period warming in the instrumental temperature record most of the observed warming occurred in two periods : around 1900 to around 1940 and around 1970 onwards ; ipcc ar5 chapter 2 page 193 the cooling/plateau from 1940 to 1970 has been mostly attributed to sulphate aerosol , in some of the temperature variations over this time period may also be due to ocean circulation patterns , human-induced ) factors is an important question : see global warming and attribution of recent climate change land air temperatures are rising faster than sea surface temperatures ipcc ar5 wg1 chapter 2 page 187 and page 192 for 1979 to 2012 , the linear warming trend for combined land and sea temperatures has been 0.155 & nbsp ; °c ( 0.122 to 0.188 & nbsp ; °c ) per decade , according to ar5 this marked the third consecutive year reaching a new record temperature , the first time since the current warming trend began in the 1970s that three years in a row were record highs some climatologists have criticized the attention that the popular press gives to '' warmest year '' statistics ; for example , gavin schmidt stated '' the long-term trends or the expected sequence of records are far more important than whether any single year is a record or not consistent with schmidt 's comment , the nasa / noaa announcement stated that '' globally-averaged temperatures in 2016 were 1.78 degrees fahrenheit ( 0.99 degrees celsius ) warmer than the mid-20th century mean '' and that the impact of el niño warming was estimated to have '' increased the annual global temperature anomaly for 2016 by 0.2 degrees fahrenheit ( 0.12 degrees celsius ) '' comments from climate scientists reported in the washington post showed strong agreement in attributing the warming primarily to anthropogenic climate change , with some contribution from el niño warming , though there were differing views on the significance of individual records deke arndt leads the monitoring group at noaa 's national centers for environmental information and offered an analogy in a report on npr : '' the long-term warming is a lot like riding up an escalator over time '' peter stott , acting director of the met office , noted the influence of the el niño event on 2016 temperatures but also stated that '' the main contributor to warming over the last 150 years is human influence on climate from increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere this long-term trend is the main cause for the record warmth of 2015 and 2016 , surpassing all previous years—even ones with strong el niño events greenhouse gases trap outgoing radiation warming the atmosphere which in turn warms the land incoming solar radiation varies very slightly , with the main variation controlled by the approximately 11-year solar cycle records of global average surface temperature are usually presented as anomalies rather than as absolute temperatures for example , if the reference value is 15 & nbsp ; °c , and the measured temperature is 17 & nbsp ; °c , then the temperature anomaly is +2 & nbsp ; °c ( i.e temperature anomalies are useful for deriving average surface temperatures because they tend to be highly correlated over large distances ( of the order of 1000 & nbsp ; km ) the earth 's average surface absolute temperature for the 1961–1990 period has been derived by spatial interpolation of average observed near-surface air temperatures from over the land , oceans and sea ice regions , with a best estimate of 14 & nbsp ; °c ( 57.2 & nbsp ; °f ) the temperature data for the record come from measurements from land stations and ships the sea record consists of surface ships taking sea temperature measurements from engine inlets or buckets temperature trends from 1901 are positive over most of the world 's surface except for atlantic ocean south of greenland , the southeastern united states , and parts of bolivia a study in 2013 also found that urban bias can be accounted for , and when all available station data is divided into rural and urban , that both temperature sets are broadly consistent also , noaa 's national climatic data center ( ncdc ) ncdc state of the climate global analysis , april 2010 of surface temperature measurements maintains a global temperature record since 1880

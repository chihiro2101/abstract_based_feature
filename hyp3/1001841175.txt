the global average and combined land and ocean surface temperature , show a warming of 0.85 0.65 to 1.06 °c , in the period 1880 to 2012 , based on multiple independently produced datasets the trend is faster for land than ocean , faster for arctic regions , and faster since the 1970s than the longer period warming in the instrumental temperature record most of the observed warming occurred in two periods : around 1900 to around 1940 and around 1970 onwards ; ipcc ar5 chapter 2 page 193 the cooling/plateau from 1940 to 1970 has been mostly attributed to sulphate aerosol , in some of the temperature variations over this time period may also be due to ocean circulation patterns , human-induced ) factors is an important question : see global warming and attribution of recent climate change land air temperatures are rising faster than sea surface temperatures ipcc ar5 wg1 chapter 2 page 187 and page 192 for 1979 to 2012 , the linear warming trend for combined land and sea temperatures has been 0.155 & nbsp ; °c ( 0.122 to 0.188 & nbsp ; °c ) per decade , according to ar5 ipcc ar5 wg1 chapter 2 p193 the ipcc fourth assessment report found that the instrumental temperature record for the past century included urban heat island effects but that these were primarily local , having a negligible influence on global temperature trends ( less than 0.006 & nbsp ; °c per decade over land and zero over the oceans ) in january 2017 , several scientific agencies around the world , including nasa and the noaa in the united states and the met office in the united kingdom , named 2016 the warmest year recorded this marked the third consecutive year reaching a new record temperature , the first time since the current warming trend began in the 1970s that three years in a row were record highs '' arndt also stated that the '' long-term warming is driven almost entirely by greenhouse gases '' peter stott , acting director of the met office , noted the influence of the el niño event on 2016 temperatures but also stated that '' the main contributor to warming over the last 150 years is human influence on climate from increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere this long-term trend is the main cause for the record warmth of 2015 and 2016 , surpassing all previous years—even ones with strong el niño events '' based on the noaa dataset ( note that other datasets produce different rankings the following table lists the global combined land and ocean annually averaged temperature rank and anomaly for each of the 10 warmest years on record incoming solar radiation varies very slightly , with the main variation controlled by the approximately 11-year solar cycle records of global average surface temperature are usually presented as anomalies rather than as absolute temperatures for example , if the reference value is 15 & nbsp ; °c , and the measured temperature is 17 & nbsp ; °c , then the temperature anomaly is +2 & nbsp ; °c ( i.e temperature anomalies are useful for deriving average surface temperatures because they tend to be highly correlated over large distances ( of the order of 1000 & nbsp ; km ) the earth 's average surface absolute temperature for the 1961–1990 period has been derived by spatial interpolation of average observed near-surface air temperatures from over the land , oceans and sea ice regions , with a best estimate of 14 & nbsp ; °c ( 57.2 & nbsp ; °f ) the temperature data for the record come from measurements from land stations and ships the sea record consists of surface ships taking sea temperature measurements from engine inlets or buckets standardization of methods is organized through the world meteorological organization ( and formerly through its predecessor , the international meteorological organization ) while temperature changes vary both in size and direction from one location to another , the numbers from different locations are combined to produce an estimate of a global average change the methods used to derive the principal estimates of global surface temperature trends—hadcrut3 , noaa and nasa/giss—are largely independent 3 , observations : atmospheric surface and climate change , section 3.2.2.2 : urban heat islands and land use effects , p also , noaa 's national climatic data center ( ncdc ) ncdc state of the climate global analysis , april 2010 of surface temperature measurements maintains a global temperature record since 1880

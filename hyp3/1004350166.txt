arrhidaeus ' whereabouts during the reign of his brother alexander are unclear from the extant sources ; what is certain is that no civil or military command was given to him in those thirteen years ( 336â€“323 bc ) a conflict then arose between perdiccas , leader of the cavalry , and meleager , who commanded the phalanx : the first wanted to wait to see if roxana , alexander 's pregnant wife , would deliver a male baby , while the second objected that arrhidaeus was the closest living relative and so should be chosen king meleager was killed , and a compromise was engineered : arrhidaeus would become king , with the name of philip , and he would be joined by roxana 's yet-unborn child as co-sovereign should that child prove a male it was immediately decided that philip arrhidaeus would reign , but not rule : this was to be the prerogative of the new regent , perdiccas when news arrived in macedonia that arrhidaeus had been chosen as king , cynane , a daughter of philip ii , developed a plan to travel to asia and offer the new king her daughter eurydice for wife cassander 's refusal to accept his father 's decision sparked the second war of the diadochi , in which eurydice saw once again a chance to free philip from the control of the regent eurydice immediately allied herself with cassander and persuaded her husband to nominate him as the new regent in renault 's version , the villainous cassander slows down his advance on macedonia to give olympias enough time to kill arrhidaeus and eurydice

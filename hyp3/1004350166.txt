arrhidaeus ' whereabouts during the reign of his brother alexander are unclear from the extant sources ; what is certain is that no civil or military command was given to him in those thirteen years ( 336â€“323 bc ) a conflict then arose between perdiccas , leader of the cavalry , and meleager , who commanded the phalanx : the first wanted to wait to see if roxana , alexander 's pregnant wife , would deliver a male baby , while the second objected that arrhidaeus was the closest living relative and so should be chosen king meleager was killed , and a compromise was engineered : arrhidaeus would become king , with the name of philip , and he would be joined by roxana 's yet-unborn child as co-sovereign should that child prove a male it was immediately decided that philip arrhidaeus would reign , but not rule : this was to be the prerogative of the new regent , perdiccas when news arrived in macedonia that arrhidaeus had been chosen as king , cynane , a daughter of philip ii , developed a plan to travel to asia and offer the new king her daughter eurydice for wife eurydice 's chance to increase her husband 's power came when the first war of the diadochi sealed the fate of perdiccas , making a new settlement necessary eurydice moved deftly enough to achieve the removal of the first two designated regents , peithon and arrhidaeus ( a namesake of her husband ) , but was powerless to block the aspirations of antipater , whose position proved too powerful , and the latter was made the new regent ; philip arrhidaeus and eurydice were forced to follow antipater back to macedonia manolis andronikos , the chief archaeologist at the site , along with a number of other archaeologists , decided it was the skeleton of philip ii , but others have disputed this attribution and instead proposed it to be the remains of philip arrhidaeus

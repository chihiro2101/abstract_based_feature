'' ouzel '' may also be applied to a group of superficially similar but more distantly related birds , the dippers , the european representative of which is sometimes known as the water ouzel '' ring ouzel '' was first used by john ray in his 1674 collection of english words not generally used and became established with his 1678 the ornithology of francis willughby of middleton in the county of warwick as with the english name , the scientific name also refers to the male 's obvious white neck crescent , being derived from the latin words turdus , '' thrush '' , and torquatus , '' collared '' although two european thrushes , the song thrush and mistle thrush , are early offshoots from the eurasian lineage of turdus thrushes after they spread north from africa , the ring ousel is descended from ancestors that had colonised the caribbean islands from africa and subsequently reached europe from there a 2007 mitochondrial cytochrome b gene analysis showed that the species found in europe and asia diverged from south american ‘ ’ turdus ’ ’ thrushes between 1.2-3.7 mya detailed of the study suggests that the ring ouzel , a member of the eurasian group , may be more closely related to naumann 's thrush rather than the superficially more similar common blackbird the ring ouzel has three subspecies : northern ring ouzel , turdus torquatus torquatus linnaeus ( 1758 ) breeds across western and northern europe from ireland through scandinavia to northwest russia , winters in southern europe and northwest africa alpestris brehm , c l ( 1831 ) breeds in mountain ranges from iberia through southern and central europe to the balkans , greece and western turkey , also north africa the ring ouzel breeds discontinuously across western and northern europe from north-west ireland through scandinavia to northwest russia , and across and central southern europe in mountains from the pyrenees through the alps , the balkans , greece and turkey east to turkmenistan the ring ouzel has an extensive range , estimated at , and a large population , estimated at 600,000–2 million individuals in europe ( which comprises 95 % of the breeding range )

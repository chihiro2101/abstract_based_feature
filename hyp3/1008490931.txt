following the initial chondrification that occurs during embryogenesis , cartilage growth consists mostly of the maturing of immature cartilage to a more mature state the division of cells within cartilage occurs very slowly , and thus growth in cartilage is usually not based on an increase in size or mass of the cartilage itself the articular cartilage function is dependent on the molecular composition of the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) the main proteoglycan in cartilage is aggrecan , which , as its name suggests , forms large aggregates with hyaluronan cartilage growth thus refers to the matrix deposition , but can also refer to both the growth and remodeling of the extracellular matrix due to the great stress on the patellofemoral joint during resisted knee extension , the articular cartilage of the patella is among the thickest in the human body lubricin , a glycoprotein abundant in cartilage and synovial fluid , plays a major role in bio-lubrication and wear protection of cartilage also , because hyaline cartilage does not have a blood supply , the deposition of new matrix is slow a tear of meniscus of the knee cartilage can often be surgically trimmed to reduce problems osteoarthritis : osteoarthritis is a disease of the whole joint , however , one of the most affected tissues is the articular cartilage traumatic rupture or detachment : the cartilage in the knee is frequently damaged but can be partially repaired through knee cartilage replacement therapy often when athletes talk of damaged '' cartilage '' in their knee , they are referring to a damaged meniscus ( a fibrocartilage structure ) and not the articular cartilage it is a vesicular cell-rich cartilage due to the large , spherical and vacuolated chondrocytes with no homologies in other arthropods the cephalopod cranial cartilage is the invertebrate cartilage that shows more resemblance to the vertebrate hyaline cartilage this implies that the cartilage is fibrillar-collagen-based the cartilage growth pattern is the same as in vertebrate cartilage

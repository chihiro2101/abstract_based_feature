following the initial chondrification that occurs during embryogenesis , cartilage growth consists mostly of the maturing of immature cartilage to a more mature state the division of cells within cartilage occurs very slowly , and thus growth in cartilage is usually not based on an increase in size or mass of the cartilage itself the articular cartilage function is dependent on the molecular composition of the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) cartilage growth thus refers to the matrix deposition , but can also refer to both the growth and remodeling of the extracellular matrix the mechanical properties of articular cartilage in load-bearing joints such as the knee and hip have been studied extensively at macro , micro , and nano-scales these mechanical properties include the response of cartilage in frictional , compressive , shear and tensile loading lubricin , a glycoprotein abundant in cartilage and synovial fluid , plays a major role in bio-lubrication and wear protection of cartilage cartilage has limited repair capabilities : because chondrocytes are bound in lacunae , they can not migrate to damaged areas also , because hyaline cartilage does not have a blood supply , the deposition of new matrix is slow a tear of meniscus of the knee cartilage can often be surgically trimmed to reduce problems some common diseases that affect the cartilage are listed below osteoarthritis : osteoarthritis is a disease of the whole joint , however , one of the most affected tissues is the articular cartilage the embryos of limulus polyphemus express cola and hyaluronan in the gill cartilage and the endosternite , which indicates that these tissues are fibrillar-collagen-based cartilage the cephalopod cranial cartilage is the invertebrate cartilage that shows more resemblance to the vertebrate hyaline cartilage the cartilage growth pattern is the same as in vertebrate cartilage the sabellidae , or feather duster worms , have cartilage tissue with cellular and matrix specialization supporting their tentacles

following the initial chondrification that occurs during embryogenesis , cartilage growth consists mostly of the maturing of immature cartilage to a more mature state the division of cells within cartilage occurs very slowly , and thus growth in cartilage is usually not based on an increase in size or mass of the cartilage itself the main proteoglycan in cartilage is aggrecan , which , as its name suggests , forms large aggregates with hyaluronan cartilage growth thus refers to the matrix deposition , but can also refer to both the growth and remodeling of the extracellular matrix due to the great stress on the patellofemoral joint during resisted knee extension , the articular cartilage of the patella is among the thickest in the human body the mechanical properties of articular cartilage in load-bearing joints such as the knee and hip have been studied extensively at macro , micro , and nano-scales lubricin , a glycoprotein abundant in cartilage and synovial fluid , plays a major role in bio-lubrication and wear protection of cartilage also , because hyaline cartilage does not have a blood supply , the deposition of new matrix is slow a tear of meniscus of the knee cartilage can often be surgically trimmed to reduce problems osteoarthritis : osteoarthritis is a disease of the whole joint , however , one of the most affected tissues is the articular cartilage other type of cartilage found in limulus polyphemus is the endosternite cartilage , a fibrous-hyaline cartilage with chondrocytes of typical morphology in a fibrous component , much more fibrous than vertebrate hyaline cartilage , with mucopolysaccharides immunoreactive against chondroitin sulfate antibodies the embryos of limulus polyphemus express cola and hyaluronan in the gill cartilage and the endosternite , which indicates that these tissues are fibrillar-collagen-based cartilage the endosternite cartilage forms close to hh-expressing ventral nerve cords and expresses cola and soxe , a sox9 analog the cephalopod cranial cartilage is the invertebrate cartilage that shows more resemblance to the vertebrate hyaline cartilage the cartilage growth pattern is the same as in vertebrate cartilage the sabellidae , or feather duster worms , have cartilage tissue with cellular and matrix specialization supporting their tentacles

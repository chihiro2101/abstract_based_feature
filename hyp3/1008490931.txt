following the initial chondrification that occurs during embryogenesis , cartilage growth consists mostly of the maturing of immature cartilage to a more mature state the division of cells within cartilage occurs very slowly , and thus growth in cartilage is usually not based on an increase in size or mass of the cartilage itself the articular cartilage function is dependent on the molecular composition of the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) the main proteoglycan in cartilage is aggrecan , which , as its name suggests , forms large aggregates with hyaluronan cartilage growth thus refers to the matrix deposition , but can also refer to both the growth and remodeling of the extracellular matrix lubricin , a glycoprotein abundant in cartilage and synovial fluid , plays a major role in bio-lubrication and wear protection of cartilage cartilage has limited repair capabilities : because chondrocytes are bound in lacunae , they can not migrate to damaged areas also , because hyaline cartilage does not have a blood supply , the deposition of new matrix is slow biological engineering techniques are being developed to generate new cartilage , using a cellular '' scaffolding '' material and cultured cells to grow artificial cartilage the cartilage covering bones ( articular cartilageâ€”a subset of hyaline cartilage ) is thinned , eventually completely wearing away , resulting in a '' bone against bone '' within the joint , leading to reduced motion , and pain often when athletes talk of damaged '' cartilage '' in their knee , they are referring to a damaged meniscus ( a fibrocartilage structure ) and not the articular cartilage other type of cartilage found in limulus polyphemus is the endosternite cartilage , a fibrous-hyaline cartilage with chondrocytes of typical morphology in a fibrous component , much more fibrous than vertebrate hyaline cartilage , with mucopolysaccharides immunoreactive against chondroitin sulfate antibodies the cephalopod cranial cartilage is the invertebrate cartilage that shows more resemblance to the vertebrate hyaline cartilage the odontophore is a vesicular cell rich cartilage , consisting of vacuolated cells containing myoglobin , surrounded by a low amount of extra cellular matrix containing collagen these regions are an acellular fibrous region with a high collagen content , called cartilage-like matrix , and collagen lacking a highly cellularized core , called osteoid-like matrix vascular plants , particularly seeds , and the stems of some mushrooms , are sometimes called '' cartilaginous '' , although they contain no cartilage

following the initial chondrification that occurs during embryogenesis , cartilage growth consists mostly of the maturing of immature cartilage to a more mature state the division of cells within cartilage occurs very slowly , and thus growth in cartilage is usually not based on an increase in size or mass of the cartilage itself the articular cartilage function is dependent on the molecular composition of the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) cartilage growth thus refers to the matrix deposition , but can also refer to both the growth and remodeling of the extracellular matrix due to the great stress on the patellofemoral joint during resisted knee extension , the articular cartilage of the patella is among the thickest in the human body the mechanical properties of articular cartilage in load-bearing joints such as the knee and hip have been studied extensively at macro , micro , and nano-scales lubricin , a glycoprotein abundant in cartilage and synovial fluid , plays a major role in bio-lubrication and wear protection of cartilage cartilage has limited repair capabilities : because chondrocytes are bound in lacunae , they can not migrate to damaged areas also , because hyaline cartilage does not have a blood supply , the deposition of new matrix is slow over the last years , surgeons and scientists have elaborated a series of articular cartilage repair that help to postpone the need for joint replacement a tear of meniscus of the knee cartilage can often be surgically trimmed to reduce problems biological engineering techniques are being developed to generate new cartilage , using a cellular '' scaffolding '' material and cultured cells to grow artificial cartilage the most studied cartilage in arthropods is the limulus polyphemus branchial cartilage the embryos of limulus polyphemus express cola and hyaluronan in the gill cartilage and the endosternite , which indicates that these tissues are fibrillar-collagen-based cartilage the cephalopod cranial cartilage is the invertebrate cartilage that shows more resemblance to the vertebrate hyaline cartilage the cartilage growth pattern is the same as in vertebrate cartilage

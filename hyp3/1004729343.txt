according to douglas adams , '' marvin came from andrew marshall '' ( indeed , in one of the early drafts for hitchhiker 's , the robot was called marshall it was changed to '' marvin '' partly to avoid causing offence , but also because it was pointed out to adams that on radio the name would sound like '' martial '' , which would have undesirable military connotations ) however , adams also admitted that marvin is part of a long line of literary depressives , such as a milne 's eeyore or jacques in shakespeare 's as you like it , and even owes something to adams 's own periods of depression marvin does not actually display any signs of paranoia , though zaphod beeblebrox refers to him as '' the paranoid android '' according to his autobiography read in the secondary phase of the radio series , marvin was constructed , much against his own wishes , by the sirius cybernetics corporation to prototype human personality artificial intelligence when the heart of gold crew arrive on the ancient planet of magrathea , they abandon marvin on the surface the restaurant was constructed on the ruins of the planet they had just left , and , while there , they find marvin , who had been waiting patiently for their return for 576,000,003,579 years ( he counted them ) the ship turns out to be a haggunenon battle cruiser , and the entire group , including marvin , but excluding ford prefect and arthur dent , who escape , are eaten by its crew a subsequent section of marvin 's biography occurs only in the secondary phase of the radio series marvin rejoins the crew on the heart of gold , and using the improbability drive programmed by zaphod beeblebrox the fourth , takes them to the ravaged planet brontitall having landed in a giant floating marble copy of a plastic cup , the crew accidentally find themselves falling several miles through the air cruelly intact , he grudgingly saves the crew multiple times from the foot soldiers of the dolmansaxlil shoe corporation marvin remains in heart of gold whilst ford , zaphod , zarniwoop and arthur bother the ruler of the universe , leaving when an enraged arthur hijacks the ship however , in the tertiary phase , trillian claims this story is zaphod 's hallucination , especially as reverse temporal engineering explanation has not entered the plot yet however of the stories of zaphod 's visit to the frogstar , the guide says '' 10 % are 95 % true , 14 % are 65 % true , 35 % are only 5 % true and the rest are told by zaphod beeblebrox '' , and listeners are presented with one '' version '' of that visit marvin 's voice was performed by stephen moore on the first five radio series and television series and by jim broadbent in the sixth radio series '' suddenly , he is kidnapped by a squad of krikkit war robots , who are after his leg , a fragment of the key that will reopen their imprisoned world and restart the genocidal krikkit war thinking that marvin 's intelligence will be an asset , they wire his brain into the interfaces of their intelligent war computer stephen moore released two pop singlesâ€” '' marvin/metal man '' marvin the paranoid android - marvin ( vinyl ) at discogs the song involves a spoken exchange between the starship captain ( also played by moore , as is a cameo radio voice ) and the depressed robot marvin marvin 's origins ( including those of the sirius cybernetics corporation , and the hitchhikers handheld device ) are referenced in the 2008 radio series the long dark tea-time of the soul

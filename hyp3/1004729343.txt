according to douglas adams , '' marvin came from andrew marshall it was changed to '' marvin '' partly to avoid causing offence , but also because it was pointed out to adams that on radio the name would sound like '' martial '' , which would have undesirable military connotations ) however , adams also admitted that marvin is part of a long line of literary depressives , such as a milne 's eeyore or jacques in shakespeare 's as you like it , and even owes something to adams 's own periods of depression marvin does not actually display any signs of paranoia , though zaphod beeblebrox refers to him as '' the paranoid android '' according to his autobiography read in the secondary phase of the radio series , marvin was constructed , much against his own wishes , by the sirius cybernetics corporation to prototype human personality artificial intelligence as the menial labourer on the heart of gold spaceship , he grew immensely resentful of the insistence of his new masters ( zaphod beeblebrox and trillian ; later also ford prefect and arthur dent ) that he open doors , check airlocks and pick up pieces of paper when the heart of gold crew arrive on the ancient planet of magrathea , they abandon marvin on the surface the restaurant was constructed on the ruins of the planet they had just left , and , while there , they find marvin , who had been waiting patiently for their return for 576,000,003,579 years ( he counted them ) deciding they had better leave , the crew make a desperate and futile attempt to engage marvin 's enthusiasm ( he '' has n't got one '' ) before he simply does what they really want and opens the door to the ship they want to steal the ship turns out to be a haggunenon battle cruiser , and the entire group , including marvin , but excluding ford prefect and arthur dent , who escape , are eaten by its crew marvin rejoins the crew on the heart of gold , and using the improbability drive programmed by zaphod beeblebrox the fourth , takes them to the ravaged planet brontitall however , in the tertiary phase , trillian claims this story is zaphod 's hallucination , especially as reverse temporal engineering explanation has not entered the plot yet forced to flee in the ship 's barely functional teleport , the crew politely ask marvin to stay behind and operate it this marvin 's design is a departure from the marvin of the television series , featuring shorter with an oversized head and stubby limbs marvin inadvertently saves the crew by plugging himself into the onboard computer of a police vehicle , which , when exposed to the true nature of marvin 's view of the universe , commits suicide , taking the two police who were then firing at the ship 's crew with it marvin subsequently saves zaphod 's life by engaging in a battle of wits with a vicious ( yet stupid ) automated tank , and then is abandoned on the planet frogstar b when zaphod is sent to the total perspective vortex the merchant grafted a steel rod to marvin 's now lost leg , and sold him to a mind zoo , where excited onlookers would try to make him happy '' suddenly , he is kidnapped by a squad of krikkit war robots , who are after his leg , a fragment of the key that will reopen their imprisoned world and restart the genocidal krikkit war it is also due to marvin 's influence that zaphod and the others ' lives are spared by the krikkit robots two of these were re-recorded and rearranged to coincide with the 2005 hitchhiker 's movie release , '' reasons to be miserable ( his name is marvin ) '' and '' marvin '' now being performed by stephen fry ( singing in the third-person , not as marvin ) marvin 's origins ( including those of the sirius cybernetics corporation , and the hitchhikers handheld device ) are referenced in the 2008 radio series the long dark tea-time of the soul bbc 's page on marvin marvin 's desolated fan page marvin 's depressing corner of the universe zz9 plural z alpha -the official hhgttg appreciation society hu : a galaxis útikalauz stopposoknak szereplőinek listája marvin

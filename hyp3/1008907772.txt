life insurance , pensions and healthcare actuarial science became a formal mathematical discipline in the late 17th century with the increased demand for long-term insurance coverage such as burial , life insurance , and annuities this requires estimating future contingent events , such as the rates of mortality by age , as well as the development of mathematical techniques for discounting the value of funds set aside and invested certain aspects of the actuarial methods for discounting pension funds have come under criticism from modern financial economics in traditional life insurance , actuarial science focuses on the analysis of mortality , the production of life tables , and the application of interest to produce life insurance , annuities and endowment policies contemporary life insurance programs have been extended to include credit and mortgage insurance , key person insurance for small businesses , long term care insurance and medical savings account in health insurance , including insurance provided directly by employers , and social insurance , actuarial science focuses on the analysis of rates of disability , morbidity , mortality , fertility and other contingencies actuarial science also aids in the design of benefit structures , reimbursement standards , and the effects of proposed government standards on the cost of healthcare in the pension industry , actuarial methods are used to measure the costs of alternative strategies with regard to the design , funding , accounting , administration , and maintenance or redesign of pension plans finally , funding schemes have to be developed that are manageable and satisfy the standards board or regulators of the appropriate country , such as the financial accounting standards board in the united states in social welfare programs , the office of the chief actuary ( ocact ) , social security administration plans and directs a program of actuarial estimates and analyses relating to ssa-administered retirement , survivors and disability insurance programs and to proposed changes in those programs actuarial science often helps to assess the overall risk from catastrophic events in relation to its underwriting capacity or surplus halley constructed his own life table , and showed how it could be used to calculate the premium amount someone of a given age should pay to purchase a life annuity traditional actuarial science and modern financial economics in the us have different practices , which is caused by different ways of calculating funding and investment strategies , and by different regulations the divergence is not related to the use of historical data and statistical projections of liability cash flows , but is instead caused by the manner in which traditional actuarial methods apply market data with those numbers the potential of modern financial economics theory to complement existing actuarial science was recognized by actuaries in the mid-twentieth century ideas from financial economics became increasingly influential in actuarial thinking , and actuarial science has started to embrace more sophisticated mathematical modelling of finance actuarial control cycle actuarial exam black swan theory : category : actuarial associations data mining list of actuarial topics ruin theory scenario optimization

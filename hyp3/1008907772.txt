actuarial science became a formal mathematical discipline in the late 17th century with the increased demand for long-term insurance coverage such as burial , life insurance , and annuities this requires estimating future contingent events , such as the rates of mortality by age , as well as the development of mathematical techniques for discounting the value of funds set aside and invested this led to the development of an important actuarial concept , referred to as the present value of a future sum certain aspects of the actuarial methods for discounting pension funds have come under criticism from modern financial economics in traditional life insurance , actuarial science focuses on the analysis of mortality , the production of life tables , and the application of interest to produce life insurance , annuities and endowment policies contemporary life insurance programs have been extended to include credit and mortgage insurance , key person insurance for small businesses , long term care insurance and medical savings account in health insurance , including insurance provided directly by employers , and social insurance , actuarial science focuses on the analysis of rates of disability , morbidity , mortality , fertility and other contingencies actuarial science also aids in the design of benefit structures , reimbursement standards , and the effects of proposed government standards on the cost of healthcare finally , funding schemes have to be developed that are manageable and satisfy the standards board or regulators of the appropriate country , such as the financial accounting standards board in the united states in social welfare programs , the office of the chief actuary ( ocact ) , social security administration plans and directs a program of actuarial estimates and analyses relating to ssa-administered retirement , survivors and disability insurance programs and to proposed changes in those programs actuarial science is also applied to property , casualty , liability , and general insurance in these forms of insurance , coverage is generally provided on a renewable period , ( such as a yearly ) in the early twentieth century , actuaries were developing many techniques that can be found in modern financial theory , but for various historical reasons , these developments did not achieve much recognition for example , one traditional actuarial method suggests that changing the asset allocation mix of investments can change the value of liabilities and assets ( by changing the discount rate assumption ) the potential of modern financial economics theory to complement existing actuarial science was recognized by actuaries in the mid-twentieth century ideas from financial economics became increasingly influential in actuarial thinking , and actuarial science has started to embrace more sophisticated mathematical modelling of finance there is an increasing trend to recognize that actuarial skills can be applied to a range of applications outside the traditional fields of insurance , pensions , etc actuarial control cycle actuarial exam black swan theory : category : actuarial associations data mining list of actuarial topics ruin theory scenario optimization

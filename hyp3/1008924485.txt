on the night before halloween in 1938 , orson welles directed the mercury theatre on the air live radio adaptation of h by mimicking a news broadcast , the show was quite realistic sounding for its time , and some listeners were fooled into thinking that a martian invasion was underway in the united states some later studies have argued that the contemporary press exaggerated the extent of the panic , but it remains clear that many people were caught up , to some degree , in the confusion in 1949 , part of the script for the war of the worlds was read out over the radio in quito , ecuador , without announcement , as if it were a major piece of breaking news huge crowds of people emerged onto the streets and sought refuge inside churches with their families an angry mob formed and burned the station to the ground , causing between six and twenty deaths keyhoe was one of the first significant conspiracy theorists , asserting eventually that the saucers were from outer space and were on some sort of scouting mission keyhoe claimed to derive his theory from his contacts in air force and navy intelligence project sign , based at air technical intelligence command at wright-patterson air force base and its successors project grudge and project blue book were officially assigned to investigate the flying saucers edward ruppelt 's book the report on unidentified flying objects , the report on unidentified flying objects , doubleday books reports that many people within these research groups did in fact support the hypothesis that the flying saucers were from outer space keyhoe later founded nicap , a civilian investigation group that asserted the u.s government was lying about ufos and covering up information that should be shared with the public hillenkoetter , the first director of the cia to date no scientific evidence for nicap 's assertions has been presented beyond accounts that are anecdotal and documented hear-say or rumor initially , the target of the aerial barrage was thought to be an attacking force from japan , but secretary of the navy frank knox speaking at a press conference shortly afterward called the incident a '' false alarm in 1946 and 1947 , numerous reports occurred of so-called ghost rockets appearing over scandinavian countries , primarily sweden , which then spread into other european countries , timothy good , need to know : ufos , the military , and intelligence , 2007 , pegasus books , donald keyhoe , aliens from space , 1973 , doubleday & co scientists and high military officials who had already concluded the objects were extraterrestrial in origin and feared public panic because no defense existed in 1947 , the united states air force issued a press release stating that a '' flying disk '' had been recovered near roswell , new mexico the roswell case quickly faded even from the attention of most ufology until the 1970s in the 1990s , the us military published two reports disclosing the true nature of the crashed aircraft : a surveillance balloon from project mogul nevertheless , the roswell incident continues to be of interest to the media , and conspiracy theories surrounding the event persist in 1948 , air force pilot thomas mantell was killed in a crash while pursuing what he described as '' a metallic object.of tremendous size '' some ufologists reject bluebook 's conclusion because of its initial suggestion that mantell was chasing '' venus or a comet '' ruppelt , the first director of blue book , characterized the air force 's public behavior regarding ufos as '' schizophrenic '' : alternately open and transparent , then secretive and dismissive according to ruppelt , the estimate was ordered destroyed by air force chief of staff hoyt vandenberg project sign 's final report , published in early 1949 , stated that while some ufos appeared to represent actual aircraft , data were insufficient to determine their origin as a result of his insistence that ufo sightings should not be dismissed without some form of proper scientific study , the department set up the flying saucer working party ( or fswp ) in august 1950 , montanan baseball manager nicholas mariana filmed several ufos with his color 16mm camera project blue book was called in and , after inspecting the film , mariana claimed it was returned to him with critical footage removed , clearly showing the objects as disc-shaped marine who wrote a series of popular books and magazine articles that were very influential in shaping public opinion , arguing that ufos were indeed real and that the u.s government was suppressing ufo evidence his first book , flying saucers are real also came out in 1950 , about the same time as frank scully 's book , and was a bestseller in 1956 , keyhoe helped establish nicap , a powerful civilian ufo investigating group with many inside sources keyhoe became its director and continued his attacks on the air force smith , who worked for the canadian department of transport , was interested in flying saucer propulsion technology and wondered if the assertions in the just-published scully and keyhoe books were factual other correspondence , having to do with keyhoe needing to get clearance to publish another article on smith 's theories of ufo propulsion , indicated that bush and his group were operating out of the research and development board roswell proof : smith papers smith then briefed superiors in the canadian government , leading to the establishment of project magnet , a small canadian government ufo research effort throughout the 1950s and early 1960s , smith granted public interviews , and among other things stated that he had been lent crashed ufo material for analysis by a highly secret u.s the 4602nd aiss was tasked with investigating only the most important ufo cases having intelligence or national security implications there has been continued speculation that the men in black are government agents who harass and threaten ufo witnesses also in 1956 , the group foundation for earth-space relations , led by film producer tzadi sophit , tested their own flying saucer outside the long island town of ridge landing on january 22 , 1958 , when donald keyhoe appeared on cbs television , his statements on ufos were censored by the air force during the show when keyhoe tried to depart from the censored script to '' reveal something that has never been disclosed before '' , cbs cut the sound , later stating keyhoe was about to violate '' predetermined security standards '' and about to say something he was n't '' authorized to release '' what keyhoe was about to reveal were four publicly unknown military studies concluding ufos were interplanetary including the 1948 project sign estimate of the situation and a 1952 project blue book engineering analysis of ufo motion presented at the robertson panel astronaut gordon cooper reported suppression of a flying saucer movie filmed in high clarity by two edwards afb range photographers on may 3 , 1957 cooper said he viewed developed negatives of the object , clearly showing a dish-like object with a dome on top and something like holes or ports in the dome cooper said military authorities then picked up the film and neither he nor the photographers ever heard what happened to it the incident was also reported in a few newspapers , such as the los angeles times government was mishandling evidence that would support the extraterrestrial hypothesis emenegger and sandler report that air force officials ( including paul shartle ) suggested incorporating ufo information in the documentary , including as its centerpiece genuine footage of a 1971 ufo landing at holloman air force base in new mexico ufo cover-up : live ! , a two-hour television special '' focusing on the government 's handling of information regarding ufos '' and '' whether there has been any suppression of evidence supporting the existence of ufos '' they essentially recirculate the information presented above , with many asides from '' branton '' , the document 's editor the photos were analyzed and subsequently appeared in some classified air force

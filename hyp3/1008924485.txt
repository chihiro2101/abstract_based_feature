time , and some listeners were fooled into thinking that a martian invasion was underway in the united states some later studies have argued that the contemporary press exaggerated the extent of the panic , but it remains clear that many people were caught up , to some degree , in the confusion in 1949 , part of the script for the war of the worlds was read out over the radio in quito , ecuador , without announcement , as if it were a major piece of breaking news huge crowds of people emerged onto the streets and sought refuge inside churches with their families an angry mob formed and burned the station to the ground , causing between six and twenty deaths ruppelt , ruppelt : roswell ufo cover the air force 's files often mentioned the panicked aftermath of the 1938 war of the worlds broadcast as a possible reaction of the public to confirmed evidence of ufos ; however , the files have not been made available to corroborate his assertions donald keyhoe later began investigating

, and officials stated that a weather balloon had been misidentified the roswell case quickly faded even from the attention of most ufology until the 1970s in the 1990s , the us military published two reports disclosing the true nature of the crashed aircraft : a surveillance balloon from project mogul nevertheless , the roswell incident continues to be of interest to the media , and conspiracy theories surrounding the event persist in 1948 , air force pilot thomas mantell was killed in a crash while pursuing what he described as '' a metallic object.of tremendous size '' clark , jerome ,

characterized the air force 's public behavior regarding ufos as '' schizophrenic '' : alternately open and transparent , then secretive and dismissive project sign 's final report , published in early 1949 , stated that while some ufos appeared to represent actual aircraft , data were insufficient to determine their origin government group called the '' interplanetary phenomenon unit '' allegedly established by general douglas macarthur that was '' supposedly formed to investigate crashed and retrieved flying saucers '' in august 1950 , montanan baseball manager nicholas mariana filmed several ufos with his color 16mm camera project blue book was called in and , after inspecting the film , mariana claimed it was returned to him with critical footage removed , clearly showing

frank scully 's book , and was a bestseller keyhoe became its director and continued his attacks on the air force other contemporary critics also charged that the united states air force was perpetrating a cover-up with its project blue book robert sarbacher , a physicist and consultant to the defense department 's research and development board other correspondence , having to do with keyhoe needing to get clearance to publish another article on smith 's theories of ufo propulsion , indicated that bush and his group were operating out of the research and development board sarbacher

stated that he had been lent crashed ufo material for analysis by a highly secret u.s in addition , ufo investigative duties started to be taken on by the newly formed 4602nd air intelligence squadron ( aiss ) of the air defense command these were deliberately siphoned away from blue book , leaving blue book to deal with the more trivial reports in 1954 an automatic working station for ufo

afb and was shown where officials conferred with extraterrestrial life moore said that he '' was in a rather unique position '' in the disinformation campaign : '' judging by the positions of the people i knew to be directly involved in it , the disinformation definitely had something to do with national security in 1999 a group in france published a study , '' ufos and defense : what must we be prepared for ? '' among other topics , the study concluded that the united states government has withheld valuable evidence 398 according to some conspiracy theorists , during the military investigation of green fireballs in new mexico , ufos were photographed by a tracking camera over white sands proving grounds on april 27 , 1949 ncp-12 : the white sands proof – maccabee on january 22 , 1958 , when nicap director donald keyhoe appeared on cbs television , his statements on ufos were censored by the air force in may 2001 , greer held a press conference at the national press club in d.c that featured '' 20 retired air force , federal aviation administration and intelligence officers '' who demanded that congress begin hearings on '' secret u.s

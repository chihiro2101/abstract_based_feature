cylinder '' recording made by edison of the '' american quartet '' performing '' that syncopated boogie boo '' in 1913 the oxford english dictionary states that the word is a reduplication of boogie , which was used for '' rent party '' as early as 1913 none of these sheet music or audio recording examples contain the musical elements that would identify them as boogie-woogie the 1919 recordings (

boogie-woogie piano in the caddo lake area of northeast texas in 1899 texas , as the state of origin , became reinforced by jelly roll morton , who said he heard the boogie piano style there early in

ar-tx , by john tennison and alfred tennison , jr the company was formed on february 16 , 1852 , but did not build track from swanson 's landing at caddo lake to marshall , texas , until after changing its name to '' southern pacific '' on august 16 , 1856 the texas-based southern pacific railroad was bought out by the newly formed texas and pacific railway on march 21 , 1872 although the '' texas western '' railroad company changed its name to '' southern pacific '' , sullivan said the name '' texas western '' stuck among the slaves who constructed the first railway hub in northeast

'' from the primitive to the complex , those identifications indicate that the most primitive form of the music was associated with marshall , texas – and that the left-hand bass lines grew more complex as the distance from marshall increased the remaining bass lines rise in complexity with distance from marshall , texas as one would expect variations and innovations would occur as the territory in which the music has been introduced expands indications that marshall & harrison county texas is the most likely point of origination of boogie-woogie jimmy blythe 's recording of ''

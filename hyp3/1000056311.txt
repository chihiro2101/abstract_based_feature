rubrum is usually easy to identify , it is highly changeable in morphological characteristics the trunk will remain free of branches until some distance up the tree on forest grown trees , while individuals grown in the open are shorter and thicker with a more rounded crown trees on poorer sites often become malformed and scraggly as the tree grows the bark becomes darker and cracks into slightly raised long plates the leaf of the red maple offer the easiest way to distinguish it from its relatives as with all north american maple trees , they are deciduous and arranged oppositely on the twig they are typically long and wide with 3-5 palmate lobes with a serrated margin in contrast , the leaves of the related silver maple , a the leaf stalks are usually red and are up to long the leaves can turn a characteristic brilliant red in autumn , but can also become yellow or orange on some individuals the fall colors of red maple are most spectacular in the northern part of its range where climates are cooler the twigs of the red maple are reddish in color and somewhat shiny with small lenticels the buds form in fall and winter and are often visible from a distance due to their large size and reddish tint the tree itself is considered polygamodioecious , meaning some individuals are male , some female , and some monoecious under the proper conditions , the tree can sometimes switch from male to female , male to hermaphroditic , and hermaphroditic to female the pistillate flowers are borne on pedicels that grow out while the flowers are blooming , so that eventually the flowers are in a hanging cluster with stems long they are borne on long slender stems and are variable in color from light brown to reddish acer rubrum is one of the most abundant and widespread trees in eastern north america it has the largest continuous range along the north american atlantic coast of any tree that occurs in florida the species is native to all regions of the united states east of the 95th meridian rubrum is not present in most of the prairie peninsula of the northern midwest ( although it is found in ohio ) , the coastal prairie in southern louisiana and southeastern texas and the swamp prairie of the florida everglades the absence of red maple from the prairie peninsula is most likely due to the tree 's poor tolerance of wildfires in several other locations , the tree is absent from large areas but still present in a few specific habitats chlorosis can occur on very alkaline soils , though otherwise its ph tolerance is quite high moist mineral soil is best for germination of seeds while many types of tree prefer a south- or north-facing aspect , the red maple does not appear to have a preference its ideal conditions are in moderately well-drained , moist sites at low or intermediate elevations additionally , red maple is one of the most drought-tolerant species of maple in the carolinas red maple is far more abundant today than when europeans first arrived in north america also , the decline of american elm and american chestnut due to introduced diseases has contributed to its spread red maple dominates such sites , but largely disappears until it only has a sparse presence by the time a forest is mature extensive use of red maple in landscaping has also contributed to the surge in the species ' numbers as volunteer seedlings proliferate while mainline forest trees continue to dominate mesic sites with rich soil , more marginal areas are increasingly being dominated by red maple its ability to thrive in a large number of habitats is largely due to its ability to produce roots to suit its site from a young age mature trees have woody roots up to long many cultivars of the freeman maple are also grown widely the fall color is yellow-orange to orange-red and the tree is a fast grower in the lumber industry acer rubrum is considered a '' soft maple '' , a designation it shares , commercially , with silver maple ( a red maple is a medium quality firewood , possessing less heat energy , nominally , than other hardwoods such as ash : , oak : , or birch : .

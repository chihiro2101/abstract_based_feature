it is a medium to large sized tree , reaching heights of and exceptionally over in the southern appalachians where conditions favor its growth the trunk diameter often ranges from ; depending on the growing conditions , however , open grown trees can attain diameters of up to the trunk will remain free of branches until some distance up the tree on forest grown trees , while individuals grown in the open are shorter and thicker with a more rounded crown the largest known living red maple is located near armada , michigan , at a height of and a bole circumference , at breast height , of the leaf of the red maple offer the easiest way to distinguish it from its relatives as with all north american maple trees , they are deciduous and arranged oppositely on the twig the fall colors of red maple are most spectacular in the northern part of its range where climates are cooler the twigs of the red maple are reddish in color and somewhat shiny with small lenticels the buds are usually blunt and greenish to reddish in color , generally with several loose scales the buds form in fall and winter and are often visible from a distance due to their large size and reddish tint under the proper conditions , the tree can sometimes switch from male to female , male to hermaphroditic , and hermaphroditic to female the red maple will begin blooming when it is about 8 years old , but it significantly varies between tree to tree : some trees may begin flowering when they are 4 years old the flowers are red with 5 small petals and a 5-lobed calyx , usually at the twig tips the pistillate flowers have one pistil formed from two fused carpels with a glabrous superior ovary and two long styles that protrude beyond the perianth the fruit is a samara long that grows in pairs with somewhat divergent wings at an angle of 50 to 60 degrees in total it ranges from north to south an example is the bluegrass region of kentucky , where red maple is not found in the dominant open plains , but is present along streams here the red maple is not present in the bottom land forests of the grain belt , despite the fact it is common in similar habitats and species associations both to the north and south of this area in the northeastern us , red maple can be a climax forest species in certain locations , but will eventually give way to sugar maple rubrum 's high ph tolerance means that it can grow in a variety of places , and it is widespread along the eastern united states it grows on glaciated as well as unglaciated soils derived from the following rocks : granite , gneiss , schist , sandstone , shale , slate , conglomerate , quartzite , and limestone its ideal conditions are in moderately well-drained , moist sites at low or intermediate elevations in northern michigan and new england , the tree is found on the tops of ridges , sandy or rocky upland and otherwise dry soils , as well as in nearly pure stands on moist soils and the edges of swamps additionally , red maple is one of the most drought-tolerant species of maple in the carolinas red maple is far more abundant today than when europeans first arrived in north america it only contributed minimally to old growth upland forests , and would only form same-species stands in riparian zones the density of the tree in many of these areas has increased 6- to 7-fold , and this trend seems to be continuing , all of which is due to human factors , mainly continued heavy logging and a recent trend of young , shrubby forests recovering from past human disturbances red maple dominates such sites , but largely disappears until it only has a sparse presence by the time a forest is mature in areas disturbed by humans where the species thrives , it can reduce diversity , but in a mature forest it is not a dominant species ; it only has a sparse presence and adds to the diversity and ecological structure of a forest extensive use of red maple in landscaping has also contributed to the surge in the species ' numbers as volunteer seedlings proliferate finally , disease epidemics have greatly reduced the population of elms and chestnuts in the forests of the us while mainline forest trees continue to dominate mesic sites with rich soil , more marginal areas are increasingly being dominated by red maple its ability to thrive in a large number of habitats is largely due to its ability to produce roots to suit its site from a young age acer rubrum is one of the first plants to flower in spring the seeds are epigeal and tend to germinate in early summer soon after they are released , assuming a small amount of light , moisture , and sufficient temperatures are present however , the wood from acer rubrum while being typically less expensive than hard maple , also has greater dimensional stability than that of a thus , high grades of wood from the red maple can be substituted for hard maple , particularly when it comes to making stain/paint-grade furniture red maple is also used for the production of maple syrup , though the hard maples acer saccharum ( sugar maple ) and acer nigrum ( black maple ) are more commonly utilized one study compared the sap and syrup from the sugar maple with those of the red maple , as well as those of the acer saccharinum ( silver maple ) , acer negundo ( boxelder ) , and acer platanoides ( norway maple ) , and all were found to be equal in sweetness , flavor , and quality

rubrum is usually easy to identify , it is highly changeable in morphological characteristics it is a medium to large sized tree , reaching heights of and exceptionally over in the southern appalachians where conditions favor its growth the leaves are usually long on a full-grown tree the trunk diameter often ranges from ; depending on the growing conditions , however , open grown trees can attain diameters of up to the trunk will remain free of branches until some distance up the tree on forest grown trees , while individuals grown in the open are shorter and thicker with a more rounded crown the largest known living red maple is located near armada , michigan , at a height of and a bole circumference , at breast height , of the leaf of the red maple offer the easiest way to distinguish it from its relatives as with all north american maple trees , they are deciduous and arranged oppositely on the twig the leaf stalks are usually red and are up to long the leaves can turn a characteristic brilliant red in autumn , but can also become yellow or orange on some individuals soil acidity can influence the color of the foliage and trees with female flowers are more likely to produce orange coloration while male trees produce red the fall colors of red maple are most spectacular in the northern part of its range where climates are cooler the twigs of the red maple are reddish in color and somewhat shiny with small lenticels the buds form in fall and winter and are often visible from a distance due to their large size and reddish tint the flowers are generally unisexual , with male and female flowers appearing in separate sessile clusters , though they are sometimes also bisexual acer rubrum is one of the most abundant and widespread trees in eastern north america the tree 's range ends where the mean minimum isotherm begins , namely in southeastern canada red maple 's western range stops with the great plains where conditions become too dry for it in several other locations , the tree is absent from large areas but still present in a few specific habitats here the red maple is not present in the bottom land forests of the grain belt , despite the fact it is common in similar habitats and species associations both to the north and south of this area in the northeastern us , red maple can be a climax forest species in certain locations , but will eventually give way to sugar maple acer rubrum does very well in a wide range of soil types , with varying textures , moisture , ph , and elevation , probably more so than any other forest tree in north america rubrum 's high ph tolerance means that it can grow in a variety of places , and it is widespread along the eastern united states chlorosis can occur on very alkaline soils , though otherwise its ph tolerance is quite high while many types of tree prefer a south- or north-facing aspect , the red maple does not appear to have a preference in the far south of its range , it is almost exclusively associated with swamps red maple is far more abundant today than when europeans first arrived in north america it only contributed minimally to old growth upland forests , and would only form same-species stands in riparian zones red maple dominates such sites , but largely disappears until it only has a sparse presence by the time a forest is mature rubrum is a prolific seed producer and highly adaptable , often dominating disturbed sites while mainline forest trees continue to dominate mesic sites with rich soil , more marginal areas are increasingly being dominated by red maple a crop of seeds is generally produced every year with a bumper crop often occurring every second year a tree in diameter was shown to produce nearly a million seeds red maple produces one of the smallest seeds of any of the maples red maple frequently hybridizes with silver maple ; the hybrid , known as freeman 's maple , acer × freemanii , is intermediate between the parents its popularity in cultivation stems from its vigorous habit , its attractive and early red flowers , and most importantly , its flaming red fall foliage 'autumn blaze ' – rounded oval form with leaves that resemble the silver maple red maple is also used for the production of maple syrup , though the hard maples acer saccharum ( sugar maple ) and acer nigrum ( black maple ) are more commonly utilized red maple is a medium quality firewood , possessing less heat energy , nominally , than other hardwoods such as ash : , oak : , or birch : .

the trunk diameter often ranges from ; depending on the growing conditions , however , open grown trees can attain diameters of up to the trunk will remain free of branches until some distance up the tree on forest grown trees , while individuals grown in the open are shorter and thicker with a more rounded crown as the tree grows the bark becomes darker and cracks into slightly raised long plates the leaf of the red maple offer the easiest way to distinguish it from its relatives as with all north american maple trees , they are deciduous and arranged oppositely on the twig they are typically long and wide with 3-5 palmate lobes with a serrated margin the leaves can turn a characteristic brilliant red in autumn , but can also become yellow or orange on some individuals soil acidity can influence the color of the foliage and trees with female flowers are more likely to produce orange coloration while male trees produce red the fall colors of red maple are most spectacular in the northern part of its range where climates are cooler the buds are usually blunt and greenish to reddish in color , generally with several loose scales the buds form in fall and winter and are often visible from a distance due to their large size and reddish tint the flowers are generally unisexual , with male and female flowers appearing in separate sessile clusters , though they are sometimes also bisexual the tree itself is considered polygamodioecious , meaning some individuals are male , some female , and some monoecious the red maple will begin blooming when it is about 8 years old , but it significantly varies between tree to tree : some trees may begin flowering when they are 4 years old the flowers are red with 5 small petals and a 5-lobed calyx , usually at the twig tips the pistillate flowers are borne on pedicels that grow out while the flowers are blooming , so that eventually the flowers are in a hanging cluster with stems long the petals are lineal to oblong in shape and are pubescent the pistillate flowers have one pistil formed from two fused carpels with a glabrous superior ovary and two long styles that protrude beyond the perianth acer rubrum is one of the most abundant and widespread trees in eastern north america it has the largest continuous range along the north american atlantic coast of any tree that occurs in florida the absence of red maple from the prairie peninsula is most likely due to the tree 's poor tolerance of wildfires an example is the bluegrass region of kentucky , where red maple is not found in the dominant open plains , but is present along streams in the northeastern us , red maple can be a climax forest species in certain locations , but will eventually give way to sugar maple acer rubrum does very well in a wide range of soil types , with varying textures , moisture , ph , and elevation , probably more so than any other forest tree in north america its ideal conditions are in moderately well-drained , moist sites at low or intermediate elevations additionally , red maple is one of the most drought-tolerant species of maple in the carolinas also , the decline of american elm and american chestnut due to introduced diseases has contributed to its spread red maple dominates such sites , but largely disappears until it only has a sparse presence by the time a forest is mature rubrum is a prolific seed producer and highly adaptable , often dominating disturbed sites extensive use of red maple in landscaping has also contributed to the surge in the species ' numbers as volunteer seedlings proliferate finally , disease epidemics have greatly reduced the population of elms and chestnuts in the forests of the us while mainline forest trees continue to dominate mesic sites with rich soil , more marginal areas are increasingly being dominated by red maple its ability to thrive in a large number of habitats is largely due to its ability to produce roots to suit its site from a young age acer rubrum is one of the first plants to flower in spring a crop of seeds is generally produced every year with a bumper crop often occurring every second year red maple frequently hybridizes with silver maple ; the hybrid , known as freeman 's maple , acer Ã— freemanii , is intermediate between the parents along with 'red sunset ' , it is the most popular selection due to the dependable fall color and vigorous growth however , the wood from acer rubrum while being typically less expensive than hard maple , also has greater dimensional stability than that of a this being the case , red maple can only be tapped for syrup before the buds emerge , making the season very short

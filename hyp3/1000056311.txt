rubrum is usually easy to identify , it is highly changeable in morphological characteristics it is a medium to large sized tree , reaching heights of and exceptionally over in the southern appalachians where conditions favor its growth the leaves are usually long on a full-grown tree the trunk diameter often ranges from ; depending on the growing conditions , however , open grown trees can attain diameters of up to the trunk will remain free of branches until some distance up the tree on forest grown trees , while individuals grown in the open are shorter and thicker with a more rounded crown as the tree grows the bark becomes darker and cracks into slightly raised long plates the leaf of the red maple offer the easiest way to distinguish it from its relatives as with all north american maple trees , they are deciduous and arranged oppositely on the twig in contrast , the leaves of the related silver maple , a the leaves can turn a characteristic brilliant red in autumn , but can also become yellow or orange on some individuals soil acidity can influence the color of the foliage and trees with female flowers are more likely to produce orange coloration while male trees produce red the twigs of the red maple are reddish in color and somewhat shiny with small lenticels the buds are usually blunt and greenish to reddish in color , generally with several loose scales the buds form in fall and winter and are often visible from a distance due to their large size and reddish tint they are borne on long slender stems and are variable in color from light brown to reddish acer rubrum is one of the most abundant and widespread trees in eastern north america in total it ranges from north to south red maple 's western range stops with the great plains where conditions become too dry for it the absence of red maple from the prairie peninsula is most likely due to the tree 's poor tolerance of wildfires red maple is most abundant in the northeastern us , the upper peninsula of michigan , and northeastern wisconsin and is rare in the extreme west of its range and in the southeastern us an example is the bluegrass region of kentucky , where red maple is not found in the dominant open plains , but is present along streams here the red maple is not present in the bottom land forests of the grain belt , despite the fact it is common in similar habitats and species associations both to the north and south of this area in the northeastern us , red maple can be a climax forest species in certain locations , but will eventually give way to sugar maple acer rubrum does very well in a wide range of soil types , with varying textures , moisture , ph , and elevation , probably more so than any other forest tree in north america rubrum 's high ph tolerance means that it can grow in a variety of places , and it is widespread along the eastern united states red maple can grow in a variety of moist and dry biomes , from dry ridges and sunny , southwest-facing slopes to peat bogs and swamps while many types of tree prefer a south- or north-facing aspect , the red maple does not appear to have a preference in northern michigan and new england , the tree is found on the tops of ridges , sandy or rocky upland and otherwise dry soils , as well as in nearly pure stands on moist soils and the edges of swamps additionally , red maple is one of the most drought-tolerant species of maple in the carolinas red maple is far more abundant today than when europeans first arrived in north america red maple dominates such sites , but largely disappears until it only has a sparse presence by the time a forest is mature in areas disturbed by humans where the species thrives , it can reduce diversity , but in a mature forest it is not a dominant species ; it only has a sparse presence and adds to the diversity and ecological structure of a forest extensive use of red maple in landscaping has also contributed to the surge in the species ' numbers as volunteer seedlings proliferate the toxin is unknown , but believed to be an oxidant because it damages red blood cells , causing acute hemolysis that inhibits the transport of oxygen red maple 's rapid growth , ease of transplanting , attractive form , and value for wildlife ( in the eastern us ) has made it one of the most extensively planted trees 'autumn blaze ' â€“ rounded oval form with leaves that resemble the silver maple thus , high grades of wood from the red maple can be substituted for hard maple , particularly when it comes to making stain/paint-grade furniture red maple is also used for the production of maple syrup , though the hard maples acer saccharum ( sugar maple ) and acer nigrum ( black maple ) are more commonly utilized pioneers made cinnamon-brown and black dyes from a bark extract , and iron sulphate could be added to the tannin from red maple bark in order to make ink

it is a medium to large sized tree , reaching heights of and exceptionally over in the southern appalachians where conditions favor its growth the leaves are usually long on a full-grown tree the trunk will remain free of branches until some distance up the tree on forest grown trees , while individuals grown in the open are shorter and thicker with a more rounded crown as the tree grows the bark becomes darker and cracks into slightly raised long plates the largest known living red maple is located near armada , michigan , at a height of and a bole circumference , at breast height , of the leaf of the red maple offer the easiest way to distinguish it from its relatives as with all north american maple trees , they are deciduous and arranged oppositely on the twig the leaf stalks are usually red and are up to long the leaves can turn a characteristic brilliant red in autumn , but can also become yellow or orange on some individuals the fall colors of red maple are most spectacular in the northern part of its range where climates are cooler the twigs of the red maple are reddish in color and somewhat shiny with small lenticels the buds form in fall and winter and are often visible from a distance due to their large size and reddish tint the red maple will begin blooming when it is about 8 years old , but it significantly varies between tree to tree : some trees may begin flowering when they are 4 years old the fruit is a samara long that grows in pairs with somewhat divergent wings at an angle of 50 to 60 degrees they are borne on long slender stems and are variable in color from light brown to reddish red maple 's western range stops with the great plains where conditions become too dry for it red maple is most abundant in the northeastern us , the upper peninsula of michigan , and northeastern wisconsin and is rare in the extreme west of its range and in the southeastern us here the red maple is not present in the bottom land forests of the grain belt , despite the fact it is common in similar habitats and species associations both to the north and south of this area in the northeastern us , red maple can be a climax forest species in certain locations , but will eventually give way to sugar maple acer rubrum does very well in a wide range of soil types , with varying textures , moisture , ph , and elevation , probably more so than any other forest tree in north america rubrum 's high ph tolerance means that it can grow in a variety of places , and it is widespread along the eastern united states red maple can grow in a variety of moist and dry biomes , from dry ridges and sunny , southwest-facing slopes to peat bogs and swamps additionally , red maple is one of the most drought-tolerant species of maple in the carolinas forest plants of the southeast and their wildlife uses also , the decline of american elm and american chestnut due to introduced diseases has contributed to its spread red maple dominates such sites , but largely disappears until it only has a sparse presence by the time a forest is mature this species is in fact a vital part of forest regeneration in the same way that paper birch is rubrum is a prolific seed producer and highly adaptable , often dominating disturbed sites extensive use of red maple in landscaping has also contributed to the surge in the species ' numbers as volunteer seedlings proliferate finally , disease epidemics have greatly reduced the population of elms and chestnuts in the forests of the us while mainline forest trees continue to dominate mesic sites with rich soil , more marginal areas are increasingly being dominated by red maple red maple 's maximum lifespan is 150 years , but most live less than 100 years acer rubrum is one of the first plants to flower in spring red maple produces one of the smallest seeds of any of the maples its popularity in cultivation stems from its vigorous habit , its attractive and early red flowers , and most importantly , its flaming red fall foliage along with 'red sunset ' , it is the most popular selection due to the dependable fall color and vigorous growth thus , high grades of wood from the red maple can be substituted for hard maple , particularly when it comes to making stain/paint-grade furniture red maple is also used for the production of maple syrup , though the hard maples acer saccharum ( sugar maple ) and acer nigrum ( black maple ) are more commonly utilized pioneers made cinnamon-brown and black dyes from a bark extract , and iron sulphate could be added to the tannin from red maple bark in order to make ink

smeaton 's water wheel experiments were conducted on a small scale model with which he tested various configurations over a period of seven years over the period 1759â€“1782 he performed a series of further experiments and measurements on water wheels that led him to support and champion the vis viva theory of german gottfried leibniz , an early formulation of conservation of energy in his 1759 paper '' an experimental enquiry concerning the natural powers of water and wind to turn mills and other machines depending on circular motion '' smeaton developed the concepts and data which became the basis for the smeaton coefficient , the lift equation used by the wright brothers it has the form : : l k v^2 a c_l \ , where : : l is the lift : k is the smeaton coefficient ( see note below ) : v is the velocity : a is the area in square feet : c_l is the lift coefficient ( the lift relative to the drag of a plate of the same area ) the wright brothers determined with wind tunnels that the smeaton coefficient value of 0.005 was incorrect and should have been 0.0033 in modern analysis , the lift coefficient is normalised by the dynamic pressure instead of the smeaton coefficient image : smeaton 's lighthouse00.jpg thumb right smeaton 's lighthouse smeaton is important in the history , rediscovery of , and development of modern cement , identifying the compositional requirements needed to obtain '' hydraulicity '' in lime ; work which led ultimately to the invention of portland cement his lighthouse remained in use until 1877 when the rock underlying the structure 's foundations had begun to erode ; it was dismantled and partially rebuilt at plymouth hoe where it is known as smeaton 's tower the project is now known informally as '' smeaton 's harbour '' , but despite the name his involvement was limited and occurred more than 30 years after work on the harbour commenced the pioneering constant of proportionality describing pressure varying inversely as the square of the velocity when applied to objects moving in air was named smeaton 's coefficient in his honor john smeaton academy , a secondary school in the suburbs of leeds adjacent to the pendas fields estate near austhorpe , is named after smeaton

after studying at leeds grammar school he joined his father 's law firm , but left to become a mathematical instrument maker ( working with henry hindley ) , developing , among other instruments , a pyrometer to study material expansion smeaton 's water wheel experiments were conducted on a small scale model with which he tested various configurations over a period of seven years it has the form : : l k v^2 a c_l \ , where : : l is the lift : k is the smeaton coefficient ( see note below ) : v is the velocity : a is the area in square feet : c_l is the lift coefficient ( the lift relative to the drag of a plate of the same area ) the wright brothers determined with wind tunnels that the smeaton coefficient value of 0.005 was incorrect and should have been 0.0033 image : smeaton 's lighthouse00.jpg thumb right smeaton 's lighthouse smeaton is important in the history , rediscovery of , and development of modern cement , identifying the compositional requirements needed to obtain '' hydraulicity '' in lime ; work which led ultimately to the invention of portland cement recommended by the royal society , smeaton designed the third eddystone lighthouse ( 1755â€“59 ) he pioneered the use of 'hydraulic lime ' ( a form of mortar that will set under water ) and developed a technique involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building of the lighthouse his lighthouse remained in use until 1877 when the rock underlying the structure 's foundations had begun to erode ; it was dismantled and partially rebuilt at plymouth hoe where it is known as smeaton 's tower he is highly regarded by other engineers , having contributed to the lunar society and founded the society of civil engineers in 1771 a memorial stone commemorating smeaton himself was unveiled in the abbey on 7 november 1994 , by noel ordman , president of the smeatonian society of civil engineers john smeaton academy , a secondary school in the suburbs of leeds adjacent to the pendas fields estate near austhorpe , is named after smeaton

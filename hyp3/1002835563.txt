after studying at leeds grammar school he joined his father 's law firm , but left to become a mathematical instrument maker ( working with henry hindley ) , developing , among other instruments , a pyrometer to study material expansion smeaton 's water wheel experiments were conducted on a small scale model with which he tested various configurations over a period of seven years over the period 1759â€“1782 he performed a series of further experiments and measurements on water wheels that led him to support and champion the vis viva theory of german gottfried leibniz , an early formulation of conservation of energy in his 1759 paper '' an experimental enquiry concerning the natural powers of water and wind to turn mills and other machines depending on circular motion '' smeaton developed the concepts and data which became the basis for the smeaton coefficient , the lift equation used by the wright brothers it has the form : : l k v^2 a c_l \ , where : : l is the lift : k is the smeaton coefficient ( see note below ) : v is the velocity : a is the area in square feet : c_l is the lift coefficient ( the lift relative to the drag of a plate of the same area ) the wright brothers determined with wind tunnels that the smeaton coefficient value of 0.005 was incorrect and should have been 0.0033 image : smeaton 's lighthouse00.jpg thumb right smeaton 's lighthouse smeaton is important in the history , rediscovery of , and development of modern cement , identifying the compositional requirements needed to obtain '' hydraulicity '' in lime ; work which led ultimately to the invention of portland cement he pioneered the use of 'hydraulic lime ' ( a form of mortar that will set under water ) and developed a technique involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building of the lighthouse this bell , built for the hexham bridge project , was not intended for underwater work , but in 1790 the design was updated to enable it to be used underwater on the breakwater at ramsgate harbour smeaton experimented with the newcomen steam engine and made marked improvements around the time james watt was building his first engines smeaton is one of six civil engineers depicted in the stephenson stained glass window , designed by william wailes and unveiled in westminster abbey in 1862

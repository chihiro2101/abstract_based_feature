smeaton 's water wheel experiments were conducted on a small scale model with which he tested various configurations over a period of seven years this led him into conflict with members of the academic establishment who rejected leibniz 's theory , believing it inconsistent with sir isaac newton 's conservation of momentum in his 1759 paper '' an experimental enquiry concerning the natural powers of water and wind to turn mills and other machines depending on circular motion '' smeaton developed the concepts and data which became the basis for the smeaton coefficient , the lift equation used by the wright brothers in modern analysis , the lift coefficient is normalised by the dynamic pressure instead of the smeaton coefficient image : smeaton 's lighthouse00.jpg thumb right smeaton 's lighthouse smeaton is important in the history , rediscovery of , and development of modern cement , identifying the compositional requirements needed to obtain '' hydraulicity '' in lime ; work which led ultimately to the invention of portland cement smeaton died after suffering a stroke while walking in the garden of his family home at austhorpe , and was buried in the parish church at whitkirk , west yorkshire the society was a forerunner of the institution of civil engineers , established in 1818 , and was renamed the smeatonian society of civil engineers in 1830 smeaton is one of six civil engineers depicted in the stephenson stained glass window , designed by william wailes and unveiled in westminster abbey in 1862 a memorial stone commemorating smeaton himself was unveiled in the abbey on 7 november 1994 , by noel ordman , president of the smeatonian society of civil engineers john smeaton academy , a secondary school in the suburbs of leeds adjacent to the pendas fields estate near austhorpe , is named after smeaton

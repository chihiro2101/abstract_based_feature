gauss 's law for magnetism , one of maxwell 's equations , is the mathematical statement that magnetic monopoles do not exist nevertheless , pierre curie pointed out in 1894 that magnetic monopoles could conceivably exist , despite not having been seen so far lecture notes by robert littlejohn , university of california , berkeley , 2007–8 the electric charge is , in fact , quantized , which is consistent with ( but does not prove ) the existence of monopoles further advances in theoretical particle physics , particularly developments in grand unified theories and quantum gravity , have led to more compelling arguments ( detailed below ) that monopoles do exist joseph polchinski , a string-theorist , described the existence of monopoles as '' one of the safest bets that one can make about physics not yet seen '' in some theoretical models , magnetic monopoles are unlikely to be observed , because they are too massive to create in particle accelerators ( see below ) , and also too rare in the universe to enter a particle detector with much probability the ends of a flux tube form a magnetic dipole , but since they move independently , they can be treated for many purposes as independent magnetic monopole quasiparticles magnetic monopoles spotted in spin ices , september 3 , 2009 in 2009 , physicists observed magnetic monopoles in a crystalline material called spin ice , which , when cooled to near-absolute zero , seems to fill with atom-sized , classical monopoles but they 're not magnetic monopoles first , electric currents create magnetic fields according to ampère 's law second , many elementary particles have an intrinsic magnetic moment , the most important of which is the electron magnetic dipole moment , which is related to its spin ( physics ) a magnetic dipole is something whose magnetic field is predominantly or exactly described by the magnetic dipole term of the multipole expansion in an electric dipole made of ordinary matter , the positive charge is made of protons and the negative charge is made of electrons , but a magnetic dipole does not have different types of matter creating the north pole and south pole one example of the work on magnetic monopole quasiparticles is a paper published in the journal science in september 2009 , in which researchers described the observation of quasiparticles resembling magnetic monopoles interview with jonathan morris about magnetic monopoles and magnetic monopole quasiparticles

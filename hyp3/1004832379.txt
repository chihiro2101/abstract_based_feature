however , an improved understanding of electromagnetism in the nineteenth century showed that the magnetism of lodestones was properly explained not by magnetic monopole fluids , but rather by a combination of electric currents , the electron magnetic moment , and the magnetic moments of other particles gauss 's law for magnetism , one of maxwell 's equations , is the mathematical statement that magnetic monopoles do not exist journal site , free access in this paper , dirac showed that if any magnetic monopoles exist in the universe , then all electric charge in the universe must be quantized ( dirac quantization condition ) lecture notes by robert littlejohn , university of california , berkeley , 2007â€“8 the electric charge is , in fact , quantized , which is consistent with ( but does not prove ) the existence of monopoles in some theoretical models , magnetic monopoles are unlikely to be observed , because they are too massive to create in particle accelerators ( see below ) , and also too rare in the universe to enter a particle detector with much probability some condensed matter physics propose a structure superficially similar to a magnetic monopole , known as a flux tube the ends of a flux tube form a magnetic dipole , but since they move independently , they can be treated for many purposes as independent magnetic monopole quasiparticles but they 're not magnetic monopoles all matter ever isolated to date , including every atom on the periodic table and every particle in the standard model , has zero magnetic monopole charge second , many elementary particles have an intrinsic magnetic moment , the most important of which is the electron magnetic dipole moment , which is related to its spin ( physics ) mathematically , the magnetic field of an object is often described in terms of a multipole expansion the first term in the expansion is called the monopole term , the second is called dipole , then quadrupole , then octupole , and so on a magnetic monopole , if it exists , would have the defining property of producing a magnetic field whose monopole term is non-zero a magnetic dipole is something whose magnetic field is predominantly or exactly described by the magnetic dipole term of the multipole expansion with the inclusion of a variable for the density of these magnetic charges , say , there is also a '' magnetic current density '' variable in the equations , interview with jonathan morris about magnetic monopoles and magnetic monopole quasiparticles

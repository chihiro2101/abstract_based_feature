many early scientists attributed the magnetism of lodestones to two different '' magnetic fluids '' ( '' effluvia '' ) , a north-pole fluid at one end and a south-pole fluid at the other , which attracted and repelled each other in analogy to positive and negative electric charge however , an improved understanding of electromagnetism in the nineteenth century showed that the magnetism of lodestones was properly explained not by magnetic monopole fluids , but rather by a combination of electric currents , the electron magnetic moment , and the magnetic moments of other particles the quantum theory of magnetic charge started with a paper by the physicist paul dirac in 1931 further advances in theoretical particle physics , particularly developments in grand unified theories and quantum gravity , have led to more compelling arguments ( detailed below ) that monopoles do exist some condensed matter physics propose a structure superficially similar to a magnetic monopole , known as a flux tube the ends of a flux tube form a magnetic dipole , but since they move independently , they can be treated for many purposes as independent magnetic monopole quasiparticles since 2009 , numerous news reports from the popular media have incorrectly described these systems as the long-awaited discovery of the magnetic monopoles , but the two phenomena are only superficially related to one another magnetic monopoles spotted in spin ices , september 3 , 2009 but they 're not magnetic monopoles all matter ever isolated to date , including every atom on the periodic table and every particle in the standard model , has zero magnetic monopole charge mathematically , the magnetic field of an object is often described in terms of a multipole expansion a magnetic monopole , if it exists , would have the defining property of producing a magnetic field whose monopole term is non-zero a magnetic dipole is something whose magnetic field is predominantly or exactly described by the magnetic dipole term of the multipole expansion with the inclusion of a variable for the density of these magnetic charges , say , there is also a '' magnetic current density '' variable in the equations , some researchers use the term magnetricity to describe the manipulation of magnetic monopole quasiparticles in spin ice , in analogy to the word “ electricity ” interview with jonathan morris about magnetic monopoles and magnetic monopole quasiparticles

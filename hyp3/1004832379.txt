however , an improved understanding of electromagnetism in the nineteenth century showed that the magnetism of lodestones was properly explained not by magnetic monopole fluids , but rather by a combination of electric currents , the electron magnetic moment , and the magnetic moments of other particles gauss 's law for magnetism , one of maxwell 's equations , is the mathematical statement that magnetic monopoles do not exist nevertheless , pierre curie pointed out in 1894 that magnetic monopoles could conceivably exist , despite not having been seen so far journal site , free access in this paper , dirac showed that if any magnetic monopoles exist in the universe , then all electric charge in the universe must be quantized ( dirac quantization condition ) some condensed matter physics propose a structure superficially similar to a magnetic monopole , known as a flux tube the ends of a flux tube form a magnetic dipole , but since they move independently , they can be treated for many purposes as independent magnetic monopole quasiparticles since 2009 , numerous news reports from the popular media have incorrectly described these systems as the long-awaited discovery of the magnetic monopoles , but the two phenomena are only superficially related to one another '' oleg tchernyshyov at johns hopkins university a researcher in this field cautions that the theory and experiments are specific to spin ices , and are not likely to shed light on magnetic monopoles as predicted by dirac but they 're not magnetic monopoles all matter ever isolated to date , including every atom on the periodic table and every particle in the standard model , has zero magnetic monopole charge second , many elementary particles have an intrinsic magnetic moment , the most important of which is the electron magnetic dipole moment , which is related to its spin ( physics ) however , in the multipole expansion of a magnetic field , the '' monopole '' term is always exactly zero ( for ordinary matter ) a magnetic monopole , if it exists , would have the defining property of producing a magnetic field whose monopole term is non-zero in an electric dipole made of ordinary matter , the positive charge is made of protons and the negative charge is made of electrons , but a magnetic dipole does not have different types of matter creating the north pole and south pole one example of the work on magnetic monopole quasiparticles is a paper published in the journal science in september 2009 , in which researchers described the observation of quasiparticles resembling magnetic monopoles in another example , a paper in the february 11 , 2011 issue of nature physics describes creation and measurement of long-lived magnetic monopole quasiparticle currents in spin ice

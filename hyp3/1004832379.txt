many early scientists attributed the magnetism of lodestones to two different '' magnetic fluids '' ( '' effluvia '' ) , a north-pole fluid at one end and a south-pole fluid at the other , which attracted and repelled each other in analogy to positive and negative electric charge however , an improved understanding of electromagnetism in the nineteenth century showed that the magnetism of lodestones was properly explained not by magnetic monopole fluids , but rather by a combination of electric currents , the electron magnetic moment , and the magnetic moments of other particles gauss 's law for magnetism , one of maxwell 's equations , is the mathematical statement that magnetic monopoles do not exist nevertheless , pierre curie pointed out in 1894 that magnetic monopoles could conceivably exist , despite not having been seen so far the quantum theory of magnetic charge started with a paper by the physicist paul dirac in 1931 journal site , free access in this paper , dirac showed that if any magnetic monopoles exist in the universe , then all electric charge in the universe must be quantized ( dirac quantization condition ) some condensed matter physics propose a structure superficially similar to a magnetic monopole , known as a flux tube the ends of a flux tube form a magnetic dipole , but since they move independently , they can be treated for many purposes as independent magnetic monopole quasiparticles since 2009 , numerous news reports from the popular media have incorrectly described these systems as the long-awaited discovery of the magnetic monopoles , but the two phenomena are only superficially related to one another however , in the multipole expansion of a magnetic field , the '' monopole '' term is always exactly zero ( for ordinary matter ) a magnetic monopole , if it exists , would have the defining property of producing a magnetic field whose monopole term is non-zero a magnetic dipole is something whose magnetic field is predominantly or exactly described by the magnetic dipole term of the multipole expansion one example of the work on magnetic monopole quasiparticles is a paper published in the journal science in september 2009 , in which researchers described the observation of quasiparticles resembling magnetic monopoles in another example , a paper in the february 11 , 2011 issue of nature physics describes creation and measurement of long-lived magnetic monopole quasiparticle currents in spin ice in superfluids , there is a field , related to superfluid vorticity , which is mathematically analogous to the magnetic -field interview with jonathan morris about magnetic monopoles and magnetic monopole quasiparticles

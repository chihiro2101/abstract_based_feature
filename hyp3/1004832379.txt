however , an improved understanding of electromagnetism in the nineteenth century showed that the magnetism of lodestones was properly explained not by magnetic monopole fluids , but rather by a combination of electric currents , the electron magnetic moment , and the magnetic moments of other particles gauss 's law for magnetism , one of maxwell 's equations , is the mathematical statement that magnetic monopoles do not exist nevertheless , pierre curie pointed out in 1894 that magnetic monopoles could conceivably exist , despite not having been seen so far the quantum theory of magnetic charge started with a paper by the physicist paul dirac in 1931 in some theoretical models , magnetic monopoles are unlikely to be observed , because they are too massive to create in particle accelerators ( see below ) , and also too rare in the universe to enter a particle detector with much probability the ends of a flux tube form a magnetic dipole , but since they move independently , they can be treated for many purposes as independent magnetic monopole quasiparticles since 2009 , numerous news reports from the popular media have incorrectly described these systems as the long-awaited discovery of the magnetic monopoles , but the two phenomena are only superficially related to one another '' oleg tchernyshyov at johns hopkins university a researcher in this field cautions that the theory and experiments are specific to spin ices , and are not likely to shed light on magnetic monopoles as predicted by dirac in 2009 , physicists observed magnetic monopoles in a crystalline material called spin ice , which , when cooled to near-absolute zero , seems to fill with atom-sized , classical monopoles but they 're not magnetic monopoles second , many elementary particles have an intrinsic magnetic moment , the most important of which is the electron magnetic dipole moment , which is related to its spin ( physics ) however , in the multipole expansion of a magnetic field , the '' monopole '' term is always exactly zero ( for ordinary matter ) a magnetic dipole is something whose magnetic field is predominantly or exactly described by the magnetic dipole term of the multipole expansion fully symmetric maxwell 's equations can also be written if one allows for the possibility of '' magnetic charges '' analogous to electric charges one example of the work on magnetic monopole quasiparticles is a paper published in the journal science in september 2009 , in which researchers described the observation of quasiparticles resembling magnetic monopoles interview with jonathan morris about magnetic monopoles and magnetic monopole quasiparticles

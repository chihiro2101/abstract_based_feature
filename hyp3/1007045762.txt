thumb castor oil is well known as a source of ricinoleic acid , a unsaturated fat , 18-carbon fatty acid this functional group causes ricinoleic acid ( and castor oil ) to be more polar than most fats the chemical reactivity of the alcohol group also allows chemical derivatization that is not possible with most other seed oils because of its ricinoleic acid content , castor oil is a valuable chemical in feedstocks , commanding a higher price than other seed oils annually 270,000–360,000 tonnes ( 600–800 million pounds ) of castor oil are produced for a variety of uses polyoxyethylated castor oil ( e.g , kolliphor el ) safety datawsheet cremophor el castor oil is also used in the food industries in india , pakistan and nepal food grains are preserved by the application of castor oil in naturopathy , castor oil is promoted as a treatment for several human health conditions , including cysts according to the american cancer society , '' available scientific evidence does not support claims that castor oil on the skin cures cancer or any other disease castor oil has been used in cosmetic products included in creams and as a moisturizer small amounts of castor oil are frequently used in cold process soap to increase lathering in the finished bar castor oil is used as a bio-based polyol in the polyurethane industry the average functionality ( number of hydroxyl groups per triglyceride molecule ) of castor oil is 2.7 , so it is widely used as a rigid polyol and in coatings it is not a drying oil , meaning that it has a low reactivity with air compared to oils such as linseed oil and tung oil dehydration of castor oil yields linoleic acids , which do have drying properties castor oil may be epoxidized by reacting the oh groups with epichlorohydrin to make the triglycidyl ether of castor oil which is useful in epoxy technology castor oil has better low-temperature viscosity properties and high-temperature lubrication than most vegetable oils , making it useful as a lubricant in jet , diesel , and racing engines the viscosity of castor oil at 10 & nbsp ; °c is 2,420 centipoise a heavy dose of castor oil could be used as a humiliating punishment for adults – overview of chemical properties and manufacturing of castor oil

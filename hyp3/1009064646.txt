the miasma theory was the predominant theory of disease transmission before the germ theory took hold towards the end of the 19th century , and it is no longer accepted as a scientific theory of disease it held that diseases such as cholera , chlamydia infection , or the black death were caused by a , ancient greek : '' pollution '' ) , a noxious form of '' bad air '' emanating from rotting organic matter miasma was considered to be a poisonous vapor or mist filled with particles from decomposed matter ( miasmata ) that was identifiable by its foul smell the theory posited that diseases were the product of environmental factors such as contaminated water , foul air , and poor hygienic conditions the mosaic law contains the earliest sentiment of contagion in the spread of disease , standing in contrast with classical medical tradition and the hippocratic writings 400 bc ) was the first person to write , in his account of the plague of athens , that diseases could spread from an infected person to others singer , charles and dorothea ( 1917 ) '' the scientific position of girolamo fracastoro 1478 ?

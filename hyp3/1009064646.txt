the miasma theory was the predominant theory of disease transmission before the germ theory took hold towards the end of the 19th century , and it is no longer accepted as a scientific theory of disease it held that diseases such as cholera , chlamydia infection , or the black death were caused by a , ancient greek : '' pollution '' ) , a noxious form of '' bad air '' emanating from rotting organic matter miasma was considered to be a poisonous vapor or mist filled with particles from decomposed matter ( miasmata ) that was identifiable by its foul smell the theory posited that diseases were the product of environmental factors such as contaminated water , foul air , and poor hygienic conditions such infections , according to the theory , were not passed between individuals but would affect those within a locale that gave rise to such vapors the mosaic law contains the earliest sentiment of contagion in the spread of disease , standing in contrast with classical medical tradition and the hippocratic writings singer , charles and dorothea ( 1917 ) '' the scientific position of girolamo fracastoro 1478 ? –1553 with especial reference to the source , character and influence of his theory of infection , '' annals of medical history , 1 : 1–34 ; see p 131–32 : '' … there was the awful spectacle of men dying like sheep , through having caught the infection in nursing each other on the one hand , if they were afraid to visit each other , they perished from neglect ; indeed many houses were emptied of their inmates for want of a nurse : on the other , if they ventured to do so , death was the consequence '' one theory of the spread of contagious diseases that were not spread by direct contact was that they were spread by spore-like '' seeds '' ( latin : semina ) that were present in and dispersible through the air 55 bc ) stated that the world contained various '' seeds '' , some of which could sicken a person if they were inhaled or ingested national library of medicine , national institutes of health lucretius with rev or even , as may be the case , the infection remains suspended in the air itself ; and when , as we breathe , we inhale the air mingled with it , we must necessarily absorb those seeds of disease into our body , varro on farming ( london , england : g 4 in his on the different types of fever ( c ad 175 ) , galen speculated that plagues were spread by '' certain seeds of plague '' , which were present in the air in book iv of the el-kanun , ibn sina discussed epidemics , outlining the classical miasma theory and attempting to blend it with his own early contagion theory 1250–1336 ) , while discussing islamic diet and hygiene , gave warnings about how contagion can contaminate water , food , and garments , and could spread through the water supply , and may have implied contagion to be unseen particles when the black death bubonic plague reached al-andalus in the 14th century , the arab physicians ibn khatima ( c 1369 ) and ibn al-khatib ( 1313–1374 ) hypothesised that infectious diseases were caused by '' minute bodies '' and described how they can be transmitted through garments , vessels and earrings during the early middle ages , isidore of seville ( c 1305–1370 ) of bologna , italy mentioned galen 's '' seeds of plague '' in his work commentaria non-parum utilia in libros galeni ( helpful commentaries on the books of galen ) he had one of the jars open , another one tightly sealed , and the last one covered with gauze after a few days , he observed that the meatloaf in the open jar was covered with maggots , and the jar covered with gauze had maggots on the surface of the gauze however , the tightly sealed jar had no maggots inside or outside it he was the first to attribute infectious disease to a microscopic pathogen , inventing the germ theory of disease , which he outlined in his scrutinium physico-medicum ( rome 1658 ) 566–78 in 1762 , the austrian physician marcus antonius von plenciz ( 1705–1786 ) published a book titled opera medico-physica von plenciz noted the distinction between diseases which are both epidemic and contagious ( like measles and dysentery ) , and diseases which are contagious but not epidemic ( like rabies and leprosy ) he discovered the pathology of the puerperal fever and the pyogenic vibrio in the blood , and suggested using boric acid to kill these microorganisms before and after confinement even in koch 's time , it was recognized that some infectious agents were clearly responsible for disease even though they did not fulfill all of the postulates the third postulate specifies '' should '' , not '' must '' , because as koch himself proved in regard to both tuberculosis and cholera , not all organisms exposed to an infectious agent will acquire the infection

paranoia is a humorous role-playing game set in a dystopia similar to nineteen eighty-four , brave new world , logan 's run , and thx 1138 ; however , the tone of the game is rife with black humor , frequently tongue-in-cheek rather than dark and heavy most of the game 's humor is derived from the players ' ( usually futile ) attempts to complete their assignment while simultaneously adhering to the computer 's arbitrary , contradictory and often nonsensical security directives the game 's main setting is an immense , futuristic city called alpha complex the computer serves as the game 's principal antagonist , and fears a number of threats to its 'perfect ' society , such as the outdoors , mutants , and secret society ( especially communism ) to deal with these threats , the computer employs troubleshooters , whose job is to go out , find trouble , and shoot it player characters are usually troubleshooters , although later game supplements have allowed the players to take on other roles , such as high-programmers of alpha complex the player characters frequently receive mission instructions from the computer that are incomprehensible , self-contradictory , or obviously fatal if adhered to , and side-missions ( such as mandatory bonus duties ) that conflict with the main mission every player 's character is assigned six clones , known as a six-pack , which are used to replace the preceding clone upon his or her death as a result , paranoia allows characters to be routinely killed , yet the player can continue instead of leaving the game the paranoia rulebook is unusual in a number of ways ; demonstrating any knowledge of the rules is forbidden , and most of the rulebook is written in an easy , conversational tone that often makes fun of the players and their characters , while occasionally taking digs at other notable role-playing games paranoia features a security clearance system based on colors of the visible spectrum which heavily restricts what the players can and can not legally do ; everything from corridors to food and equipment have security restrictions the lowest rating is infrared , but the lowest playable security clearance is red ; the game usually begins with the characters having just been promoted to red grade security clearance is not related to competence but is instead the result of the computer 's often insane and unjustified calculus of trust concerning a citizen the 1st edition also included secret societies such as programs groups ( the personal agents and spies of the high programmers at the apex of alpha complex society ) and spy for another alpha complex the actual societies which would be encountered in a game depends on the play style ; some societies are more suited for more light-hearted games ( zap-style , or the lighter end of classic ) , whereas others represent a more serious threat to alpha complex and are therefore more suitable for straight or the more dark sort of classic games three of these were published by west end games - the 1st , 2nd , and '' fifth '' editions - whereas the later three editions ( paranoia xp , the 25th anniversary edition and the '' red clearance '' edition ) were published by mongoose publishing 150px 1st edition - written by greg costikyan , dan gelber , and eric goldberg - published in 1984 by west end games in 1985 , this edition of paranoia won the origins award for best roleplaying rules of 1984 150px 2nd edition - written by greg costikyan , dan gelber , eric goldberg , ken rolston , and paul murphy - published in 1987 by west end games many of the supplements released for the second edition fall into a story arc set up by new writers and line editors that was intended to freshen up the game and broaden roleplay possibilities while they undoubtedly did so , giving roleplayers the opportunity to transcend time and space , play in a post-apocalyptic computerless alpha complex , or play in a post-post-apocalyptic alpha complex in which the computer battled for control with other factions , many fans felt these new settings ran counter to the spirit of the game in particular , many felt the removal of the computer - and thus the power structure associated with it - and the greater freedom given to player characters effectively wrecked the very premise of the game , which required that player characters had little freedom , had to appease the demands of the computer , and were presented with insane situations that arose from the ludicrous rules of alpha complex society 150px '' fifth edition '' - published in 1995 by west end games - was in fact the third edition of the game released ( the game skipped two editions as a joke , and possibly also as a reference to the two major revisions to the game released during the lifetime of the second edition with the crash course manual and the paranoia sourcebook almost none of the original production staff were involved , and the books in this line focused less on the dark humor and oppressive nature of alpha , and more on cheap pop culture spoofs , such as a vampire : the masquerade parody following the extremely negative reception of the fifth edition , west end games began planning a new edition of the game , which would be released as the '' third edition '' in an interview in 1999 scott palter of west end expressed hopes that the third edition would be published that summer ; however , he also disclosed that court proceedings had been begun by the original designers in order to reclaim the rights to the game the designers would ultimately succeed in purchasing the rights to the game , putting an end to any possibility that the final west end games edition would be released straight represents a relatively new style for paranoia , although it is not entirely without precedent in the darker portions of the original 1st edition rules primary designer allen varney , in the designer 's notes , explained that his aim with the new edition was to return to the game 's roots whilst updating both the game system and the satirical setting to take account of twenty years of game design progress each of the three books is an entirely self-contained and playable game : paranoia : troubleshooters , paranoia : internal security , and paranoia : high programmers the internal security volume casts the player characters as blue-clearance internal security agents , a refinement of the premise of the 1st edition supplement hil sector blues ( reprinted in the xp line as part of extreme paranoia ) the third game , paranoia : high programmers , casts the player characters as the ultraviolet-clearance elite of alpha complex society and focuses on the political plotting and infighting that dominates the high programmers ' lives , a premise not dissimilar to the violet-level campaign ideas presented in extreme paranoia the game was inducted into the origins awards hall of fame in 2007 paranoia : happiness is mandatory store page however the game unexpectedly ceased to be available in mid-january 2020 when the egs store page for the game unexpectedly began returning a 404 error

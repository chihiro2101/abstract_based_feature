paranoia is a humorous role-playing game set in a dystopia similar to nineteen eighty-four , brave new world , logan 's run , and thx 1138 ; however , the tone of the game is rife with black humor , frequently tongue-in-cheek rather than dark and heavy most of the game 's humor is derived from the players ' ( usually futile ) attempts to complete their assignment while simultaneously adhering to the computer 's arbitrary , contradictory and often nonsensical security directives the game 's main setting is an immense , futuristic city called alpha complex the computer serves as the game 's principal antagonist , and fears a number of threats to its 'perfect ' society , such as the outdoors , mutants , and secret society ( especially communism ) player characters are usually troubleshooters , although later game supplements have allowed the players to take on other roles , such as high-programmers of alpha complex the player characters frequently receive mission instructions from the computer that are incomprehensible , self-contradictory , or obviously fatal if adhered to , and side-missions ( such as mandatory bonus duties ) that conflict with the main mission as a result , paranoia allows characters to be routinely killed , yet the player can continue instead of leaving the game this easy spending of clones tends to lead to frequent firefights , gruesome slapstick , and the horrible yet humorous demise of most if not all of the player character 's clone family the lowest rating is infrared , but the lowest playable security clearance is red ; the game usually begins with the characters having just been promoted to red grade the 1st edition also included secret societies such as programs groups ( the personal agents and spies of the high programmers at the apex of alpha complex society ) and spy for another alpha complex three of these were published by west end games - the 1st , 2nd , and '' fifth '' editions - whereas the later three editions ( paranoia xp , the 25th anniversary edition and the '' red clearance '' edition ) were published by mongoose publishing 150px 1st edition - written by greg costikyan , dan gelber , and eric goldberg - published in 1984 by west end games this edition , while encouraging dark humour in-game , took a fairly serious dystopian tone ; the supplements and adventures released to accompany it emphasised the lighter side , however , establishing the freewheeling mix of slapstick , intra-team backstabbing and satire that is classically associated with a game of paranoia 150px 2nd edition - written by greg costikyan , dan gelber , eric goldberg , ken rolston , and paul murphy - published in 1987 by west end games this edition can be seen as a response to the natural development of the line towards a rules-light , fast and entertaining play style many of the supplements released for the second edition fall into a story arc set up by new writers and line editors that was intended to freshen up the game and broaden roleplay possibilities while they undoubtedly did so , giving roleplayers the opportunity to transcend time and space , play in a post-apocalyptic computerless alpha complex , or play in a post-post-apocalyptic alpha complex in which the computer battled for control with other factions , many fans felt these new settings ran counter to the spirit of the game secret society wars : introduced in the doa sector travelogue , and supported by a series of secret society wars modules 150px '' fifth edition '' - published in 1995 by west end games - was in fact the third edition of the game released '' unperson '' ) by the writers of the current edition , due to its extremely poor commercial and critical reception after they too departed , editorial control fell to—how do i put this tactfully ? —people with different views of the paranoia line following the extremely negative reception of the fifth edition , west end games began planning a new edition of the game , which would be released as the '' third edition '' in an interview in 1999 scott palter of west end expressed hopes that the third edition would be published that summer ; however , he also disclosed that court proceedings had been begun by the original designers in order to reclaim the rights to the game 150px following the bankruptcy of west end games , the original designers of paranoia banded together and purchased the rights to the game from west end in order to regain control of the line the symbol of this game style is two smoking boots , much like the front cover best for a one-shot game of paranoia classic is the atmosphere associated with the 2nd edition varney has explained that this is due mainly to his distaste for the direction the metaplot took the game line in , a distaste he asserts is shared by the game 's fan community he has also stated that he personally has little affection for the '' zap '' style , and therefore may have given it short shrift in the main rulebook , although later supplements for paranoia xp did provide more support for zap play paranoia xp marked his return to the line as well ; he has designed every cover of the xp edition , and many books contain both his classic and new paranoia art in addition , varney ran an online game , the toothpaste disaster , where players took the role of high programmers documenting the titular disaster in a lexicon format each of the three books is an entirely self-contained and playable game : paranoia : troubleshooters , paranoia : internal security , and paranoia : high programmers the internal security volume includes an appendix listing three new styles tailored for the game - '' heist '' , '' overkill '' and '' horror '' paranoia was also made into a video game called the paranoia complex released in 1989 by magic bytes paranoia : happiness is mandatory store page however the game unexpectedly ceased to be available in mid-january 2020 when the egs store page for the game unexpectedly began returning a 404 error

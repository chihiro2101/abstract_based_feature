paranoia is a humorous role-playing game set in a dystopia similar to nineteen eighty-four , brave new world , logan 's run , and thx 1138 ; however , the tone of the game is rife with black humor , frequently tongue-in-cheek rather than dark and heavy most of the game 's humor is derived from the players ' ( usually futile ) attempts to complete their assignment while simultaneously adhering to the computer 's arbitrary , contradictory and often nonsensical security directives the game 's main setting is an immense , futuristic city called alpha complex alpha complex is controlled by the computer , a civil service ai construct ( a literal realization of the '' influencing machine '' that some schizophrenics fear ) the computer serves as the game 's principal antagonist , and fears a number of threats to its 'perfect ' society , such as the outdoors , mutants , and secret society ( especially communism ) player characters are usually troubleshooters , although later game supplements have allowed the players to take on other roles , such as high-programmers of alpha complex the player characters frequently receive mission instructions from the computer that are incomprehensible , self-contradictory , or obviously fatal if adhered to , and side-missions ( such as mandatory bonus duties ) that conflict with the main mission additionally , each player character is generally an unregistered mutant and a secret society member ( which are both termination offenses in alpha complex ) , and has a hidden agenda separate from the group 's goals , often involving stealing from or killing teammates every player 's character is assigned six clones , known as a six-pack , which are used to replace the preceding clone upon his or her death the game lacks a conventional health system ; most wounds the player characters can suffer are assumed to be fatal as a result , paranoia allows characters to be routinely killed , yet the player can continue instead of leaving the game paranoia features a security clearance system based on colors of the visible spectrum which heavily restricts what the players can and can not legally do ; everything from corridors to food and equipment have security restrictions the lowest rating is infrared , but the lowest playable security clearance is red ; the game usually begins with the characters having just been promoted to red grade security clearance is not related to competence but is instead the result of the computer 's often insane and unjustified calculus of trust concerning a citizen for example , previous editions included societies such as the '' seal club '' that idolizes the outdoors but is unsure what plants and animals actually look like other societies include the knights of the circular object ( based on the knights of the round table ) , the trekkies , and the first church of christ computer programmer the 1st edition also included secret societies such as programs groups ( the personal agents and spies of the high programmers at the apex of alpha complex society ) and spy for another alpha complex three of these were published by west end games - the 1st , 2nd , and '' fifth '' editions - whereas the later three editions ( paranoia xp , the 25th anniversary edition and the '' red clearance '' edition ) were published by mongoose publishing 150px 1st edition - written by greg costikyan , dan gelber , and eric goldberg - published in 1984 by west end games this edition , while encouraging dark humour in-game , took a fairly serious dystopian tone ; the supplements and adventures released to accompany it emphasised the lighter side , however , establishing the freewheeling mix of slapstick , intra-team backstabbing and satire that is classically associated with a game of paranoia here , the humorous possibilities of life in a paranoid dystopia are emphasised , and the rules are simplified considerably from the first edition many of the supplements released for the second edition fall into a story arc set up by new writers and line editors that was intended to freshen up the game and broaden roleplay possibilities in particular , many felt the removal of the computer - and thus the power structure associated with it - and the greater freedom given to player characters effectively wrecked the very premise of the game , which required that player characters had little freedom , had to appease the demands of the computer , and were presented with insane situations that arose from the ludicrous rules of alpha complex society the computer returns , but does not control all of alpha complex - plays as a hybrid of the other eras , with players free to choose sides 150px '' fifth edition '' - published in 1995 by west end games - was in fact the third edition of the game released '' unperson '' ) by the writers of the current edition , due to its extremely poor commercial and critical reception following the extremely negative reception of the fifth edition , west end games began planning a new edition of the game , which would be released as the '' third edition '' due to west end games ' financial problems this edition was never completed in an interview in 1999 scott palter of west end expressed hopes that the third edition would be published that summer ; however , he also disclosed that court proceedings had been begun by the original designers in order to reclaim the rights to the game 150px following the bankruptcy of west end games , the original designers of paranoia banded together and purchased the rights to the game from west end in order to regain control of the line he has also stated that he personally has little affection for the '' zap '' style , and therefore may have given it short shrift in the main rulebook , although later supplements for paranoia xp did provide more support for zap play each of the three books is an entirely self-contained and playable game : paranoia : troubleshooters , paranoia : internal security , and paranoia : high programmers this game is best treated as a succession of short adventure sessions in which players get to enjoy themselves doing all those despicable things that would spoil a more 'serious â€™ game paranoia was also made into a video game called the paranoia complex released in 1989 by magic bytes paranoia : happiness is mandatory store page however the game unexpectedly ceased to be available in mid-january 2020 when the egs store page for the game unexpectedly began returning a 404 error

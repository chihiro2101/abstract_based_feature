paranoia is a humorous role-playing game set in a dystopia similar to nineteen eighty-four , brave new world , logan 's run , and thx 1138 ; however , the tone of the game is rife with black humor , frequently tongue-in-cheek rather than dark and heavy most of the game 's humor is derived from the players ' ( usually futile ) attempts to complete their assignment while simultaneously adhering to the computer 's arbitrary , contradictory and often nonsensical security directives the game 's main setting is an immense , futuristic city called alpha complex alpha complex is controlled by the computer , a civil service ai construct ( a literal realization of the '' influencing machine '' that some schizophrenics fear ) the computer serves as the game 's principal antagonist , and fears a number of threats to its 'perfect ' society , such as the outdoors , mutants , and secret society ( especially communism ) player characters are usually troubleshooters , although later game supplements have allowed the players to take on other roles , such as high-programmers of alpha complex every player 's character is assigned six clones , known as a six-pack , which are used to replace the preceding clone upon his or her death the game lacks a conventional health system ; most wounds the player characters can suffer are assumed to be fatal as a result , paranoia allows characters to be routinely killed , yet the player can continue instead of leaving the game the paranoia rulebook is unusual in a number of ways ; demonstrating any knowledge of the rules is forbidden , and most of the rulebook is written in an easy , conversational tone that often makes fun of the players and their characters , while occasionally taking digs at other notable role-playing games paranoia features a security clearance system based on colors of the visible spectrum which heavily restricts what the players can and can not legally do ; everything from corridors to food and equipment have security restrictions it is suggested that it may if fact be the high programmers ' meddling with the computer 's programming that resulted in it 's insanity the actual societies which would be encountered in a game depends on the play style ; some societies are more suited for more light-hearted games ( zap-style , or the lighter end of classic ) , whereas others represent a more serious threat to alpha complex and are therefore more suitable for straight or the more dark sort of classic games three of these were published by west end games - the 1st , 2nd , and '' fifth '' editions - whereas the later three editions ( paranoia xp , the 25th anniversary edition and the '' red clearance '' edition ) were published by mongoose publishing 150px 1st edition - written by greg costikyan , dan gelber , and eric goldberg - published in 1984 by west end games in 1985 , this edition of paranoia won the origins award for best roleplaying rules of 1984 this edition , while encouraging dark humour in-game , took a fairly serious dystopian tone ; the supplements and adventures released to accompany it emphasised the lighter side , however , establishing the freewheeling mix of slapstick , intra-team backstabbing and satire that is classically associated with a game of paranoia 150px 2nd edition - written by greg costikyan , dan gelber , eric goldberg , ken rolston , and paul murphy - published in 1987 by west end games while they undoubtedly did so , giving roleplayers the opportunity to transcend time and space , play in a post-apocalyptic computerless alpha complex , or play in a post-post-apocalyptic alpha complex in which the computer battled for control with other factions , many fans felt these new settings ran counter to the spirit of the game in particular , many felt the removal of the computer - and thus the power structure associated with it - and the greater freedom given to player characters effectively wrecked the very premise of the game , which required that player characters had little freedom , had to appease the demands of the computer , and were presented with insane situations that arose from the ludicrous rules of alpha complex society 150px '' fifth edition '' - published in 1995 by west end games - was in fact the third edition of the game released ( the game skipped two editions as a joke , and possibly also as a reference to the two major revisions to the game released during the lifetime of the second edition with the crash course manual and the paranoia sourcebook as well as the lighter , sillier atmosphere , fans also disliked the lower production values of the new edition , in which most of the internal art consisted of extremely cartoonish and sketchy illustrations as opposed to the more detailed and thematically-appropriate jim holloway illustrations of previous editions in ken â€™ s wake , developers doug kaufman and paul murphy in turn briefly supervised the paranoia line . unreleased west end games third edition following the extremely negative reception of the fifth edition , west end games began planning a new edition of the game , which would be released as the '' third edition '' the designers would ultimately succeed in purchasing the rights to the game , putting an end to any possibility that the final west end games edition would be released 150px following the bankruptcy of west end games , the original designers of paranoia banded together and purchased the rights to the game from west end in order to regain control of the line the designers in turn granted a license to mongoose publishing to produce a new version of the game , with the result that paranoia xp , written by allen varney , aaron allston , paul baldowski , beth fischi , dan curtis johnson and greg costikyan , was published in 2004 in a posting on rpg.net he explained that the point of including the three playstyles in paranoia xp was to counteract the impression that '' zap '' -styled play was the default for paranoia , an impression which had in part been created by the more cartoonish later supplements in the west end games line ( as well as '' fifth edition '' ) varney has explained that this is due mainly to his distaste for the direction the metaplot took the game line in , a distaste he asserts is shared by the game 's fan community he has also stated that he personally has little affection for the '' zap '' style , and therefore may have given it short shrift in the main rulebook , although later supplements for paranoia xp did provide more support for zap play each of the three books is an entirely self-contained and playable game : paranoia : troubleshooters , paranoia : internal security , and paranoia : high programmers paranoia : happiness is mandatory , is a video game that was released on december 5 , 2019 , for pc on the epic game store ( egs ) paranoia : happiness is mandatory store page however the game unexpectedly ceased to be available in mid-january 2020 when the egs store page for the game unexpectedly began returning a 404 error

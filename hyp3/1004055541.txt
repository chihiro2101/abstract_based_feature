paranoia is a humorous role-playing game set in a dystopia similar to nineteen eighty-four , brave new world , logan 's run , and thx 1138 ; however , the tone of the game is rife with black humor , frequently tongue-in-cheek rather than dark and heavy most of the game 's humor is derived from the players ' ( usually futile ) attempts to complete their assignment while simultaneously adhering to the computer 's arbitrary , contradictory and often nonsensical security directives the game 's main setting is an immense , futuristic city called alpha complex the computer serves as the game 's principal antagonist , and fears a number of threats to its 'perfect ' society , such as the outdoors , mutants , and secret society ( especially communism ) to deal with these threats , the computer employs troubleshooters , whose job is to go out , find trouble , and shoot it player characters are usually troubleshooters , although later game supplements have allowed the players to take on other roles , such as high-programmers of alpha complex the player characters frequently receive mission instructions from the computer that are incomprehensible , self-contradictory , or obviously fatal if adhered to , and side-missions ( such as mandatory bonus duties ) that conflict with the main mission failing a mission generally results in termination of the player character , but succeeding can just as often result in the same fate , after being rewarded for successfully concluding the mission additionally , each player character is generally an unregistered mutant and a secret society member ( which are both termination offenses in alpha complex ) , and has a hidden agenda separate from the group 's goals , often involving stealing from or killing teammates the game 's manual encourages suspicion between players , offering several tips on how to make the gameplay as paranoid as possible as a result , paranoia allows characters to be routinely killed , yet the player can continue instead of leaving the game this easy spending of clones tends to lead to frequent firefights , gruesome slapstick , and the horrible yet humorous demise of most if not all of the player character 's clone family paranoia features a security clearance system based on colors of the visible spectrum which heavily restricts what the players can and can not legally do ; everything from corridors to food and equipment have security restrictions the lowest rating is infrared , but the lowest playable security clearance is red ; the game usually begins with the characters having just been promoted to red grade in the game , secret society tend to be based on sketchy and spurious knowledge of historical matters other societies include the knights of the circular object ( based on the knights of the round table ) , the trekkies , and the first church of christ computer programmer the 1st edition also included secret societies such as programs groups ( the personal agents and spies of the high programmers at the apex of alpha complex society ) and spy for another alpha complex the actual societies which would be encountered in a game depends on the play style ; some societies are more suited for more light-hearted games ( zap-style , or the lighter end of classic ) , whereas others represent a more serious threat to alpha complex and are therefore more suitable for straight or the more dark sort of classic games three of these were published by west end games - the 1st , 2nd , and '' fifth '' editions - whereas the later three editions ( paranoia xp , the 25th anniversary edition and the '' red clearance '' edition ) were published by mongoose publishing in addition to these six published editions , it is known that west end games were working on a '' third edition '' - to replace the poorly received fifth edition - in the late 1990s , but their financial issues would prevent this edition from being published , except for being included in one tournament adventure 150px 1st edition - written by greg costikyan , dan gelber , and eric goldberg - published in 1984 by west end games in 1985 , this edition of paranoia won the origins award for best roleplaying rules of 1984 this edition , while encouraging dark humour in-game , took a fairly serious dystopian tone ; the supplements and adventures released to accompany it emphasised the lighter side , however , establishing the freewheeling mix of slapstick , intra-team backstabbing and satire that is classically associated with a game of paranoia 150px 2nd edition - written by greg costikyan , dan gelber , eric goldberg , ken rolston , and paul murphy - published in 1987 by west end games many of the supplements released for the second edition fall into a story arc set up by new writers and line editors that was intended to freshen up the game and broaden roleplay possibilities while they undoubtedly did so , giving roleplayers the opportunity to transcend time and space , play in a post-apocalyptic computerless alpha complex , or play in a post-post-apocalyptic alpha complex in which the computer battled for control with other factions , many fans felt these new settings ran counter to the spirit of the game 150px '' fifth edition '' - published in 1995 by west end games - was in fact the third edition of the game released as well as the lighter , sillier atmosphere , fans also disliked the lower production values of the new edition , in which most of the internal art consisted of extremely cartoonish and sketchy illustrations as opposed to the more detailed and thematically-appropriate jim holloway illustrations of previous editions the designers would ultimately succeed in purchasing the rights to the game , putting an end to any possibility that the final west end games edition would be released 150px following the bankruptcy of west end games , the original designers of paranoia banded together and purchased the rights to the game from west end in order to regain control of the line the designers in turn granted a license to mongoose publishing to produce a new version of the game , with the result that paranoia xp , written by allen varney , aaron allston , paul baldowski , beth fischi , dan curtis johnson and greg costikyan , was published in 2004 in a departure from previous mongoose editions , red clearance edition utilises a d6-based dice pool system as well as using cards for equipment , mutant powers , secret societies , and combat actions '' in the april 1988 edition of dragon ( issue 132 ) , jim bambra thought that the second edition had marked improvements compared to the first edition : '' the first edition of paranoia ] promised hilarious fun and a combat system that didn ’ t get bogged down in tedious mechanics this game is best treated as a succession of short adventure sessions in which players get to enjoy themselves doing all those despicable things that would spoil a more 'serious ’ game paranoia : happiness is mandatory store page however the game unexpectedly ceased to be available in mid-january 2020 when the egs store page for the game unexpectedly began returning a 404 error

paranoia is a humorous role-playing game set in a dystopia similar to nineteen eighty-four , brave new world , logan 's run , and thx 1138 ; however , the tone of the game is rife with black humor , frequently tongue-in-cheek rather than dark and heavy most of the game 's humor is derived from the players ' ( usually futile ) attempts to complete their assignment while simultaneously adhering to the computer 's arbitrary , contradictory and often nonsensical security directives the game 's main setting is an immense , futuristic city called alpha complex alpha complex is controlled by the computer , a civil service ai construct ( a literal realization of the '' influencing machine '' that some schizophrenics fear ) the computer serves as the game 's principal antagonist , and fears a number of threats to its 'perfect ' society , such as the outdoors , mutants , and secret society ( especially communism ) to deal with these threats , the computer employs troubleshooters , whose job is to go out , find trouble , and shoot it player characters are usually troubleshooters , although later game supplements have allowed the players to take on other roles , such as high-programmers of alpha complex the player characters frequently receive mission instructions from the computer that are incomprehensible , self-contradictory , or obviously fatal if adhered to , and side-missions ( such as mandatory bonus duties ) that conflict with the main mission failing a mission generally results in termination of the player character , but succeeding can just as often result in the same fate , after being rewarded for successfully concluding the mission every player 's character is assigned six clones , known as a six-pack , which are used to replace the preceding clone upon his or her death the game lacks a conventional health system ; most wounds the player characters can suffer are assumed to be fatal as a result , paranoia allows characters to be routinely killed , yet the player can continue instead of leaving the game the paranoia rulebook is unusual in a number of ways ; demonstrating any knowledge of the rules is forbidden , and most of the rulebook is written in an easy , conversational tone that often makes fun of the players and their characters , while occasionally taking digs at other notable role-playing games the lowest rating is infrared , but the lowest playable security clearance is red ; the game usually begins with the characters having just been promoted to red grade in the game , secret society tend to be based on sketchy and spurious knowledge of historical matters for example , previous editions included societies such as the '' seal club '' that idolizes the outdoors but is unsure what plants and animals actually look like three of these were published by west end games - the 1st , 2nd , and '' fifth '' editions - whereas the later three editions ( paranoia xp , the 25th anniversary edition and the '' red clearance '' edition ) were published by mongoose publishing 150px 1st edition - written by greg costikyan , dan gelber , and eric goldberg - published in 1984 by west end games 150px 2nd edition - written by greg costikyan , dan gelber , eric goldberg , ken rolston , and paul murphy - published in 1987 by west end games this edition can be seen as a response to the natural development of the line towards a rules-light , fast and entertaining play style here , the humorous possibilities of life in a paranoid dystopia are emphasised , and the rules are simplified considerably from the first edition many of the supplements released for the second edition fall into a story arc set up by new writers and line editors that was intended to freshen up the game and broaden roleplay possibilities adventures occur in a fractured complex in which there is no computer , possibly as a result of the secret society wars , possibly not the computer returns , but does not control all of alpha complex - plays as a hybrid of the other eras , with players free to choose sides 150px '' fifth edition '' - published in 1995 by west end games - was in fact the third edition of the game released '' unperson '' ) by the writers of the current edition , due to its extremely poor commercial and critical reception catalano â€™ s successor fired ( illustrator ) jim holloway and brought in a succession of increasingly poor cartoonists following the extremely negative reception of the fifth edition , west end games began planning a new edition of the game , which would be released as the '' third edition '' the designers would ultimately succeed in purchasing the rights to the game , putting an end to any possibility that the final west end games edition would be released 150px following the bankruptcy of west end games , the original designers of paranoia banded together and purchased the rights to the game from west end in order to regain control of the line this edition of the game has received a much warmer critical reception , as well as selling well in both the core rulebook and the flashbacks supplement - a reprint of classic adventures originally published by west end games - varney was highly critical of west end games ' handling of the product line in its latter days each of the three books is an entirely self-contained and playable game : paranoia : troubleshooters , paranoia : internal security , and paranoia : high programmers '' in a 1996 reader poll conducted by arcane magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time , paranoia was ranked 7th paranoia : happiness is mandatory , is a video game that was released on december 5 , 2019 , for pc on the epic game store ( egs )

after studying theology under schleiermacher and de wette , he turned to pure philosophy , studying england writers and the german modifiers of kantianism , such as jacobi , fries and schopenhauer in 1820 , he published erkenntnisslehre , erfahrungsseelenlehre als grundlage alles wissens , and his inaugural dissertation de veris philosophiae initiis the distinctive features of beneke 's system are the firmness with which he maintained that in empirical psychology is to be found the basis of all philosophy , and his rigid treatment of mental phenomena by the genetic method according to beneke , the perfected mind is a development from simple elements , and the first problem of philosophy is the determination of these elements and of the processes by which the development takes place this and the introduction to his lehrbuch signaled the two great stages in tile progress of psychology the negation of innate ideas by john locke , and of faculties , in the ordinary acceptation of the term , by herbart if the union of impression and faculty be sufficiently strong , consciousness ( not self-consciousness ) arises , and definite sensations and perceptions begin to be formed through them he gives a rationale of reproduction and association , and strives to show that all the formed faculties are simply developments from traces of earlier processes all psychical phenomena are explicable by the relation of impression and power , and by the flow of movable elements ; the whole process of mental development is nothing but the result of the action and interaction of the above simple laws thus , the sensations of the special senses are gradually formed from the primary sensuous feelings ( sensliche empfindungen ) ; concepts are formed from intuitions of individuals by the attraction of the common elements , and the consequent flow towards them of movable forms even memory is not a special faculty ; it is simply the fundamental property of tenacity possessed by the original faculties as is the case with all empirical theories of mental development , the higher categories or notions , which are apparently shown to result from the simple elements , are really presupposed at every step a complete list of his writings will be found in the appendix to dressier 's edition of the lehrbuch der psychologie als naturwissenschaft ( 1861 )

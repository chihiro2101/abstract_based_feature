as aerial warfare developed , the allies gained a lead over the germans by introducing machine-gun armed types such as the vickers f.b.5 gunbus fighter and the morane-saulnier l by early 1915 , the german ( ohl , supreme army command ) had ordered the development of machine-gun-armed aircraft to counter those of the allies the new '' c '' class , armed two-seaters and twin-engined '' k '' ( later '' g '' ) class aircraft such as the aeg g.i were attached in ones and twos to ( ffa ) artillery-observation and reconnaissance detachments for '' fighter '' sorties , mostly the escort of unarmed aircraft van wyngarden 2006 , p 469 on 18 april 1915 , the morane-saulnier l of roland garros was captured , after he was forced to land behind the german lines from 1april , garros had destroyed three german aircraft in the morane , which carried a machine-gun firing through the propeller arc saulnier had failed to develop a synchroniser and with garros , as an interim solution , fitted metal wedges to the propeller ; bullets that hit the blades were deflected by them the german authorities requested several aircraft manufacturers , including that of anthony fokker , to produce a copy the fokker company produced the ( push rod controller ) , a genuine synchronisation gear unlike earlier proposed gears the was fitted to an aircraft and proved in flight in a postwar biography , fokker claimed that he produced the gear in 48hours but it was probably designed by heinrich lübbe , a engineer the device was fitted to the most suitable fokker type , the fokker m.5k ( military type name '' fokker a.iii '' ) , of which a.16/15 , assigned to otto parschau , became the prototype of the fokker eindecker series of fighter designs fokker demonstrated a.16/15 to german fighter pilots , including kurt wintgens , oswald boelcke and max immelmann in may and june 1915 the fokker , with its typical controls , an over-sensitive balanced elevator and dubious lateral control , was difficult to fly ; parschau , who was experienced on fokkera types , converted pilots to the new fighter the early were attached to ffas , in ones and twos , to protect reconnaissance machines from allied machine-gun-armed aircraft by 15july , wintgens had moved to ffa48 and scored his first confirmed victory , another moranel the pilots flew the new aircraft as a sideline , when not flying normal operations in two-seater reconnaissance aircraft m.5k/mg prototype airframe e.3/15 , the first delivered to ffa62 , was armed with a parabellum mg14 gun , synchronised by the unreliable first version of the fokker gear at first , e.3/15 was jointly allocated to him and immelmann when their '' official '' duties permitted , allowing them to master the type 's difficult handling characteristics and to practice shooting at ground targets van wyngarden 2006 , p immelmann was soon allocated a very early production fokker e.i , e.13/15 , one of the first armed with the lmg 08 ( a lightened version of the mg08 spandau ) machine-gun , using the more reliable production version of the fokker gear boelcke suffered a jammed gun but immelmann caught up with a b.e.2c and shot it down the fokker pilots took to flying high and diving on their quarry , usually out of the sun , firing a long burst and continuing the dive until well out of range if the british aircraft had not been shot down , the german pilot could climb again and repeat the process 150 the mystique acquired by the fokker was greater than its material effect and in october , rfc hq expressed concern at the willingness of pilots to avoid combat 38 boelcke and immelmann continued to score , as did hans joachim buddecke , ernst von althaus and rudolph berthold from ffa23 and kurt voncrailshein of ffa53 thirteen aeroplanes had been shot down by immelmann or boelcke and the rest by seven other fokker pilots allied casualties had been light by later standards but the loss of air superiority to the germans , flying a new and supposedly invincible aircraft , caused dismay among the allied commanders and lowered the morale of allied airmen in his memoir sagittarius rising ( 1936 ) , cecil lewis wrote , on 14 january , rfc hq issued orders that until better aircraft arrived , long and short-range reconnaissance aircraft must have three escorts flying in close formation sending the b.e.2c into action without an observer armed with a lewis gun also became less prevalent the new tactic of concentrating aircraft in time and space had the effect of reducing the number of reconnaissance sorties the rfc could fly 156–157 new defensive formations were devised ; a ii wing rfc method was for the reconnaissance aircraft to lead , escorted on each side higher , with another escort behind and above 147–148 on 7 february , on a iiwing long-range reconnaissance , the observation pilot flew at ; a german aircraft appeared over roulers and seven more closed in behind the formation west of thourout , two fokkers arrived and attacked at once , one diving on the reconnaissance machine and the other on an escort none of the german pilots attacked and all the british aircraft returned , only to meet two german aircraft coming back from a bombing raid , which opened fire and mortally wounded the pilot of one the escorts the british ascribed their immunity to attack during the 55-minute flight to the rigid formation which the two fokkers were unable to disrupt the effect of the new allied types , especially the nieuport , was of considerable concern to the fokker pilots ; some even took to flying captured examples 29 before the unsuitability of the b.e.2c for aerial combat was exposed by the first fokker aces , criticism was not primarily aimed at the technical quality of royal aircraft factory aircraft but because a government body was competing with private industry the period of allied air superiority that followed the fokker scourge was brief ; by mid-september 1916 , the first twin-spandau armed albatros d.i fighters were coming into service kennett , lee the first air war : 1914–1918 new york , simon & schuster , 1991

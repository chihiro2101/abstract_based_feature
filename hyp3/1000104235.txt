as aerial warfare developed , the allies gained a lead over the germans by introducing machine-gun armed types such as the vickers f.b.5 gunbus fighter and the morane-saulnier l by early 1915 , the german ( ohl , supreme army command ) had ordered the development of machine-gun-armed aircraft to counter those of the allies the new '' c '' class , armed two-seaters and twin-engined '' k '' ( later '' g '' ) class aircraft such as the aeg g.i were attached in ones and twos to ( ffa ) artillery-observation and reconnaissance detachments for '' fighter '' sorties , mostly the escort of unarmed aircraft 469 on 18 april 1915 , the morane-saulnier l of roland garros was captured , after he was forced to land behind the german lines from 1april , garros had destroyed three german aircraft in the morane , which carried a machine-gun firing through the propeller arc saulnier had failed to develop a synchroniser and with garros , as an interim solution , fitted metal wedges to the propeller ; bullets that hit the blades were deflected by them garros burned his aircraft but this failed to conceal the nature of the device and the significance of the deflector blades the german authorities requested several aircraft manufacturers , including that of anthony fokker , to produce a copy unlike earlier proposed gears the was fitted to an aircraft and proved in flight in a postwar biography , fokker claimed that he produced the gear in 48hours but it was probably designed by heinrich lübbe , a engineer among several pre-war patents for similar devices was that of franz schneider , a swiss engineer who had worked for nieuport and the german lvg company the device was fitted to the most suitable fokker type , the fokker m.5k ( military type name '' fokker a.iii '' ) , of which a.16/15 , assigned to otto parschau , became the prototype of the fokker eindecker series of fighter designs fokker demonstrated a.16/15 to german fighter pilots , including kurt wintgens , oswald boelcke and max immelmann in may and june 1915 van wyngarden 2006 , p fokker e.5/15 , the last of the pre-production series , is believed to have been first flown in action by kurt wintgens of ffa6 van wyngarden 2006 , p by the end of july 1915 , about fifteen were operational with various units , including the five m.5k/mgs and about ten early production e.i airframes boelcke , in ffa62 , scored his first victory in an albatros c.i on 4july at first , e.3/15 was jointly allocated to him and immelmann when their '' official '' duties permitted , allowing them to master the type 's difficult handling characteristics and to practice shooting at ground targets the machine gun was belt-fed , unlike the drum-fed lewis guns of their opponents , who had to change drums when in action the fokker pilots took to flying high and diving on their quarry , usually out of the sun , firing a long burst and continuing the dive until well out of range immelmann invented the immelmann turn , a zoom after the dive , followed by a roll when vertical to face the opposite way , after which he could turn to attack again 150 the mystique acquired by the fokker was greater than its material effect and in october , rfc hq expressed concern at the willingness of pilots to avoid combat the '' official '' list of claims by fokker pilots for the second half of 1915 was no more than 28 , many of them over french aircraft allied casualties had been light by later standards but the loss of air superiority to the germans , flying a new and supposedly invincible aircraft , caused dismay among the allied commanders and lowered the morale of allied airmen in his memoir sagittarius rising ( 1936 ) , cecil lewis wrote , on 14 january , rfc hq issued orders that until better aircraft arrived , long and short-range reconnaissance aircraft must have three escorts flying in close formation the new tactic of concentrating aircraft in time and space had the effect of reducing the number of reconnaissance sorties the rfc could fly 156–157 new defensive formations were devised ; a ii wing rfc method was for the reconnaissance aircraft to lead , escorted on each side higher , with another escort behind and above 147–148 on 7 february , on a iiwing long-range reconnaissance , the observation pilot flew at ; a german aircraft appeared over roulers and seven more closed in behind the formation , arrived in france on 23january 1916 , for long-range reconnaissance and escort flying on 8 february , 24 squadron ( major lanoe hawker ) arrived with d.h.2s and began patrols north of the somme ; another six d.h.2 squadrons followed pilot caused a fokker to crash onto a roof at bapaume the bogey of the fokker as a fighter was finally laid in april , when an e.iii landed by mistake on a british aerodrome 52 the first british aircraft with a synchronisation gear was a bristol scout , which arrived on 25 march 1916 and on 24 may the first sopwith 1½ strutter aircraft were flown to france by a flight of 70 squadron the effect of the new allied types , especially the nieuport , was of considerable concern to the fokker pilots ; some even took to flying captured examples the kek were units mostly of two to four fighters , equipped with and other types which had served with ffa units during the winter of 1915–1916 29 before the unsuitability of the b.e.2c for aerial combat was exposed by the first fokker aces , criticism was not primarily aimed at the technical quality of royal aircraft factory aircraft but because a government body was competing with private industry the period of allied air superiority that followed the fokker scourge was brief ; by mid-september 1916 , the first twin-spandau armed albatros d.i fighters were coming into service the new aircraft created another fokker scourge in the summer of 1918 and as a condition of the armistice , germany was required to surrender all of its fokker d.viis to the allies kennett , lee the first air war : 1914–1918 new york , simon & schuster , 1991

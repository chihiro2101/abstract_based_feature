as aerial warfare developed , the allies gained a lead over the germans by introducing machine-gun armed types such as the vickers f.b.5 gunbus fighter and the morane-saulnier l by early 1915 , the german ( ohl , supreme army command ) had ordered the development of machine-gun-armed aircraft to counter those of the allies the new '' c '' class , armed two-seaters and twin-engined '' k '' ( later '' g '' ) class aircraft such as the aeg g.i were attached in ones and twos to ( ffa ) artillery-observation and reconnaissance detachments for '' fighter '' sorties , mostly the escort of unarmed aircraft from 1april , garros had destroyed three german aircraft in the morane , which carried a machine-gun firing through the propeller arc garros burned his aircraft but this failed to conceal the nature of the device and the significance of the deflector blades the german authorities requested several aircraft manufacturers , including that of anthony fokker , to produce a copy the fokker company produced the ( push rod controller ) , a genuine synchronisation gear impulses from a cam driven by the engine controlled the timing of the machine-gun for its fire to be limited to the intervals between the propeller blades 's travel past the barrel unlike earlier proposed gears the was fitted to an aircraft and proved in flight in a postwar biography , fokker claimed that he produced the gear in 48hours but it was probably designed by heinrich lübbe , a engineer among several pre-war patents for similar devices was that of franz schneider , a swiss engineer who had worked for nieuport and the german lvg company the device was fitted to the most suitable fokker type , the fokker m.5k ( military type name '' fokker a.iii '' ) , of which a.16/15 , assigned to otto parschau , became the prototype of the fokker eindecker series of fighter designs fokker demonstrated a.16/15 to german fighter pilots , including kurt wintgens , oswald boelcke and max immelmann in may and june 1915 the fokker , with its typical controls , an over-sensitive balanced elevator and dubious lateral control , was difficult to fly ; parschau , who was experienced on fokkera types , converted pilots to the new fighter van wyngarden 2006 , p the early were attached to ffas , in ones and twos , to protect reconnaissance machines from allied machine-gun-armed aircraft the claims were not confirmed but research has shown that the first claim matches french records of a morane forced down on 1july near lunéville , with a wounded crew and a damaged engine , followed three days later by another by the end of july 1915 , about fifteen were operational with various units , including the five m.5k/mgs and about ten early production e.i airframes the pilots flew the new aircraft as a sideline , when not flying normal operations in two-seater reconnaissance aircraft at first , e.3/15 was jointly allocated to him and immelmann when their '' official '' duties permitted , allowing them to master the type 's difficult handling characteristics and to practice shooting at ground targets immelmann was soon allocated a very early production fokker e.i , e.13/15 , one of the first armed with the lmg 08 ( a lightened version of the mg08 spandau ) machine-gun , using the more reliable production version of the fokker gear this aircraft was flown as a bomber , without an observer or lewis gun , the pilot armed only with an automatic pistol by late october , towards the end of the battle of loos , more fokkers ( including the similar pfalz e-type fighters , which were also called fokkers by allied airmen ) were encountered by rfc pilots and by december , forty fokkers were in service 355 in the new fighters , pilots could make long , steep dives , aiming the fixed , synchronised machine-gun by aiming the aircraft the machine gun was belt-fed , unlike the drum-fed lewis guns of their opponents , who had to change drums when in action the fokker pilots took to flying high and diving on their quarry , usually out of the sun , firing a long burst and continuing the dive until well out of range immelmann invented the immelmann turn , a zoom after the dive , followed by a roll when vertical to face the opposite way , after which he could turn to attack again 150 the mystique acquired by the fokker was greater than its material effect and in october , rfc hq expressed concern at the willingness of pilots to avoid combat the '' official '' list of claims by fokker pilots for the second half of 1915 was no more than 28 , many of them over french aircraft allied casualties had been light by later standards but the loss of air superiority to the germans , flying a new and supposedly invincible aircraft , caused dismay among the allied commanders and lowered the morale of allied airmen if contact with the escorts was lost , the reconnaissance must be cancelled , as would photographic reconnaissance to any great distance beyond the front line sending the b.e.2c into action without an observer armed with a lewis gun also became less prevalent 147–148 on 7 february , on a iiwing long-range reconnaissance , the observation pilot flew at ; a german aircraft appeared over roulers and seven more closed in behind the formation west of thourout , two fokkers arrived and attacked at once , one diving on the reconnaissance machine and the other on an escort the british ascribed their immunity to attack during the 55-minute flight to the rigid formation which the two fokkers were unable to disrupt 52 the first british aircraft with a synchronisation gear was a bristol scout , which arrived on 25 march 1916 and on 24 may the first sopwith 1½ strutter aircraft were flown to france by a flight of 70 squadron when the news of the fokker monoplane fighters reached him in late 1915 , grey was quick to blame the problem on orders for equipment that the latest developments had rendered obsolete the new aircraft created another fokker scourge in the summer of 1918 and as a condition of the armistice , germany was required to surrender all of its fokker d.viis to the allies the royal aircraft factory the dream of civilized warfare : world war i flying aces and the american imagination minneapolis , university of minnesota press , 2003

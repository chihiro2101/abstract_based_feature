as aerial warfare developed , the allies gained a lead over the germans by introducing machine-gun armed types such as the vickers f.b.5 gunbus fighter and the morane-saulnier l by early 1915 , the german ( ohl , supreme army command ) had ordered the development of machine-gun-armed aircraft to counter those of the allies the new '' c '' class , armed two-seaters and twin-engined '' k '' ( later '' g '' ) class aircraft such as the aeg g.i were attached in ones and twos to ( ffa ) artillery-observation and reconnaissance detachments for '' fighter '' sorties , mostly the escort of unarmed aircraft 469 on 18 april 1915 , the morane-saulnier l of roland garros was captured , after he was forced to land behind the german lines from 1april , garros had destroyed three german aircraft in the morane , which carried a machine-gun firing through the propeller arc saulnier had failed to develop a synchroniser and with garros , as an interim solution , fitted metal wedges to the propeller ; bullets that hit the blades were deflected by them the german authorities requested several aircraft manufacturers , including that of anthony fokker , to produce a copy impulses from a cam driven by the engine controlled the timing of the machine-gun for its fire to be limited to the intervals between the propeller blades 's travel past the barrel among several pre-war patents for similar devices was that of franz schneider , a swiss engineer who had worked for nieuport and the german lvg company the device was fitted to the most suitable fokker type , the fokker m.5k ( military type name '' fokker a.iii '' ) , of which a.16/15 , assigned to otto parschau , became the prototype of the fokker eindecker series of fighter designs fokker demonstrated a.16/15 to german fighter pilots , including kurt wintgens , oswald boelcke and max immelmann in may and june 1915 fokker e.5/15 , the last of the pre-production series , is believed to have been first flown in action by kurt wintgens of ffa6 van wyngarden 2006 , pp on 1and 4july 1915 , he reported combats with french morane-saulnierl ( parasols ) , well over the french lines the claims were not confirmed but research has shown that the first claim matches french records of a morane forced down on 1july near lunéville , with a wounded crew and a damaged engine , followed three days later by another parschau had received the new e.1/15 ( fokker factory serial 191 ) , the initial example of the five fokker m.5k/mg service test examples for the line of aircraft , when the a.16/15 ( green machine ) , he had flown since the beginning of the war , was returned to the fokker flugzeugbau factory in schwerin–gorries for development by the end of july 1915 , about fifteen were operational with various units , including the five m.5k/mgs and about ten early production e.i airframes the pilots flew the new aircraft as a sideline , when not flying normal operations in two-seater reconnaissance aircraft by late october , towards the end of the battle of loos , more fokkers ( including the similar pfalz e-type fighters , which were also called fokkers by allied airmen ) were encountered by rfc pilots and by december , forty fokkers were in service the machine gun was belt-fed , unlike the drum-fed lewis guns of their opponents , who had to change drums when in action if the british aircraft had not been shot down , the german pilot could climb again and repeat the process immelmann invented the immelmann turn , a zoom after the dive , followed by a roll when vertical to face the opposite way , after which he could turn to attack again 150 the mystique acquired by the fokker was greater than its material effect and in october , rfc hq expressed concern at the willingness of pilots to avoid combat rfc losses were exacerbated by the increase in the number of aircraft at the front , from 85 to 161 between march and september , the hard winter of 1915–1916 and some aggressive flying by the new german '' c '' type two-seaters the '' official '' list of claims by fokker pilots for the second half of 1915 was no more than 28 , many of them over french aircraft thirteen aeroplanes had been shot down by immelmann or boelcke and the rest by seven other fokker pilots january 1916 brought thirteen claims , most of them against the french , followed by twenty more in february , the last month of the '' scourge '' proper most of the victories had been scored by aces rather than the newer pilots flying the greater number of fokkers in his memoir sagittarius rising ( 1936 ) , cecil lewis wrote , on 14 january , rfc hq issued orders that until better aircraft arrived , long and short-range reconnaissance aircraft must have three escorts flying in close formation if contact with the escorts was lost , the reconnaissance must be cancelled , as would photographic reconnaissance to any great distance beyond the front line sending the b.e.2c into action without an observer armed with a lewis gun also became less prevalent the new tactic of concentrating aircraft in time and space had the effect of reducing the number of reconnaissance sorties the rfc could fly none of the german pilots attacked and all the british aircraft returned , only to meet two german aircraft coming back from a bombing raid , which opened fire and mortally wounded the pilot of one the escorts the british ascribed their immunity to attack during the 55-minute flight to the rigid formation which the two fokkers were unable to disrupt organised in specialist fighter squadrons the nieuports could operate in formations larger than the singletons or pairs normally flown by the fokkers , quickly regaining air superiority for the herris and pearson 2010 , p the kek were units mostly of two to four fighters , equipped with and other types which had served with ffa units during the winter of 1915–1916 in the next two years , the allied air forces gradually

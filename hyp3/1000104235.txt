as aerial warfare developed , the allies gained a lead over the germans by introducing machine-gun armed types such as the vickers f.b.5 gunbus fighter and the morane-saulnier l by early 1915 , the german ( ohl , supreme army command ) had ordered the development of machine-gun-armed aircraft to counter those of the allies van wyngarden 2006 , p 469 on 18 april 1915 , the morane-saulnier l of roland garros was captured , after he was forced to land behind the german lines from 1april , garros had destroyed three german aircraft in the morane , which carried a machine-gun firing through the propeller arc garros burned his aircraft but this failed to conceal the nature of the device and the significance of the deflector blades the fokker company produced the ( push rod controller ) , a genuine synchronisation gear impulses from a cam driven by the engine controlled the timing of the machine-gun for its fire to be limited to the intervals between the propeller blades 's travel past the barrel unlike earlier proposed gears the was fitted to an aircraft and proved in flight in a postwar biography , fokker claimed that he produced the gear in 48hours but it was probably designed by heinrich lübbe , a engineer the device was fitted to the most suitable fokker type , the fokker m.5k ( military type name '' fokker a.iii '' ) , of which a.16/15 , assigned to otto parschau , became the prototype of the fokker eindecker series of fighter designs fokker demonstrated a.16/15 to german fighter pilots , including kurt wintgens , oswald boelcke and max immelmann in may and june 1915 the early were attached to ffas , in ones and twos , to protect reconnaissance machines from allied machine-gun-armed aircraft on 1and 4july 1915 , he reported combats with french morane-saulnierl ( parasols ) , well over the french lines by 15july , wintgens had moved to ffa48 and scored his first confirmed victory , another moranel the pilots flew the new aircraft as a sideline , when not flying normal operations in two-seater reconnaissance aircraft m.5k/mg prototype airframe e.3/15 , the first delivered to ffa62 , was armed with a parabellum mg14 gun , synchronised by the unreliable first version of the fokker gear this aircraft was flown as a bomber , without an observer or lewis gun , the pilot armed only with an automatic pistol van wyngarden 2006 , p 355 in the new fighters , pilots could make long , steep dives , aiming the fixed , synchronised machine-gun by aiming the aircraft the machine gun was belt-fed , unlike the drum-fed lewis guns of their opponents , who had to change drums when in action if the british aircraft had not been shot down , the german pilot could climb again and repeat the process immelmann invented the immelmann turn , a zoom after the dive , followed by a roll when vertical to face the opposite way , after which he could turn to attack again 150 the mystique acquired by the fokker was greater than its material effect and in october , rfc hq expressed concern at the willingness of pilots to avoid combat the '' official '' list of claims by fokker pilots for the second half of 1915 was no more than 28 , many of them over french aircraft most of the victories had been scored by aces rather than the newer pilots flying the greater number of fokkers if contact with the escorts was lost , the reconnaissance must be cancelled , as would photographic reconnaissance to any great distance beyond the front line the new tactic of concentrating aircraft in time and space had the effect of reducing the number of reconnaissance sorties the rfc could fly 156–157 new defensive formations were devised ; a ii wing rfc method was for the reconnaissance aircraft to lead , escorted on each side higher , with another escort behind and above 147–148 on 7 february , on a iiwing long-range reconnaissance , the observation pilot flew at ; a german aircraft appeared over roulers and seven more closed in behind the formation six more german aircraft appeared over kortemark and formed a procession of fourteen aeroplanes stalking the british formation , was to be escorted by three b.e.2cs , two f.e.2s and a bristol scout from 12 squadron and two more f.es during march and april increasing numbers of the new french nieuport 11 fighters were sent to verdun british f.e.2b pusher aircraft had been arriving in france from late 1915 and in the new year began to replace the older f.b.5s the pilot and observer had a good view forwards from their cockpits and the observer could also fire backwards over the tail the airco dh.2 single-seat fighter , began to arrive at the front in february 1916 the bogey of the fokker as a fighter was finally laid in april , when an e.iii landed by mistake on a british aerodrome their supposed object was the replacement of the b.e.2c with better aircraft but it took the form of an attack on the rfc command and the royal aircraft factory grey had orchestrated a campaign against the royal aircraft factory in the pages of the aeroplane , going back to its period as the balloon factory , well before it had produced any heavier-than-air aircraft the period of allied air superiority that followed the fokker scourge was brief ; by mid-september 1916 , the first twin-spandau armed albatros d.i fighters were coming into service

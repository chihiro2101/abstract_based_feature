as aerial warfare developed , the allies gained a lead over the germans by introducing machine-gun armed types such as the vickers f.b.5 gunbus fighter and the morane-saulnier l by early 1915 , the german ( ohl , supreme army command ) had ordered the development of machine-gun-armed aircraft to counter those of the allies 469 on 18 april 1915 , the morane-saulnier l of roland garros was captured , after he was forced to land behind the german lines saulnier had failed to develop a synchroniser and with garros , as an interim solution , fitted metal wedges to the propeller ; bullets that hit the blades were deflected by them garros burned his aircraft but this failed to conceal the nature of the device and the significance of the deflector blades the german authorities requested several aircraft manufacturers , including that of anthony fokker , to produce a copy the fokker company produced the ( push rod controller ) , a genuine synchronisation gear unlike earlier proposed gears the was fitted to an aircraft and proved in flight fokker demonstrated a.16/15 to german fighter pilots , including kurt wintgens , oswald boelcke and max immelmann in may and june 1915 the fokker , with its typical controls , an over-sensitive balanced elevator and dubious lateral control , was difficult to fly ; parschau , who was experienced on fokkera types , converted pilots to the new fighter the early were attached to ffas , in ones and twos , to protect reconnaissance machines from allied machine-gun-armed aircraft fokker e.5/15 , the last of the pre-production series , is believed to have been first flown in action by kurt wintgens of ffa6 on 1and 4july 1915 , he reported combats with french morane-saulnierl ( parasols ) , well over the french lines franks 2001 , pp by the end of july 1915 , about fifteen were operational with various units , including the five m.5k/mgs and about ten early production e.i airframes the pilots flew the new aircraft as a sideline , when not flying normal operations in two-seater reconnaissance aircraft at first , e.3/15 was jointly allocated to him and immelmann when their '' official '' duties permitted , allowing them to master the type 's difficult handling characteristics and to practice shooting at ground targets boelcke suffered a jammed gun but immelmann caught up with a b.e.2c and shot it down this aircraft was flown as a bomber , without an observer or lewis gun , the pilot armed only with an automatic pistol after about ten minutes of manoeuvring ( giving the lie to exaggerated accounts of the stability of b.e.2 aircraft ) immelmann had fired 450rounds , which riddled the b.e franks 2001 , p 355 in the new fighters , pilots could make long , steep dives , aiming the fixed , synchronised machine-gun by aiming the aircraft the machine gun was belt-fed , unlike the drum-fed lewis guns of their opponents , who had to change drums when in action the fokker pilots took to flying high and diving on their quarry , usually out of the sun , firing a long burst and continuing the dive until well out of range if the british aircraft had not been shot down , the german pilot could climb again and repeat the process 150 the mystique acquired by the fokker was greater than its material effect and in october , rfc hq expressed concern at the willingness of pilots to avoid combat rfc losses were exacerbated by the increase in the number of aircraft at the front , from 85 to 161 between march and september , the hard winter of 1915â€“1916 and some aggressive flying by the new german '' c '' type two-seaters thirteen aeroplanes had been shot down by immelmann or boelcke and the rest by seven other fokker pilots most of the victories had been scored by aces rather than the newer pilots flying the greater number of fokkers if contact with the escorts was lost , the reconnaissance must be cancelled , as would photographic reconnaissance to any great distance beyond the front line sending the b.e.2c into action without an observer armed with a lewis gun also became less prevalent the new tactic of concentrating aircraft in time and space had the effect of reducing the number of reconnaissance sorties the rfc could fly none of the german pilots attacked and all the british aircraft returned , only to meet two german aircraft coming back from a bombing raid , which opened fire and mortally wounded the pilot of one the escorts this policy , for various reasons , prevailed for most of the war ; the rarity of german fighters appearing behind the allied lines limited the degree of air superiority they were able to attain this aircraft had a modest performance but its superior manoeuvrability gave it an advantage over the , especially once a clamp , fixing the lewis gun pointing straight ahead , was installed the effect of the new allied types , especially the nieuport , was of considerable concern to the fokker pilots ; some even took to flying captured examples their supposed object was the replacement of the b.e.2c with better aircraft but it took the form of an attack on the rfc command and the royal aircraft factory the period of allied air superiority that followed the fokker scourge was brief ; by mid-september 1916 , the first twin-spandau armed albatros d.i fighters were coming into service german aircraft of the first world war the war in the air , being the story of the part played in the great war by the royal air force , ( volume ii )

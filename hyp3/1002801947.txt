this type of structure is still in use in many lightweight aircraft using welded steel tube trusses a box truss fuselage structure can also be built out of woodâ€”often covered with plywood geodesic structural elements were used by barnes wallis for british vickers between the wars and into world war ii to form the whole of the fuselage , including its aerodynamic shape in this method , the exterior surface of the fuselage is also the primary structure an example of a larger molded plywood aircraft is the de havilland mosquito fighter/light bomber of world war ii the use of molded composites for fuselage structures is being extended to large passenger aircraft such as the boeing 787 dreamliner ( using pressure-molding on female molds ) most modern large aircraft are built using this technique , but use several large sections constructed in this fashion which are then joined with fasteners to form the complete fuselage early examples of this type include the douglas aircraft dc-2 and dc-3 civil aircraft and the boeing b-17 flying fortress '' flying wing '' aircraft , such as the northrop yb-49 and the b-2 spirit have no separate fuselage ; instead what would be the fuselage is a thickened portion of the wing structure conversely , there have been a small number of aircraft designs which have no separate wing , but use the fuselage to generate lift one of the earliest aircraft using this design approach is burnelli cby-3 , which fuselage was airfoil shaped to produce lift

this type of structure is still in use in many lightweight aircraft using welded steel tube trusses a box truss fuselage structure can also be built out of woodâ€”often covered with plywood geodesic structural elements were used by barnes wallis for british vickers between the wars and into world war ii to form the whole of the fuselage , including its aerodynamic shape in this method , the exterior surface of the fuselage is also the primary structure a simple form of this used in some amateur-built aircraft uses rigid expanded foam plastic as the core , with a fiberglass covering , eliminating the necessity of fabricating molds , but requiring more effort in finishing ( see the rutan varieze ) the use of molded composites for fuselage structures is being extended to large passenger aircraft such as the boeing 787 dreamliner ( using pressure-molding on female molds ) first , a series of frames in the shape of the fuselage cross sections are held in position on a rigid fixture most modern large aircraft are built using this technique , but use several large sections constructed in this fashion which are then joined with fasteners to form the complete fuselage some modern aircraft are constructed with composite materials for major control surfaces , wings , or the entire fuselage such as the boeing 787 '' flying wing '' aircraft , such as the northrop yb-49 and the b-2 spirit have no separate fuselage ; instead what would be the fuselage is a thickened portion of the wing structure one of the earliest aircraft using this design approach is burnelli cby-3 , which fuselage was airfoil shaped to produce lift

this type of structure is still in use in many lightweight aircraft using welded steel tube trusses a box truss fuselage structure can also be built out of woodâ€”often covered with plywood geodesic structural elements were used by barnes wallis for british vickers between the wars and into world war ii to form the whole of the fuselage , including its aerodynamic shape in this method , the exterior surface of the fuselage is also the primary structure no plywood-skin fuselage is truly monocoque , since stiffening elements are incorporated into the structure to carry concentrated loads that would otherwise buckle the thin skin the use of molded composites for fuselage structures is being extended to large passenger aircraft such as the boeing 787 dreamliner ( using pressure-molding on female molds ) first , a series of frames in the shape of the fuselage cross sections are held in position on a rigid fixture some modern aircraft are constructed with composite materials for major control surfaces , wings , or the entire fuselage such as the boeing 787 '' flying wing '' aircraft , such as the northrop yb-49 and the b-2 spirit have no separate fuselage ; instead what would be the fuselage is a thickened portion of the wing structure conversely , there have been a small number of aircraft designs which have no separate wing , but use the fuselage to generate lift one of the earliest aircraft using this design approach is burnelli cby-3 , which fuselage was airfoil shaped to produce lift

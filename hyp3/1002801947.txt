a box truss fuselage structure can also be built out of woodâ€”often covered with plywood a fabric covering over the structure completed the aerodynamic shell ( see the vickers wellington for an example of a large warplane which uses this process ) a simple form of this used in some amateur-built aircraft uses rigid expanded foam plastic as the core , with a fiberglass covering , eliminating the necessity of fabricating molds , but requiring more effort in finishing ( see the rutan varieze ) an example of a larger molded plywood aircraft is the de havilland mosquito fighter/light bomber of world war ii the use of molded composites for fuselage structures is being extended to large passenger aircraft such as the boeing 787 dreamliner ( using pressure-molding on female molds ) the fixture is then disassembled and removed from the completed fuselage shell , which is then fitted out with wiring , controls , and interior equipment such as seats and luggage bins most modern large aircraft are built using this technique , but use several large sections constructed in this fashion which are then joined with fasteners to form the complete fuselage as the accuracy of the final product is determined largely by the costly fixture , this form is suitable for series production , where many identical aircraft are to be produced some modern aircraft are constructed with composite materials for major control surfaces , wings , or the entire fuselage such as the boeing 787 '' flying wing '' aircraft , such as the northrop yb-49 and the b-2 spirit have no separate fuselage ; instead what would be the fuselage is a thickened portion of the wing structure conversely , there have been a small number of aircraft designs which have no separate wing , but use the fuselage to generate lift

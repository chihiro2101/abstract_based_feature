historians have argued that in general the late 17th century highlands were more peaceful than often suggested , in part because chiefs could be fined for crimes committed by their clansmen four lochaber clans were consistently named in such accounts ; the glencoe and keppoch macdonalds , the macgregors and the camerons levies from all four clans served in the independent companies used to suppress the conventicles in 1678â€“80 , and took part in the devastating atholl raid that followed argyll 's rising in 1685 in march 1689 , james landed in ireland while john graham , 1st viscount dundee recruited a small force for a supporting campaign in scotland , which included the camerons and keppoch macdonalds in addition , links between irish and scottish branches of the macdonalds , as well as scots and irish presbyterians , meant unrest in one country often spilled into the other after the battle of killiecrankie , the scottish government held a series of meetings with the jacobite chiefs , offering terms that varied based on events in ireland and scotland two days later , secret articles appeared , cancelling the agreement in the event of a jacobite invasion and signed by all the attendees , including breadalbane , who claimed they had been manufactured by glengarry , the macdonald chief as a result , maciain of glencoe only left for fort william on 30 december to take the oath from the governor , lieutenant colonel john hill sir colin administered the oath on 6 january , after which maciain returned home their commander was robert campbell of glenlyon , a local landowner whose niece was married to one of maciain 's sons on 12 february , hill ordered hamilton to take 400 men and block the northern exits from glencoe at kinlochleven meanwhile , another 400 men under major duncanson would join glenlyon 's detachment and sweep northwards up the glen , killing anyone they found , removing property and burning houses on the evening of 12 february , glenlyon received written orders from duncanson carried by another argyll officer , captain thomas drummond ; their tone shows doubts as to his ability or willingness to carry them out as captain of the argylls ' grenadier company , drummond was senior to glenlyon ; his presence appears to have been to ensure the orders were enforced , since witnesses gave evidence he shot two people who asked glenlyon for mercy duncanson was two hours late , only joining glenlyon at the southern end at 7:00 am , after which they advanced up the glen burning houses and removing livestock ' this differs from their testimony to the commission and is unlikely , since they arrived hours after the killings , which were carried out at the opposite end of the glen glenlyon died in bruges in august 1696 , duncanson was killed in spain in may 1705 , drummond survived to take part in another famous scottish disaster of the period , the darien scheme the commission therefore focused on whether participants exceeded their orders , not their legality ; it concluded stair and hamilton had a case to answer but left the decision to william glencoe became part of a focus on 'the emotional trappings of the scottish past.bonnie scotland of the bens and glens and misty shieling , the jacobites , mary , queen of scots , tartan mania and the raising of historical statuary martin , cites the glencoe massacre as one of two historical influences on the infamous '' red wedding '' in his 2000 book a storm of swords

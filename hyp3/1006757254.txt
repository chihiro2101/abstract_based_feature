historians have argued that in general the late 17th century highlands were more peaceful than often suggested , in part because chiefs could be fined for crimes committed by their clansmen four lochaber clans were consistently named in such accounts ; the glencoe and keppoch macdonalds , the macgregors and the camerons primarily directed against areas in cowal and kintyre settled by lowland migrants , it destabilised large parts of the central and southern highlands , and the government of james vii and ii had to use military force to restore order in march 1689 , james landed in ireland while john graham , 1st viscount dundee recruited a small force for a supporting campaign in scotland , which included the camerons and keppoch macdonalds however , a continuing low level scottish insurgency used resources william needed for the nine years ' war in addition , links between irish and scottish branches of the macdonalds , as well as scots and irish presbyterians , meant unrest in one country often spilled into the other after the battle of killiecrankie , the scottish government held a series of meetings with the jacobite chiefs , offering terms that varied based on events in ireland and scotland in march 1690 , the secretary of state , lord stair , offered a total of £12,000 for swearing allegiance to william they agreed to do so in the june 1691 declaration of achallader , the earl of breadalbane signing for the government ; in july , the battle of aughrim ended the war in ireland and immediate prospects of a restoration one suggestion for the delay was an internal power struggle between protestant elements of the macdonald clan , like glencoe , and the catholic minority , led by glengarry as a result , maciain of glencoe only left for fort william on 30 december to take the oath from the governor , lieutenant colonel john hill stair 's letter of 2 december to breadalbane shows the intention of making an example was taken well before the deadline for the oath but as a much bigger operation ; in january , he wrote three letters in quick succession to sir thomas livingstone , military commander in scotland ; on 7th , the intention was to this suggests the episcopalian glencoe macdonalds only replaced the catholic glengarry as the target on 11 january ; maciain 's son john macdonald told the 1695 commission the soldiers came to glencoe from the north '.glengarry 's house being reduced in summary , the glencoe macdonalds were a small clan with few friends and powerful enemies the glencoe macdonalds themselves were similarly billeted on the campbells when serving with the highland levies used to police argyll in 1678 as both a capital offence and treason , it was an awkward weapon with which to attack stair , as william himself signed the orders and the intent was widely known in government circles he sought to exonerate william from every charge made by leslie , including the massacre , which he claimed was part of a campbell–macdonald clan feud glencoe was a popular topic with 19th-century poets , the best-known work being sir walter scott 's '' massacre of glencoe '' martin , cites the glencoe massacre as one of two historical influences on the infamous '' red wedding '' in his 2000 book a storm of swords

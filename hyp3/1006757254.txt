historians have argued that in general the late 17th century highlands were more peaceful than often suggested , in part because chiefs could be fined for crimes committed by their clansmen four lochaber clans were consistently named in such accounts ; the glencoe and keppoch macdonalds , the macgregors and the camerons levies from all four clans served in the independent companies used to suppress the conventicles in 1678–80 , and took part in the devastating atholl raid that followed argyll 's rising in 1685 in march 1689 , james landed in ireland while john graham , 1st viscount dundee recruited a small force for a supporting campaign in scotland , which included the camerons and keppoch macdonalds despite his victory at the battle of killiecrankie on 27 july , dundee was killed along with 600 highlanders ; the survivors spent the winter in lochaber , before organised jacobite resistance ended with defeat at cromdale in may 1690 however , a continuing low level scottish insurgency used resources william needed for the nine years ' war after the battle of killiecrankie , the scottish government held a series of meetings with the jacobite chiefs , offering terms that varied based on events in ireland and scotland in march 1690 , the secretary of state , lord stair , offered a total of £12,000 for swearing allegiance to william one suggestion for the delay was an internal power struggle between protestant elements of the macdonald clan , like glencoe , and the catholic minority , led by glengarry as a result , maciain of glencoe only left for fort william on 30 december to take the oath from the governor , lieutenant colonel john hill sir colin administered the oath on 6 january , after which maciain returned home glengarry did not swear until 4 february , with others doing so by proxy , but only maciain was excluded from the indemnity issued by the scottish privy council this suggests the episcopalian glencoe macdonalds only replaced the catholic glengarry as the target on 11 january ; maciain 's son john macdonald told the 1695 commission the soldiers came to glencoe from the north '.glengarry 's house being reduced in summary , the glencoe macdonalds were a small clan with few friends and powerful enemies their commander was robert campbell of glenlyon , a local landowner whose niece was married to one of maciain 's sons the glencoe macdonalds themselves were similarly billeted on the campbells when serving with the highland levies used to police argyll in 1678 on the evening of 12 february , glenlyon received written orders from duncanson carried by another argyll officer , captain thomas drummond ; their tone shows doubts as to his ability or willingness to carry them out he sought to exonerate william from every charge made by leslie , including the massacre , which he claimed was part of a campbell–macdonald clan feud glencoe was a popular topic with 19th-century poets , the best-known work being sir walter scott 's '' massacre of glencoe '' martin , cites the glencoe massacre as one of two historical influences on the infamous '' red wedding '' in his 2000 book a storm of swords

in 1836 , michael faraday observed that the excess charge on a charged conductor resided only on its exterior and had no influence on anything enclosed within it although this cage effect has been attributed to faraday 's ice pail experiment performed in 1843 , it was benjamin franklin in 1755 who observed the effect by lowering an uncharged cork ball suspended on a silk thread through an opening in an electrically charged metal can '' franklin had discovered the behavior of what we now refer to as a faraday cage or shield ( based on faraday 's later experiments which duplicated franklin 's cork and can ) image : faraday cage.gif right thumb 300px animation showing how a faraday cage ( box ) works if a charge is placed inside an ungrounded faraday shield without touching the walls ( let 's denote this charge quantity as +q ) , the internal face of the shield becomes charged with -q , leading to field lines originating at the charge and extending to charges inside the inner surface of the metal so for all intents and purposes , the faraday shield generates the same static electric field on the outside that it would generate if the metal were simply charged with +q if the cage is grounded , the excess charges will be neutralized as the ground connection creates an equipotential bonding between the outside of the cage and the environment , so there is no voltage between them and therefore also no field thumb effectiveness of shielding of a static electric field is largely independent of the geometry of the conductive material ; however , static magnetic fields can penetrate the shield completely elevators and other rooms with metallic conducting frames and walls simulate a faraday cage effect , leading to a loss of signal and '' dead zones '' for users of cellular phones , radios , and other electronic devices that require external electromagnetic signals the scan room of a magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) machine is designed as a faraday cage a microwave oven utilizes a faraday cage , which can be partly seen covering the transparent window , to contain the electromagnetic energy within the oven and to shield the exterior from radiation faraday cage protects from 100,000 v : : physikshow uni bonn notes from physics lecture on faraday cages from michigan state university michael faraday : the invention of faraday cage background and related experiment top gear 's richard hammond is protected from 600,000 v by a car ( a faraday cage )

in 1836 , michael faraday observed that the excess charge on a charged conductor resided only on its exterior and had no influence on anything enclosed within it '' franklin had discovered the behavior of what we now refer to as a faraday cage or shield ( based on faraday 's later experiments which duplicated franklin 's cork and can ) image : faraday cage.gif right thumb 300px animation showing how a faraday cage ( box ) works these induced charges create an opposing electric field that cancels the external electric field throughout the box a continuous faraday shield is a hollow conductor see faraday 's ice pail experiment , for example , for more details on electric field lines and the decoupling of the outside from the inside thumb effectiveness of shielding of a static electric field is largely independent of the geometry of the conductive material ; however , static magnetic fields can penetrate the shield completely in this case the shielding also depends on the electrical conductivity , the magnetic properties of the conductive materials used in the cages , as well as their thicknesses faraday cages are faraday shields which have holes in them and are therefore more complex to analyze automobile and airplane passenger compartments are essentially faraday cages , protecting passengers from electric charges , such as lightning electronic components in automobiles and aircraft utilize faraday cages to protect signals from interference properly designed conductive clothing can also form a protective faraday cage a microwave oven utilizes a faraday cage , which can be partly seen covering the transparent window , to contain the electromagnetic energy within the oven and to shield the exterior from radiation

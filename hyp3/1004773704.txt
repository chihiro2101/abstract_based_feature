in 1836 , michael faraday observed that the excess charge on a charged conductor resided only on its exterior and had no influence on anything enclosed within it although this cage effect has been attributed to faraday 's ice pail experiment performed in 1843 , it was benjamin franklin in 1755 who observed the effect by lowering an uncharged cork ball suspended on a silk thread through an opening in an electrically charged metal can '' franklin had discovered the behavior of what we now refer to as a faraday cage or shield ( based on faraday 's later experiments which duplicated franklin 's cork and can ) krauss , electromagnetics , 4ed , mcgraw-hill , 1992 , additionally , in 1754 the abbe nollet published an early account of an effect attributable to the cage effect in his leçons de physique expérimentale image : faraday cage.gif right thumb 300px animation showing how a faraday cage ( box ) works externally or internally applied electromagnetic fields produce forces on the charge carriers ( usually electrons ) within the conductor ; the charges are redistributed accordingly due to electrostatic induction if a charge is placed inside an ungrounded faraday shield without touching the walls ( let 's denote this charge quantity as +q ) , the internal face of the shield becomes charged with -q , leading to field lines originating at the charge and extending to charges inside the inner surface of the metal so for all intents and purposes , the faraday shield generates the same static electric field on the outside that it would generate if the metal were simply charged with +q see faraday 's ice pail experiment , for example , for more details on electric field lines and the decoupling of the outside from the inside automobile and airplane passenger compartments are essentially faraday cages , protecting passengers from electric charges , such as lightning electronic components in automobiles and aircraft utilize faraday cages to protect signals from interference a microwave oven utilizes a faraday cage , which can be partly seen covering the transparent window , to contain the electromagnetic energy within the oven and to shield the exterior from radiation faraday cage protects from 100,000 v : : physikshow uni bonn notes from physics lecture on faraday cages from michigan state university michael faraday : the invention of faraday cage background and related experiment top gear 's richard hammond is protected from 600,000 v by a car ( a faraday cage )

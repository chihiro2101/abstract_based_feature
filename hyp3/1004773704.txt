in 1836 , michael faraday observed that the excess charge on a charged conductor resided only on its exterior and had no influence on anything enclosed within it although this cage effect has been attributed to faraday 's ice pail experiment performed in 1843 , it was benjamin franklin in 1755 who observed the effect by lowering an uncharged cork ball suspended on a silk thread through an opening in an electrically charged metal can in his words , '' the cork was not attracted to the inside of the can as it would have been to the outside , and though it touched the bottom , yet when drawn out it was not found to be electrified ( charged ) by that touch , as it would have been by touching the outside '' franklin had discovered the behavior of what we now refer to as a faraday cage or shield ( based on faraday 's later experiments which duplicated franklin 's cork and can ) image : faraday cage.gif right thumb 300px animation showing how a faraday cage ( box ) works so for all intents and purposes , the faraday shield generates the same static electric field on the outside that it would generate if the metal were simply charged with +q see faraday 's ice pail experiment , for example , for more details on electric field lines and the decoupling of the outside from the inside because a faraday shield has finite thickness , this determines how well the shield works ; a thicker shield can attenuate electromagnetic fields better , and to a lower frequency automobile and airplane passenger compartments are essentially faraday cages , protecting passengers from electric charges , such as lightning electronic components in automobiles and aircraft utilize faraday cages to protect signals from interference elevators and other rooms with metallic conducting frames and walls simulate a faraday cage effect , leading to a loss of signal and '' dead zones '' for users of cellular phones , radios , and other electronic devices that require external electromagnetic signals a microwave oven utilizes a faraday cage , which can be partly seen covering the transparent window , to contain the electromagnetic energy within the oven and to shield the exterior from radiation faraday cage protects from 100,000 v : : physikshow uni bonn notes from physics lecture on faraday cages from michigan state university michael faraday : the invention of faraday cage background and related experiment top gear 's richard hammond is protected from 600,000 v by a car ( a faraday cage )

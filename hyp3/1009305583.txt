later made from petroleum , kerosene became a popular lighting fuel modern and most popular versions of the kerosene lamp were later constructed by poles inventor and pharmacist ignacy Å‚ukasiewicz , in lviv in 1853 a flat-wick lamp is a simple type of kerosene lamp , which burns kerosene drawn up through a wick by capillary action a flat-wick lamp has a fuel tank ( fount ) , with the lamp burner attached if the wick is too high , and extends beyond the burner cone at the top of the wick tube , the lamp will produce smoke and soot ( unburned carbon ) as the kerosene burns , capillary action in the wick draws more kerosene up from the fuel tank a central-draught lamp , or argand lamp , works in the same manner as the flat-wick lamp the tubular wick is then mounted into a '' carrier '' , which is some form of a toothed rack that engages into the gears of the wick-raising mechanism of the burner and allows the wick to be raised and lowered the wick rides in between the inner and outer wick tubes ; the inner wick tube ( central draft tube ) provides the '' central draft '' or draft that supplies air to the flame spreader when the lamp is lit , the central draft tube supplies air to the flame spreader that spreads out the flame into a ring of fire and allows the lamp to burn cleanly mantle lamps are considerably brighter than flat- or round-wick lamps , produce a whiter light and generate more heat mantle lamps typically use fuel faster than a flat-wick lamp , but slower than a center-draught round-wick , as they depend on a small flame heating a mantle , rather than having all the light coming from the flame itself large fixed pressurized kerosene mantle lamps were used in lighthouse beacons for navigation of ships , brighter and with lower fuel consumption than oil lamps used before a kerosene lamp producing 37 lumens for 4 hours per day consumes about of kerosene per month

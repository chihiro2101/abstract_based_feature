later made from petroleum , kerosene became a popular lighting fuel a flat-wick lamp is a simple type of kerosene lamp , which burns kerosene drawn up through a wick by capillary action a flat-wick lamp has a fuel tank ( fount ) , with the lamp burner attached the glass chimney needs a '' throat '' , or slight constriction , to create the proper draft for complete combustion of the fuel ; the draft carries more air ( oxygen ) past the flame , helping to produce a smokeless light , which is brighter than an open flame would produce the lamp burner has a flat wick , usually made of cotton the wick tube surrounds the wick and ensures that the correct amount of air reaches the lamp burner adjustment is usually done by means of a small knob operating a cric , which is a toothed metal sprocket bearing against the wick all kerosene flat-wick lamps use the dead-flame burner design , where the flame is fed cold air from below , and hot air exits above this type of lamp was very widely used by railways , both on the front and rear of trains and for hand signals , due to its reliability when the lamp is lit , the central draft tube supplies air to the flame spreader that spreads out the flame into a ring of fire and allows the lamp to burn cleanly mantle lamps are considerably brighter than flat- or round-wick lamps , produce a whiter light and generate more heat mantle lamps are nearly always bright enough to benefit from a lampshade , and a few mantle lamps may be enough to heat a small building in cold weather a kerosene lantern , also known as a '' barn lantern '' or '' hurricane lantern '' , is a flat-wick lamp made for portable and outdoor use kerosene lamps are still extensively used in areas without electrical lighting ; the cost and dangers of combustion lighting are a continuing concern in many countries

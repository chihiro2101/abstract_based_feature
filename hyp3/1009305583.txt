modern and most popular versions of the kerosene lamp were later constructed by poles inventor and pharmacist ignacy Å‚ukasiewicz , in lviv in 1853 a flat-wick lamp is a simple type of kerosene lamp , which burns kerosene drawn up through a wick by capillary action a flat-wick lamp has a fuel tank ( fount ) , with the lamp burner attached attached to the fuel tank , four prongs hold the glass chimney , which acts to prevent the flame from being blown out and enhances a thermally induced draft when the lantern is lit and a chimney is attached , the thermally induced draft draws air thru these holes and passes over the top of the mantle , just as a chimney in your house the lower part of the wick dips into the fount and absorbs the kerosene ; the top part of the wick extends out of the wick tube of the lamp burner , which includes a wick-adjustment mechanism adjusting how much of the wick extends above the wick tube controls the flame the wick tube surrounds the wick and ensures that the correct amount of air reaches the lamp burner if the wick is too high , and extends beyond the burner cone at the top of the wick tube , the lamp will produce smoke and soot ( unburned carbon ) when the lamp is lit , the kerosene that the wick has absorbed burns and produces a clear , bright , yellow flame all kerosene flat-wick lamps use the dead-flame burner design , where the flame is fed cold air from below , and hot air exits above the wick rides in between the inner and outer wick tubes ; the inner wick tube ( central draft tube ) provides the '' central draft '' or draft that supplies air to the flame spreader when the lamp is lit , the central draft tube supplies air to the flame spreader that spreads out the flame into a ring of fire and allows the lamp to burn cleanly the primary benefit of this design compared to the earlier '' hot-blast '' design was to maximize the amount of oxygen available for combustion by ensuring that only fresh air is supplied to the burner , thereby increasing the brightness and stability of the flame

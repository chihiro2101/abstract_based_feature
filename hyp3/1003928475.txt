the starter must be fed 4 to 12 hours prior to being added to dough , by mixing flour and water to the starter the starter weight is usually 13 % to 25 % of the total flour weight , though formulas may vary a number of 'no knead ' methods are available for sourdough bread due to the length of time sourdough bread takes to proof , many bakers may refrigerate their loaves prior to baking because the rise time of most sourdough starters is longer than that of breads made with baker 's yeasts , sourdough starters are generally unsuitable for use in a bread machine however , sourdough that has been proved over many hours , using a sourdough starter or mother dough , can then be transferred to the machine , utilizing only the baking segment of the bread-making program , bypassing timed mechanical kneading by the machine 's paddle this may be convenient for single loaf production , but the complex blistered and slashed crust characteristics of oven-baked sourdough bread can not be achieved in a bread making machine , as this usually requires the use of a baking stone in the oven and misting of the dough to produce steam sourdough is a stable culture of lactic acid bacteria and yeast in a mixture of flour and water broadly speaking , the yeast produces gas ( carbon dioxide ) which leavens the dough , and the lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid , which contributes flavor in the form of sourness the lactic acid bacteria metabolize sugars that the yeast can not , while the yeast metabolizes the by-products of lactic acid fermentation during sourdough fermentation , many cereal enzymes , particularly phytases , proteases and pentosanases , are activated through acidification and contribute to biochemical changes during sourdough fermentation lactic acid bacteria are anaerobic organism , which means that though they are anaerobes , they can multiply in the presence of oxygen traditional sourdoughs used as sole leavening agent are referred to as type i sourdough , examples include sourdoughs used for san francisco sourdough bread , panettone , and rye bread lactobacillus sanfranciscensis was named for its discovery in san francisco sourdough starters , though it is not endemic to san francisco the yeasts saccharomyces exiguus , kasachstania humilis , or candida holmii usually populate sourdough cultures symbiotically with lactobacillus sanfranciscensis in type ii sourdoughs , baker 's yeast or saccharomyces cerevisiae is added to leaven the dough ; l there are many breads that use techniques similar to that used in the making of sourdough bread list of sourdough breads biga herman cake history of california bread kyselo , czech soup made from sourdough

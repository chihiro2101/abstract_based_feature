the starter must be fed 4 to 12 hours prior to being added to dough , by mixing flour and water to the starter this creates an active leaven , which should grow in size and is ready to use when it is bubbly and floats in water the leaven is mixed with flour and water to make a final dough of the desired consistency due to the length of time sourdough bread takes to proof , many bakers may refrigerate their loaves prior to baking this process has the added benefit of developing a richer flavoured bread because the rise time of most sourdough starters is longer than that of breads made with baker 's yeasts , sourdough starters are generally unsuitable for use in a bread machine sourdough is a stable culture of lactic acid bacteria and yeast in a mixture of flour and water the lactic acid bacteria metabolize sugars that the yeast can not , while the yeast metabolizes the by-products of lactic acid fermentation during sourdough fermentation , many cereal enzymes , particularly phytases , proteases and pentosanases , are activated through acidification and contribute to biochemical changes during sourdough fermentation lactic acid bacteria are anaerobic organism , which means that though they are anaerobes , they can multiply in the presence of oxygen the most common yeast species in sourdough are kazachstania exigua , saccharomyces cerevisiae , k traditional sourdoughs used as sole leavening agent are referred to as type i sourdough , examples include sourdoughs used for san francisco sourdough bread , panettone , and rye bread type i sourdoughs are generally firm doughs , have a ph range of 3.8 to 4.5 , and are fermented in a temperature range of the yeasts saccharomyces exiguus , kasachstania humilis , or candida holmii usually populate sourdough cultures symbiotically with lactobacillus sanfranciscensis cerevisiae has less tolerance to acetic acid than other sourdough yeasts there are many breads that use techniques similar to that used in the making of sourdough bread amish friendship bread uses a sourdough starter that includes sugar and milk list of sourdough breads biga herman cake history of california bread kyselo , czech soup made from sourdough

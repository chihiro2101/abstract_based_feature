the starter must be fed 4 to 12 hours prior to being added to dough , by mixing flour and water to the starter the starter weight is usually 13 % to 25 % of the total flour weight , though formulas may vary a number of 'no knead ' methods are available for sourdough bread due to the length of time sourdough bread takes to proof , many bakers may refrigerate their loaves prior to baking because the rise time of most sourdough starters is longer than that of breads made with baker 's yeasts , sourdough starters are generally unsuitable for use in a bread machine however , sourdough that has been proved over many hours , using a sourdough starter or mother dough , can then be transferred to the machine , utilizing only the baking segment of the bread-making program , bypassing timed mechanical kneading by the machine 's paddle sourdough is a stable culture of lactic acid bacteria and yeast in a mixture of flour and water the lactic acid bacteria metabolize sugars that the yeast can not , while the yeast metabolizes the by-products of lactic acid fermentation during sourdough fermentation , many cereal enzymes , particularly phytases , proteases and pentosanases , are activated through acidification and contribute to biochemical changes during sourdough fermentation the most common yeast species in sourdough are kazachstania exigua , saccharomyces cerevisiae , k traditional sourdoughs used as sole leavening agent are referred to as type i sourdough , examples include sourdoughs used for san francisco sourdough bread , panettone , and rye bread type i sourdoughs are generally firm doughs , have a ph range of 3.8 to 4.5 , and are fermented in a temperature range of the yeasts saccharomyces exiguus , kasachstania humilis , or candida holmii usually populate sourdough cultures symbiotically with lactobacillus sanfranciscensis sanfranciscensis has typically not been identified in spontaneous sourdoughs , even after multiple cycles of back-slopping ; it was rapidly introduced in wheat sourdoughs , however , when plant materials were used to start the fermentation cerevisiae has less tolerance to acetic acid than other sourdough yeasts there are many breads that use techniques similar to that used in the making of sourdough bread sourdough bread has a relatively low glycemic index compared with other types of bread list of sourdough breads biga herman cake history of california bread kyselo , czech soup made from sourdough

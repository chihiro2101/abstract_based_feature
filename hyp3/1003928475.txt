the starter must be fed 4 to 12 hours prior to being added to dough , by mixing flour and water to the starter the starter weight is usually 13 % to 25 % of the total flour weight , though formulas may vary a number of 'no knead ' methods are available for sourdough bread due to the length of time sourdough bread takes to proof , many bakers may refrigerate their loaves prior to baking because the rise time of most sourdough starters is longer than that of breads made with baker 's yeasts , sourdough starters are generally unsuitable for use in a bread machine however , sourdough that has been proved over many hours , using a sourdough starter or mother dough , can then be transferred to the machine , utilizing only the baking segment of the bread-making program , bypassing timed mechanical kneading by the machine 's paddle this may be convenient for single loaf production , but the complex blistered and slashed crust characteristics of oven-baked sourdough bread can not be achieved in a bread making machine , as this usually requires the use of a baking stone in the oven and misting of the dough to produce steam sourdough is a stable culture of lactic acid bacteria and yeast in a mixture of flour and water broadly speaking , the yeast produces gas ( carbon dioxide ) which leavens the dough , and the lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid , which contributes flavor in the form of sourness the lactic acid bacteria metabolize sugars that the yeast can not , while the yeast metabolizes the by-products of lactic acid fermentation the most common yeast species in sourdough are kazachstania exigua , saccharomyces cerevisiae , k traditional sourdoughs used as sole leavening agent are referred to as type i sourdough , examples include sourdoughs used for san francisco sourdough bread , panettone , and rye bread wheat dough contains abundant starch and some sinistrines , which enzymes degrade to '' maltose , fructose and little glucose a belgian study of wheat and spelt doughs refreshed once every 24 hours and fermented at in a laboratory environment provides insight into the three-phase evolution of first-generation-to-stable sourdough ecosystems in type ii sourdoughs , yeast growth is slowed or stopped due to higher fermentation temperatures type iii sourdoughs are type ii sourdoughs subjected to a drying process , usually either spray or drum drying , and are mainly used at an industrial level as flavoring agents sourdough bread made from whole grains was recommended as a key daily food in the italian mediterranean diet list of microorganisms found in sourdough salt-rising bread Å¼urek , polish soup made with rye flour soured in the same process that occurs in the forming of sourdough injera

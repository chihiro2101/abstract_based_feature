the iden project originally began as mirs ( motorola integrated radio system ) in early 1991 iden operates on 25 & nbsp ; khz channels , but only occupies 20 & nbsp ; khz in order to provide interference protection via guard bands iden uses frequency-division duplexing to transmit and receive signals separately , with transmit and receive bands separated by 39 & nbsp ; mhz , 45 & nbsp ; mhz , or 48 & nbsp ; mhz depending on the frequency band being used iden supports either three or six interconnect users ( phone users ) per channel , and six dispatch users ( push-to-talk users ) per channel , using time division multiple access the transmit and receive time slots assigned to each user are deliberately offset in time so that a single user never needs to transmit and receive at the same time wideband integrated digital enhanced network , or widen , is a software upgrade developed by motorola and partners for its iden enhanced specialized mobile radio ( or esmr ) wireless telephony protocol iden , the platform which widen upgrades , and the protocol on which it is based , was originally introduced by motorola in 1993 , and launched as a commercial network by nextel in the united states in september 1996 sprint nextel provided iden service across the united states until its iden network was decommissioned for additional lte network capacity on 30 june 2013 southernlinc wireless provided iden service across the united states until its iden network was decommissioned for additional lte network capacity on 1 april 2019

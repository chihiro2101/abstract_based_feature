only a few targeted genes have been identified , however researchers believe that there could be up to hundreds of other genes targeted by the foxp2 gene the foxp2 gene is also involved in synaptic plasticity , making it imperative for learning and memory foxp2 is required for proper brain and lung development knockout mice with only one functional copy of the foxp2 gene have significantly reduced vocalizations as pups knockout mice with no functional copies of foxp2 are runted , display abnormalities in brain regions such as the purkinje layer , and die an average of 21 days after birth from inadequate lung development foxp2 is expressed in many areas of the brain , including the basal ganglia and inferior frontal cortex , where it is essential for brain maturation and speech and language development conversely , in human children aged 4â€“5 , the gene was found to be 30 % more expressed in the broca 's areas of female children the expression of foxp2 is subject to post-transcriptional regulation , particularly microrna ( mirna ) , which binds to multiple mirna binding-sites in the neocortex , causing the repression of the foxp2 3 ' untranslated region three amino acid substitutions distinguish the human foxp2 protein from that found in mice , while two amino acid substitutions distinguish the human foxp2 protein from that found in chimpanzees , but only one of these changes is unique to humans evidence from genetically manipulated mice and human neuronal cell models suggests that these changes affect the neural functions of foxp2 the foxp2 gene has been implicated in several cognitive functions including ; general brain development , language , and synaptic plasticity the foxp2 gene region acts as a transcription factor for the forkhead box p2 protein a missense mutation causing an arginine-to-histidine substitution ( r553h ) in the dna-binding domain is thought to be the abnormality in ke r553h and r328x mutations also affected nuclear localization , dna-binding , and the transactivation ( increased gene expression ) properties of foxp2 while foxp2 has been proposed to play a critical role in the development of speech and language , this view has been challenged by the fact that the gene is also expressed in other mammals as well as birds and fish that do not speak it has also been proposed that the foxp2 transcription-factor is not so much a hypothetical 'language gene ' but rather part of a regulatory machinery related to externalization of speech one of the two amino acid differences between human and chimps also arose independently in carnivores and bats similar foxp2 proteins can be found in songbirds , fish , and reptiles such as alligators dna sampling from homo neanderthalensis bones indicates that their foxp2 gene is a little different though largely similar to those of homo sapiens ( i.e sapiens foxp2 gene became fixed in the population around 125,000 years ago some researchers consider the neanderthal findings to indicate that the gene instead swept through the population over 260,000 years ago , before our most recent common ancestor with the neanderthals the human allele of the foxp2 gene was transferred into the mouse embryos through homologous recombination to create humanized foxp2 mice foxp2 was also found in the medial geniculate nucleus of the mouse brain , which is the processing area that auditory inputs must go through in the thalamus it was found that its mutations play a role in delaying the development of language learning the zebrafish foxp2 gene has an 85 % similarity to the human fox2p ortholog around this time , the researchers identified an individual who was unrelated to the ke family but had a similar type of speech and language disorder when the researchers sequenced the foxp2 gene in the ke family , they found a heterozygous point mutation shared by all the affected individuals , but not in unaffected members of the family and other people

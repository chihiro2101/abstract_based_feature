as a fox protein , foxp2 contains a forkhead-box domain only a few targeted genes have been identified , however researchers believe that there could be up to hundreds of other genes targeted by the foxp2 gene the foxp2 gene is also involved in synaptic plasticity , making it imperative for learning and memory foxp2 is required for proper brain and lung development knockout mice with only one functional copy of the foxp2 gene have significantly reduced vocalizations as pups knockout mice with no functional copies of foxp2 are runted , display abnormalities in brain regions such as the purkinje layer , and die an average of 21 days after birth from inadequate lung development foxp2 is expressed in many areas of the brain , including the basal ganglia and inferior frontal cortex , where it is essential for brain maturation and speech and language development three amino acid substitutions distinguish the human foxp2 protein from that found in mice , while two amino acid substitutions distinguish the human foxp2 protein from that found in chimpanzees , but only one of these changes is unique to humans the foxp2 gene has been implicated in several cognitive functions including ; general brain development , language , and synaptic plasticity the foxp2 gene region acts as a transcription factor for the forkhead box p2 protein specifically , foxp2 has been investigated in correlation with autism and dyslexia , however with no mutation was discovered as the cause there is some evidence that the linguistic impairments associated with a mutation of the foxp2 gene are not simply the result of a fundamental deficit in motor control a heterozygous nonsense mutation , r328x variant , produces a truncated protein involved in speech and language difficulties in one ke individual and two of their close family members r553h and r328x mutations also affected nuclear localization , dna-binding , and the transactivation ( increased gene expression ) properties of foxp2 this is one of the primary reasons that foxp2 is known as a language gene these findings suggest that the effects of foxp2 are not limited to motor control , as they include comprehension among other cognitive language functions thumb right upright 1.25 the foxp2 gene is highly conserved in mammals see also previous genetic analysis had suggested that the h sapiens foxp2 gene became fixed in the population around 125,000 years ago according to a 2002 study , the foxp2 gene showed indications of recent positive selection some researchers have speculated that positive selection is crucial for the evolution of language in humans others , however , were unable to find a clear association between species with learned vocalizations and similar mutations in foxp2 foxp2 also downregulates the sushi repeat-containing protein x-linked 2 ( srpx2 ) the human allele of the foxp2 gene was transferred into the mouse embryos through homologous recombination to create humanized foxp2 mice in zebrafish , foxp2 is expressed in the ventral and dorsal thalamus , telencephalon , diencephalon where it likely plays a role in nervous system development the zebrafish foxp2 gene has an 85 % similarity to the human fox2p ortholog when the researchers sequenced the foxp2 gene in the ke family , they found a heterozygous point mutation shared by all the affected individuals , but not in unaffected members of the family and other people

the foxp2 gene is also involved in synaptic plasticity , making it imperative for learning and memory knockout mice with only one functional copy of the foxp2 gene have significantly reduced vocalizations as pups knockout mice with no functional copies of foxp2 are runted , display abnormalities in brain regions such as the purkinje layer , and die an average of 21 days after birth from inadequate lung development foxp2 is expressed in many areas of the brain , including the basal ganglia and inferior frontal cortex , where it is essential for brain maturation and speech and language development conversely , in human children aged 4â€“5 , the gene was found to be 30 % more expressed in the broca 's areas of female children three amino acid substitutions distinguish the human foxp2 protein from that found in mice , while two amino acid substitutions distinguish the human foxp2 protein from that found in chimpanzees , but only one of these changes is unique to humans the foxp2 gene has been implicated in several cognitive functions including ; general brain development , language , and synaptic plasticity the foxp2 gene region acts as a transcription factor for the forkhead box p2 protein transcription factors affect other regions , and the forkhead box p2 protein has been suggested to also act as a transcription factor for hundreds of genes there is some evidence that the linguistic impairments associated with a mutation of the foxp2 gene are not simply the result of a fundamental deficit in motor control a heterozygous nonsense mutation , r328x variant , produces a truncated protein involved in speech and language difficulties in one ke individual and two of their close family members this is one of the primary reasons that foxp2 is known as a language gene they have delayed onset of speech , difficulty with articulation including , slurred speech , stuttering , and poor pronunciation , as well as dyspraxia these findings suggest that the effects of foxp2 are not limited to motor control , as they include comprehension among other cognitive language functions general mild motor and cognitive deficits are noted across the board image : browserfoxp2.jpg human foxp2 gene and evolutionary conservation is shown in a multiple alignment ( at bottom of figure ) in this image from the ucsc genome browser thumb right upright 1.25 the foxp2 gene is highly conserved in mammals in mice it differs from that of humans by three substitutions , and in zebra finch by seven amino acids one of the two amino acid differences between human and chimps also arose independently in carnivores and bats similar foxp2 proteins can be found in songbirds , fish , and reptiles such as alligators dna sampling from homo neanderthalensis bones indicates that their foxp2 gene is a little different though largely similar to those of homo sapiens ( i.e sapiens foxp2 gene became fixed in the population around 125,000 years ago according to a 2002 study , the foxp2 gene showed indications of recent positive selection within bats , however , amino acid variation correlated with different echolocating types gene knockdown of foxp2 in area x of the basal ganglia in songbirds results in incomplete and inaccurate song imitation the zebrafish foxp2 gene has an 85 % similarity to the human fox2p ortholog when the researchers sequenced the foxp2 gene in the ke family , they found a heterozygous point mutation shared by all the affected individuals , but not in unaffected members of the family and other people

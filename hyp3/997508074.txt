only a few targeted genes have been identified , however researchers believe that there could be up to hundreds of other genes targeted by the foxp2 gene the foxp2 gene is also involved in synaptic plasticity , making it imperative for learning and memory foxp2 is required for proper brain and lung development knockout mice with only one functional copy of the foxp2 gene have significantly reduced vocalizations as pups knockout mice with no functional copies of foxp2 are runted , display abnormalities in brain regions such as the purkinje layer , and die an average of 21 days after birth from inadequate lung development foxp2 is expressed in many areas of the brain , including the basal ganglia and inferior frontal cortex , where it is essential for brain maturation and speech and language development in mice , the gene was found to be twice as highly expressed in male pups than female pups , which correlated with an almost double increase in the number of vocalisations the male pups made when separated from mothers the expression of foxp2 is subject to post-transcriptional regulation , particularly microrna ( mirna ) , which binds to multiple mirna binding-sites in the neocortex , causing the repression of the foxp2 3 ' untranslated region three amino acid substitutions distinguish the human foxp2 protein from that found in mice , while two amino acid substitutions distinguish the human foxp2 protein from that found in chimpanzees , but only one of these changes is unique to humans the foxp2 gene has been implicated in several cognitive functions including ; general brain development , language , and synaptic plasticity the foxp2 gene region acts as a transcription factor for the forkhead box p2 protein this prolific involvement opens the possibility that the foxp2 gene is much more extensive than originally thought there is some evidence that the linguistic impairments associated with a mutation of the foxp2 gene are not simply the result of a fundamental deficit in motor control a 2020 genome-wide association study ( gwas ) implicates single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) of foxp2 in susceptibility to cannabis use disorder a heterozygous nonsense mutation , r328x variant , produces a truncated protein involved in speech and language difficulties in one ke individual and two of their close family members this is one of the primary reasons that foxp2 is known as a language gene they have delayed onset of speech , difficulty with articulation including , slurred speech , stuttering , and poor pronunciation , as well as dyspraxia these findings suggest that the effects of foxp2 are not limited to motor control , as they include comprehension among other cognitive language functions while foxp2 has been proposed to play a critical role in the development of speech and language , this view has been challenged by the fact that the gene is also expressed in other mammals as well as birds and fish that do not speak image : browserfoxp2.jpg human foxp2 gene and evolutionary conservation is shown in a multiple alignment ( at bottom of figure ) in this image from the ucsc genome browser thumb right upright 1.25 the foxp2 gene is highly conserved in mammals in chimpanzees , foxp2 differs from the human version by two amino acids the negative effects of the mutations of foxp2 in these brain regions on motor abilities were shown in mice through tasks in lab studies when the birds were singing undirected song , there was a decrease of foxp2 expression in area x this downregulation was not observed and foxp2 levels remained stable in birds singing directed song when the researchers sequenced the foxp2 gene in the ke family , they found a heterozygous point mutation shared by all the affected individuals , but not in unaffected members of the family and other people further screening of the gene identified multiple additional cases of foxp2 disruption , including different point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements , providing evidence that damage to one copy of this gene is sufficient to derail speech and language development .

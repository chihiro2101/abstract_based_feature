as a fox protein , foxp2 contains a forkhead-box domain the protein attaches to the dna of other proteins and controls their activity through the forkhead-box domain only a few targeted genes have been identified , however researchers believe that there could be up to hundreds of other genes targeted by the foxp2 gene the forkhead box p2 protein is active in the brain and other tissues before and after birth , many studies show that it is paramount for the growth of nerve cells and transmission between them the foxp2 gene is also involved in synaptic plasticity , making it imperative for learning and memory foxp2 is required for proper brain and lung development knockout mice with only one functional copy of the foxp2 gene have significantly reduced vocalizations as pups foxp2 is expressed in many areas of the brain , including the basal ganglia and inferior frontal cortex , where it is essential for brain maturation and speech and language development the foxp2 gene has been implicated in several cognitive functions including ; general brain development , language , and synaptic plasticity the foxp2 gene region acts as a transcription factor for the forkhead box p2 protein transcription factors affect other regions , and the forkhead box p2 protein has been suggested to also act as a transcription factor for hundreds of genes specifically , foxp2 has been investigated in correlation with autism and dyslexia , however with no mutation was discovered as the cause a 2020 genome-wide association study ( gwas ) implicates single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) of foxp2 in susceptibility to cannabis use disorder they have delayed onset of speech , difficulty with articulation including , slurred speech , stuttering , and poor pronunciation , as well as dyspraxia it is believed that a major part of this speech deficit comes from an inability to coordinate the movements necessary to produce normal speech including mouth and tongue shaping while foxp2 has been proposed to play a critical role in the development of speech and language , this view has been challenged by the fact that the gene is also expressed in other mammals as well as birds and fish that do not speak it has also been proposed that the foxp2 transcription-factor is not so much a hypothetical 'language gene ' but rather part of a regulatory machinery related to externalization of speech in mice it differs from that of humans by three substitutions , and in zebra finch by seven amino acids similar foxp2 proteins can be found in songbirds , fish , and reptiles such as alligators dna sampling from homo neanderthalensis bones indicates that their foxp2 gene is a little different though largely similar to those of homo sapiens ( i.e sapiens foxp2 gene became fixed in the population around 125,000 years ago some researchers consider the neanderthal findings to indicate that the gene instead swept through the population over 260,000 years ago , before our most recent common ancestor with the neanderthals according to a 2002 study , the foxp2 gene showed indications of recent positive selection the human allele of the foxp2 gene was transferred into the mouse embryos through homologous recombination to create humanized foxp2 mice gene knockdown of foxp2 in area x of the basal ganglia in songbirds results in incomplete and inaccurate song imitation when the researchers sequenced the foxp2 gene in the ke family , they found a heterozygous point mutation shared by all the affected individuals , but not in unaffected members of the family and other people further screening of the gene identified multiple additional cases of foxp2 disruption , including different point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements , providing evidence that damage to one copy of this gene is sufficient to derail speech and language development .

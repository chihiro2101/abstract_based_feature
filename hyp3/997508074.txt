as a fox protein , foxp2 contains a forkhead-box domain only a few targeted genes have been identified , however researchers believe that there could be up to hundreds of other genes targeted by the foxp2 gene the foxp2 gene is also involved in synaptic plasticity , making it imperative for learning and memory foxp2 is required for proper brain and lung development knockout mice with only one functional copy of the foxp2 gene have significantly reduced vocalizations as pups knockout mice with no functional copies of foxp2 are runted , display abnormalities in brain regions such as the purkinje layer , and die an average of 21 days after birth from inadequate lung development foxp2 is expressed in many areas of the brain , including the basal ganglia and inferior frontal cortex , where it is essential for brain maturation and speech and language development the expression of foxp2 is subject to post-transcriptional regulation , particularly microrna ( mirna ) , which binds to multiple mirna binding-sites in the neocortex , causing the repression of the foxp2 3 ' untranslated region three amino acid substitutions distinguish the human foxp2 protein from that found in mice , while two amino acid substitutions distinguish the human foxp2 protein from that found in chimpanzees , but only one of these changes is unique to humans evidence from genetically manipulated mice and human neuronal cell models suggests that these changes affect the neural functions of foxp2 the foxp2 gene has been implicated in several cognitive functions including ; general brain development , language , and synaptic plasticity the foxp2 gene region acts as a transcription factor for the forkhead box p2 protein transcription factors affect other regions , and the forkhead box p2 protein has been suggested to also act as a transcription factor for hundreds of genes this prolific involvement opens the possibility that the foxp2 gene is much more extensive than originally thought specifically , foxp2 has been investigated in correlation with autism and dyslexia , however with no mutation was discovered as the cause there is some evidence that the linguistic impairments associated with a mutation of the foxp2 gene are not simply the result of a fundamental deficit in motor control this is one of the primary reasons that foxp2 is known as a language gene while foxp2 has been proposed to play a critical role in the development of speech and language , this view has been challenged by the fact that the gene is also expressed in other mammals as well as birds and fish that do not speak thumb right upright 1.25 the foxp2 gene is highly conserved in mammals in mice it differs from that of humans by three substitutions , and in zebra finch by seven amino acids similar foxp2 proteins can be found in songbirds , fish , and reptiles such as alligators dna sampling from homo neanderthalensis bones indicates that their foxp2 gene is a little different though largely similar to those of homo sapiens ( i.e sapiens foxp2 gene became fixed in the population around 125,000 years ago when foxp2 expression was altered in mice , it affected many different processes including the learning motor skills and the plasticity of synapses the zebrafish foxp2 gene has an 85 % similarity to the human fox2p ortholog around this time , the researchers identified an individual who was unrelated to the ke family but had a similar type of speech and language disorder when the researchers sequenced the foxp2 gene in the ke family , they found a heterozygous point mutation shared by all the affected individuals , but not in unaffected members of the family and other people

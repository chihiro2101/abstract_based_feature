military with the 131-b2 mixer device that encrypted teleprinter signals by xor ’ ing them with key material from one-time tapes ( the sigtot system ) or , earlier , a rotor-based key generator called sigcum later bell informed the signal corps that they were able to detect electromagnetic spikes at a distance from the mixer and recover the plain text meeting skepticism over whether the phenomenon they discovered in the laboratory could really be dangerous , they demonstrated their ability to recover plain text from a signal corps ’ crypto center on varick street in lower manhattan bell identified three problem areas : radiated signals , signals conducted on wires extending from the facility , and magnetic fields instead , relevant commanders were warned of the problem and advised to control a -diameter zone around their communications center to prevent covert interception , and things were left at that acoustical emanations could reveal plain text , but only if the pick-up device was close to the source soundproofing the room made the problem worse by removing reflections and providing a cleaner signal to the recorder however , many users needed the higher signal levels to drive teleprinters at greater distances or where multiple teleprinters were connected , so the newer encryption devices included the option to switch the signal back up to the higher strength nsa began developing techniques and specifications for isolating sensitive-communications pathways through filtering , shielding , grounding , and physical separation : of those lines that carried sensitive plain text – from those intended to carry only non-sensitive data , the latter often extending outside of the secure environment a 1958 joint policy called nag-1 set radiation standards for equipment and installations based on a limit of control communications security board ( uscsb ) produced a flexowriter policy that banned its use overseas for classified information and limited its use within the u.s the resulting directive 5200.19 , coordinated with 22 separate agencies , was signed by secretary of defense robert mcnamara in december 1964 , but still took months to fully implement other units were fully shielded to contain electronic emanations , but were unpopular with the personnel who were supposed to work inside ; they called the enclosures '' meat lockers '' , and sometimes just left their doors open nonetheless , they were installed in critical locations , such as the embassy in moscow , where two were installed : one for state-department use and one for military attachés tempest standards continued to evolve in the 1970s and later , with newer testing methods and more-nuanced guidelines that took account of the risks in specific locations and situations boak lectures , national security agency ( nsa ) , volumes i , 1973 , volumes ii 1981 , partially released 2008 , additional portions declassified october 14 , 2015 but then as now , security needs often met with resistance current united states and nato tempest standards define three levels of protection requirements : nato sdip-27 level a ( formerly amsg 720b ) and usa nstissam level i : '' compromising emanations laboratory test standard '' : this is the strictest standard for devices that will be operated in nato zone 0 environments , where it is assumed that an attacker has almost immediate access ( e.g a declassified nsa specification for shielded enclosures offers similar shielding values , requiring , '' a minimum of 100 db insertion loss from 1 khz to 10 ghz '' since much of the current requirements are still classified , there are no publicly available correlations between this 100 & nbsp ; db shielding requirement and the newer zone-based shielding standards in addition , many separation distance requirements and other elements are provided by the declassified nsa red-black installation guidance , nstissam tempest/2-95 the information-security agencies of several nato countries publish lists of accredited testing labs and of equipment that has passed these tests : in canada : canadian industrial tempest program in germany : bsi german zoned products list in the uk : uk cesg directory of infosec assured products , section 12 in the u.s : nsa tempest certification program the united states army also has a tempest testing facility , as part of the u.s , maintaining distance or installing shielding between circuits and equipment used to handle plaintext classified or sensitive information that is not encrypted ( red ) and secured circuits and equipment ( black ) , the latter including those carrying encrypted signals this paper caused some consternation in the security community , which had previously believed that such monitoring was a highly sophisticated attack available only to governments ; van eck successfully eavesdropped on a real system , at a range of hundreds of metres , using just 15 worth of equipment plus a television set in 2014 , researchers introduced '' airhopper '' , a bifurcated attack pattern showing the feasibility of data exfiltration from an isolated computer to a nearby mobile phone , using fm frequency signals pdf file ) compromising emanations : eavesdropping risks of computer displays tempest and qinetiq : electronic eavesdropping counter-measures soft tempest : hidden data transmission using electromagnetic emanations (

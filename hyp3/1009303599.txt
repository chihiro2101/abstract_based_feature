later bell informed the signal corps that they were able to detect electromagnetic spikes at a distance from the mixer and recover the plain text bell identified three problem areas : radiated signals , signals conducted on wires extending from the facility , and magnetic fields then in 1951 , the cia rediscovered the problem with the 131-b2 mixer and found they could recover plain text off the line carrying the encrypted signal from a quarter-mile away filters for signal and power lines were developed , and the recommended control-perimeter radius was extended to 200 feet , based more on what commanders could be expected to accomplish than any technical criteria the question of exploiting the noise of electromechanical encryption systems had been raised in the late 1940s , but was re-evaluated now as a possible threat acoustical emanations could reveal plain text , but only if the pick-up device was close to the source in 1956 , the naval research laboratory developed a better mixer that operated at much lower voltages and currents and therefore radiated far less a 1958 joint policy called nag-1 set radiation standards for equipment and installations based on a limit of control computerization was becoming important to processing intelligence data , and computers and their peripherals had to be evaluated , wherein many of them evidenced vulnerabilities to the confidential level , and then only within a security zone â€“ but users found the policy onerous and impractical there was a multi-year process of moving from policy recommendations to more strictly enforced tempest rules the resulting directive 5200.19 , coordinated with 22 separate agencies , was signed by secretary of defense robert mcnamara in december 1964 , but still took months to fully implement meanwhile , the problem of acoustic emanations became more critical with the discovery of some 900 microphones in u.s tempest standards continued to evolve in the 1970s and later , with newer testing methods and more-nuanced guidelines that took account of the risks in specific locations and situations boak lectures , national security agency ( nsa ) , volumes i , 1973 , volumes ii 1981 , partially released 2008 , additional portions declassified october 14 , 2015 but then as now , security needs often met with resistance additional standards include : nato sdip-29 ( formerly amsg 719g ) : '' installation of electrical equipment for the processing of classified information '' : this standard defines installation requirements , for example in respect to grounding and cable distances the nsa and department of defense have declassified some tempest elements after freedom of information act requests , but the documents black out many key values and descriptions the declassified version of the tempest test standard is heavily redacted , with emanation limits and test procedures blacked out a redacted version of the introductory tempest handbook nacsim 5000 was publicly released in december 2000 a declassified nsa specification for shielded enclosures offers similar shielding values , requiring , '' a minimum of 100 db insertion loss from 1 khz to 10 ghz : nsa tempest certification program the united states army also has a tempest testing facility , as part of the u.s in 1985 , wim van eck published the first unclassified technical analysis of the security risks of emanations from computer monitors this paper caused some consternation in the security community , which had previously believed that such monitoring was a highly sophisticated attack available only to governments ; van eck successfully eavesdropped on a real system , at a range of hundreds of metres , using just 15 worth of equipment plus a television set in the novel cryptonomicon by neal stephenson , characters use van eck phreaking to likewise read information from a computer monitor in a neighboring room bitwhisper : the heat is on the air-gap how to leak sensitive data from an isolated computer ( air-gap ) to a near by mobile phone - airhopper nsa tempest endorsement program the complete , unofficial tempest information page ( original defunct pdf file ) compromising emanations : eavesdropping risks of computer displays tempest and qinetiq : electronic eavesdropping counter-measures soft tempest : hidden data transmission using electromagnetic emanations (

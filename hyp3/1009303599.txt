during world war ii , bell telephone supplied the u.s later bell informed the signal corps that they were able to detect electromagnetic spikes at a distance from the mixer and recover the plain text bell identified three problem areas : radiated signals , signals conducted on wires extending from the facility , and magnetic fields as possible solutions , they suggested shielding , filtering and masking bell developed a modified mixer , the 131-a1 with shielding and filtering , but it proved difficult to maintain and too expensive to deploy instead , relevant commanders were warned of the problem and advised to control a -diameter zone around their communications center to prevent covert interception , and things were left at that then in 1951 , the cia rediscovered the problem with the 131-b2 mixer and found they could recover plain text off the line carrying the encrypted signal from a quarter-mile away filters for signal and power lines were developed , and the recommended control-perimeter radius was extended to 200 feet , based more on what commanders could be expected to accomplish than any technical criteria a long process of evaluating systems and developing possible solutions followed the question of exploiting the noise of electromechanical encryption systems had been raised in the late 1940s , but was re-evaluated now as a possible threat soundproofing the room made the problem worse by removing reflections and providing a cleaner signal to the recorder a 1958 joint policy called nag-1 set radiation standards for equipment and installations based on a limit of control it also specified the classification levels of various aspects of the tempest problem communications security board ( uscsb ) produced a flexowriter policy that banned its use overseas for classified information and limited its use within the u.s later , the nsa found similar problems with the introduction of cathode-ray-tube displays ( crts ) , which were also powerful radiators there was a multi-year process of moving from policy recommendations to more strictly enforced tempest rules tempest standards continued to evolve in the 1970s and later , with newer testing methods and more-nuanced guidelines that took account of the risks in specific locations and situations boak lectures , national security agency ( nsa ) , volumes i , 1973 , volumes ii 1981 , partially released 2008 , additional portions declassified october 14 , 2015 but then as now , security needs often met with resistance many specifics of the tempest standards are classified , but some elements are public the nsa and department of defense have declassified some tempest elements after freedom of information act requests , but the documents black out many key values and descriptions for example , military handbook 1195 includes the chart at the right , showing electromagnetic shielding requirements at different frequencies : nsa tempest certification program the united states army also has a tempest testing facility , as part of the u.s , maintaining distance or installing shielding between circuits and equipment used to handle plaintext classified or sensitive information that is not encrypted ( red ) and secured circuits and equipment ( black ) , the latter including those carrying encrypted signals each eight character transmission provided soviet access to sensitive documents , as they were being typed , at us facilities in moscow and leningrad in the novel cryptonomicon by neal stephenson , characters use van eck phreaking to likewise read information from a computer monitor in a neighboring room pdf file ) information leakage from optical emanationsâ€”journal article in acm transactions on information and system security , vol

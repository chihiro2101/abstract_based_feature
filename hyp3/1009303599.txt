military with the 131-b2 mixer device that encrypted teleprinter signals by xor ’ ing them with key material from one-time tapes ( the sigtot system ) or , earlier , a rotor-based key generator called sigcum later bell informed the signal corps that they were able to detect electromagnetic spikes at a distance from the mixer and recover the plain text meeting skepticism over whether the phenomenon they discovered in the laboratory could really be dangerous , they demonstrated their ability to recover plain text from a signal corps ’ crypto center on varick street in lower manhattan bell developed a modified mixer , the 131-a1 with shielding and filtering , but it proved difficult to maintain and too expensive to deploy then in 1951 , the cia rediscovered the problem with the 131-b2 mixer and found they could recover plain text off the line carrying the encrypted signal from a quarter-mile away filters for signal and power lines were developed , and the recommended control-perimeter radius was extended to 200 feet , based more on what commanders could be expected to accomplish than any technical criteria acoustical emanations could reveal plain text , but only if the pick-up device was close to the source soundproofing the room made the problem worse by removing reflections and providing a cleaner signal to the recorder in 1956 , the naval research laboratory developed a better mixer that operated at much lower voltages and currents and therefore radiated far less however , many users needed the higher signal levels to drive teleprinters at greater distances or where multiple teleprinters were connected , so the newer encryption devices included the option to switch the signal back up to the higher strength a 1958 joint policy called nag-1 set radiation standards for equipment and installations based on a limit of control communications security board ( uscsb ) produced a flexowriter policy that banned its use overseas for classified information and limited its use within the u.s boak lectures , national security agency ( nsa ) , volumes i , 1973 , volumes ii 1981 , partially released 2008 , additional portions declassified october 14 , 2015 but then as now , security needs often met with resistance nato sdip-27 level c ( formerly amsg 784 ) and usa nstissam level iii : '' laboratory test standard for tactical mobile equipment/systems '' : an even more relaxed standard for devices operated in nato zone 2 environments , where attackers have to deal with the equivalent of 100 metres ( 300 ' ) of free-space attenuation ( or equivalent attenuation through building materials ) the nsa and department of defense have declassified some tempest elements after freedom of information act requests , but the documents black out many key values and descriptions despite this , some declassified documents give information on the shielding required by tempest standards '' since much of the current requirements are still classified , there are no publicly available correlations between this 100 & nbsp ; db shielding requirement and the newer zone-based shielding standards : nsa tempest certification program the united states army also has a tempest testing facility , as part of the u.s , maintaining distance or installing shielding between circuits and equipment used to handle plaintext classified or sensitive information that is not encrypted ( red ) and secured circuits and equipment ( black ) , the latter including those carrying encrypted signals this paper caused some consternation in the security community , which had previously believed that such monitoring was a highly sophisticated attack available only to governments ; van eck successfully eavesdropped on a real system , at a range of hundreds of metres , using just 15 worth of equipment plus a television set ( 24 metres ) additionally the nsa published tempest fundamentals , nsa-82-89 , nacsim 5000 , national security agency ( classified ) on february 1 , 1982 adding random noise to the least significant bits of pixel values may render the emanations from flat-panel displays unintelligible to eavesdroppers but is not a secure method since dvi uses a 8b/10b encoding that tries to transport a balanced signal of 0 bits and 1 bits , there may not be much difference between two pixel colors that differ very much in their color or intensity in the television series spooks , season 4 episode '' the sting '' , a failed attempt to read information from a computer that has no network link is described bitwhisper : the heat is on the air-gap how to leak sensitive data from an isolated computer ( air-gap ) to a near by mobile phone - airhopper nsa tempest endorsement program the complete , unofficial tempest information page ( original defunct pdf file ) compromising emanations : eavesdropping risks of computer displays tempest and qinetiq : electronic eavesdropping counter-measures soft tempest : hidden data transmission using electromagnetic emanations (

military with the 131-b2 mixer device that encrypted teleprinter signals by xor ’ ing them with key material from one-time tapes ( the sigtot system ) or , earlier , a rotor-based key generator called sigcum later bell informed the signal corps that they were able to detect electromagnetic spikes at a distance from the mixer and recover the plain text bell developed a modified mixer , the 131-a1 with shielding and filtering , but it proved difficult to maintain and too expensive to deploy then in 1951 , the cia rediscovered the problem with the 131-b2 mixer and found they could recover plain text off the line carrying the encrypted signal from a quarter-mile away filters for signal and power lines were developed , and the recommended control-perimeter radius was extended to 200 feet , based more on what commanders could be expected to accomplish than any technical criteria in 1956 , the naval research laboratory developed a better mixer that operated at much lower voltages and currents and therefore radiated far less a 1958 joint policy called nag-1 set radiation standards for equipment and installations based on a limit of control it also specified the classification levels of various aspects of the tempest problem computerization was becoming important to processing intelligence data , and computers and their peripherals had to be evaluated , wherein many of them evidenced vulnerabilities communications security board ( uscsb ) produced a flexowriter policy that banned its use overseas for classified information and limited its use within the u.s to the confidential level , and then only within a security zone – but users found the policy onerous and impractical other units were fully shielded to contain electronic emanations , but were unpopular with the personnel who were supposed to work inside ; they called the enclosures '' meat lockers '' , and sometimes just left their doors open boak lectures , national security agency ( nsa ) , volumes i , 1973 , volumes ii 1981 , partially released 2008 , additional portions declassified october 14 , 2015 but then as now , security needs often met with resistance additional standards include : nato sdip-29 ( formerly amsg 719g ) : '' installation of electrical equipment for the processing of classified information '' : this standard defines installation requirements , for example in respect to grounding and cable distances the nsa and department of defense have declassified some tempest elements after freedom of information act requests , but the documents black out many key values and descriptions the declassified version of the tempest test standard is heavily redacted , with emanation limits and test procedures blacked out a redacted version of the introductory tempest handbook nacsim 5000 was publicly released in december 2000 additionally , the current nato standard sdip-27 ( before 2006 known as amsg 720b , amsg 788a , and amsg 784 ) is still classified a declassified nsa specification for shielded enclosures offers similar shielding values , requiring , '' a minimum of 100 db insertion loss from 1 khz to 10 ghz '' since much of the current requirements are still classified , there are no publicly available correlations between this 100 & nbsp ; db shielding requirement and the newer zone-based shielding standards in addition , many separation distance requirements and other elements are provided by the declassified nsa red-black installation guidance , nstissam tempest/2-95 , maintaining distance or installing shielding between circuits and equipment used to handle plaintext classified or sensitive information that is not encrypted ( red ) and secured circuits and equipment ( black ) , the latter including those carrying encrypted signals one aspect of tempest testing that distinguishes it from limits on spurious emissions ( e.g recent research has shown it is possible to detect the radiation corresponding to a keypress event from not only wireless ( radio ) keyboards , but also from traditional wired keyboards , and even from laptop keyboards pdf file ) publicly released version of nacsim 5000 nist 800-59—nist 800-59 - guideline for identifying an information system as a national security system pdf file ) information leakage from optical emanations—journal article in acm transactions on information and system security , vol

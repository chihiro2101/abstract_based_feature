military with the 131-b2 mixer device that encrypted teleprinter signals by xor ’ ing them with key material from one-time tapes ( the sigtot system ) or , earlier , a rotor-based key generator called sigcum later bell informed the signal corps that they were able to detect electromagnetic spikes at a distance from the mixer and recover the plain text meeting skepticism over whether the phenomenon they discovered in the laboratory could really be dangerous , they demonstrated their ability to recover plain text from a signal corps ’ crypto center on varick street in lower manhattan bell identified three problem areas : radiated signals , signals conducted on wires extending from the facility , and magnetic fields bell developed a modified mixer , the 131-a1 with shielding and filtering , but it proved difficult to maintain and too expensive to deploy instead , relevant commanders were warned of the problem and advised to control a -diameter zone around their communications center to prevent covert interception , and things were left at that then in 1951 , the cia rediscovered the problem with the 131-b2 mixer and found they could recover plain text off the line carrying the encrypted signal from a quarter-mile away filters for signal and power lines were developed , and the recommended control-perimeter radius was extended to 200 feet , based more on what commanders could be expected to accomplish than any technical criteria computerization was becoming important to processing intelligence data , and computers and their peripherals had to be evaluated , wherein many of them evidenced vulnerabilities communications security board ( uscsb ) produced a flexowriter policy that banned its use overseas for classified information and limited its use within the u.s other units were fully shielded to contain electronic emanations , but were unpopular with the personnel who were supposed to work inside ; they called the enclosures '' meat lockers '' , and sometimes just left their doors open tempest standards continued to evolve in the 1970s and later , with newer testing methods and more-nuanced guidelines that took account of the risks in specific locations and situations boak lectures , national security agency ( nsa ) , volumes i , 1973 , volumes ii 1981 , partially released 2008 , additional portions declassified october 14 , 2015 but then as now , security needs often met with resistance many specifics of the tempest standards are classified , but some elements are public current united states and nato tempest standards define three levels of protection requirements : nato sdip-27 level a ( formerly amsg 720b ) and usa nstissam level i : '' compromising emanations laboratory test standard '' : this is the strictest standard for devices that will be operated in nato zone 0 environments , where it is assumed that an attacker has almost immediate access ( e.g additional standards include : nato sdip-29 ( formerly amsg 719g ) : '' installation of electrical equipment for the processing of classified information '' : this standard defines installation requirements , for example in respect to grounding and cable distances the nsa and department of defense have declassified some tempest elements after freedom of information act requests , but the documents black out many key values and descriptions a redacted version of the introductory tempest handbook nacsim 5000 was publicly released in december 2000 additionally , the current nato standard sdip-27 ( before 2006 known as amsg 720b , amsg 788a , and amsg 784 ) is still classified a declassified nsa specification for shielded enclosures offers similar shielding values , requiring , '' a minimum of 100 db insertion loss from 1 khz to 10 ghz in addition , many separation distance requirements and other elements are provided by the declassified nsa red-black installation guidance , nstissam tempest/2-95 , maintaining distance or installing shielding between circuits and equipment used to handle plaintext classified or sensitive information that is not encrypted ( red ) and secured circuits and equipment ( black ) , the latter including those carrying encrypted signals ( 24 metres ) additionally the nsa published tempest fundamentals , nsa-82-89 , nacsim 5000 , national security agency ( classified ) on february 1 , 1982 in the novel cryptonomicon by neal stephenson , characters use van eck phreaking to likewise read information from a computer monitor in a neighboring room bitwhisper : the heat is on the air-gap how to leak sensitive data from an isolated computer ( air-gap ) to a near by mobile phone - airhopper nsa tempest endorsement program the complete , unofficial tempest information page ( original defunct pdf file ) compromising emanations : eavesdropping risks of computer displays tempest and qinetiq : electronic eavesdropping counter-measures soft tempest : hidden data transmission using electromagnetic emanations (

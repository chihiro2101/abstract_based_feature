thumb peripheral membrane proteins may interact with other proteins or directly with the lipid bilayer some proteins , such as g-proteins and certain protein kinases , interact with transmembrane proteins and the lipid bilayer simultaneously some polypeptide hormones , antimicrobial peptides , and neurotoxins accumulate at the membrane surface prior to locating and interacting with their cell surface receptor targets , which may themselves be peripheral membrane proteins the hydrophobic inner core region of typical biological membranes may have a thickness of around 27 to 32 Ã¥ , as estimated by small angle x-ray scattering ( saxs ) these proteins are usually described as peripheral as one of their conformational states is water-soluble or only loosely associated with a membrane it has been shown that the membrane binding affinities of many peripheral proteins depend on the specific lipid composition of the membrane with which they are associated amphitropic proteins associate with lipid bilayers via various hydrophobic anchor structures protein association with membranes through the use of acylated residues is a reversible process , as the acyl chain can be buried in a protein 's hydrophobic binding pocket after dissociation from the membrane thumb some cytosolic proteins are recruited to different cellular membranes by recognizing certain types of lipid found within a given membrane binding of a protein to a specific lipid occurs via specific membrane-targeting structural domains that occur within the protein and have specific binding pockets for the lipid head groups of the lipids to which they bind these include the cytoplasmic side of cell membranes , the outer leaflet of outer bacterial membranes and mitochondrial membranes therefore , electrostatic play an important role in protein targeting of electron carriers such as cytochrome c , cationic toxins such as charybdotoxin , and specific membrane-targeting domains such as some ph domains , c1 domains , and c2 domains antimicrobial peptides lipoproteins membrane proteins transmembrane proteins

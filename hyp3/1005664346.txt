binding to the lipid bilayer thumb peripheral membrane proteins may interact with other proteins or directly with the lipid bilayer some proteins , such as g-proteins and certain protein kinases , interact with transmembrane proteins and the lipid bilayer simultaneously the hydrophobic inner core region of typical biological membranes may have a thickness of around 27 to 32 å , as estimated by small angle x-ray scattering ( saxs ) the boundary region between the hydrophobic inner core and the hydrophilic interfacial regions is very narrow , at around 3å , ( see lipid bilayer article for a description of its component chemical groups ) moving outwards away from the hydrophobic core region and into the interfacial hydrophilic region , the effective concentration of water rapidly changes across this boundary layer , from nearly zero to a concentration of around 2 m the phosphate groups within phospholipid bilayers are fully hydrated or saturated with water and are situated around 5 å outside the boundary of the hydrophobic core region ( see figures ) these may include the folding of regions of protein structure that were previously unfolded typical amphitropic proteins must interact strongly with the lipid bilayer in order to perform their biological functions it has been shown that the membrane binding affinities of many peripheral proteins depend on the specific lipid composition of the membrane with which they are associated perhaps because of this additional need for structural flexibility , lipid anchors are usually bound to the highly flexible segments of proteins tertiary structure that are not well resolved by protein crystallography thumb some cytosolic proteins are recruited to different cellular membranes by recognizing certain types of lipid found within a given membrane however , typical amphitropic proteins have various hydrophobic anchors that penetrate the interfacial region and reach the hydrocarbon interior of the membrane intrinsically unstructured or unfolded peptides with nonpolar residues or lipid anchors can also penetrate the interfacial region of the membrane and reach the hydrocarbon core , especially when such peptides are cationic and interact with negatively charged membranes

thumb peripheral membrane proteins may interact with other proteins or directly with the lipid bilayer some proteins , such as g-proteins and certain protein kinases , interact with transmembrane proteins and the lipid bilayer simultaneously some polypeptide hormones , antimicrobial peptides , and neurotoxins accumulate at the membrane surface prior to locating and interacting with their cell surface receptor targets , which may themselves be peripheral membrane proteins the phospholipid bilayer that forms the cell surface membrane consists of a hydrophobic inner core region sandwiched between two regions of hydrophilicity , one at the inner surface and one at the outer surface of the cell membrane ( see lipid bilayer article for a more detailed structural description of the cell membrane ) the inner and outer surfaces , or interfacial regions , of model phospholipid bilayers have been shown to have a thickness of around 8 to 10 å , although this may be wider in biological membranes that include large amounts of gangliosides or lipopolysaccharides the hydrophobic inner core region of typical biological membranes may have a thickness of around 27 to 32 å , as estimated by small angle x-ray scattering ( saxs ) these may include the folding of regions of protein structure that were previously unfolded typical amphitropic proteins must interact strongly with the lipid bilayer in order to perform their biological functions hydrophobic interactions have been shown to be important even for highly cationic peptides and proteins , such as the polybasic domain of the marcks protein or histactophilin , when their natural hydrophobic anchors are present on the exoplasmic face of the cell membrane , lipid anchored proteins are covalently attached to the lipids glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( gpi ) and cholesterol protein association with membranes through the use of acylated residues is a reversible process , as the acyl chain can be buried in a protein 's hydrophobic binding pocket after dissociation from the membrane binding of a protein to a specific lipid occurs via specific membrane-targeting structural domains that occur within the protein and have specific binding pockets for the lipid head groups of the lipids to which they bind antimicrobial peptides lipoproteins membrane proteins transmembrane proteins peripheral membrane proteins in opm database dolop genomics-oriented database of bacterial lipoproteins peptaibol database antimicrobial peptide database

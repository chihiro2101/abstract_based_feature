thumb peripheral membrane proteins may interact with other proteins or directly with the lipid bilayer some proteins , such as g-proteins and certain protein kinases , interact with transmembrane proteins and the lipid bilayer simultaneously some polypeptide hormones , antimicrobial peptides , and neurotoxins accumulate at the membrane surface prior to locating and interacting with their cell surface receptor targets , which may themselves be peripheral membrane proteins the hydrophobic inner core region of typical biological membranes may have a thickness of around 27 to 32 Ã¥ , as estimated by small angle x-ray scattering ( saxs ) some water-soluble proteins associate with lipid bilayers irreversibly and can form transmembrane alpha-helical or beta-barrel channels these proteins are usually described as peripheral as one of their conformational states is water-soluble or only loosely associated with a membrane the association of a protein with a lipid bilayer may involve significant changes within tertiary structure of a protein it has been shown that the membrane binding affinities of many peripheral proteins depend on the specific lipid composition of the membrane with which they are associated thumb some cytosolic proteins are recruited to different cellular membranes by recognizing certain types of lipid found within a given membrane binding of a protein to a specific lipid occurs via specific membrane-targeting structural domains that occur within the protein and have specific binding pockets for the lipid head groups of the lipids to which they bind any positively charged protein will be attracted to a negatively charged membrane by nonspecific electrostatic interactions however , not all peripheral peptides and proteins are cationic , and only certain sides of membrane are negatively charged antimicrobial peptides lipoproteins membrane proteins transmembrane proteins

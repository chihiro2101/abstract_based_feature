thumb peripheral membrane proteins may interact with other proteins or directly with the lipid bilayer some proteins , such as g-proteins and certain protein kinases , interact with transmembrane proteins and the lipid bilayer simultaneously some polypeptide hormones , antimicrobial peptides , and neurotoxins accumulate at the membrane surface prior to locating and interacting with their cell surface receptor targets , which may themselves be peripheral membrane proteins the phospholipid bilayer that forms the cell surface membrane consists of a hydrophobic inner core region sandwiched between two regions of hydrophilicity , one at the inner surface and one at the outer surface of the cell membrane ( see lipid bilayer article for a more detailed structural description of the cell membrane ) some water-soluble proteins associate with lipid bilayers irreversibly and can form transmembrane alpha-helical or beta-barrel channels these proteins are usually described as peripheral as one of their conformational states is water-soluble or only loosely associated with a membrane these may include the folding of regions of protein structure that were previously unfolded typical amphitropic proteins must interact strongly with the lipid bilayer in order to perform their biological functions it has been shown that the membrane binding affinities of many peripheral proteins depend on the specific lipid composition of the membrane with which they are associated hydrophobic interactions have been shown to be important even for highly cationic peptides and proteins , such as the polybasic domain of the marcks protein or histactophilin , when their natural hydrophobic anchors are present lipid anchored proteins are covalently attached to different fatty acid acyl chains on the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane via palmitoylation , myristoylation , or prenylation thumb some cytosolic proteins are recruited to different cellular membranes by recognizing certain types of lipid found within a given membrane however , not all peripheral peptides and proteins are cationic , and only certain sides of membrane are negatively charged antimicrobial peptides lipoproteins membrane proteins transmembrane proteins

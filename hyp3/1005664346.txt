thumb peripheral membrane proteins may interact with other proteins or directly with the lipid bilayer some proteins , such as g-proteins and certain protein kinases , interact with transmembrane proteins and the lipid bilayer simultaneously some polypeptide hormones , antimicrobial peptides , and neurotoxins accumulate at the membrane surface prior to locating and interacting with their cell surface receptor targets , which may themselves be peripheral membrane proteins the phospholipid bilayer that forms the cell surface membrane consists of a hydrophobic inner core region sandwiched between two regions of hydrophilicity , one at the inner surface and one at the outer surface of the cell membrane ( see lipid bilayer article for a more detailed structural description of the cell membrane ) the inner and outer surfaces , or interfacial regions , of model phospholipid bilayers have been shown to have a thickness of around 8 to 10 å , although this may be wider in biological membranes that include large amounts of gangliosides or lipopolysaccharides the boundary region between the hydrophobic inner core and the hydrophilic interfacial regions is very narrow , at around 3å , ( see lipid bilayer article for a description of its component chemical groups ) these may include the folding of regions of protein structure that were previously unfolded typical amphitropic proteins must interact strongly with the lipid bilayer in order to perform their biological functions it has been shown that the membrane binding affinities of many peripheral proteins depend on the specific lipid composition of the membrane with which they are associated hydrophobic interactions have been shown to be important even for highly cationic peptides and proteins , such as the polybasic domain of the marcks protein or histactophilin , when their natural hydrophobic anchors are present lipid anchored proteins are covalently attached to different fatty acid acyl chains on the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane via palmitoylation , myristoylation , or prenylation protein association with membranes through the use of acylated residues is a reversible process , as the acyl chain can be buried in a protein 's hydrophobic binding pocket after dissociation from the membrane thumb some cytosolic proteins are recruited to different cellular membranes by recognizing certain types of lipid found within a given membrane antimicrobial peptides lipoproteins membrane proteins transmembrane proteins

in a phase space , every degree of freedom or parameter of the system is represented as an axis of a multidimensional space ; a one-dimensional system is called a phase line , while a two-dimensional system is called a phase plane for every possible state of the system or allowed combination of values of the system 's parameters , a point is included in the multidimensional space the system 's evolving state over time traces a path ( a phase space trajectory for the system ) through the high-dimensional space as a whole , the phase diagram represents all that the system can be , and its shape can easily elucidate qualities of the system that might not be obvious otherwise more abstractly , in classical mechanics phase space is the cotangent bundle of configuration space , and in this interpretation the procedure above expresses that a choice of local coordinates on configuration space induces a choice of natural local darboux coordinates for the standard symplectic structure on a cotangent space within the context of a model system in classical mechanics , the phase space coordinates of the system at any given time are composed of all of the system 's dynamic variables in quantum mechanics , the coordinates p and q of phase space normally become hermitian operators in a hilbert space with j e moyal ( 1949 ) , these completed the foundations of the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics , a complete and logically autonomous reformulation of quantum mechanics thus , by expressing quantum mechanics in phase space ( the same ambit as for classical mechanics ) , the weyl map facilitates recognition of quantum mechanics as a deformation ( generalization ) of classical mechanics , with deformation parameter ħ/s , where s is the action of the relevant process in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics contexts , the term phase space has two meanings : for one , it is used in the same sense as in classical mechanics phase line , 1-dimensional case phase plane , 2-dimensional case phase portrait phase space method parameter space separatrix ; applications optical phase space state space ( controls ) for information about state space ( similar to phase state ) in control engineering molecular dynamics ; mathematics cotangent bundle dynamic system symplectic manifold wigner–weyl transform ; physics classical mechanics hamiltonian mechanics lagrangian mechanics state space ( physics ) for information about state space in physics phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics

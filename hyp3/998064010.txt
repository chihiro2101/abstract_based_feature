in a phase space , every degree of freedom or parameter of the system is represented as an axis of a multidimensional space ; a one-dimensional system is called a phase line , while a two-dimensional system is called a phase plane for every possible state of the system or allowed combination of values of the system 's parameters , a point is included in the multidimensional space the system 's evolving state over time traces a path ( a phase space trajectory for the system ) through the high-dimensional space as a whole , the phase diagram represents all that the system can be , and its shape can easily elucidate qualities of the system that might not be obvious otherwise coordinates on configuration space ) defines conjugate momentum p i which together define co-ordinates on phase space statistical ensembles in phase space the motion of an ensemble of systems in this space is studied by classical statistical mechanics within the context of a model system in classical mechanics , the phase space coordinates of the system at any given time are composed of all of the system 's dynamic variables the phase space of a two-dimensional system is called a phase plane , which occurs in classical mechanics for a single particle moving in one dimension , and where the two variables are position and velocity ( other familiar deformations in physics involve the deformation of classical newtonian into special relativity , with deformation parameter v/c ; or the deformation of newtonian gravity into general relativity , with deformation parameter schwarzschild radius/characteristic-dimension the phase space can also refer to the space that is parameterized by the macroscopic states of the system , such as pressure , temperature , etc phase line , 1-dimensional case phase plane , 2-dimensional case phase portrait phase space method parameter space separatrix ; applications optical phase space state space ( controls ) for information about state space ( similar to phase state ) in control engineering

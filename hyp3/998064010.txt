in a phase space , every degree of freedom or parameter of the system is represented as an axis of a multidimensional space ; a one-dimensional system is called a phase line , while a two-dimensional system is called a phase plane the system 's evolving state over time traces a path ( a phase space trajectory for the system ) through the high-dimensional space the phase space trajectory represents the set of states compatible with starting from one particular initial condition , located in the full phase space that represents the set of states compatible with starting from any initial condition phase spaces are easier to use when analyzing the behavior of mechanical systems restricted to motion around and along various axes of rotation or translation - e.g within the context of a model system in classical mechanics , the phase space coordinates of the system at any given time are composed of all of the system 's dynamic variables the phase space of a two-dimensional system is called a phase plane , which occurs in classical mechanics for a single particle moving in one dimension , and where the two variables are position and velocity a plot of position and momentum variables as a function of time is sometimes called a phase plot or a phase diagram if a thermodynamic system consists of n particles , then a point in the 6n-dimensional phase space describes the dynamic state of every particle in that system , as each particle is associated with three-position variables and three momentum variables when used in this sense , a phase is a region of phase space where the system in question is in , for example , the liquid phase , or solid phase , etc instead of summing the boltzmann factor over discretely spaced energy states ( defined by appropriate integer quantum numbers for each degree of freedom ) one may integrate over continuous phase space once the phase integral is known , it may be related to the classical partition function by multiplication of a normalization constant representing the number of quantum energy states per unit phase space phase line , 1-dimensional case phase plane , 2-dimensional case phase portrait phase space method parameter space separatrix ; applications optical phase space state space ( controls ) for information about state space ( similar to phase state ) in control engineering

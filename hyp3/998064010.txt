in a phase space , every degree of freedom or parameter of the system is represented as an axis of a multidimensional space ; a one-dimensional system is called a phase line , while a two-dimensional system is called a phase plane for every possible state of the system or allowed combination of values of the system 's parameters , a point is included in the multidimensional space the system 's evolving state over time traces a path ( a phase space trajectory for the system ) through the high-dimensional space as a whole , the phase diagram represents all that the system can be , and its shape can easily elucidate qualities of the system that might not be obvious otherwise coordinates on configuration space ) defines conjugate momentum p i which together define co-ordinates on phase space within the context of a model system in classical mechanics , the phase space coordinates of the system at any given time are composed of all of the system 's dynamic variables one degree of freedom occurs when one has an autonomous ordinary differential equation in a single variable , dy/dt f ( y ) , with the resulting one-dimensional system being called a phase line , and the qualitative behaviour of the system being immediately visible from the phase line the phase space of a two-dimensional system is called a phase plane , which occurs in classical mechanics for a single particle moving in one dimension , and where the two variables are position and velocity a plot of position and momentum variables as a function of time is sometimes called a phase plot or a phase diagram the phase space can also refer to the space that is parameterized by the macroscopic states of the system , such as pressure , temperature , etc when used in this sense , a phase is a region of phase space where the system in question is in , for example , the liquid phase , or solid phase , etc phase line , 1-dimensional case phase plane , 2-dimensional case phase portrait phase space method parameter space separatrix ; applications optical phase space state space ( controls ) for information about state space ( similar to phase state ) in control engineering

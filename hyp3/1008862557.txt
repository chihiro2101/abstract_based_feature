endeavour was originally the merchant collier earl of pembroke , built by thomas fishburn for thomas millner , launched in june 1764 from the coal and whaling port of whitby in north yorkshire she was a type known locally as the whitby cat she was ship-rigged and sturdily built with a broad , flat bow , a square stern , and a long box-like body with a deep hold her hull , internal floors , and futtocks were built from traditional white oak , her keel and stern post from elm , and her masts from pine and fir plans of the ship also show a double keelson to lock the keel , floors and frames in place 33–41 there is uncertainty about the height of her standing masts ( excludes top and gallant masts national maritime museum greenwich endeavour 1771 draught zaz6595 ) , as surviving diagrams of endeavour depict the body of the vessel only , and not the mast plan if correct , this would produce an oddly truncated mast a full shorter than the naval standards of the day a more recent critical review of contemporary sources does n't require a supposed typo in 1771 to explain this shorter measurement for the mizzen whilst at the same time offers supporting evidence of its cap being at the taller supposed normal height zooming this painting also reveals that the position of the mizzen channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the mizzen chainplates on the original as fitted draught nmm zaz7844 the royal society suggested command be given to scottish geographer alexander dalrymple , whose acceptance was conditional on a brevet commission as a captain in the royal navy first lord of the admiralty edward hawke refused , going so far as to say he would rather cut off his right hand than give command of a navy vessel to someone not educated as a seaman the impasse was broken when the admiralty proposed james cook , a naval officer with a background in mathematics and cartography rigby and van der merwe 2002 , p 30 on 27 may 1768 , cook took command of earl of pembroke , valued in march at £2,307 and assigned for use in the society 's expedition the great cabin at the rear of the deck was designed as a workroom for cook and the royal society the adjoining open mess deck provided sleeping and living quarters for the marines and crew , and additional storage space a longboat , pinnace and yawl were provided as ship 's boats , though the longboat was rotten having to be rebuilt and painted with white lead before it could be brought aboard the ship was also equipped with a set of sweeps to allow her to be rowed forward if becalmed or demasted the refitted vessel was commissioned as his majesty 's bark the endeavour , to distinguish her from the 4-gun cutter on 21 july 1768 , endeavour sailed to gallion 's reach to take on armaments to protect her against potentially hostile pacific island natives 1–2 cook also ordered that twelve tons of pig iron be brought on board as sailing ballast beaglehole 1968 , p the ship was recaulked and painted , and fresh vegetables , beef and water were brought aboard for the next leg of the voyage endeavour then continued south along the coast of africa and across the atlantic to south america , arriving in rio de janeiro on 13 november 1768 fresh food and water were brought aboard and the ship departed for cape horn , which she reached during stormy weather on 13 january 1769 beaglehole 1968 , pp on 17 january two of banks ' servants died from cold while attempting to return to the ship during a heavy snowstorm hough 1994 , pp 91–97 endeavour resumed her voyage on 21 january 1769 , heading west-northwest into warmer weather the transit of venus across the sun occurred on 3 june , and was observed and recorded by astronomer charles green from endeavour deck the transit observed , endeavour departed tahiti on 13 july and headed northwest to allow cook to survey and name the society islands an attempt to land the pinnace on the austral island of rurutu was thwarted by rough surf and the rocky shoreline endeavour spent the next six months sailing close to shore , while cook mapped the coastline and concluded that new zealand comprised two large islands and was not the hoped-for terra australis on his return , endeavour resumed her voyage westward , her crew sighting the east coast of australia on 19 april 299 on 29 april , she became the first european vessel to make landfall on the east coast of australia , when cook landed one of the ship 's boats on the southern shore of what is now known as botany bay , new south wales just before 11 & nbsp ; pm on 11 june 1770 , the ship struck a reef , beaglehole 1968 , pp the reef endeavour had struck rose so steeply from the seabed that although the ship was hard aground , cook measured depths up to less than one ship 's length away iron and stone ballast , spoiled stores and all but four of the ship 's guns were thrown overboard , and the ship 's drinking water pumped out 179 in the afternoon of 12 june , the longboat carried out two large bower anchors , and block and tackle were rigged to the anchor chains to allow another attempt on the evening high tide 345–346 the anchors were retrieved , except for one which could not be freed from the seabed and had to be abandoned a mistake occurred in sounding the depth of water in the hold , when a new man measured the length of a sounding line from the outside plank of the hull where his predecessor had used the top of the cross-beams 236 midshipman jonathon monkhouse proposed fothering the ship , as he had previously been on a merchant ship which used the technique successfully 321 he was entrusted with supervising the task , sewing bits of oakum and wool into an old sail , which was then drawn under the ship to allow water pressure to force it into the hole in the hull on 13 june , the ship came to a broad watercourse that cook named the endeavour river cook attempted to enter the river mouth , but strong winds and rain prevented endeavour from crossing the bar until the morning of 17 june surrounded by pieces of oakum from the fother , this coral fragment had helped plug the hole in the hull and preserved the ship from sinking on the reef after waiting for the wind , endeavour resumed her voyage on the afternoon of 5 august 1770 , reaching the northernmost point of cape york peninsula fifteen days later on 22 august , cook was rowed ashore to a small coastal island to proclaim british sovereignty over the eastern australian mainland cook noted it was a '' surprise to every one who saw her bottom how we had kept her above water '' for the previous three-month voyage across open seas during the ship 's stay in batavia , all but 10 of the 94 & nbsp ; people aboard had been taken ill with malaria and dysentery 338–344 by the time endeavour set sail on 26 december , seven crew members had died and another forty were too sick to attend their duties over the following twelve weeks , a further 23 died from disease and were buried at sea , including spöring , green , parkinson , and the ship 's surgeon william monkhouse 452 on 13 march 1771 , endeavour rounded the cape of good hope and made port in cape town two days later those still sick were taken ashore for treatment a further letter to the providence journal stated that a retired english sailor was conducting guided tours of a hulk on the river thames as late as 1825 , claiming that the ship had once been cook 's endeavour at whitby the '' bark endeavour whitby '' is a scaled-down replica of the original ship blue latitudes , a travel book by tony horwitz european and american voyages of scientific exploration 613 the shanghaiied man was john thurman , born in new york but a british subject and therefore eligible for involuntary impressment aboard a royal navy vessel 458–459 a number of british vessels were sunk in local waters in the days leading up to the 29–30 august 1778 , battle of rhode island

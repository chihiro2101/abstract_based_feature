endeavour was originally the merchant collier earl of pembroke , built by thomas fishburn for thomas millner , launched in june 1764 from the coal and whaling port of whitby in north yorkshire she was a type known locally as the whitby cat she was ship-rigged and sturdily built with a broad , flat bow , a square stern , and a long box-like body with a deep hold 41 a flat-bottomed design made her well-suited to sailing in shallow waters and allowed her to be beached for loading and unloading of cargo and for basic repairs without requiring a dry dock her hull , internal floors , and futtocks were built from traditional white oak , her keel and stern post from elm , and her masts from pine and fir hosty and hundley 2003 , p plans of the ship also show a double keelson to lock the keel , floors and frames in place 33–41 there is uncertainty about the height of her standing masts ( excludes top and gallant masts national maritime museum greenwich endeavour 1771 draught zaz6595 ) , as surviving diagrams of endeavour depict the body of the vessel only , and not the mast plan if correct , this would produce an oddly truncated mast a full shorter than the naval standards of the day zooming this painting also reveals that the position of the mizzen channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the mizzen chainplates on the original as fitted draught nmm zaz7844 the replica standing mizzen is built to this shorter measurement and stepped in the hold on the keelson , as is the model in the national maritime museum in greenwich on 16 february 1768 , the royal society petitioned king george iii to finance a scientific expedition to the pacific to study and observe the 1769 transit of venus across the sun first lord of the admiralty edward hawke refused , going so far as to say he would rather cut off his right hand than give command of a navy vessel to someone not educated as a seaman the impasse was broken when the admiralty proposed james cook , a naval officer with a background in mathematics and cartography 30 on 27 may 1768 , cook took command of earl of pembroke , valued in march at £2,307 she was refitted at deptford on the river thames for the sum of £2,294 , almost the price of the ship itself the adjoining open mess deck provided sleeping and living quarters for the marines and crew , and additional storage space these were accompanied by two privately owned skiffs , one belonging to the boatswain john gathrey , and the other to banks the ship was also equipped with a set of sweeps to allow her to be rowed forward if becalmed or demasted on 21 july 1768 , endeavour sailed to gallion 's reach to take on armaments to protect her against potentially hostile pacific island natives the ship departed for plymouth on 30 july , for provisioning and crew boarding of 85 , including 12 & nbsp ; royal marines 1–2 cook also ordered that twelve tons of pig iron be brought on board as sailing ballast endeavour departed plymouth on 26 august 1768 , carrying 18 months of provisions for 94 people beaglehole 1968 , p 15 the first port of call was funchal in the madeira islands , which endeavour reached on 12 september 7 to replace him , cook shanghaied a sailor from an american sloop anchored nearby endeavour then continued south along the coast of africa and across the atlantic to south america , arriving in rio de janeiro on 13 november 1768 attempts to round the cape over the next two days were unsuccessful , and endeavour was repeatedly driven back by wind , rain and contrary tides cook noted that the seas off the cape were large enough to regularly submerge the bow of the ship as she rode down from the crests of waves at last , on 16 january the wind eased and the ship was able to pass the cape and anchor in the bay of good success on the pacific coast 41–44 the crew were sent to collect wood and water , while banks and his team gathered hundreds of plant specimens from along the icy shore on 17 january two of banks ' servants died from cold while attempting to return to the ship during a heavy snowstorm she reached tahiti on 10 april , where she remained for the next three months the transit observed , endeavour departed tahiti on 13 july and headed northwest to allow cook to survey and name the society islands 34 landfall was made at huahine , raiatea and borabora , providing opportunities for cook to claim each of them as british territories 133–134 on 15 august , endeavour finally turned south to explore the open ocean for terra australis incognita in october 1769 , endeavour reached the coastline of new zealand , becoming the first european vessel to do so since abel tasman 's heemskerck in 1642 343–345 today called endeavour reef , within the great barrier reef system the sails were immediately taken down , a anchor kedging set and an unsuccessful attempt was made to drag the ship back to open water the reef endeavour had struck rose so steeply from the seabed that although the ship was hard aground , cook measured depths up to less than one ship 's length away cook then ordered that the ship be lightened to help her float off the reef the crew attached buoys to the discarded guns with the intention of retrieving them later , parkin 2003 , p every man on board took turns on the pumps , including cook and banks although the leak would certainly increase once off the reef , cook decided to risk the attempt and at 10:20 & nbsp ; pm the ship was floated on the tide and successfully drawn off 345–346 the anchors were retrieved , except for one which could not be freed from the seabed and had to be abandoned the mistake suggested the water depth had increased by about between soundings , sending a wave of fear through the ship 311 despite this , joseph banks noted in his journal the calm efficiency of the crew in the face of danger , contrary to stories he had heard of seamen panicking or refusing orders in such circumstances 321 he was entrusted with supervising the task , sewing bits of oakum and wool into an old sail , which was then drawn under the ship to allow water pressure to force it into the hole in the hull 322 endeavour then resumed her course northward and parallel to the reef , the crew looking for a safe harbour in which to make repairs on 13 june , the ship came to a broad watercourse that cook named the endeavour river surrounded by pieces of oakum from the fother , this coral fragment had helped plug the hole in the hull and preserved the ship from sinking on the reef after waiting for the wind , endeavour resumed her voyage on the afternoon of 5 august 1770 , reaching the northernmost point of cape york peninsula fifteen days later 386–389 by 26 august she was out of sight of land , and had entered the open waters of the torres strait between australia and new guinea , earlier navigated by luis váez de torres in 1606 433 the ship remained in very poor condition following her grounding on the great barrier reef in june wounded on her larbord side where the greatest leak is but i could not come at it for the water 55–56 an inspection of the hull revealed that some unrepaired planks were cut through to within & nbsp ; inch ( 3 & nbsp ; mm ) she sailed from portsmouth on 8 november 1771 , but due to terrible weather did not arrive at port egmont ( the british base in the falkland islands ) until 1 march endeavours pacific voyage was further commemorated in the use of her image on the reverse of the new zealand fifty-cent coin , and in the naming of the space shuttle endeavour in 1989 the russell museum , in the bay of islands , new zealand , has a sailing one-fifth scale replica of endeavour 458–459 a number of british vessels were sunk in local waters in the days leading up to the 29–30 august 1778 , battle of rhode island

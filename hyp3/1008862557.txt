endeavour was originally the merchant collier earl of pembroke , built by thomas fishburn for thomas millner , launched in june 1764 from the coal and whaling port of whitby in north yorkshire she was ship-rigged and sturdily built with a broad , flat bow , a square stern , and a long box-like body with a deep hold 41 a flat-bottomed design made her well-suited to sailing in shallow waters and allowed her to be beached for loading and unloading of cargo and for basic repairs without requiring a dry dock her hull , internal floors , and futtocks were built from traditional white oak , her keel and stern post from elm , and her masts from pine and fir plans of the ship also show a double keelson to lock the keel , floors and frames in place hosty and hundley 2003 , pp 33–41 there is uncertainty about the height of her standing masts ( excludes top and gallant masts national maritime museum greenwich endeavour 1771 draught zaz6595 ) , as surviving diagrams of endeavour depict the body of the vessel only , and not the mast plan zooming this painting also reveals that the position of the mizzen channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the mizzen chainplates on the original as fitted draught nmm zaz7844 the replica standing mizzen is built to this shorter measurement and stepped in the hold on the keelson , as is the model in the national maritime museum in greenwich 30 on 27 may 1768 , cook took command of earl of pembroke , valued in march at £2,307 the hull was sheathed and caulked to protect against shipworm , and a third internal deck installed to provide cabins , a powder magazine and storerooms 61 the new cabins provided around of floorspace apiece being allocated to cook and the royal society representatives : naturalist joseph banks , banks ' assistants daniel solander and herman spöring , astronomer charles green , and artists sydney parkinson and alexander buchan the great cabin at the rear of the deck was designed as a workroom for cook and the royal society a longboat , pinnace and yawl were provided as ship 's boats , though the longboat was rotten having to be rebuilt and painted with white lead before it could be brought aboard these were accompanied by two privately owned skiffs , one belonging to the boatswain john gathrey , and the other to banks on 21 july 1768 , endeavour sailed to gallion 's reach to take on armaments to protect her against potentially hostile pacific island natives twelve swivel guns were also supplied , and fixed to posts along the quarterdeck , sides and bow beaglehole 1968 , pp endeavour departed plymouth on 26 august 1768 , carrying 18 months of provisions for 94 people beaglehole 1968 , p 15 the first port of call was funchal in the madeira islands , which endeavour reached on 12 september 7 to replace him , cook shanghaied a sailor from an american sloop anchored nearby endeavour then continued south along the coast of africa and across the atlantic to south america , arriving in rio de janeiro on 13 november 1768 fresh food and water were brought aboard and the ship departed for cape horn , which she reached during stormy weather on 13 january 1769 attempts to round the cape over the next two days were unsuccessful , and endeavour was repeatedly driven back by wind , rain and contrary tides cook noted that the seas off the cape were large enough to regularly submerge the bow of the ship as she rode down from the crests of waves 41–44 the crew were sent to collect wood and water , while banks and his team gathered hundreds of plant specimens from along the icy shore on 17 january two of banks ' servants died from cold while attempting to return to the ship during a heavy snowstorm the transit of venus across the sun occurred on 3 june , and was observed and recorded by astronomer charles green from endeavour deck the transit observed , endeavour departed tahiti on 13 july and headed northwest to allow cook to survey and name the society islands rigby and van der merwe 2002 , p 133–134 on 15 august , endeavour finally turned south to explore the open ocean for terra australis incognita unfamiliar with such ships , the māori people at cook 's first landing point in poverty bay thought the ship was a floating island , or a gigantic bird from their mythical homeland of hawaiki on his return , endeavour resumed her voyage westward , her crew sighting the east coast of australia on 19 april 299 on 29 april , she became the first european vessel to make landfall on the east coast of australia , when cook landed one of the ship 's boats on the southern shore of what is now known as botany bay , new south wales 343–345 today called endeavour reef , within the great barrier reef system the reef endeavour had struck rose so steeply from the seabed that although the ship was hard aground , cook measured depths up to less than one ship 's length away the crew attached buoys to the discarded guns with the intention of retrieving them later , parkin 2003 , p hough 1994 , p 179 in the afternoon of 12 june , the longboat carried out two large bower anchors , and block and tackle were rigged to the anchor chains to allow another attempt on the evening high tide although the leak would certainly increase once off the reef , cook decided to risk the attempt and at 10:20 & nbsp ; pm the ship was floated on the tide and successfully drawn off a mistake occurred in sounding the depth of water in the hold , when a new man measured the length of a sounding line from the outside plank of the hull where his predecessor had used the top of the cross-beams the vessel was from shore and the three ship 's boats could not carry the entire crew cook attempted to enter the river mouth , but strong winds and rain prevented endeavour from crossing the bar until the morning of 17 june she grounded briefly on a sand spit but was refloated an hour later and warped into the river proper by early afternoon the ship was promptly beached on the southern bank and careened to make repairs to the hull 252–257 an examination of the hull showed that a piece of coral the size of a man 's fist had sliced clean through the timbers and then broken off after waiting for the wind , endeavour resumed her voyage on the afternoon of 5 august 1770 , reaching the northernmost point of cape york peninsula fifteen days later on 22 august , cook was rowed ashore to a small coastal island to proclaim british sovereignty over the eastern australian mainland hough 1994 , pp 386–389 by 26 august she was out of sight of land , and had entered the open waters of the torres strait between australia and new guinea , earlier navigated by luis váez de torres in 1606 to keep endeavours voyages and discoveries secret , cook confiscated the log books and journals of all on board and ordered them to remain silent about where they had been 426 after a three-day layover off the island of savu , endeavour sailed on to batavia , the capital of the dutch east indies , on 10 october 431–432 a day later lightning during a sudden tropical storm struck the ship , but the rudimentary '' electric chain '' or lightning rod that cook had ordered rigged to endeavours mast saved her from serious damage over the following twelve weeks , a further 23 died from disease and were buried at sea , including spöring , green , parkinson , and the ship 's surgeon william monkhouse 457 the ship remained in port for four weeks awaiting the recovery of the crew and undergoing minor repairs to her masts she was a collapsible vessel and was no sooner built than taken apart , and the pieces were stowed in endeavour in 1999 a combined research team from rimap and the australian national maritime museum examined some known wrecks in the harbour hosty and hundley 2003 , pp the replica vessel commenced her maiden voyage in october of that year , sailing to sydney harbour and then following cook 's path from botany bay northward to cooktown the russell museum , in the bay of islands , new zealand , has a sailing one-fifth scale replica of endeavour

endeavour was originally the merchant collier earl of pembroke , built by thomas fishburn for thomas millner , launched in june 1764 from the coal and whaling port of whitby in north yorkshire she was a type known locally as the whitby cat she was ship-rigged and sturdily built with a broad , flat bow , a square stern , and a long box-like body with a deep hold hosty and hundley 2003 , p her hull , internal floors , and futtocks were built from traditional white oak , her keel and stern post from elm , and her masts from pine and fir plans of the ship also show a double keelson to lock the keel , floors and frames in place 33–41 there is uncertainty about the height of her standing masts ( excludes top and gallant masts national maritime museum greenwich endeavour 1771 draught zaz6595 ) , as surviving diagrams of endeavour depict the body of the vessel only , and not the mast plan zooming this painting also reveals that the position of the mizzen channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the mizzen chainplates on the original as fitted draught nmm zaz7844 the replica standing mizzen is built to this shorter measurement and stepped in the hold on the keelson , as is the model in the national maritime museum in greenwich on 16 february 1768 , the royal society petitioned king george iii to finance a scientific expedition to the pacific to study and observe the 1769 transit of venus across the sun the royal society suggested command be given to scottish geographer alexander dalrymple , whose acceptance was conditional on a brevet commission as a captain in the royal navy , editor robert kerr 's introduction footnote 3 in refusing dalrymple 's command , hawke was influenced by previous insubordination aboard the sloop in 1698 , when naval officers had refused to take orders from civilian commander dr the impasse was broken when the admiralty proposed james cook , a naval officer with a background in mathematics and cartography 34 , 46 acceptable to both parties , cook was promoted to lieutenant and named as commander of the expedition she was refitted at deptford on the river thames for the sum of £2,294 , almost the price of the ship itself the hull was sheathed and caulked to protect against shipworm , and a third internal deck installed to provide cabins , a powder magazine and storerooms these were accompanied by two privately owned skiffs , one belonging to the boatswain john gathrey , and the other to banks the ship was also equipped with a set of sweeps to allow her to be rowed forward if becalmed or demasted ten 4-pounder cannon were brought aboard , six of which were mounted on the upper deck with the remainder stowed in the hold the ship departed for plymouth on 30 july , for provisioning and crew boarding of 85 , including 12 & nbsp ; royal marines 4 livestock on board included pigs , poultry , two greyhounds and a milking goat 15 the first port of call was funchal in the madeira islands , which endeavour reached on 12 september the ship was recaulked and painted , and fresh vegetables , beef and water were brought aboard for the next leg of the voyage endeavour then continued south along the coast of africa and across the atlantic to south america , arriving in rio de janeiro on 13 november 1768 fresh food and water were brought aboard and the ship departed for cape horn , which she reached during stormy weather on 13 january 1769 cook noted that the seas off the cape were large enough to regularly submerge the bow of the ship as she rode down from the crests of waves at last , on 16 january the wind eased and the ship was able to pass the cape and anchor in the bay of good success on the pacific coast in october 1769 , endeavour reached the coastline of new zealand , becoming the first european vessel to do so since abel tasman 's heemskerck in 1642 for the next four months , cook charted the coast of australia , heading generally northward just before 11 & nbsp ; pm on 11 june 1770 , the ship struck a reef , beaglehole 1968 , pp the sails were immediately taken down , a anchor kedging set and an unsuccessful attempt was made to drag the ship back to open water the reef endeavour had struck rose so steeply from the seabed that although the ship was hard aground , cook measured depths up to less than one ship 's length away iron and stone ballast , spoiled stores and all but four of the ship 's guns were thrown overboard , and the ship 's drinking water pumped out every man on board took turns on the pumps , including cook and banks 313 when , by cook 's reckoning , about of equipment had been thrown overboard , on the next high tide a second unsuccessful attempt was made to pull the ship free hough 1994 , p although the leak would certainly increase once off the reef , cook decided to risk the attempt and at 10:20 & nbsp ; pm the ship was floated on the tide and successfully drawn off 345–346 the anchors were retrieved , except for one which could not be freed from the seabed and had to be abandoned as expected the leak increased once the ship was off the reef , and all three working pumps had to be continually manned a mistake occurred in sounding the depth of water in the hold , when a new man measured the length of a sounding line from the outside plank of the hull where his predecessor had used the top of the cross-beams the mistake suggested the water depth had increased by about between soundings , sending a wave of fear through the ship as soon as the mistake was realised , redoubled efforts kept the pumps ahead of the leak the prospects if the ship sank were grim the vessel was from shore and the three ship 's boats could not carry the entire crew 321 he was entrusted with supervising the task , sewing bits of oakum and wool into an old sail , which was then drawn under the ship to allow water pressure to force it into the hole in the hull torn sails and rigging were also replaced and the hull scraped free of barnacles 252–257 an examination of the hull showed that a piece of coral the size of a man 's fist had sliced clean through the timbers and then broken off surrounded by pieces of oakum from the fother , this coral fragment had helped plug the hole in the hull and preserved the ship from sinking on the reef after waiting for the wind , endeavour resumed her voyage on the afternoon of 5 august 1770 , reaching the northernmost point of cape york peninsula fifteen days later on 22 august , cook was rowed ashore to a small coastal island to proclaim british sovereignty over the eastern australian mainland 189–190 endeavour then resumed her voyage westward along the coast , picking a path through intermittent shoals and reefs with the help of the pinnace , which was rowed ahead to test the water depth 55–56 an inspection of the hull revealed that some unrepaired planks were cut through to within & nbsp ; inch ( 3 & nbsp ; mm ) finally , the rigging and pumps were renewed and fresh stores brought aboard for the return journey to england though endeavour was now in good condition , her crew were not 457 the ship remained in port for four weeks awaiting the recovery of the crew and undergoing minor repairs to her masts another ship there at that time was hms siren , captained by tobias furneaux , who had commanded adventure on cook 's second voyage in 1991 the rhode island marine archaeology project ( rimap ) began research into the identity of the thirteen transports sunk as part of the newport blockade of 1778 , including lord sandwich in 1937 , a small part of endeavour keel was given to the australian government by philanthropist charles wakefield in his capacity as president of the arthur phillip endeavours pacific voyage was further commemorated in the use of her image on the reverse of the new zealand fifty-cent coin , and in the naming of the space shuttle endeavour in 1989 a second full-size replica of endeavour was berthed on the river tees in stockton-on-tees before being moved to whitby

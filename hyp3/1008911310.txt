the first dnsbl was the real-time blackhole list ( rbl ) , created in 1997 , at first as a border gateway protocol ( bgp ) feed by paul vixie , and then as a dnsbl by eric ziegast as part of vixie 's mail abuse prevention system ( maps ) ; dave rand at abovenet was its first subscriber the very first version of the rbl was not published as a dnsbl , but rather a list of networks transmitted via bgp to routers owned by subscribers so that network operators could drop all tcp/ip traffic for machines used to send spam or host spam supporting services , such as a website the intent of the rbl was that sites using it would refuse traffic from sites which supported spam — whether by actively sending spam , or in other ways such effort was considered very important before blackholing all network traffic , but it also meant that spammers and spam supporting isps could delay being put on the rbl for long periods while such discussions went on later , the rbl was also released in a dnsbl form and paul vixie encouraged the authors of sendmail and other mail software to implement rbl support in their clients these allowed the mail software to query the rbl and reject mail from listed sites on a per-mail-server basis instead of blackholing all traffic soon after the advent of the rbl , others started developing their own lists with different policies this used automated testing to discover and list mail servers running as open mail relays—exploitable by spammers to carry their spam orbs was controversial at the time because many people felt running an open relay was acceptable , and that scanning the internet for open mail servers could be abusive in august 2003 , the firm osirusoft , an operator of several dnsbls including one based on the spews data set , shut down its lists after suffering weeks of near-continuous attack uri dnsbls were created when it was determined that much spam made it past spam filters during that short time frame between the first use of a spam-sending ip address and the point where that sending ip address was first listed on major sending-ip-based dnsbls in many cases , such elusive spams contain in their links domain names or ip addresses ( collectively referred to as a uris ) where that uri was already spotted in previously caught spam and where that uri is not found in non-spam e-mail therefore , when a spam filter extracts all uris from a message and checks them against a uri dnsbl , then the spam can be blocked even if the sending ip for that spam has not yet been listed on any sending ip dnsbl the spamhaus project provides the spamhaus domain block list ( dbl ) which they describe as domains '' found in spam messages '' unlike other uribls , the dbl only lists domain names , not ip addresses , since spamhaus provides other lists of ip addresses how does the dnsbl discover addresses to list ? does it use nominations submitted by users ? spam-trap addresses or honeypots ? listing lifetime in addition to the different types of listed entities ( ip addresses for traditional dnsbls , host and domain names for rhsbls , uris for uribls ) there is a wide range of semantic variations between lists as to what a listing means '' yellow '' and '' nobl '' ) are varieties that are not in widespread use and so the names themselves are not in widespread use , but should be recognized by many spam control specialists this allows for the use of rules that act ( by whatever criteria are available in the specific software ) to '' whitelist '' mail that would otherwise be rejected due to a dnsbl listing or due to other rules when an isp 's shared mailserver has one or more compromised machines sending spam , it can become listed on a dnsbl but these lists can also accidentally include static addresses , which may be legitimately used by small-business owners or other end-users to host small email servers a spam-support operation is a site that may not directly send spam , but provides commercial services for spammers , such as hosting of web sites that are advertised in spam spammers have pursued lawsuits against dnsbl operators on similar grounds : in 2003 , a newly formed corporation calling itself '' emarketersamerica '' filed suit against a number of dnsbl operators in florida court

the first dnsbl was the real-time blackhole list ( rbl ) , created in 1997 , at first as a border gateway protocol ( bgp ) feed by paul vixie , and then as a dnsbl by eric ziegast as part of vixie 's mail abuse prevention system ( maps ) ; dave rand at abovenet was its first subscriber the very first version of the rbl was not published as a dnsbl , but rather a list of networks transmitted via bgp to routers owned by subscribers so that network operators could drop all tcp/ip traffic for machines used to send spam or host spam supporting services , such as a website the intent of the rbl was that sites using it would refuse traffic from sites which supported spam — whether by actively sending spam , or in other ways these allowed the mail software to query the rbl and reject mail from listed sites on a per-mail-server basis instead of blackholing all traffic this used automated testing to discover and list mail servers running as open mail relays—exploitable by spammers to carry their spam orbs was controversial at the time because many people felt running an open relay was acceptable , and that scanning the internet for open mail servers could be abusive however , many observers believe the attacks are perpetrated by spammers in order to interfere with the dnsbls ' operation or hound them into shutting down a uniform resource identifier ( uri ) dnsbl is a dnsbl that lists the domain names and sometimes also ip addresses which are found in the '' clickable '' links contained in the body of spams , but generally not found inside legitimate messages uri dnsbls were created when it was determined that much spam made it past spam filters during that short time frame between the first use of a spam-sending ip address and the point where that sending ip address was first listed on major sending-ip-based dnsbls in many cases , such elusive spams contain in their links domain names or ip addresses ( collectively referred to as a uris ) where that uri was already spotted in previously caught spam and where that uri is not found in non-spam e-mail therefore , when a spam filter extracts all uris from a message and checks them against a uri dnsbl , then the spam can be blocked even if the sending ip for that spam has not yet been listed on any sending ip dnsbl the spamhaus project provides the spamhaus domain block list ( dbl ) which they describe as domains '' found in spam messages '' unlike other uribls , the dbl only lists domain names , not ip addresses , since spamhaus provides other lists of ip addresses a uri dnsbl lists domain names and ips found in the body of the message to operate a dnsbl requires three things : a domain to host it under , a nameserver for that domain , and a list of addresses to publish it is possible to serve a dnsbl using any general-purpose dns server software dnsbls intended for public use usually have specific , published policies as to what a listing means , and must be operated accordingly to attain or sustain public confidence how does the dnsbl discover addresses to list ? does it use nominations submitted by users ? spam-trap addresses or honeypots ? listing lifetime in addition to the different types of listed entities ( ip addresses for traditional dnsbls , host and domain names for rhsbls , uris for uribls ) there is a wide range of semantic variations between lists as to what a listing means list maintainers themselves have been divided on the issues of whether their listings should be seen as statements of objective fact or subjective opinion and on how their lists should best be used ; yellow list : a listing indicates that the source is known to produce a mixture of spam and non-spam to a degree that makes checking other dnsbls of any sort useless a spam-support operation is a site that may not directly send spam , but provides commercial services for spammers , such as hosting of web sites that are advertised in spam spammers have pursued lawsuits against dnsbl operators on similar grounds : in 2003 , a newly formed corporation calling itself '' emarketersamerica '' filed suit against a number of dnsbl operators in florida court

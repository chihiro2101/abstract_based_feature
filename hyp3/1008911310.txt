the first dnsbl was the real-time blackhole list ( rbl ) , created in 1997 , at first as a border gateway protocol ( bgp ) feed by paul vixie , and then as a dnsbl by eric ziegast as part of vixie 's mail abuse prevention system ( maps ) ; dave rand at abovenet was its first subscriber the very first version of the rbl was not published as a dnsbl , but rather a list of networks transmitted via bgp to routers owned by subscribers so that network operators could drop all tcp/ip traffic for machines used to send spam or host spam supporting services , such as a website the intent of the rbl was that sites using it would refuse traffic from sites which supported spam — whether by actively sending spam , or in other ways such effort was considered very important before blackholing all network traffic , but it also meant that spammers and spam supporting isps could delay being put on the rbl for long periods while such discussions went on later , the rbl was also released in a dnsbl form and paul vixie encouraged the authors of sendmail and other mail software to implement rbl support in their clients these allowed the mail software to query the rbl and reject mail from listed sites on a per-mail-server basis instead of blackholing all traffic this used automated testing to discover and list mail servers running as open mail relays—exploitable by spammers to carry their spam in august 2003 , the firm osirusoft , an operator of several dnsbls including one based on the spews data set , shut down its lists after suffering weeks of near-continuous attack a uniform resource identifier ( uri ) dnsbl is a dnsbl that lists the domain names and sometimes also ip addresses which are found in the '' clickable '' links contained in the body of spams , but generally not found inside legitimate messages uri dnsbls were created when it was determined that much spam made it past spam filters during that short time frame between the first use of a spam-sending ip address and the point where that sending ip address was first listed on major sending-ip-based dnsbls therefore , when a spam filter extracts all uris from a message and checks them against a uri dnsbl , then the spam can be blocked even if the sending ip for that spam has not yet been listed on any sending ip dnsbl the spamhaus project provides the spamhaus domain block list ( dbl ) which they describe as domains '' found in spam messages '' unlike other uribls , the dbl only lists domain names , not ip addresses , since spamhaus provides other lists of ip addresses a uri dnsbl lists domain names and ips found in the body of the message an rhsbl lists the domain names used in the '' from '' or '' reply-to '' e-mail address to operate a dnsbl requires three things : a domain to host it under , a nameserver for that domain , and a list of addresses to publish for the large resource consumption when using software designed as the role of a domain name server , there are role-specific software applications designed specifically for servers with a role of a dns blacklist dnsbls intended for public use usually have specific , published policies as to what a listing means , and must be operated accordingly to attain or sustain public confidence in addition to the different types of listed entities ( ip addresses for traditional dnsbls , host and domain names for rhsbls , uris for uribls ) there is a wide range of semantic variations between lists as to what a listing means '' yellow '' and '' nobl '' ) are varieties that are not in widespread use and so the names themselves are not in widespread use , but should be recognized by many spam control specialists dnsbls can be used in rule based spam analysis software like spamassassin where each dnsbl has its own rule for example , the uceprotect dnsbl seems to list ip addresses merely once they have validated a recipient address or established a tcp connection , even if no spam message is ever delivered spammers have pursued lawsuits against dnsbl operators on similar grounds : in 2003 , a newly formed corporation calling itself '' emarketersamerica '' filed suit against a number of dnsbl operators in florida court

the first dnsbl was the real-time blackhole list ( rbl ) , created in 1997 , at first as a border gateway protocol ( bgp ) feed by paul vixie , and then as a dnsbl by eric ziegast as part of vixie 's mail abuse prevention system ( maps ) ; dave rand at abovenet was its first subscriber the very first version of the rbl was not published as a dnsbl , but rather a list of networks transmitted via bgp to routers owned by subscribers so that network operators could drop all tcp/ip traffic for machines used to send spam or host spam supporting services , such as a website the intent of the rbl was that sites using it would refuse traffic from sites which supported spam — whether by actively sending spam , or in other ways before an address would be listed on the rbl , volunteers and maps staff would attempt repeatedly to contact the persons responsible for it and get its problems corrected such effort was considered very important before blackholing all network traffic , but it also meant that spammers and spam supporting isps could delay being put on the rbl for long periods while such discussions went on later , the rbl was also released in a dnsbl form and paul vixie encouraged the authors of sendmail and other mail software to implement rbl support in their clients this used automated testing to discover and list mail servers running as open mail relays—exploitable by spammers to carry their spam orbs was controversial at the time because many people felt running an open relay was acceptable , and that scanning the internet for open mail servers could be abusive in august 2003 , the firm osirusoft , an operator of several dnsbls including one based on the spews data set , shut down its lists after suffering weeks of near-continuous attack in many cases , such elusive spams contain in their links domain names or ip addresses ( collectively referred to as a uris ) where that uri was already spotted in previously caught spam and where that uri is not found in non-spam e-mail therefore , when a spam filter extracts all uris from a message and checks them against a uri dnsbl , then the spam can be blocked even if the sending ip for that spam has not yet been listed on any sending ip dnsbl of the three major uri dnsbls , the oldest and most popular is surbl the spamhaus project provides the spamhaus domain block list ( dbl ) which they describe as domains '' found in spam messages '' unlike other uribls , the dbl only lists domain names , not ip addresses , since spamhaus provides other lists of ip addresses a uri dnsbl lists domain names and ips found in the body of the message to operate a dnsbl requires three things : a domain to host it under , a nameserver for that domain , and a list of addresses to publish for the large resource consumption when using software designed as the role of a domain name server , there are role-specific software applications designed specifically for servers with a role of a dns blacklist how does the dnsbl discover addresses to list ? does it use nominations submitted by users ? spam-trap addresses or honeypots ? listing lifetime depending on the specific mta , there can be subtle distinctions in configuration that make list types such as yellow and nobl useful or pointless because of how the mta handles multiple dnsbls a technique developed by junk email filter uses yellow lists and nobl lists to mitigate the false positives that occur routinely when using black lists that are not carefully maintained to avoid them in may 2016 , the sorbs system was blocking the smtp servers of telstra australia , australia 's largest internet service provider a spam-support operation is a site that may not directly send spam , but provides commercial services for spammers , such as hosting of web sites that are advertised in spam spammers have pursued lawsuits against dnsbl operators on similar grounds : in 2003 , a newly formed corporation calling itself '' emarketersamerica '' filed suit against a number of dnsbl operators in florida court

the first dnsbl was the real-time blackhole list ( rbl ) , created in 1997 , at first as a border gateway protocol ( bgp ) feed by paul vixie , and then as a dnsbl by eric ziegast as part of vixie 's mail abuse prevention system ( maps ) ; dave rand at abovenet was its first subscriber the very first version of the rbl was not published as a dnsbl , but rather a list of networks transmitted via bgp to routers owned by subscribers so that network operators could drop all tcp/ip traffic for machines used to send spam or host spam supporting services , such as a website the intent of the rbl was that sites using it would refuse traffic from sites which supported spam — whether by actively sending spam , or in other ways later , the rbl was also released in a dnsbl form and paul vixie encouraged the authors of sendmail and other mail software to implement rbl support in their clients these allowed the mail software to query the rbl and reject mail from listed sites on a per-mail-server basis instead of blackholing all traffic this used automated testing to discover and list mail servers running as open mail relays—exploitable by spammers to carry their spam orbs was controversial at the time because many people felt running an open relay was acceptable , and that scanning the internet for open mail servers could be abusive in august 2003 , the firm osirusoft , an operator of several dnsbls including one based on the spews data set , shut down its lists after suffering weeks of near-continuous attack a uniform resource identifier ( uri ) dnsbl is a dnsbl that lists the domain names and sometimes also ip addresses which are found in the '' clickable '' links contained in the body of spams , but generally not found inside legitimate messages uri dnsbls were created when it was determined that much spam made it past spam filters during that short time frame between the first use of a spam-sending ip address and the point where that sending ip address was first listed on major sending-ip-based dnsbls in many cases , such elusive spams contain in their links domain names or ip addresses ( collectively referred to as a uris ) where that uri was already spotted in previously caught spam and where that uri is not found in non-spam e-mail therefore , when a spam filter extracts all uris from a message and checks them against a uri dnsbl , then the spam can be blocked even if the sending ip for that spam has not yet been listed on any sending ip dnsbl unlike other uribls , the dbl only lists domain names , not ip addresses , since spamhaus provides other lists of ip addresses a uri dnsbl lists domain names and ips found in the body of the message an rhsbl lists the domain names used in the '' from '' or '' reply-to '' e-mail address to operate a dnsbl requires three things : a domain to host it under , a nameserver for that domain , and a list of addresses to publish however this is typically inefficient for zones containing large numbers of addresses , particularly dnsbls which list entire classless inter-domain routing netblocks for the large resource consumption when using software designed as the role of a domain name server , there are role-specific software applications designed specifically for servers with a role of a dns blacklist the domain name to query is prepended to the dns list host as follows : example.net.dnslist.example.com where dnslist.example.com is the dns list host and example.net is the queried domain one way to do this is to first check white lists and accept the message if the source is on a white list , bypassing all other testing mechanisms this type of dnsbl lists ip addresses submitted by isps as dynamic and therefore presumably unsuitable to send email directly ; the end-user is supposed to use the isp 's mailserver for all sending of email for example , the uceprotect dnsbl seems to list ip addresses merely once they have validated a recipient address or established a tcp connection , even if no spam message is ever delivered spammers have pursued lawsuits against dnsbl operators on similar grounds : in 2003 , a newly formed corporation calling itself '' emarketersamerica '' filed suit against a number of dnsbl operators in florida court

the very first version of the rbl was not published as a dnsbl , but rather a list of networks transmitted via bgp to routers owned by subscribers so that network operators could drop all tcp/ip traffic for machines used to send spam or host spam supporting services , such as a website the intent of the rbl was that sites using it would refuse traffic from sites which supported spam — whether by actively sending spam , or in other ways such effort was considered very important before blackholing all network traffic , but it also meant that spammers and spam supporting isps could delay being put on the rbl for long periods while such discussions went on later , the rbl was also released in a dnsbl form and paul vixie encouraged the authors of sendmail and other mail software to implement rbl support in their clients these allowed the mail software to query the rbl and reject mail from listed sites on a per-mail-server basis instead of blackholing all traffic soon after the advent of the rbl , others started developing their own lists with different policies this used automated testing to discover and list mail servers running as open mail relays—exploitable by spammers to carry their spam orbs was controversial at the time because many people felt running an open relay was acceptable , and that scanning the internet for open mail servers could be abusive a uniform resource identifier ( uri ) dnsbl is a dnsbl that lists the domain names and sometimes also ip addresses which are found in the '' clickable '' links contained in the body of spams , but generally not found inside legitimate messages uri dnsbls were created when it was determined that much spam made it past spam filters during that short time frame between the first use of a spam-sending ip address and the point where that sending ip address was first listed on major sending-ip-based dnsbls in many cases , such elusive spams contain in their links domain names or ip addresses ( collectively referred to as a uris ) where that uri was already spotted in previously caught spam and where that uri is not found in non-spam e-mail therefore , when a spam filter extracts all uris from a message and checks them against a uri dnsbl , then the spam can be blocked even if the sending ip for that spam has not yet been listed on any sending ip dnsbl the spamhaus project provides the spamhaus domain block list ( dbl ) which they describe as domains '' found in spam messages '' unlike other uribls , the dbl only lists domain names , not ip addresses , since spamhaus provides other lists of ip addresses a uri dnsbl lists domain names and ips found in the body of the message to operate a dnsbl requires three things : a domain to host it under , a nameserver for that domain , and a list of addresses to publish for the large resource consumption when using software designed as the role of a domain name server , there are role-specific software applications designed specifically for servers with a role of a dns blacklist look up this name in the dns as a domain name ( '' a '' record ) in addition to the different types of listed entities ( ip addresses for traditional dnsbls , host and domain names for rhsbls , uris for uribls ) there is a wide range of semantic variations between lists as to what a listing means a drawback of using the direct dnsbl support in most mtas is that sources not on any list require checking all of the dnsbls being used with relatively little utility to caching the negative results a spam-support operation is a site that may not directly send spam , but provides commercial services for spammers , such as hosting of web sites that are advertised in spam because lists have varying methods for adding ip addresses and/or uris , it can be difficult for senders to configure their systems appropriately to avoid becoming listed on a dnsbl for example , the uceprotect dnsbl seems to list ip addresses merely once they have validated a recipient address or established a tcp connection , even if no spam message is ever delivered

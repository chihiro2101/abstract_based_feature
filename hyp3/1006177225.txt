in ancient times , the najd was settled by numerous tribes like the kindah , tayy , and many others led by usma bin luai , the tayy sacked the mountains of aja and samra from banu tamim in northern arabia in their exodus from yemen circa ce 115 the tayy shammaris became nomadic camel herders and horse breeders in northern najd for centuries with a sedentary faction ruling the tribal league from within their capital city of hail in the 5th century ad , the tribes of north arabia became a major threat to the trade line between yemen and syria the ḥimyarites of sheba decided to establish a vassal state that controlled central and north arabia the kindah established a kingdom in najd in central arabia unlike the organized states of yemen ; its kings exercised an influence over a number of associated tribes more by personal prestige than by coercive settled authority their first capital was qaryat dhāt kāhil , today known as qaryat al-fāw the ghassanids , lakhmids and kindah were all kahlani and qaḥṭānī vassal kingdoms appointed by the byzantines , persians and ḥimyarites to protect their borders and imperial interests from the raids of the then-rising threat of the 'adnānī tribes al-ḥārith ibn 'amr , the most famous of their kings , finally succeeded in capturing the lakhmid capital of al-ḥirah in southern modern-day iraq later however in about 529 , al-mundhir recaptured the city and put king ḥārith and about fifty members of his family to death in 540 , the lakhmids destroyed all the kindite settlements in nejd , forcing the majority of them to move to yemen after muhammad received intelligence about the caravan 's route , muhammad ordered zayd ibn haritha to go after the caravan , and they successfully raided it and captured 100,000 dirhams worth of booty some scholars say the expedition of dhat al-riqa took place in nejd as part of this invasion banu asad ibn khuzaymah tribe ( not to be confused with the banu asad tribe ) , were the residents of katan , in the vicinity of fayd , was a powerful tribe connected with the quraysh so he dispatched a force of 150 men under the leadership of abu salama ` abd allah ibn ` abd al-asad to make a sudden attack on this tribe other arabic tribes also wished to revert to exit from islam to local leadership and split from medina 's control in some places , people claiming prophethood started to establish leaderships to oppose medina , e.g when abu bakr was informed of the meeting , he , umar , abu ubaidah ibn al-jarrah and a few others rushed to prevent the ansar from making a premature decision during the meeting umar declared that abu bakr should be the new leader , and declared his allegiance to abu bakr , followed by abu ubaidah ibn al-jarrah , and thus abu bakr became the first caliph at najd , malik ibn nuweira led the tribes of banu tamim against the authority of medina nothing could be done about the tribes of bani assad and banu ghatafan , which stood solidly behind tulayha , but the tayy were not so staunch in their support of tulayha , and their chief , adi ibn hatim , was a devout muslim here again , adi ibn hatim offered his services to persuade the tribe to submit without bloodshed house , rawalpindi ( 1970 ) several tribes submitted to the caliph after khalid 's decisive victories moving south from buzakha , khalid reached naqra in october , with an army now 6000 strong , and defeated the rebel tribe of banu saleem in the battle of naqra afterwards , he moved to najd against the rebel tribe of banu tamim and their sheikh malik ibn nuwayrah his riders were stopped by khalid 's army at the town of buttah malik avoided direct contact with khalid 's army and ordered his followers to scatter , and he and his family apparently moved away across the desert 2 , page no : 5 ) khalid bin walid killed malik ibn nuwayra with ikrimah on the horizon , musaylima would remain in expectation of a muslim attack , and thus not be able to leave his base with musaylima so committed , khalid would be free to deal with the apostate tribes of north-central arabia without interference from yamamah meanwhile , abu bakr sent shurhabil 's corps to reinforce ikrama at yamamah meanwhile , abu bakr sent orders to khalid to march against musaylima shurhabil 's corps , that was stationed at yamamah , was to reinforce khalid 's corps in addition to this abu bakr assembled a fresh army of ansar and muhajireen in medina that joined khalid 's corps at butah khalid established his headquarters at yamamah , from where he despatched columns to all over the plain of aqraba to subdue the region around yamamah and to kill or capture all who resisted the most prominent among these provinces are al-'aridh , which includes riyadh and the historical saudi capital of diriyah ; al-qassim , with its capital in buraidah ; sudair , centered on al majma'ah ; al-washm , centered on shaqraa ; and jebel shammar , with its capital , ha'il prior to the formation of the modern kingdom of saudi arabia , the native population arabs , who were either nomads ( bedouins ) , or sedentary farmers and merchants since the formation of modern saudi arabia , najd , and particularly riyadh , has seen an influx of immigrants from all regions of the country and from virtually every social class the native najdi population has also largely moved away from its native towns and villages to the capital , riyadh indeed , not even the ancient south arabian language appears to have been widely spoken in najd in ancient times , unlike southern saudi arabia , for example bahiyyih nakhjavani ’ s first novel the saddlebag – a fable for doubters and seekers describes events set in the najd plateau along the hajj route between mecca and medina in 1844–1845

thumb jodrell bank was first used for academic purposes in 1939 when the university of manchester 's department of botany purchased three fields from the leighs the site was extended in 1952 by the purchase of a farm from george massey on which the lovell telescope was built lovell , the story of jodrell bank , p 110 gunn , 2005 he intended to use the equipment in manchester , but electrical interference from the trams on oxford road prevented him from doing so lovell , the story of jodrell bank , p 3 lovell 's main research was transient radio echoes , which he confirmed were from ionized meteor trails by october 1946 lovell , the story of jodrell bank , p the first time lovell turned the radar on – 14 december 1945 – the geminids meteor shower was at a maximum over the next few years , lovell accumulated more ex-military radio hardware , including a portable cabin , known as a '' park royal '' in the military ( see park royal vehicles ) jodrell bank is primarily used for investigating radio waves from the planets and stars a searchlight was loaned to jodrell bank in 1946 by the army ; lovell , the story of jodrell bank , p the telescope was then used to determine the radiant points for meteors lovell , the story of jodrell bank , p the transit telescope was a parabolic reflector zenith telescope built in 1947 the telescope mainly looked directly upwards , but the direction of the beam could be changed by small amounts by tilting the mast to change the position of the focal point the telescope was replaced by the steerable lovell telescope and the mark ii telescope was subsequently built at the same location the telescope could map a ± 15-degree strip around the zenith at 72 and 160 & nbsp ; mhz , with a resolution at 160 & nbsp ; mhz of 1 degree lovell , the story of jodrell bank , p lovell , the story of jodrell bank , p the telescope sent commands to the probe , including those to separate it from its carrier rocket and turn on its more powerful transmitter when the probe was eight million miles away 272 in february 1966 , jodrell bank was asked by the soviet union to track its unmanned moon lander luna 9 and recorded on its fax transmission of photographs from the moon 's surface as well as operating as a standalone telescope , it has been used as an interferometer with the lovell telescope , and is now primarily used as part of the merlin project the mark iii telescope , the same size as the mark ii , was constructed to be transportable palmer and rowson ( 1968 ) but it was never moved from wardle , near nantwich , where it was used as part of merlin the concept of this proposal was for a telescope on a railway line adjoining jodrell bank , but concerns about future levels of interference meant that a site in wales would have been preferable design proposals by husband and co and freeman fox , who had designed the parkes observatory telescope were put forward a 50 & nbsp ; ft ( 15 & nbsp ; m ) alt-azimuth dish was constructed in 1964 for astronomical research and to track the zond 1 , zond 2 , ranger 6 and ranger 7 space probes and apollo 11 an reflecting optical telescope was donated to the observatory in 1951 pullan , a history of the university of manchester 1951–73 , p garrett also has overall responsibility for jodrell bank observatory receivers were also designed at jodrell bank for the parkes telescope in australia asbestos in the visitors ' centre buildings led to its demolition in 2003 leaving a remnant of its far end jodrell bank was also featured heavily in the 1983 music video secret messages by electric light orchestra and also are we ourselves by the fixx since 13 july 1988 the lovell telescope has been designated as a grade i listed building on 10 july 2017 the mark ii telescope was also designated at the same grade

first attested in english in 1380 , the word coffin derives from the old french , from latin , which means basket , which is the latinisation of the greek κόφινος ( kophinos ) , basket the earliest attested form of the word is the mycenaean greek ko-pi-na , written in linear b syllabic script any box in which the dead are buried is a coffin , and while a casket was originally regarded as a box for jewelry , use of the word '' casket '' in this sense began as a euphemism introduced by the undertaker 's trade a distinction is commonly drawn between '' coffins '' and '' caskets '' , using '' coffin '' to refer to a tapered hexagonal or octagonal ( also considered to be anthropoidal in shape ) box and '' casket '' to refer to a rectangle box , often with a split lid used for viewing the deceased as seen in the picture the earliest evidence of wooden coffin remains , dated at 5000 bc , was found in the tomb 4 at beishouling , shaanxi the banpo coffin belongs to a four-year-old girl ; it measures 1.4 & nbsp ; m ( 4.6 & nbsp ; ft ) by 0.55 & nbsp ; m ( 1.8 & nbsp ; ft ) and 3–9 & nbsp ; cm thick the thickness of the coffin , as determined by the number of timber frames in its composition , also emphasized the level of nobility , as mentioned in the classic of rites , legge ( 2004 ) , 525 a coffin may be buried in the ground directly , placed in a burial vault or cremated some countries practice one form almost exclusively , whereas in others it may depend on the individual cemetery in part of sumatra , indonesia , ancestors are revered and bodies were often kept in coffins kept alongside the longhouses until a ritual burial could be performed in judaism , the coffin must be plain , made of wood and contain no metal parts or adornments in china and japan , coffins made from the scented , decay-resistant wood of cypress , sugi , thuja and incense-cedar are in high demand certain aboriginal australian groups use intricately decorated tree-bark cylinders sewn with fibre and sealed with adhesive as coffins another form of four-sided coffin is trapezoidal ( also known as the '' wedge '' form ) and is considered a variant of the six-sided hexagonal kind of coffin the rectangular form , and also the trapezoidal form , is still regularly used in germany , austria , hungary and other parts of eastern and central europe , with the lid sometimes made to slope gently from the head down towards the foot coffins in the uk are mainly similar to the hexagonal design , but with one-piece sides , curved at the shoulder instead of having a join for example , some may offer a protective casket that uses a gasket to seal the casket shut after it is closed for the final time a burial vault serves as an outer enclosure for buried remains and the coffin serves as an inner enclosure the primary purpose of the vault is to prevent collapse of the coffin due to the weight of the soil above an airtight coffin , for example , fosters decomposition by anaerobic bacteria , which results in a putrefied liquefaction of the body , and all putrefied tissue remains inside the container , only to be exposed in the event of an exhumation a container that allows air to pass in and out , such as a simple wooden box , allows for clean skeletonization other coffins are left deliberately blank so that friends and family can inscribe final wishes and thoughts upon them to the deceased so the figurative coffins , rather than constituting a new art form as it was long believed , were developed from the figurative palanquins which had existed already a long time at the end of the services the inner box is removed and the deceased is cremated inside this box in modern times coffins are almost always mass-produced bier cenotaph coffin plate count dracula count duckula hanging coffins ossuary treetrunk coffin vampire

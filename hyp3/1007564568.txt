lignin was first mentioned in 1813 by the swiss botanist a de candolle , who described it as a fibrous , tasteless material , insoluble in water and alcohol but soluble in weak alkaline solutions , and which can be precipitated from solution using acid lignin constitutes 30 % of non-fossil organic carbon and 20 to 35 % of the dry mass of wood lignin is present in red algae , which suggest that the common ancestor of plants and red algae also synthesised lignin this finding also suggests that the original function of lignin was structural as it plays this role in the red alga calliarthron , where it supports joints between calcified segments lignin is highly heterogeneous polymer derived from a handful of precursor lignols that crosslink in diverse ways the aryl substituent on these three monomers are sometimes called guaiacyl , syringyl , and 4-hydroxyphenyl from respectively coniferyl , sinapyl , and paracoumaryl alcohols the polysaccharide components of plant cell walls are highly hydrophilic and thus permeable to water , whereas lignin is more hydrophobic the crosslinking of polysaccharides by lignin is an obstacle for water absorption to the cell wall thus , lignin makes it possible for the plant 's vascular tissue to conduct water efficiently lignin is present in all vascular plants , but not in bryophytes , supporting the idea that the original function of lignin was restricted to water transport finally , in terms of its other functions , lignin confers disease resistance global commercial production of lignin is a consequence of papermaking much of this paper was delignified ; lignin comprises about 1/3 of the mass of lignocellulose , the precursor to paper it can thus be seen that lignin is handled on a very large scale mechanical , or high-yield pulp , which is used to make newsprint , still contains most of the lignin originally present in the wood in sulfite process , lignin is removed from wood pulp as lignosulfonates , for which many applications have been proposed they are used as dispersants , humectants , emulsion stabilizers , and sequestrants ( water treatment ) lignin peroxidases oxidize non-phenolic lignin , whereas manganese peroxidases only oxidize the phenolic structures in contrast to fungi , most bacterial enzymes involved in lignin degradation are intracellular , including two classes of dyp and most bacterial laccases the conventional method for lignin quantitation in the pulp industry is the klason lignin and acid-soluble lignin test , which is standardized procedures a solution of hydrochloric acid and phloroglucinol is used for the detection of lignin ( wiesner test )

de candolle , who described it as a fibrous , tasteless material , insoluble in water and alcohol but soluble in weak alkaline solutions , and which can be precipitated from solution using acid it is one of the most abundant organic polymers on earth , exceeded only by cellulose lignin constitutes 30 % of non-fossil organic carbon and 20 to 35 % of the dry mass of wood lignin is present in red algae , which suggest that the common ancestor of plants and red algae also synthesised lignin this finding also suggests that the original function of lignin was structural as it plays this role in the red alga calliarthron , where it supports joints between calcified segments all lignins contain small amounts of incomplete or modified monolignols , and other monomers are prominent in non-woody plants lignin fills the spaces in the cell wall between cellulose , hemicellulose , and pectin components , especially in vascular and support tissues : xylem tracheids , vessel elements and sclereid cells lignin plays a crucial part in conducting water and aqueous nutrients in plant stems the polysaccharide components of plant cell walls are highly hydrophilic and thus permeable to water , whereas lignin is more hydrophobic the crosslinking of polysaccharides by lignin is an obstacle for water absorption to the cell wall lignin is present in all vascular plants , but not in bryophytes , supporting the idea that the original function of lignin was restricted to water transport it is covalently linked to hemicellulose and therefore cross-links different plant polysaccharides , conferring mechanical strength to the cell wall and by extension the plant as a whole its most commonly noted function is the support through strengthening of wood ( mainly composed of xylem cells and lignified sclerenchyma fibres ) in vascular plants only a fraction is used in a wide range of low volume applications where the form but not the quality is important mechanical , or high-yield pulp , which is used to make newsprint , still contains most of the lignin originally present in the wood in sulfite process , lignin is removed from wood pulp as lignosulfonates , for which many applications have been proposed lignin removed by the kraft process is usually burned for its fuel value , providing energy to power the mill lignin peroxidases oxidize non-phenolic lignin , whereas manganese peroxidases only oxidize the phenolic structures an important aspect of fungal lignin degradation is the activity of accessory enzymes to produce the h 2 o 2 required for the function of lignin peroxidase and other heme peroxidases leaf litter ) can enter waterways and leach dissolved organic carbon rich in lignin , cellulose , and hemicellulose in cooking , lignin in the form of hardwood is an important source of these two compounds , which impart the characteristic aroma and taste to smoked foods such as barbecue owing to the structural complexity of lignins , the spectra are poorly resolved and quantitation is challenging

it is one of the most abundant organic polymers on earth , exceeded only by cellulose lignin constitutes 30 % of non-fossil organic carbon and 20 to 35 % of the dry mass of wood lignin is present in red algae , which suggest that the common ancestor of plants and red algae also synthesised lignin this finding also suggests that the original function of lignin was structural as it plays this role in the red alga calliarthron , where it supports joints between calcified segments broadly speaking : hardwoods are rich in coniferyl and sinapyl units softwoods are rich in coniferyl units grasses are rich in coniferyl and sinapyl units lignin 's molecular masses exceed 10,000 u all lignins contain small amounts of incomplete or modified monolignols , and other monomers are prominent in non-woody plants lignin fills the spaces in the cell wall between cellulose , hemicellulose , and pectin components , especially in vascular and support tissues : xylem tracheids , vessel elements and sclereid cells lignin plays a crucial part in conducting water and aqueous nutrients in plant stems the polysaccharide components of plant cell walls are highly hydrophilic and thus permeable to water , whereas lignin is more hydrophobic the crosslinking of polysaccharides by lignin is an obstacle for water absorption to the cell wall thus , lignin makes it possible for the plant 's vascular tissue to conduct water efficiently lignin is present in all vascular plants , but not in bryophytes , supporting the idea that the original function of lignin was restricted to water transport its most commonly noted function is the support through strengthening of wood ( mainly composed of xylem cells and lignified sclerenchyma fibres ) in vascular plants in such mills , using the kraft or the sulfite process , lignin is removed from lignocellulose to yield pulp for papermaking mechanical , or high-yield pulp , which is used to make newsprint , still contains most of the lignin originally present in the wood in sulfite process , lignin is removed from wood pulp as lignosulfonates , for which many applications have been proposed higher quality lignin presents the potential to become a renewable source of aromatic compounds for the chemical industry , with an addressable market of more than 130bn many fungal laccases are also secreted , which facilitate degradation of phenolic lignin-derived compounds , although several intracellular fungal laccases have also been described bacteria lack most of the enzymes employed in fungal lignin degradation , yet bacterial degradation can be quite extensive the conventional method for lignin quantitation in the pulp industry is the klason lignin and acid-soluble lignin test , which is standardized procedures lignin production and detection in wood owing to the structural complexity of lignins , the spectra are poorly resolved and quantitation is challenging

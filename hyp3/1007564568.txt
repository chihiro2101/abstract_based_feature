lignin constitutes 30 % of non-fossil organic carbon and 20 to 35 % of the dry mass of wood lignin is present in red algae , which suggest that the common ancestor of plants and red algae also synthesised lignin this finding also suggests that the original function of lignin was structural as it plays this role in the red alga calliarthron , where it supports joints between calcified segments lignin is highly heterogeneous polymer derived from a handful of precursor lignols that crosslink in diverse ways lignin fills the spaces in the cell wall between cellulose , hemicellulose , and pectin components , especially in vascular and support tissues : xylem tracheids , vessel elements and sclereid cells lignin plays a crucial part in conducting water and aqueous nutrients in plant stems the polysaccharide components of plant cell walls are highly hydrophilic and thus permeable to water , whereas lignin is more hydrophobic the crosslinking of polysaccharides by lignin is an obstacle for water absorption to the cell wall thus , lignin makes it possible for the plant 's vascular tissue to conduct water efficiently lignin is present in all vascular plants , but not in bryophytes , supporting the idea that the original function of lignin was restricted to water transport only a fraction is used in a wide range of low volume applications where the form but not the quality is important mechanical , or high-yield pulp , which is used to make newsprint , still contains most of the lignin originally present in the wood this lignin is responsible for newsprint 's yellowing with age in sulfite process , lignin is removed from wood pulp as lignosulfonates , for which many applications have been proposed higher quality lignin presents the potential to become a renewable source of aromatic compounds for the chemical industry , with an addressable market of more than 130bn because it is cross-linked with the other cell wall components , lignin minimizes the accessibility of cellulose and hemicellulose to microbial enzymes , leading to a reduced digestibility of biomass an important aspect of fungal lignin degradation is the activity of accessory enzymes to produce the h 2 o 2 required for the function of lignin peroxidase and other heme peroxidases in contrast to fungi , most bacterial enzymes involved in lignin degradation are intracellular , including two classes of dyp and most bacterial laccases bacterial degradation of lignin is particularly relevant in aquatic systems such as lakes , rivers , and streams , where inputs of terrestrial material ( e.g pyrolysis of lignin during the combustion of wood or charcoal production yields a range of products , of which the most characteristic ones are methoxy-substituted phenols in cooking , lignin in the form of hardwood is an important source of these two compounds , which impart the characteristic aroma and taste to smoked foods such as barbecue lignin production and detection in wood

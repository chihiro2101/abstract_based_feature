he named the substance “ lignine ” , which is derived from the latin word lignum , meaning wood it is one of the most abundant organic polymers on earth , exceeded only by cellulose lignin constitutes 30 % of non-fossil organic carbon and 20 to 35 % of the dry mass of wood lignin is present in red algae , which suggest that the common ancestor of plants and red algae also synthesised lignin this finding also suggests that the original function of lignin was structural as it plays this role in the red alga calliarthron , where it supports joints between calcified segments the aryl substituent on these three monomers are sometimes called guaiacyl , syringyl , and 4-hydroxyphenyl from respectively coniferyl , sinapyl , and paracoumaryl alcohols different types of lignin have been described depending on the means of isolation all lignins contain small amounts of incomplete or modified monolignols , and other monomers are prominent in non-woody plants lignin fills the spaces in the cell wall between cellulose , hemicellulose , and pectin components , especially in vascular and support tissues : xylem tracheids , vessel elements and sclereid cells the polysaccharide components of plant cell walls are highly hydrophilic and thus permeable to water , whereas lignin is more hydrophobic the crosslinking of polysaccharides by lignin is an obstacle for water absorption to the cell wall thus , lignin makes it possible for the plant 's vascular tissue to conduct water efficiently lignin is present in all vascular plants , but not in bryophytes , supporting the idea that the original function of lignin was restricted to water transport its most commonly noted function is the support through strengthening of wood ( mainly composed of xylem cells and lignified sclerenchyma fibres ) in vascular plants only a fraction is used in a wide range of low volume applications where the form but not the quality is important two commercial processes exist to remove lignin from black liquor for higher value uses : lignoboost ( sweden ) and lignoforce ( canada ) both peroxidase and laccase enzymes are present in the plant cell walls , and it is not known whether one or both of these groups participates in the polymerisation the oxidative enzyme catalyses the formation of monolignol radicals these radicals are often said to undergo uncatalyzed coupling to form the lignin polymer these compounds are produced by thermal breakdown of lignin in the wood used in the smokehouse the conventional method for lignin quantitation in the pulp industry is the klason lignin and acid-soluble lignin test , which is standardized procedures owing to the structural complexity of lignins , the spectra are poorly resolved and quantitation is challenging

up on the principles of rousseau after the reign of terror in france ( 1793–1794 ) , constant became an advocate of bicameralism and of an assembly like the parliament of great britain in revolutionary france this strand of political thought resulted in the constitution of the year iii , the council of five hundred and the council of ancients in 1799 , after 18 brumaire , constant was reluctantly appointed , on the insistence of abbe sieyes , by napoleon bonaparte to the tribunat , despite grave reservations on the latter 's part eventually , in 1802 , the first consul confirmed in

( 1797–1838 ) , who later married victor de broglie ( 1785–1870 ) constant died in paris on 8 december 1830 and was buried in the pere la chaise cemetery one of the first thinkers to go by the name of '' liberal '' , constant looked to britain rather than to ancient rome for a practical model of freedom in a large mercantile society he drew a distinction between the '' liberty of the ancients '' and the '' liberty of the moderns '' the liberty of the ancients was a participatory republican liberty , which gave the citizens the right to influence politics directly through debates and votes in the public assembly ancient liberty was also limited to relatively small and homogenous male societies , in which they could be conveniently gathered together in one place to transact public affairs the liberty of the moderns , in contrast , was based on the possession of civil liberties , the rule of law , and freedom from excessive state interference instead , the voters would elect legislator , who would deliberate in parliament on behalf of the people and would save citizens from daily political involvement he stated how the french attempted to apply ancient republican liberties to a modern state constant emphasised how citizens in ancient states found more satisfaction in the public sphere and less in their private lives whereas modern people favoured their private life these writers , influential in the french revolution , according to constant , mistook authority for liberty and approved any means of extending the action of the state he continually condemned despotism , citing the contradiction of a liberty derived from despotism , and the vacuous nature of this ideology in françois furet 's words , constant 's '' entire political thought '' revolved around this question , namely the problem of how to justify the terror thus , although often ignored in france , because of his anglo-saxon sympathies , constant succeeded in contributing in a profound ( albeit indirect ) way to french constitutional traditions in constant 's scheme , the executive power would be entrusted to a council of ministers ( or cabinet ) who , although appointed by the king , were ultimately accountable to parliament as a young man , constant became acquainted with a literary friend of his uncle , david-louis constant de rebecque isabelle de charrière et benjamin constant paris

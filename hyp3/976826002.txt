history and origin of the ideal class group ideal class groups ( or , rather , what were effectively ideal class groups ) were studied some time before the idea of an ideal was formulated , the fundamental theorem of arithmetic , to hold in the rings generated by those roots of unity was a major obstacle we now recognise this as part of the ideal class group : in fact kummer had isolated the p-torsion in that group for the field of p-roots of unity , for any prime number p , as the reason for the failure of the standard method of attack on the fermat problem ( see regular prime ) the size of the ideal class group can be considered as a measure for the deviation of a ring from being a principal ideal domain ; a ring is a principal domain if and only if it has a trivial ideal class group ideal classes can be multiplied : if i denotes the equivalence class of the ideal i , then the multiplication ij ij is well-defined and commutative the principal ideals form the ideal class r which serves as an identity element for this multiplication however , if r is the ring of algebraic integers in an algebraic number field , or more generally a dedekind domain , the multiplication defined above turns the set of fractional ideal classes into an abelian group , the ideal class group of r the group property of existence of inverse elements follows easily from the fact that , in a dedekind domain , every non-zero ideal ( except r ) is a product of prime ideals in fact , every abelian group is isomorphic to the ideal class group of some dedekind domain it was remarked above that the ideal class group provides part of the answer to the question of how much ideals in a dedekind domain behave like elements this is a group homomorphism ; its kernel is the group of units of r , and its cokernel is the ideal class group of r for d 0 , the ideal class group may be half the size since the class group of integral binary quadratic forms is isomorphic to the narrow class group of q the hilbert class field l of a number field k is unique and has the following properties : every ideal of the ring of integers of k becomes principal in l , i.e

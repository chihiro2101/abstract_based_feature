history and origin of the ideal class group ideal class groups ( or , rather , what were effectively ideal class groups ) were studied some time before the idea of an ideal was formulated these groups appeared in the theory of quadratic forms : in the case of binary integral quadratic forms , as put into something like a final form by gauss , a composition law was defined on certain equivalence classes of forms we now recognise this as part of the ideal class group : in fact kummer had isolated the p-torsion in that group for the field of p-roots of unity , for any prime number p , as the reason for the failure of the standard method of attack on the fermat problem ( see regular prime ) somewhat later again dedekind formulated the concept of ideal , kummer having worked in a different way it was shown that while rings of algebraic integers do not always have unique factorization into primes ( because they need not be principal ideal domains ) , they do have the property that every proper ideal admits a unique factorization as a product of prime ideals ( that is , every ring of algebraic integers is a dedekind domain ) the size of the ideal class group can be considered as a measure for the deviation of a ring from being a principal ideal domain ; a ring is a principal domain if and only if it has a trivial ideal class group however , if r is the ring of algebraic integers in an algebraic number field , or more generally a dedekind domain , the multiplication defined above turns the set of fractional ideal classes into an abelian group , the ideal class group of r the group property of existence of inverse elements follows easily from the fact that , in a dedekind domain , every non-zero ideal ( except r ) is a product of prime ideals in fact , every abelian group is isomorphic to the ideal class group of some dedekind domain a square root of & minus ; 1 ) , are all principal ideal domains ( and in fact are all euclidean domains ) , and so have class number 1 : that is , they have trivial ideal class groups however , it is not even known if there are infinitely many number fields with class number 1 for d 0 , the ideal class group may be half the size since the class group of integral binary quadratic forms is isomorphic to the narrow class group of q the hilbert class field l of a number field k is unique and has the following properties : every ideal of the ring of integers of k becomes principal in l , i.e

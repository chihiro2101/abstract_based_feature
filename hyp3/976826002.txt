history and origin of the ideal class group ideal class groups ( or , rather , what were effectively ideal class groups ) were studied some time before the idea of an ideal was formulated it had been realised ( probably by several people ) that failure to complete proofs in the general case of fermat 's last theorem by factorisation using the roots of unity was for a very good reason : a failure of unique factorization , i.e it was shown that while rings of algebraic integers do not always have unique factorization into primes ( because they need not be principal ideal domains ) , they do have the property that every proper ideal admits a unique factorization as a product of prime ideals ( that is , every ring of algebraic integers is a dedekind domain ) the size of the ideal class group can be considered as a measure for the deviation of a ring from being a principal ideal domain ; a ring is a principal domain if and only if it has a trivial ideal class group however , if r is the ring of algebraic integers in an algebraic number field , or more generally a dedekind domain , the multiplication defined above turns the set of fractional ideal classes into an abelian group , the ideal class group of r the ideal class group is trivial ( i.e in this sense , the ideal class group measures how far r is from being a principal ideal domain , and hence from satisfying unique prime factorization ( dedekind domains are unique factorization domains if and only if they are principal ideal domains ) in fact , every abelian group is isomorphic to the ideal class group of some dedekind domain computation of the class group is hard , in general ; it can be done by hand for the ring of integers in an algebraic number field of small discriminant , using minkowski 's bound a square root of & minus ; 1 ) , are all principal ideal domains ( and in fact are all euclidean domains ) , and so have class number 1 : that is , they have trivial ideal class groups for d 0 , the ideal class group may be half the size since the class group of integral binary quadratic forms is isomorphic to the narrow class group of q one also computes that j 2 ( 2 ) , which is principal , so the class of j in the ideal class group has order two l is a galois extension of k with galois group isomorphic to the ideal class group of k

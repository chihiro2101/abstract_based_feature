ideal class groups ( or , rather , what were effectively ideal class groups ) were studied some time before the idea of an ideal was formulated we now recognise this as part of the ideal class group : in fact kummer had isolated the p-torsion in that group for the field of p-roots of unity , for any prime number p , as the reason for the failure of the standard method of attack on the fermat problem ( see regular prime ) the size of the ideal class group can be considered as a measure for the deviation of a ring from being a principal ideal domain ; a ring is a principal domain if and only if it has a trivial ideal class group ideal classes can be multiplied : if i denotes the equivalence class of the ideal i , then the multiplication ij ij is well-defined and commutative however , if r is the ring of algebraic integers in an algebraic number field , or more generally a dedekind domain , the multiplication defined above turns the set of fractional ideal classes into an abelian group , the ideal class group of r the group property of existence of inverse elements follows easily from the fact that , in a dedekind domain , every non-zero ideal ( except r ) is a product of prime ideals in this sense , the ideal class group measures how far r is from being a principal ideal domain , and hence from satisfying unique prime factorization ( dedekind domains are unique factorization domains if and only if they are principal ideal domains ) computation of the class group is hard , in general ; it can be done by hand for the ring of integers in an algebraic number field of small discriminant , using minkowski 's bound the mapping from rings of integers r to their corresponding class groups is functorial , and the class group can be subsumed under the heading of algebraic k-theory , with k 0 ( r ) being the functor assigning to r its ideal class group ; more precisely , k 0 ( r ) z & times ; c ( r ) , where c ( r ) is the class group this is a group homomorphism ; its kernel is the group of units of r , and its cokernel is the ideal class group of r a square root of & minus ; 1 ) , are all principal ideal domains ( and in fact are all euclidean domains ) , and so have class number 1 : that is , they have trivial ideal class groups for d 0 , the ideal class group may be half the size since the class group of integral binary quadratic forms is isomorphic to the narrow class group of q one also computes that j 2 ( 2 ) , which is principal , so the class of j in the ideal class group has order two the hilbert class field l of a number field k is unique and has the following properties : every ideal of the ring of integers of k becomes principal in l , i.e

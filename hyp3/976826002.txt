ideal class groups ( or , rather , what were effectively ideal class groups ) were studied some time before the idea of an ideal was formulated it had been realised ( probably by several people ) that failure to complete proofs in the general case of fermat 's last theorem by factorisation using the roots of unity was for a very good reason : a failure of unique factorization , i.e we now recognise this as part of the ideal class group : in fact kummer had isolated the p-torsion in that group for the field of p-roots of unity , for any prime number p , as the reason for the failure of the standard method of attack on the fermat problem ( see regular prime ) it was shown that while rings of algebraic integers do not always have unique factorization into primes ( because they need not be principal ideal domains ) , they do have the property that every proper ideal admits a unique factorization as a product of prime ideals ( that is , every ring of algebraic integers is a dedekind domain ) the size of the ideal class group can be considered as a measure for the deviation of a ring from being a principal ideal domain ; a ring is a principal domain if and only if it has a trivial ideal class group however , if r is the ring of algebraic integers in an algebraic number field , or more generally a dedekind domain , the multiplication defined above turns the set of fractional ideal classes into an abelian group , the ideal class group of r the group property of existence of inverse elements follows easily from the fact that , in a dedekind domain , every non-zero ideal ( except r ) is a product of prime ideals in this sense , the ideal class group measures how far r is from being a principal ideal domain , and hence from satisfying unique prime factorization ( dedekind domains are unique factorization domains if and only if they are principal ideal domains ) but if r is in fact a ring of algebraic integers , then the class number is always finite it was remarked above that the ideal class group provides part of the answer to the question of how much ideals in a dedekind domain behave like elements this is a group homomorphism ; its kernel is the group of units of r , and its cokernel is the ideal class group of r a square root of & minus ; 1 ) , are all principal ideal domains ( and in fact are all euclidean domains ) , and so have class number 1 : that is , they have trivial ideal class groups class field theory is a branch of algebraic number theory which seeks to classify all the galois theorys of a given algebraic number field , meaning galois extensions with abelian galois group the hilbert class field l of a number field k is unique and has the following properties : every ideal of the ring of integers of k becomes principal in l , i.e

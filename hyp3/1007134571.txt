a topology on a set then τ is called a topology on x if : munkres , james r the notation x τ may be used to denote a set x endowed with the particular topology τ a subset of x may be open , closed , both ( clopen set ) , or neither a base ( or basis ) b for a topological space x with topology t is a collection of open sets in t such that every open set in t can be written as a union of elements of b every subset of a topological space can be given the subspace topology in which the open sets are the intersections of the open sets of the larger space with the subset for example , in finite products , a basis for the product topology consists of all products of open sets for infinite products , there is the additional requirement that in a basic open set , all but finitely many of its projections are the entire space a common example of a quotient topology is when an equivalence relation is defined on the topological space x a given set may have many different topologies any set can be given the discrete space , in which every subset is open also , any set can be given the trivial topology ( also called the indiscrete topology ) , in which only the empty set and the whole space are open any set can be given the cofinite topology in which the open sets are the empty set and the sets whose complement is finite the set of all open intervals forms a base or basis for the topology , meaning that every open set is a union of some collection of sets from the base in particular , this means that a set is open if there exists an open interval of non zero radius about every point in the set more generally , the euclidean spaces r n can be given a topology in the usual topology on r n the basic open sets are the open balls similarly , c , the set of complex numbers , and c n have a standard topology in which the basic open sets are open balls this example shows that a set may have many distinct topologies defined on it finite spaces are sometimes used to provide examples or counterexamples to conjectures about topological spaces in general the zariski topology is defined algebraically on the spectrum of a ring or an algebraic variety on r n or c n , the closed sets of the zariski topology are the solution sets of systems of polynomial equations continuous functions preserve limits of nets , and in fact this property characterizes continuous functions any open subspace of a baire space is itself a baire space in topology and related areas of mathematics , a metrizable space is a topological space that is homeomorphic to a metric space set-theoretic topology is a subject that combines set theory and general topology

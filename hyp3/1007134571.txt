general topology assumed its present form around 1940 a topology on a set then τ is called a topology on x if : munkres , james r the notation x τ may be used to denote a set x endowed with the particular topology τ the members of τ are called open sets in x a base ( or basis ) b for a topological space x with topology t is a collection of open sets in t such that every open set in t can be written as a union of elements of b for any indexed family of topological spaces , the product can be given the product topology , which is generated by the inverse images of open sets of the factors under the projection mappings for example , in finite products , a basis for the product topology consists of all products of open sets in other words , the quotient topology is the finest topology on y for which f is continuous any set can be given the discrete space , in which every subset is open the only convergent sequences or nets in this topology are those that are eventually constant also , any set can be given the trivial topology ( also called the indiscrete topology ) , in which only the empty set and the whole space are open every sequence and net in this topology converges to every point of the space this example shows that in general topological spaces , limits of sequences need not be unique any set can be given the cofinite topology in which the open sets are the empty set and the sets whose complement is finite any set can be given the cocountable topology , in which a set is defined as open if it is either empty or its complement is countable when the set is uncountable , this topology serves as a counterexample in many situations the set of all open intervals forms a base or basis for the topology , meaning that every open set is a union of some collection of sets from the base in the usual topology on r n the basic open sets are the open balls here , the basic open sets are the half open intervals [ a , b ) this example shows that a set may have many distinct topologies defined on it every metric space can be given a metric topology , in which the basic open sets are open balls defined by the metric this is the standard topology on any normed vector space an extreme example : if a set is given the discrete topology , all functions : f\colon x \rightarrow t to any topological space are continuous the peano curve is studied in continuum theory , a branch of general topology dimension theory is a branch of general topology dealing with dimensional invariants of topological spaces

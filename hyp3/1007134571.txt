general topology assumed its present form around 1940 a topology on a set then τ is called a topology on x if : munkres , james r the notation x τ may be used to denote a set x endowed with the particular topology τ the members of τ are called open sets in x a base ( or basis ) b for a topological space x with topology t is a collection of open sets in t such that every open set in t can be written as a union of elements of b every subset of a topological space can be given the subspace topology in which the open sets are the intersections of the open sets of the larger space with the subset a common example of a quotient topology is when an equivalence relation is defined on the topological space x if a set is given a different topology , it is viewed as a different topological space also , any set can be given the trivial topology ( also called the indiscrete topology ) , in which only the empty set and the whole space are open every sequence and net in this topology converges to every point of the space however , often topological spaces must be hausdorff spaces where limit points are unique any set can be given the cofinite topology in which the open sets are the empty set and the sets whose complement is finite any set can be given the cocountable topology , in which a set is defined as open if it is either empty or its complement is countable when the set is uncountable , this topology serves as a counterexample in many situations in particular , this means that a set is open if there exists an open interval of non zero radius about every point in the set similarly , c , the set of complex numbers , and c n have a standard topology in which the basic open sets are open balls the real line can also be given the lower limit topology this topology on r is strictly finer than the euclidean topology defined above ; a sequence converges to a point in this topology if and only if it converges from above in the euclidean topology this example shows that a set may have many distinct topologies defined on it every metric space can be given a metric topology , in which the basic open sets are open balls defined by the metric such spaces are called finite topological spaces on r n or c n , the closed sets of the zariski topology are the solution sets of systems of polynomial equations any open subspace of a baire space is itself a baire space pointless topology ( also called point-free or pointfree topology ) is an approach to topology that avoids mentioning points set-theoretic topology is a subject that combines set theory and general topology

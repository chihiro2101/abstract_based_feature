a topology on a set let x be a set and let τ be a family of subsets of x the notation x τ may be used to denote a set x endowed with the particular topology τ a subset of x may be open , closed , both ( clopen set ) , or neither the empty set and x itself are always both closed and open a base ( or basis ) b for a topological space x with topology t is a collection of open sets in t such that every open set in t can be written as a union of elements of b for any indexed family of topological spaces , the product can be given the product topology , which is generated by the inverse images of open sets of the factors under the projection mappings for example , in finite products , a basis for the product topology consists of all products of open sets in other words , the quotient topology is the finest topology on y for which f is continuous if a set is given a different topology , it is viewed as a different topological space also , any set can be given the trivial topology ( also called the indiscrete topology ) , in which only the empty set and the whole space are open however , often topological spaces must be hausdorff spaces where limit points are unique any set can be given the cofinite topology in which the open sets are the empty set and the sets whose complement is finite this is the smallest t1 space topology on any infinite set any set can be given the cocountable topology , in which a set is defined as open if it is either empty or its complement is countable when the set is uncountable , this topology serves as a counterexample in many situations there are many ways to define a topology on r , the set of real numbers the standard topology on r is generated by the open intervals similarly , c , the set of complex numbers , and c n have a standard topology in which the basic open sets are open balls this topology on r is strictly finer than the euclidean topology defined above ; a sequence converges to a point in this topology if and only if it converges from above in the euclidean topology every metric space can be given a metric topology , in which the basic open sets are open balls defined by the metric in metric spaces , this definition is equivalent to the ε & ndash ; δ-definition that is often used in analysis an extreme example : if a set is given the discrete topology , all functions : f\colon x \rightarrow t to any topological space are continuous in several contexts , the topology of a space is conveniently specified in terms of limit points in particular , if x is a metric space , sequential continuity and continuity are equivalent in topology and related areas of mathematics , a metrizable space is a topological space that is homeomorphic to a metric space

general topology assumed its present form around 1940 a topology on a set then τ is called a topology on x if : munkres , james r the members of τ are called open sets in x the empty set and x itself are always both closed and open a base ( or basis ) b for a topological space x with topology t is a collection of open sets in t such that every open set in t can be written as a union of elements of b for example , in finite products , a basis for the product topology consists of all products of open sets for infinite products , there is the additional requirement that in a basic open set , all but finitely many of its projections are the entire space in other words , the quotient topology is the finest topology on y for which f is continuous a common example of a quotient topology is when an equivalence relation is defined on the topological space x any set can be given the discrete space , in which every subset is open this example shows that in general topological spaces , limits of sequences need not be unique any set can be given the cofinite topology in which the open sets are the empty set and the sets whose complement is finite any set can be given the cocountable topology , in which a set is defined as open if it is either empty or its complement is countable when the set is uncountable , this topology serves as a counterexample in many situations there are many ways to define a topology on r , the set of real numbers the set of all open intervals forms a base or basis for the topology , meaning that every open set is a union of some collection of sets from the base in the usual topology on r n the basic open sets are the open balls every metric space can be given a metric topology , in which the basic open sets are open balls defined by the metric this is the standard topology on any normed vector space finite spaces are sometimes used to provide examples or counterexamples to conjectures about topological spaces in general on r n or c n , the closed sets of the zariski topology are the solution sets of systems of polynomial equations a continuum ( pl continua ) is a nonempty compact connected metric space , or less frequently , a compact connected hausdorff space pointless topology ( also called point-free or pointfree topology ) is an approach to topology that avoids mentioning points in topology and related areas of mathematics , a metrizable space is a topological space that is homeomorphic to a metric space set-theoretic topology is a subject that combines set theory and general topology

general topology assumed its present form around 1940 a topology on a set the notation x τ may be used to denote a set x endowed with the particular topology τ the members of τ are called open sets in x every subset of a topological space can be given the subspace topology in which the open sets are the intersections of the open sets of the larger space with the subset for any indexed family of topological spaces , the product can be given the product topology , which is generated by the inverse images of open sets of the factors under the projection mappings for infinite products , there is the additional requirement that in a basic open set , all but finitely many of its projections are the entire space a quotient space is defined as follows : if x is a topological space and y is a set , and if f : x→ y is a surjection function , then the quotient topology on y is the collection of subsets of y that have open inverse images under f in other words , the quotient topology is the finest topology on y for which f is continuous a common example of a quotient topology is when an equivalence relation is defined on the topological space x the map f is then the natural projection onto the set of equivalence classes if a set is given a different topology , it is viewed as a different topological space any set can be given the discrete space , in which every subset is open also , any set can be given the trivial topology ( also called the indiscrete topology ) , in which only the empty set and the whole space are open however , often topological spaces must be hausdorff spaces where limit points are unique any set can be given the cofinite topology in which the open sets are the empty set and the sets whose complement is finite this is the smallest t1 space topology on any infinite set when the set is uncountable , this topology serves as a counterexample in many situations there are many ways to define a topology on r , the set of real numbers the set of all open intervals forms a base or basis for the topology , meaning that every open set is a union of some collection of sets from the base similarly , c , the set of complex numbers , and c n have a standard topology in which the basic open sets are open balls every metric space can be given a metric topology , in which the basic open sets are open balls defined by the metric on the other hand , if is equipped with the indiscrete topology and the space set is at least t0 space , then the only continuous functions are the constant functions in particular , if x is a metric space , sequential continuity and continuity are equivalent topological dynamics concerns the behavior of a space and its subspaces over time when subjected to continuous change set-theoretic topology is a subject that combines set theory and general topology

typically , it arises from the reaction of hydrogen chloride with magnesium silicide : : mg 2 si + 4 hcl → 2 mgcl 2 + sih 4 it is also prepared from metallurgical grade silicon in a two-step process first , silicon is treated with hydrogen chloride at about 300 & nbsp ; °c to produce trichlorosilane , hsicl 3 , along with hydrogen gas , according to the chemical equation : : si + 3 hcl → hsicl 3 + h 2 the trichlorosilane is then converted to a mixture of silane and silicon tetrachloride this redistribution reaction requires a catalyst : :4 hsicl 3 → sih 4 + 3 sicl 4 the most commonly used catalysts for this process are metal halogen , particularly aluminium chloride the reactions are summarized below : : si + 2 h 2 + 3 sicl 4 → 4 sihcl 3 :2 sihcl 3 → sih 2 cl 2 + sicl 4 :2 dichlorosilane → sihcl 3 + sih 3 cl :2 chlorosilane → sih 4 + sih 2 cl 2 the silane produced by this route can be thermally decomposed to produce high-purity silicon and hydrogen in a single pass another commercial production of silane involves reduction of silicon dioxide ( sio 2 ) under al and h 2 gas in a mixture of nacl and aluminum chloride ( alcl 3 ) at high pressures : shriver and atkins for classroom demonstrations , silane can be produced by heating sand with magnesium powder to produce magnesium silicide ( mg 2 si ) , then pouring the mixture into hydrochloric acid the magnesium silicide reacts with the acid to produce silane gas , which burns on contact with air and produces tiny explosions this may be classified as a heterogeneous acid-base chemical reaction since the isolated si 4 − ion in the mg 2 si antifluorite structure can serve as a brønsted–lowry base capable of accepting four protons in all cases , these substances react with brønsted–lowry acids to produce some type of hydride of silicon that is dependent on the si anion connectivity in the silicide hence , m ii si with their zigzag chains of si 2 − anions ( containing two lone pairs of electrons on each si anion that can accept protons ) yield the polymeric hydride ( sih 2 ) x yet another small-scale route for the production of silane is from the action of sodium amalgam on dichlorosilane , sih 2 cl 2 , to yield monosilane along with some yellow polysilicon hydride ( sih ) x silane msds : sih 4 + 2 o 2 → sio 2 + 2 h 2 o with δh –1517 kj/mol –47.23 kj/g : sih 4 + o 2 → sio 2 + 2 h 2 : sih 4 + o 2 → sih 2 o + h 2 o :2 sih 4 + o 2 → 2 sih 2 o + 2h 2 : sih 2 o + o 2 → sio 2 + h 2 o for lean mixtures a two-stage reaction process has been proposed , which consists of a silane consumption process and a hydrogen oxidation process

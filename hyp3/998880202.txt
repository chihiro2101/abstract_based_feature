typically , it arises from the reaction of hydrogen chloride with magnesium silicide : : mg 2 si + 4 hcl → 2 mgcl 2 + sih 4 it is also prepared from metallurgical grade silicon in a two-step process first , silicon is treated with hydrogen chloride at about 300 & nbsp ; °c to produce trichlorosilane , hsicl 3 , along with hydrogen gas , according to the chemical equation : : si + 3 hcl → hsicl 3 + h 2 the trichlorosilane is then converted to a mixture of silane and silicon tetrachloride this redistribution reaction requires a catalyst : :4 hsicl 3 → sih 4 + 3 sicl 4 the most commonly used catalysts for this process are metal halogen , particularly aluminium chloride it may also be thought of as a disproportionation reaction even though there is no change in the oxidation number for silicon ( si has a nominal oxidation number iv in all three species ) the silicon atom could be rationalized as having the highest formal oxidation state and partial positive charge in sicl 4 and the lowest formal oxidation state in sih 4 since cl is far more electronegative than is h an alternative industrial process for the preparation of very high purity silane , suitable for use in the production of semiconductor grade silicon , starts with metallurgical grade silicon , hydrogen , and silicon tetrachloride and involves a complex series of redistribution reactions ( producing byproducts that are recycled in the process ) and distillations the reactions are summarized below : : si + 2 h 2 + 3 sicl 4 → 4 sihcl 3 :2 sihcl 3 → sih 2 cl 2 + sicl 4 :2 dichlorosilane → sihcl 3 + sih 3 cl :2 chlorosilane → sih 4 + sih 2 cl 2 the silane produced by this route can be thermally decomposed to produce high-purity silicon and hydrogen in a single pass another commercial production of silane involves reduction of silicon dioxide ( sio 2 ) under al and h 2 gas in a mixture of nacl and aluminum chloride ( alcl 3 ) at high pressures : shriver and atkins for classroom demonstrations , silane can be produced by heating sand with magnesium powder to produce magnesium silicide ( mg 2 si ) , then pouring the mixture into hydrochloric acid above 420 & nbsp ; °c , silane decomposes into silicon and hydrogen ; it can therefore be used in the chemical vapor deposition of silicon silane msds : sih 4 + 2 o 2 → sio 2 + 2 h 2 o with δh –1517 kj/mol –47.23 kj/g : sih 4 + o 2 → sio 2 + 2 h 2 : sih 4 + o 2 → sih 2 o + h 2 o :2 sih 4 + o 2 → 2 sih 2 o + 2h 2 : sih 2 o + o 2 → sio 2 + h 2 o for lean mixtures a two-stage reaction process has been proposed , which consists of a silane consumption process and a hydrogen oxidation process diluted silane mixtures with inert gases such as nitrogen or argon are even more likely to ignite when leaked into open air , compared to pure silane : even a 1 % mixture of silane in pure nitrogen easily ignites when exposed to air

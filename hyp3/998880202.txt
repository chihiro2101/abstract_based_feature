typically , it arises from the reaction of hydrogen chloride with magnesium silicide : : mg 2 si + 4 hcl → 2 mgcl 2 + sih 4 it is also prepared from metallurgical grade silicon in a two-step process first , silicon is treated with hydrogen chloride at about 300 & nbsp ; °c to produce trichlorosilane , hsicl 3 , along with hydrogen gas , according to the chemical equation : : si + 3 hcl → hsicl 3 + h 2 the trichlorosilane is then converted to a mixture of silane and silicon tetrachloride it may also be thought of as a disproportionation reaction even though there is no change in the oxidation number for silicon ( si has a nominal oxidation number iv in all three species ) the silicon atom could be rationalized as having the highest formal oxidation state and partial positive charge in sicl 4 and the lowest formal oxidation state in sih 4 since cl is far more electronegative than is h an alternative industrial process for the preparation of very high purity silane , suitable for use in the production of semiconductor grade silicon , starts with metallurgical grade silicon , hydrogen , and silicon tetrachloride and involves a complex series of redistribution reactions ( producing byproducts that are recycled in the process ) and distillations the reactions are summarized below : : si + 2 h 2 + 3 sicl 4 → 4 sihcl 3 :2 sihcl 3 → sih 2 cl 2 + sicl 4 :2 dichlorosilane → sihcl 3 + sih 3 cl :2 chlorosilane → sih 4 + sih 2 cl 2 the silane produced by this route can be thermally decomposed to produce high-purity silicon and hydrogen in a single pass still other industrial routes to silane involve reduction of sif 4 with sodium hydride ( nah ) or reduction of sicl 4 with lithium aluminum hydride ( lialh 4 ) the magnesium silicide reacts with the acid to produce silane gas , which burns on contact with air and produces tiny explosions it can be written as : :4 hcl + mg 2 si → sih 4 + 2 mgcl 2 in general , the alkaline-earth metals form silicides with the following stoichiometry : m ii 2 si , m ii si , and m ii si 2 yet another small-scale route for the production of silane is from the action of sodium amalgam on dichlorosilane , sih 2 cl 2 , to yield monosilane along with some yellow polysilicon hydride ( sih ) x a second consequence is that silane is pyrophoric & nbsp ; — it undergoes spontaneous combustion in air , without the need for external ignition in japan , in order to reduce the danger of silane for amorphous silicon solar cell manufacturing , several companies began to dilute silane with hydrogen gas

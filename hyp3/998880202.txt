typically , it arises from the reaction of hydrogen chloride with magnesium silicide : : mg 2 si + 4 hcl → 2 mgcl 2 + sih 4 it is also prepared from metallurgical grade silicon in a two-step process first , silicon is treated with hydrogen chloride at about 300 & nbsp ; °c to produce trichlorosilane , hsicl 3 , along with hydrogen gas , according to the chemical equation : : si + 3 hcl → hsicl 3 + h 2 the trichlorosilane is then converted to a mixture of silane and silicon tetrachloride the silicon atom could be rationalized as having the highest formal oxidation state and partial positive charge in sicl 4 and the lowest formal oxidation state in sih 4 since cl is far more electronegative than is h an alternative industrial process for the preparation of very high purity silane , suitable for use in the production of semiconductor grade silicon , starts with metallurgical grade silicon , hydrogen , and silicon tetrachloride and involves a complex series of redistribution reactions ( producing byproducts that are recycled in the process ) and distillations the reactions are summarized below : : si + 2 h 2 + 3 sicl 4 → 4 sihcl 3 :2 sihcl 3 → sih 2 cl 2 + sicl 4 :2 dichlorosilane → sihcl 3 + sih 3 cl :2 chlorosilane → sih 4 + sih 2 cl 2 the silane produced by this route can be thermally decomposed to produce high-purity silicon and hydrogen in a single pass in 1857 , the german chemists heinrich buff and friedrich wöhler discovered silane among the products formed by the action of hydrochloric acid on aluminum silicide , which they had previously prepared '' a comprehensive treatise on inorganic and theoretical chemistry , '' vol vi , longmans , green and co for classroom demonstrations , silane can be produced by heating sand with magnesium powder to produce magnesium silicide ( mg 2 si ) , then pouring the mixture into hydrochloric acid the magnesium silicide reacts with the acid to produce silane gas , which burns on contact with air and produces tiny explosions this may be classified as a heterogeneous acid-base chemical reaction since the isolated si 4 − ion in the mg 2 si antifluorite structure can serve as a brønsted–lowry base capable of accepting four protons yet another small-scale route for the production of silane is from the action of sodium amalgam on dichlorosilane , sih 2 cl 2 , to yield monosilane along with some yellow polysilicon hydride ( sih ) x above 420 & nbsp ; °c , silane decomposes into silicon and hydrogen ; it can therefore be used in the chemical vapor deposition of silicon

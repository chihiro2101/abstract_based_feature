silane can be produced by several routes typically , it arises from the reaction of hydrogen chloride with magnesium silicide : : mg 2 si + 4 hcl → 2 mgcl 2 + sih 4 it is also prepared from metallurgical grade silicon in a two-step process first , silicon is treated with hydrogen chloride at about 300 & nbsp ; °c to produce trichlorosilane , hsicl 3 , along with hydrogen gas , according to the chemical equation : : si + 3 hcl → hsicl 3 + h 2 the trichlorosilane is then converted to a mixture of silane and silicon tetrachloride this redistribution reaction requires a catalyst : :4 hsicl 3 → sih 4 + 3 sicl 4 the most commonly used catalysts for this process are metal halogen , particularly aluminium chloride it may also be thought of as a disproportionation reaction even though there is no change in the oxidation number for silicon ( si has a nominal oxidation number iv in all three species ) the reactions are summarized below : : si + 2 h 2 + 3 sicl 4 → 4 sihcl 3 :2 sihcl 3 → sih 2 cl 2 + sicl 4 :2 dichlorosilane → sihcl 3 + sih 3 cl :2 chlorosilane → sih 4 + sih 2 cl 2 the silane produced by this route can be thermally decomposed to produce high-purity silicon and hydrogen in a single pass still other industrial routes to silane involve reduction of sif 4 with sodium hydride ( nah ) or reduction of sicl 4 with lithium aluminum hydride ( lialh 4 ) another commercial production of silane involves reduction of silicon dioxide ( sio 2 ) under al and h 2 gas in a mixture of nacl and aluminum chloride ( alcl 3 ) at high pressures : shriver and atkins for classroom demonstrations , silane can be produced by heating sand with magnesium powder to produce magnesium silicide ( mg 2 si ) , then pouring the mixture into hydrochloric acid it can be written as : :4 hcl + mg 2 si → sih 4 + 2 mgcl 2 in general , the alkaline-earth metals form silicides with the following stoichiometry : m ii 2 si , m ii si , and m ii si 2 hence , m ii si with their zigzag chains of si 2 − anions ( containing two lone pairs of electrons on each si anion that can accept protons ) yield the polymeric hydride ( sih 2 ) x above 420 & nbsp ; °c , silane decomposes into silicon and hydrogen ; it can therefore be used in the chemical vapor deposition of silicon

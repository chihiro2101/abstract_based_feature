modern orthodoxy comprises a fairly broad spectrum of movements each drawing on several distinct , though related , philosophies , which in some combination provide the basis for all variations of the movement today in general , modern orthodoxy 's '' overall approach is the belief that one can and should be a full member of modern society , accepting the risks to remaining observant , because the benefits outweigh those risks '' jews should engage constructively with the world that they are in to tikkun olam within both themselves and the larger community , such as by avoiding sin in their personal lives while also tzedakah thus , modern orthodoxy holds that halakha is normative and binding , while simultaneously attaching a positive value to interaction with the modern world berman , the ideology of modern orthodoxy orthodox judaism can '' be enriched '' by its intersection with modernity ; further , '' modern society creates opportunities to be productive citizens engaged in the divine work of tikkun olam '' at the same time , in order to preserve the integrity of halakha , any area of '' powerful inconsistency and conflict '' between torah and modern culture must be filtered out this includes modern orthodox 's unequivocal stance prohibiting its members from engaging in gay and lesbian relationships see modern orthodoxy also assigns a central role to the '' people of israel '' the specific expression of modern orthodoxy , however , takes many forms , and particularly over the past 30-40 years , describes a political spectrum soloveitchik debate over world view ; torah im derech eretz interpretation to the conservatism , the line between haredi and modern orthodox has blurred in recent years ; some have referred to this trend as '' haredization '' and many have redefined 'madda ' as support for making one 's livelihood in the secular world , not culturally or intellectually engaging with it see yeshivat chovevei torah , shalom hartman institute , hebrew institute of riverdale , partnership minyan , shira hadasha , maharat it is also noted that many modern orthodox are '' behaviorally modern '' as opposed to '' ideologically modern '' , and , in truth , fall outside of '' modern '' orthodoxy , at least in the philosophical sense ; see below the distinction is as follows : the ideologically modern are '' meticulously observant of halakha '' , and their interaction with the secular comprises a tangible expression of their ideology , wherever it may lie on the spectrum described the '' behaviorally modern '' , on the other hand , define themselves as '' modern orthodox '' only in the sense that they are neither haredi ( '' ultra-orthodox '' ) nor conservative : these , in other words , are '' not deeply concerned with philosophical ideas '' , and , often , are not as careful in their observance this '' orthodoxy of convenience '' has maintained a certain stability over time : as long as these do n't seek to legitimize their behaviour in halakhic terms , the leadership of the ( modern ) orthodox world have no particular difficulty with them various highly differing views ( or non views ) - ranging from traditionalist to revisionist - are offered under the banner of '' modern orthodoxy '' in fact , even among its leadership , there is limited agreement '' on the philosophical parameters of modern orthodoxy '' the boundaries here , with respect to haredi and conservative judaism , have therefore become increasingly indistinct similarly , at modern orthodoxy 's left , many appear to align with more traditional elements of conservative judaism in discussing '' modern orthodoxy '' , it is thus also important to clarify its position with reference to other movements in judaism : see comparison with other movements below further , given this wide range of views , some see the possibility that , in fact , '' there is no longer a cohesive , singular modern orthodoxy '' ; see further below modern orthodoxy traces its roots to the works of rabbis azriel hildesheimer ( 1820–1899 ) and samson raphael hirsch ( 1808–1888 ) while hildesheimer 's role is not disputed—comprising distinct philosophy and pragmatic contributions—hirsch 's role is less clear , with some hirsch scholars arguing that his '' torah im derech eretz '' philosophy is in fact at odds with that of modern orthodoxy ; see further below and in the hildesheimer article hirsch 's torah im derech eretz – '' torah with the 'way of the world'/society '' ) is a philosophy of orthodox judaism that formalizes a relationship between halakhically observant judaism and the modern world hirsch held that judaism requires the application of torah philosophy to all human endeavor and knowledge compatible with it hirsch : '' religion allied to progress '' hirsch 's vision , although not unqualified , extended to the sciences as well as to ( german ) literature , philosophy and culture neo orthodoxy , the movement descended from hirsch 's frankfurt community , regards itself as positioned , ideologically , outside of contemporary modern orthodoxy ; see further below he maintained traditional attachments to the land of israel , and worked with the non-orthodox on its behalf torah umadda – '' torah and secular knowledge '' ) is a philosophy concerning the secular world and judaism , and in particular secular knowledge and jewish knowledge it envisions a personal—as opposed to philosophic— '' synthesis '' between torah scholarship and western , secular scholarship , entailing , also , positive involvement with the broader community rabbi sol roth , the jewish idea of community the resultant mode of orthodox judaism is referred to as '' centrist orthodoxy '' in rav soloveitchik 's thought , judaism , which believes that the world is '' very good '' , enjoins man to engage in tikkun olam rabbi ronnie ziegler : introduction to the philosophy of rav soloveitchik : the need for action centrist orthodoxy is the dominant mode of modern orthodoxy in the united states , while torah umadda remains closely associated with yeshiva university both modern orthodoxy and ultra orthodoxy regard halakha as divine in origin , and as such , no position is assumed without justification in the shulchan aruch and in the acharonim the movements differ , however , in their approach to strictures ( chumras ) and leniencies ( kulas ) modern orthodoxy 's efforts to encourage religious observance among non-orthodox jews has been likened to similar efforts by the chabad movement '' church/sect theory and american orthodoxy reconsidered '' differences between the movements may be more than a question of degree : some hirsch scholars argue that hirschian philosophy is at odds with that of modern orthodoxy , see , for example : joseph elias ' introduction to the nineteen letters for modern orthodoxy , on the other hand , secular culture and knowledge are seen as a complement to torah , and , to some extent , encouraged for their own sake by contrast , in the view of modern orthodoxy , although torah is the '' preeminent center '' , secular knowledge is considered to offer '' a different perspective that may not agree at all with torah note , however , that modern orthodoxy , in fact , overlaps to a large extent with mizrachi ( religious zionism ) ( '' throughout the world , a 'religious zionist day school ' is a synonym for a 'modern orthodox day school ' '' at the least , the two are not in any direct conflict , and generally coexist , sharing both values and adherents . here , engagement with the secular is permissible , and encouraged , but only insofar as this benefits the state of israel ; secular knowledge ( or , at the least , an extensive secular education ) is viewed as valuable for practical ends , though not in and of itself the very term '' modern orthodoxy '' is thus , in some sense , an oxymoron as observed above , the ( precise ) '' philosophical parameters of modern orthodoxy '' are not readily defined in fact , '' many are making the argument that the time has come to state the inevitable or to admit that which already has occurred : there is no longer a cohesive , singular modern orthodoxy torah v'chokhma there , re modern orthodoxy

modern orthodoxy comprises a fairly broad spectrum of movements each drawing on several distinct , though related , philosophies , which in some combination provide the basis for all variations of the movement today in general , modern orthodoxy 's '' overall approach is the belief that one can and should be a full member of modern society , accepting the risks to remaining observant , because the benefits outweigh those risks '' jews should engage constructively with the world that they are in to tikkun olam within both themselves and the larger community , such as by avoiding sin in their personal lives while also tzedakah thus , modern orthodoxy holds that halakha is normative and binding , while simultaneously attaching a positive value to interaction with the modern world berman , the ideology of modern orthodoxy orthodox judaism can '' be enriched '' by its intersection with modernity ; further , '' modern society creates opportunities to be productive citizens engaged in the divine work of tikkun olam '' at the same time , in order to preserve the integrity of halakha , any area of '' powerful inconsistency and conflict '' between torah and modern culture must be filtered out this includes modern orthodox 's unequivocal stance prohibiting its members from engaging in gay and lesbian relationships there is , however , a difference of opinion as to what stance to take with individuals who violate halakha in this regard see modern orthodoxy also assigns a central role to the '' people of israel '' the specific expression of modern orthodoxy , however , takes many forms , and particularly over the past 30-40 years , describes a political spectrum rabbi david bigman : finding a home for critical talmud study , the edah journal 2:1 for further discussion , see orthodox judaism diversity ; joseph b soloveitchik debate over world view ; torah im derech eretz interpretation in addition to increasing stringency in adherence to halakha , many modern orthodox jews express a growing sense of alienation from the larger , secular culture ) adherents on the ideological left have begun to develop new institutions that aim to be outward looking while maintaining a discourse between modernity and halakhah see yeshivat chovevei torah , shalom hartman institute , hebrew institute of riverdale , partnership minyan , shira hadasha , maharat it is also noted that many modern orthodox are '' behaviorally modern '' as opposed to '' ideologically modern '' , and , in truth , fall outside of '' modern '' orthodoxy , at least in the philosophical sense ; see below the distinction is as follows : the ideologically modern are '' meticulously observant of halakha '' , and their interaction with the secular comprises a tangible expression of their ideology , wherever it may lie on the spectrum described this '' orthodoxy of convenience '' has maintained a certain stability over time : as long as these do n't seek to legitimize their behaviour in halakhic terms , the leadership of the ( modern ) orthodox world have no particular difficulty with them various highly differing views ( or non views ) - ranging from traditionalist to revisionist - are offered under the banner of '' modern orthodoxy '' in fact , even among its leadership , there is limited agreement '' on the philosophical parameters of modern orthodoxy '' the boundaries here , with respect to haredi and conservative judaism , have therefore become increasingly indistinct modern orthodoxy traces its roots to the works of rabbis azriel hildesheimer ( 1820–1899 ) and samson raphael hirsch ( 1808–1888 ) today , the movement is additionally , and particularly , influenced by the philosophy of rabbi joseph b soloveitchik and the closely related torah umadda , as well as by the writings of rabbi abraham isaac kook hirsch 's torah im derech eretz – '' torah with the 'way of the world'/society '' ) is a philosophy of orthodox judaism that formalizes a relationship between halakhically observant judaism and the modern world hirsch held that judaism requires the application of torah philosophy to all human endeavor and knowledge compatible with it rabbi azriel hildesheimer , along with rabbi hirsch , was insistent that orthodox jews living in the west should not segregate themselves behind ghetto walls shapiro , rabbi esriel hildesheimer 's program of torah u-madda his approach , '' cultured orthodoxy '' , was defined as representing '' unconditional agreement with the culture of the present day ; harmony between judaism and science ; but also unconditional steadfastness in the faith and traditions of judaism '' he was , however , '' the pragmatist rather than the philosopher '' , and it is his actions , rather than his philosophy , which have become institutionalized in modern orthodoxy , chaim i he established jewish education for males and females , which included both religious and secular studies torah umadda – '' torah and secular knowledge '' ) is a philosophy concerning the secular world and judaism , and in particular secular knowledge and jewish knowledge it envisions a personal—as opposed to philosophic— '' synthesis '' between torah scholarship and western , secular scholarship , entailing , also , positive involvement with the broader community rabbi sol roth , the jewish idea of community the resultant mode of orthodox judaism is referred to as '' centrist orthodoxy '' rabbi ronnie ziegler : introduction to the philosophy of rav soloveitchik : the need for action centrist orthodoxy is the dominant mode of modern orthodoxy in the united states , while torah umadda remains closely associated with yeshiva university rabbi hillel rachmani : introduction to the thought of rav kook in israel , the religious zionism of the dati leumi , '' national religious '' ) dominates modern orthodoxy here too , the ideological basis is largely drawn from the teachings of rav kook , lisa richlen ( 2003 ) as above , modern orthodoxy comprises various approaches , ranging from traditionalist to revisionist , and the movement apparently overlaps with conservative judaism and with haredi judaism at its respective boundaries therefore , in clarifying what modern orthodoxy in fact entails , its positioning must be discussed with reference to these movements modern orthodoxy is almost uniformly receptive toward israel and zionism , viewing the state of israel ( in addition to the land of israel ) as having inherent religious significance both modern orthodoxy and ultra orthodoxy regard halakha as divine in origin , and as such , no position is assumed without justification in the shulchan aruch and in the acharonim the movements differ , however , in their approach to strictures ( chumras ) and leniencies ( kulas ) modern orthodoxy holds that strictures are not normative , rather , these are a matter of personal choice ; rabbi saul berman ( edah.org ) : diverse orthodox attitudes : chumrah '' severity and leniency are relevant only in circumstances of factual doubt , not in situations of debate or varied practice michael kress , the state of orthodox judaism today ) see torah umadda moderation as to the contention that modern orthodoxy 's standards of observance of halakha are '' relaxed '' , as opposed to moderate , see below under criticism the role of secular life and culture : in the hirschian view , interaction with the secular and the requisite acquisition of culture and knowledge is encouraged , only insofar as it facilitates the application of torah to worldly matters rabbi avi weiss , from the left of modern orthodoxy , stresses that orthodox and conservative judaism are '' so very different in the suggestion here is that modern orthodoxy may not provide a directly applicable theology for the contemporary modern orthodox family ;

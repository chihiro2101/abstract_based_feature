in north america , harness races are restricted to standardbred horses , although european racehorses may also be french trotters or russian trotters , or have mixed ancestry with lineages from multiple breeds the horse temperament coldblood trotters and finnhorses race separately in finland , norway and sweden standardbreds are so named because in the early years of the standardbred stud book , only horses who could trot or pace a mile in a standard time ( or whose progeny could do so ) of no more than 2 minutes , 30 seconds were admitted to the book from messenger came a great-grandson , hambletonian 10 ( 1849–1876 ) , who gained a wide following for his racing prowess the lineage of virtually all north american standardbred race horses can be traced from four of hambletonian 10 sons foiled again retired on january 1 , 2019 , but the then 15-year-old gelding left an indelible mark in harness racing annals he compiled a 331/109–70–46 record and earned an all-time record us 7,635,588 in purse money i 'm themightyquinn ( foaled 2004 ) is an australasian champion standardbred notable for being a three time australian harness horse of the year and three-time winner of the inter dominion ( 2011 - 2013 ) in continental europe , races are conducted exclusively among trotters , whereas in australia , canada , new zealand , the united kingdom and the united states races are also held for pacers pacing races constitute 80 % to 90 % of the harness races conducted in north america - while the clear majority of harness racing in australia and new zealand are also now for pacers , even though the sport is colloquially still known as 'the trots ' pacing horses are faster and ( most important to the bettor ) less likely to break stride ( a horse which starts to gallop must be slowed down and taken to the outside until it resumes trotting or pacing ) the pace is a natural gait for many horses , and hobbles are an aid in supporting the gait at top speed ; trotting hobbles ( which employ a different design , due to the difference in the gait ) are becoming increasingly popular for the same reason most harness races start from behind a motorized starting gate , also known as the mobile barrier the horses commence pacing or trotting and line up behind a hinged gate mounted on a moving motor vehicle , which then leads them to the starting line the race must then be brought back to the starting line for a restart which can cause delays in programming and disrupts betting the sulky ( informally known as a '' bike '' , and also known as a spider ) is a light , two-wheeled cart equipped with bicycle wheels the driver ( not a '' jockey '' , as in thoroughbred racing ) carries a light whip chiefly used to signal the horse by tapping and to make noise by striking the sulky shaft there are strict rules as to how and how much the whip may be used ; in some jurisdictions ( like norway ) , whips are forbidden the horses are entered in the race based on life-time earnings , unless they have qualified by performing well in the preceding six qualifying races at solvalla in the suburbs of stockholm the premier standardbred mile race is held in late may every year , elitloppet ( the elite race ) other important annual races are svenskt travkriterium , a race restricted to three-year-olds , also hosted at solvalla and swedish trotting derby ( open for the best four-year-old horses ) hosted in september at jägersro in malmö the latter race track also hosts the hugo åbergs memorial , which is an international race open for all horses the winner of seven ( pre-decided ) races ( with 12 or 15 horses ) is to be picked one single '' row '' is very cheap to play , but people usually play large systems , picking the winner in one or two of the races and several horses in the other races price for one '' row '' is 1/2 sek ( approximately 0,05 euro ) but if , for instance , betting on 2 , 5 , 1 , 7 , 7 , 1 and 4 horses in the seven races the price multiplies as 0.5 × 2 × 5 × 1 × 7 × 7 × 1 × 4 980 sek ( approximately 92 euro ) the bettors win money if they get all seven , six or five horses right within the system but mares also belong to one of the other six classifications in pure mare horse races , horses from higher classification get 20 , 40 or up to 60 meter extra to run how well this succeeds depends on the horse , the starting position and how the opponents drive their horses due to the sulky width and the oval race track overtaking is a far more difficult manoeuver to achieve , in comparison with gallop racing this is explained with the fact that the outer track is close to 15 meter longer per lap , front running is always heavier compared with just follow behind ( just like in cycling ) and horses in the inner track may very well be trapped all the way to the finish , due to the horses and sulkies in the outer track in both new zealand and australia the same system of an 'open lane ' operates , although in australia it is called a 'sprint lane ' and in new zealand a 'passing lane ' all notable racing nations also host their own highly regarded premier events for young horses älgen stolta canadian horse racing hall of fame chariot racing harness racing museum & hall of fame harness racing in australia harness racing in new zealand harness racing in sweden

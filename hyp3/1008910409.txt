in north america , harness races are restricted to standardbred horses , although european racehorses may also be french trotters or russian trotters , or have mixed ancestry with lineages from multiple breeds the horse temperament coldblood trotters and finnhorses race separately in finland , norway and sweden the lineage of virtually all north american standardbred race horses can be traced from four of hambletonian 10 sons foiled again retired on january 1 , 2019 , but the then 15-year-old gelding left an indelible mark in harness racing annals thumb races can be conducted in two differing gaits : trotting and pacing in continental europe , races are conducted exclusively among trotters , whereas in australia , canada , new zealand , the united kingdom and the united states races are also held for pacers pacing races constitute 80 % to 90 % of the harness races conducted in north america - while the clear majority of harness racing in australia and new zealand are also now for pacers , even though the sport is colloquially still known as 'the trots ' pacing horses are faster and ( most important to the bettor ) less likely to break stride ( a horse which starts to gallop must be slowed down and taken to the outside until it resumes trotting or pacing ) one of the reasons pacers are less likely to break stride is that they often wear hobbles ( straps connecting the legs on each of the horse 's sides ) the pace is a natural gait for many horses , and hobbles are an aid in supporting the gait at top speed ; trotting hobbles ( which employ a different design , due to the difference in the gait ) are becoming increasingly popular for the same reason most harness races start from behind a motorized starting gate , also known as the mobile barrier this enables handicaps to be placed on horses ( according to class ) with several tapes , usually with 10 or 20 meters between tapes the race must then be brought back to the starting line for a restart which can cause delays in programming and disrupts betting the sulky ( informally known as a '' bike '' , and also known as a spider ) is a light , two-wheeled cart equipped with bicycle wheels it is held annually at the gigantic vincennes hippodrome in eastern paris late in january at solvalla in the suburbs of stockholm the premier standardbred mile race is held in late may every year , elitloppet ( the elite race ) one single '' row '' is very cheap to play , but people usually play large systems , picking the winner in one or two of the races and several horses in the other races some races use the mobile starting gate as seen in the united states but numbers 6 and 7 ( who start in the second volt together with number 8 and higher ) may get up a better speed after the turn-around but before the starting whistle sounds the start of the races and the starting position ( which equals a certain number as explained previously ) are indeed important , independent of the start method how well this succeeds depends on the horse , the starting position and how the opponents drive their horses due to the sulky width and the oval race track overtaking is a far more difficult manoeuver to achieve , in comparison with gallop racing after the initial fight for good running position , the horses usually form two rows or tracks good running positions are the leading position of the inner track or the second ( or third ) place in the outer track this is explained with the fact that the outer track is close to 15 meter longer per lap , front running is always heavier compared with just follow behind ( just like in cycling ) positions in the inner track behind the leader may appear the best and horses in the inner track may very well be trapped all the way to the finish , due to the horses and sulkies in the outer track on the other hand , if an opening in the outer track appears close to the finish line , such a horse have had '' an easy ride '' with much strength left to give the leading position of the outer track , also known as the position of '' death '' , is a very hard position to run and only very strong horses can win from this position if a horse completes the race from the '' death '' position , commentators often point that out when announcing the km pace of the horse at longer races ( with rather even competitors ) running positions like second or third in the outer track have good chances , especially if the inner track horses get trapped behind a weakening front horse though the vast majority of races are one mile , races are contested on several different size tracks in new zealand the major races include the auckland cup and the new zealand cup as well as the noel j taylor memorial mile and the new zealand messenger championship for four-year-olds other notable races include the elitloppet one-mile race in solvalla track near stockholm , sweden and gran premio lotteria in naples , italy Ã¤lgen stolta canadian horse racing hall of fame chariot racing harness racing museum & hall of fame harness racing in australia harness racing in new zealand harness racing in sweden

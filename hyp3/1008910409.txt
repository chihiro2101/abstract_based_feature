in north america , harness races are restricted to standardbred horses , although european racehorses may also be french trotters or russian trotters , or have mixed ancestry with lineages from multiple breeds the horse temperament coldblood trotters and finnhorses race separately in finland , norway and sweden standardbreds are so named because in the early years of the standardbred stud book , only horses who could trot or pace a mile in a standard time ( or whose progeny could do so ) of no more than 2 minutes , 30 seconds were admitted to the book from messenger came a great-grandson , hambletonian 10 ( 1849–1876 ) , who gained a wide following for his racing prowess the lineage of virtually all north american standardbred race horses can be traced from four of hambletonian 10 sons foiled again retired on january 1 , 2019 , but the then 15-year-old gelding left an indelible mark in harness racing annals i 'm themightyquinn ( foaled 2004 ) is an australasian champion standardbred notable for being a three time australian harness horse of the year and three-time winner of the inter dominion ( 2011 - 2013 ) thumb races can be conducted in two differing gaits : trotting and pacing in continental europe , races are conducted exclusively among trotters , whereas in australia , canada , new zealand , the united kingdom and the united states races are also held for pacers pacing races constitute 80 % to 90 % of the harness races conducted in north america - while the clear majority of harness racing in australia and new zealand are also now for pacers , even though the sport is colloquially still known as 'the trots ' pacing horses are faster and ( most important to the bettor ) less likely to break stride ( a horse which starts to gallop must be slowed down and taken to the outside until it resumes trotting or pacing ) the race must then be brought back to the starting line for a restart which can cause delays in programming and disrupts betting the driver ( not a '' jockey '' , as in thoroughbred racing ) carries a light whip chiefly used to signal the horse by tapping and to make noise by striking the sulky shaft for exercising or training , the drivers use what is known as a '' jog cart , '' which is a sulky that is heavier and bulkier than a racing unit one of them ( jägersro ) is a combined thoroughbred and standardbred track , while another is only used once every year the latter race track also hosts the hugo åbergs memorial , which is an international race open for all horses other important harness racing arenas in scandinavia are åby outside gothenburg , mantorp , axevalla , bergsåker , boden ( almost at the polar circle ) and charlottenlund in danish capital copenhagen the classifications are from the lowest and upwards : class iii class ii class i bronze division silver division gold division there is also a seventh class , for mares only stallions ( and castrated geldings ) are considered a little better in general in volt start good starting numbers ( which automatically turn in to certain positions ) are 1 , 3 and 5 ( slightly better than 2 and 4 ) horses may have different initial speed , but must not exceed the starting line before the start signal sounds due to this number 6 and number 7 are known as '' running tracks '' at volt starting horses 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 and 13 , 14 , 15 have all horses in front of them how well this succeeds depends on the horse , the starting position and how the opponents drive their horses due to the sulky width and the oval race track overtaking is a far more difficult manoeuver to achieve , in comparison with gallop racing the '' running position fight '' during start and the beginning of the race usually ends in the first turn the leading position of the outer track , also known as the position of '' death '' , is a very hard position to run and only very strong horses can win from this position at longer races ( with rather even competitors ) running positions like second or third in the outer track have good chances , especially if the inner track horses get trapped behind a weakening front horse the huge popularity of trot betting in sweden '' spills over '' to the neighboring norway ( 11 racing tracks ) , finland ( 43 ) and denmark ( 9 ) trotting sport and betting also exist in austria , belgium , germany , hungary , italy , the netherlands , malta , russia and ireland on the rail behind the leader is a choice spot , known as the '' pocket '' , and a horse in that position is said to have a '' garden trip '' in both new zealand and australia the same system of an 'open lane ' operates , although in australia it is called a 'sprint lane ' and in new zealand a 'passing lane ' the hambletonian is part of the triple crown of harness racing for trotters and the little brown jug is part of the triple crown of harness racing for pacers the leading harness racing nations in europe are france , italy and sweden , and the sport is fairly popular in most northern european countries älgen stolta canadian horse racing hall of fame chariot racing harness racing museum & hall of fame harness racing in australia harness racing in new zealand harness racing in sweden

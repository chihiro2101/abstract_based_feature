in north america , harness races are restricted to standardbred horses , although european racehorses may also be french trotters or russian trotters , or have mixed ancestry with lineages from multiple breeds the horse temperament coldblood trotters and finnhorses race separately in finland , norway and sweden the lineage of virtually all north american standardbred race horses can be traced from four of hambletonian 10 sons as of january 1 , 2019 , foiled again is the richest standardbred horse in the world i 'm themightyquinn ( foaled 2004 ) is an australasian champion standardbred notable for being a three time australian harness horse of the year and three-time winner of the inter dominion ( 2011 - 2013 ) in continental europe , races are conducted exclusively among trotters , whereas in australia , canada , new zealand , the united kingdom and the united states races are also held for pacers pacing races constitute 80 % to 90 % of the harness races conducted in north america - while the clear majority of harness racing in australia and new zealand are also now for pacers , even though the sport is colloquially still known as 'the trots ' pacing horses are faster and ( most important to the bettor ) less likely to break stride ( a horse which starts to gallop must be slowed down and taken to the outside until it resumes trotting or pacing ) one of the reasons pacers are less likely to break stride is that they often wear hobbles ( straps connecting the legs on each of the horse 's sides ) this enables handicaps to be placed on horses ( according to class ) with several tapes , usually with 10 or 20 meters between tapes the sulky ( informally known as a '' bike '' , and also known as a spider ) is a light , two-wheeled cart equipped with bicycle wheels for exercising or training , the drivers use what is known as a '' jog cart , '' which is a sulky that is heavier and bulkier than a racing unit the horses are entered in the race based on life-time earnings , unless they have qualified by performing well in the preceding six qualifying races one of them ( jägersro ) is a combined thoroughbred and standardbred track , while another is only used once every year at solvalla in the suburbs of stockholm the premier standardbred mile race is held in late may every year , elitloppet ( the elite race ) the latter race track also hosts the hugo åbergs memorial , which is an international race open for all horses one single '' row '' is very cheap to play , but people usually play large systems , picking the winner in one or two of the races and several horses in the other races the horses are classified by how much prize money they have gained through the entire career of the horse in such case the silver division horses must run 60 & nbsp ; m behind the less experienced class ii horses but numbers 6 and 7 ( who start in the second volt together with number 8 and higher ) may get up a better speed after the turn-around but before the starting whistle sounds horses may have different initial speed , but must not exceed the starting line before the start signal sounds but to get advantage of the '' running tracks '' the horse must be '' a fast starter '' how well this succeeds depends on the horse , the starting position and how the opponents drive their horses due to the sulky width and the oval race track overtaking is a far more difficult manoeuver to achieve , in comparison with gallop racing the '' running position fight '' during start and the beginning of the race usually ends in the first turn after the initial fight for good running position , the horses usually form two rows or tracks on the other hand , if an opening in the outer track appears close to the finish line , such a horse have had '' an easy ride '' with much strength left to give the leading position of the outer track , also known as the position of '' death '' , is a very hard position to run and only very strong horses can win from this position if a horse completes the race from the '' death '' position , commentators often point that out when announcing the km pace of the horse on short distance ( 1640 meter ) , the horse that gets the leading position of the inner track has a very good chance to be the winner australian racing generally has more horses in each race ; a field of 12 or 13 is not uncommon the modern starting gates use only a driver for steering the vehicle and a starter in the rear to observe the race and call a false start if required the hambletonian is part of the triple crown of harness racing for trotters and the little brown jug is part of the triple crown of harness racing for pacers the leading harness racing nations in europe are france , italy and sweden , and the sport is fairly popular in most northern european countries saddled events are also commonplace in france and though less frequent , they are not considered exceptional in other european trotting nations

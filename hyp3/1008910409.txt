in north america , harness races are restricted to standardbred horses , although european racehorses may also be french trotters or russian trotters , or have mixed ancestry with lineages from multiple breeds the horse temperament coldblood trotters and finnhorses race separately in finland , norway and sweden standardbreds are so named because in the early years of the standardbred stud book , only horses who could trot or pace a mile in a standard time ( or whose progeny could do so ) of no more than 2 minutes , 30 seconds were admitted to the book from messenger came a great-grandson , hambletonian 10 ( 1849–1876 ) , who gained a wide following for his racing prowess foiled again retired on january 1 , 2019 , but the then 15-year-old gelding left an indelible mark in harness racing annals i 'm themightyquinn ( foaled 2004 ) is an australasian champion standardbred notable for being a three time australian harness horse of the year and three-time winner of the inter dominion ( 2011 - 2013 ) in continental europe , races are conducted exclusively among trotters , whereas in australia , canada , new zealand , the united kingdom and the united states races are also held for pacers pacing races constitute 80 % to 90 % of the harness races conducted in north america - while the clear majority of harness racing in australia and new zealand are also now for pacers , even though the sport is colloquially still known as 'the trots ' pacing horses are faster and ( most important to the bettor ) less likely to break stride ( a horse which starts to gallop must be slowed down and taken to the outside until it resumes trotting or pacing ) most harness races start from behind a motorized starting gate , also known as the mobile barrier the horses commence pacing or trotting and line up behind a hinged gate mounted on a moving motor vehicle , which then leads them to the starting line another kind of start is a standing start , where there are tapes or imaginary lines across the track behind which the horses either stand stationary or trot in circles in pairs in a specific pattern to hit the starting line as a group the race must then be brought back to the starting line for a restart which can cause delays in programming and disrupts betting the sulky ( informally known as a '' bike '' , and also known as a spider ) is a light , two-wheeled cart equipped with bicycle wheels the driver ( not a '' jockey '' , as in thoroughbred racing ) carries a light whip chiefly used to signal the horse by tapping and to make noise by striking the sulky shaft there are strict rules as to how and how much the whip may be used ; in some jurisdictions ( like norway ) , whips are forbidden for exercising or training , the drivers use what is known as a '' jog cart , '' which is a sulky that is heavier and bulkier than a racing unit sweden is '' the locomotive '' of harness racing in scandinavia in sweden there are 33 racing tracks , and in finland 43 one of them ( jägersro ) is a combined thoroughbred and standardbred track , while another is only used once every year other important harness racing arenas in scandinavia are åby outside gothenburg , mantorp , axevalla , bergsåker , boden ( almost at the polar circle ) and charlottenlund in danish capital copenhagen the race track 's length most usually is 1000 meters ( inner track ) with two long sides and two curves the horses are classified by how much prize money they have gained through the entire career of the horse in pure mare horse races , horses from higher classification get 20 , 40 or up to 60 meter extra to run an example of such a race could be silver division against class ii how well this succeeds depends on the horse , the starting position and how the opponents drive their horses due to the sulky width and the oval race track overtaking is a far more difficult manoeuver to achieve , in comparison with gallop racing this is explained with the fact that the outer track is close to 15 meter longer per lap , front running is always heavier compared with just follow behind ( just like in cycling ) positions in the inner track behind the leader may appear the best on the other hand , if an opening in the outer track appears close to the finish line , such a horse have had '' an easy ride '' with much strength left to give though the vast majority of races are one mile , races are contested on several different size tracks this solves a common problem , in which trailing horses are '' boxed in '' ( behind the leader , with another horse outside ) the leading harness racing nations in europe are france , italy and sweden , and the sport is fairly popular in most northern european countries a yearly grand circuit tour for the top trotters includes a number of prestigious european races älgen stolta canadian horse racing hall of fame chariot racing harness racing museum & hall of fame harness racing in australia harness racing in new zealand harness racing in sweden

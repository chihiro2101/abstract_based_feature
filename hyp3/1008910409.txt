in north america , harness races are restricted to standardbred horses , although european racehorses may also be french trotters or russian trotters , or have mixed ancestry with lineages from multiple breeds standardbreds are so named because in the early years of the standardbred stud book , only horses who could trot or pace a mile in a standard time ( or whose progeny could do so ) of no more than 2 minutes , 30 seconds were admitted to the book the founding sire of today 's standardbred horse was messenger , a gray thoroughbred brought to america in 1788 and purchased by henry astor , brother of john jacob astor the lineage of virtually all north american standardbred race horses can be traced from four of hambletonian 10 sons foiled again retired on january 1 , 2019 , but the then 15-year-old gelding left an indelible mark in harness racing annals in one of his last races at rosecroft raceway , he beat the then 10 year old career winner of over 600,000 , real flight i 'm themightyquinn ( foaled 2004 ) is an australasian champion standardbred notable for being a three time australian harness horse of the year and three-time winner of the inter dominion ( 2011 - 2013 ) in continental europe , races are conducted exclusively among trotters , whereas in australia , canada , new zealand , the united kingdom and the united states races are also held for pacers pacing races constitute 80 % to 90 % of the harness races conducted in north america - while the clear majority of harness racing in australia and new zealand are also now for pacers , even though the sport is colloquially still known as 'the trots ' pacing horses are faster and ( most important to the bettor ) less likely to break stride ( a horse which starts to gallop must be slowed down and taken to the outside until it resumes trotting or pacing ) the pace is a natural gait for many horses , and hobbles are an aid in supporting the gait at top speed ; trotting hobbles ( which employ a different design , due to the difference in the gait ) are becoming increasingly popular for the same reason most harness races start from behind a motorized starting gate , also known as the mobile barrier the sulky ( informally known as a '' bike '' , and also known as a spider ) is a light , two-wheeled cart equipped with bicycle wheels sweden is '' the locomotive '' of harness racing in scandinavia so the only '' pure '' thoroughbred track in sweden is bro park at solvalla in the suburbs of stockholm the premier standardbred mile race is held in late may every year , elitloppet ( the elite race ) other important annual races are svenskt travkriterium , a race restricted to three-year-olds , also hosted at solvalla and swedish trotting derby ( open for the best four-year-old horses ) hosted in september at jägersro in malmö the latter race track also hosts the hugo åbergs memorial , which is an international race open for all horses the race track 's length most usually is 1000 meters ( inner track ) with two long sides and two curves in pure mare horse races , horses from higher classification get 20 , 40 or up to 60 meter extra to run in such case the silver division horses must run 60 & nbsp ; m behind the less experienced class ii horses but numbers 6 and 7 ( who start in the second volt together with number 8 and higher ) may get up a better speed after the turn-around but before the starting whistle sounds horses may have different initial speed , but must not exceed the starting line before the start signal sounds horses number 6 and 7 can both get a better speed at the starting line , and there are no horses in front of them horses 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 and 13 , 14 , 15 have all horses in front of them but to get advantage of the '' running tracks '' the horse must be '' a fast starter '' how well this succeeds depends on the horse , the starting position and how the opponents drive their horses due to the sulky width and the oval race track overtaking is a far more difficult manoeuver to achieve , in comparison with gallop racing after the initial fight for good running position , the horses usually form two rows or tracks and horses in the inner track may very well be trapped all the way to the finish , due to the horses and sulkies in the outer track until the 1990s harness tracks featured a rail on the inside , much like the one at thoroughbred tracks in both new zealand and australia the same system of an 'open lane ' operates , although in australia it is called a 'sprint lane ' and in new zealand a 'passing lane ' the harness racing industry conducts an annual grand circuit , which includes many of the most prestigious races for both pacers and trotters the leading harness racing nations in europe are france , italy and sweden , and the sport is fairly popular in most northern european countries älgen stolta canadian horse racing hall of fame chariot racing harness racing museum & hall of fame harness racing in australia harness racing in new zealand harness racing in sweden

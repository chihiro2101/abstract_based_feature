vasubandhu 's abhidharmakośakārikā states , '' he who affirms the existence of the dharmas of the three time periods past , present and future is held to be a sarvāstivādin the sarvāstivāda was also known by other names , particularly hetuvada and yuktivada according to charles prebish , '' there is a great deal of mystery surrounding the rise and early development of the sarvāstivādin school since aśoka ’ s reign is around 268–232 b.c.e in central asia , several buddhist monastic groups were historically prevalent according to some accounts , the sarvāstivādins emerged from the sthavira nikāya , a small group of conservatives , who split from the reformist majority mahāsāṃghikas at the second buddhist council 126 and the origins of the sarvāstivāda have also been related to ashoka sending majjhantika ( sanskrit : madhyāntika ) on a mission to gandhara , which had an early presence of the sarvāstivāda the sarvāstivādins in turn are believed to have given rise to the mulasarvastivada sect , although the relationship between these two groups has not yet been fully determined according to prebish , '' this episode corresponds well with one sarvāstivādin tradition stating that madhyantika converted the city of kasmir , which seems to have close ties with gandhara '' a third tradition says that a community of sarvāstivādin monks was established at mathura by the patriarch upagupta in the sarvāstivādin tradition upagupta is said to have been the fifth patriarch after mahākaśyapa , ānanda , madhyāntika , and śāṇakavāsin , and in the ch'an tradition he is regarded as the fourth 127–150 ce ) emperor of the kushan empire , during which time they were greatly strengthened , and became one of the dominant sects of buddhism in north india for centuries , flourishing throughout northwest india , north india , and central asia when the sarvāstivāda school held a synod in kashmir during the reign of kanishka ii ( c 158-176 ) , the most important sarvāstivāda abhidharma text , the astagrantha of katyayaniputra was rewritten and revised in sanskrit though the gandharan astagrantha had many vibhaṣas ( commentaries ) , the new kashmiri jñānaprasthāna had a sanskrit mahavibhasa , compiled by the kashmir sarvāstivāda synod westerhoff , 2018 , p this new vaibhāṣika orthodoxy , however , was not readily accepted by all sarvāstivādins some '' western masters '' from gandhara and bactria had divergent views which disagreed with the new kashmiri orthodoxy 1552 ) , the abhidharmakośakārikā of vasubandhu and its commentaries ( who critiqued some orthodox views ) , and the nyāyānusāra ( ny ) of master saṃghabhadra ( ca fifth century ce ) who formulated the most robust vaibhāṣika response to the new criticisms when the chinese pilgrim xuanzang visited kucha in 630 ce , he received the favours of suvarna-deva , the son and successor of suvarna-puspa , and hinayana king of kucha sarvāstivāda was a widespread group , and there were different sub-schools or sects throughout its history , the most influential ones being the vaibhāṣika and the sautrāntika schools the vaibhāṣika was formed by adherents of the mahavibhasa ( mvś ) during the council of kashmir the vaibhāśika-sarvāstivāda , which had by far the most '' comprehensive edifice of doctrinal systematics '' of the early buddhist schools , '' one does not find anywhere else a body of doctrine as organized or as complete as theirs '' in various texts , they also referred to their tradition as yuktavāda ( the doctrine of logic ) , as well as hetuvāda ( the doctrine of causes ) these doctrines are all inter-connected and it is the principle of 'all exists ' that is the axial doctrine holding the larger movement together when the precise details of other doctrines are at stake according to vaibhāṣikas , svabhavas are those things that exist substantially ( dravyasat ) as opposed to those things which are made up of aggregations of dharmas and thus only have a nominal existence ( prajñaptisat ) the sautrāntika ( '' those who uphold the sūtras '' ) , also known as dārṣṭāntikas ( who may or may not have been a separate but related group ) , did not uphold the mahavibhasa , but rather emphasized the buddhist sūtras as being authoritative westerhoff , jan , the golden age of indian buddhist philosophy , oxford university press , 2018 , p they studied the same abhidharma texts as other sarvāstivādins , but in a more critical way those who rejected the most important sarvāstivāda doctrine ( along with numerous other key vaibhāṣika views ) , which came to be called sautrāntika ( those who rely on sutras ) the sautrāntikas did not reject abhidharma however , in fact they were the authors of several abhidharma manuals , like the abhidharmahṛdaya he is famous for his abhidharmakośa , a very influential abhidharma work , with an auto commentary that defends sautrāntika views the kośa was so influential that it became the abhidharma text par excellence in both east asian buddhism and indo-tibetan buddhism the later buddhist tradition of pramāṇa founded by dignāga and dharmakīrti is also associated with the sautrāntika school 187 in the 7th century , the existence of multiple vinaya lineages throughout china was criticized by prominent vinaya masters such as yijing and dao'an ( 654 & ndash ; 717 ) various other abhidharma works were written by sarvāstivāda masters , some are more concise manuals of abhidharma , others critiqued the orthodox vaibhāṣika views or provided a defense of the orthodoxy the is thought to have been authored around 150 ce , around the time of kaniṣka ( 127–151 ce ) of the kushan empire

sarvāstivāda is a sanskrit term that can be glossed as : '' the theory of all exists '' the sarvāstivāda argued that all dharmas exist in the past , present and future , the '' three times '' vasubandhu 's abhidharmakośakārikā states , '' he who affirms the existence of the dharmas of the three time periods past , present and future is held to be a sarvāstivādin '' although there is some dispute over how the word '' sarvāstivāda '' is to be analyzed , the general consensus is that it is to be parsed into three parts : sarva '' all '' or '' every '' + asti '' exist '' + vada '' speak '' , '' say '' or '' theory '' this equates perfectly with the chinese term , shuōyīqièyǒu bù , taisho 27 , n1545 which is literally '' the sect that speaks of the existence of everything , '' as used by xuanzang and other translators the sarvāstivāda was also known by other names , particularly hetuvada and yuktivada yuktivada comes from yukti – 'reason ' or even 'logic ' , which shows their use of rational argument and syllogism according to charles prebish , '' there is a great deal of mystery surrounding the rise and early development of the sarvāstivādin school pg 42-43 according to dhammajoti , '' its presence , as well as that of its rival — the vibhajyavāda lineage — in the time of emperor aśoka is beyond doubt since aśoka ’ s reign is around 268–232 b.c.e in central asia , several buddhist monastic groups were historically prevalent according to some accounts , the sarvāstivādins emerged from the sthavira nikāya , a small group of conservatives , who split from the reformist majority mahāsāṃghikas at the second buddhist council according to this account , they were expelled from magadha , and moved to northwestern india where they developed into the sarvāstivādin school 126 and the origins of the sarvāstivāda have also been related to ashoka sending majjhantika ( sanskrit : madhyāntika ) on a mission to gandhara , which had an early presence of the sarvāstivāda the sarvāstivādins in turn are believed to have given rise to the mulasarvastivada sect , although the relationship between these two groups has not yet been fully determined according to prebish , '' this episode corresponds well with one sarvāstivādin tradition stating that madhyantika converted the city of kasmir , which seems to have close ties with gandhara '' a third tradition says that a community of sarvāstivādin monks was established at mathura by the patriarch upagupta in the sarvāstivādin tradition upagupta is said to have been the fifth patriarch after mahākaśyapa , ānanda , madhyāntika , and śāṇakavāsin , and in the ch'an tradition he is regarded as the fourth 127–150 ce ) emperor of the kushan empire , during which time they were greatly strengthened , and became one of the dominant sects of buddhism in north india for centuries , flourishing throughout northwest india , north india , and central asia when the sarvāstivāda school held a synod in kashmir during the reign of kanishka ii ( c 158-176 ) , the most important sarvāstivāda abhidharma text , the astagrantha of katyayaniputra was rewritten and revised in sanskrit some '' western masters '' from gandhara and bactria had divergent views which disagreed with the new kashmiri orthodoxy sarvāstivāda was a widespread group , and there were different sub-schools or sects throughout its history , the most influential ones being the vaibhāṣika and the sautrāntika schools since then , it comprised the orthodox or mainstream branch of the sarvāstivāda school based in kāśmīra ( though not exclusive to this region ) the vaibhāśika-sarvāstivāda , which had by far the most '' comprehensive edifice of doctrinal systematics '' of the early buddhist schools , '' one does not find anywhere else a body of doctrine as organized or as complete as theirs '' '' indeed , no other competing schools have ever come close to building up such a comprehensive edifice of doctrinal systematics as the vaibhāśika university of wisconsin-madison : 1987 pg 3 as noted by kl dhammajoti , '' it is important to realize that not all of them necessarily subscribed to each and every view sanctioned by the mvś compilers these doctrines are all inter-connected and it is the principle of 'all exists ' that is the axial doctrine holding the larger movement together when the precise details of other doctrines are at stake the term was also identified as a unique mark or own characteristic ( svalaksana ) that differentiated a dharma and remained unchangeable throughout its existence the sautrāntika ( '' those who uphold the sūtras '' ) , also known as dārṣṭāntikas ( who may or may not have been a separate but related group ) , did not uphold the mahavibhasa , but rather emphasized the buddhist sūtras as being authoritative westerhoff , jan , the golden age of indian buddhist philosophy , oxford university press , 2018 , p scholars at present have '' a nearly complete collection of sūtras from the sarvāstivāda school '' thanks to a recent discovery in afghanistan of roughly two-thirds of the dīrgha āgama in sanskrit dhammajoti provides the following list of such later abhidharma works that are extant in chinese : 108 109 abhidharmāmṛta ( -rasa ) -śāstra ( t no 55-56 however , in the corresponding passage found in the later śāriputraparipṛcchā , the

sarvāstivāda is a sanskrit term that can be glossed as : '' the theory of all exists '' the sarvāstivāda argued that all dharmas exist in the past , present and future , the '' three times '' vasubandhu 's abhidharmakośakārikā states , '' he who affirms the existence of the dharmas of the three time periods past , present and future is held to be a sarvāstivādin '' although there is some dispute over how the word '' sarvāstivāda '' is to be analyzed , the general consensus is that it is to be parsed into three parts : sarva '' all '' or '' every '' + asti '' exist '' + vada '' speak '' , '' say '' or '' theory '' this equates perfectly with the chinese term , shuōyīqièyǒu bù , taisho 27 , n1545 which is literally '' the sect that speaks of the existence of everything , '' as used by xuanzang and other translators the sarvāstivāda was also known by other names , particularly hetuvada and yuktivada according to charles prebish , '' there is a great deal of mystery surrounding the rise and early development of the sarvāstivādin school pg 42-43 according to dhammajoti , '' its presence , as well as that of its rival — the vibhajyavāda lineage — in the time of emperor aśoka is beyond doubt since aśoka ’ s reign is around 268–232 b.c.e in central asia , several buddhist monastic groups were historically prevalent according to some accounts , the sarvāstivādins emerged from the sthavira nikāya , a small group of conservatives , who split from the reformist majority mahāsāṃghikas at the second buddhist council according to this account , they were expelled from magadha , and moved to northwestern india where they developed into the sarvāstivādin school 126 and the origins of the sarvāstivāda have also been related to ashoka sending majjhantika ( sanskrit : madhyāntika ) on a mission to gandhara , which had an early presence of the sarvāstivāda when the sarvāstivāda school held a synod in kashmir during the reign of kanishka ii ( c though the gandharan astagrantha had many vibhaṣas ( commentaries ) , the new kashmiri jñānaprasthāna had a sanskrit mahavibhasa , compiled by the kashmir sarvāstivāda synod 1552 ) , the abhidharmakośakārikā of vasubandhu and its commentaries ( who critiqued some orthodox views ) , and the nyāyānusāra ( ny ) of master saṃghabhadra ( ca fifth century ce ) who formulated the most robust vaibhāṣika response to the new criticisms xuanzang described in many details the characteristics of kucha , and probably visited the kizil caves sarvāstivāda was a widespread group , and there were different sub-schools or sects throughout its history , the most influential ones being the vaibhāṣika and the sautrāntika schools the vaibhāśika-sarvāstivāda , which had by far the most '' comprehensive edifice of doctrinal systematics '' of the early buddhist schools , '' one does not find anywhere else a body of doctrine as organized or as complete as theirs '' in various texts , they also referred to their tradition as yuktavāda ( the doctrine of logic ) , as well as hetuvāda ( the doctrine of causes ) the vaibhāṣika school saw itself as the orthodox sarvāstivāda tradition , and they were united in their doctrinal defense of the theory of '' all exists '' ( sarvām asti ) while the vaibhāṣikas held that dharmas of the three times all exist , they held that only present dharmas have '' efficacy '' ( karitra ) , thus they were able to explain how the present seems to function differently than the past or future poussin ; pruden , abhidharmakosabhasyam of vasubandhu , vol 3 , 1991 , p in order to explain how it is possible for a dharma to remain the same and yet also undergo change as it moves through the three times , the vaibhāṣika held that dharmas have a constant essence ( svabhava ) which persists through the three times the term was also identified as a unique mark or own characteristic ( svalaksana ) that differentiated a dharma and remained unchangeable throughout its existence the sautrāntika ( '' those who uphold the sūtras '' ) , also known as dārṣṭāntikas ( who may or may not have been a separate but related group ) , did not uphold the mahavibhasa , but rather emphasized the buddhist sūtras as being authoritative already by the time of the mvś , the early dārṣṭāntikas such as dharmatrāta and buddhadeva , existed as a school of thought within the fold of the sarvāstivāda who disagreed with the orthodox views these groups were also called '' the western masters '' ( pāścātya ) , the foreign masters ( bahirdeśaka ; also called ‘ the masters outside kaśmīra ’ , and the ‘ gāndhārian masters ’ ) he is famous for his abhidharmakośa , a very influential abhidharma work , with an auto commentary that defends sautrāntika views willemen , dessein , and cox hold that this group is really the sautrāntika school who renamed themselves in the later years of the sarvāstivāda school history 52 the complete sarvāstivāda vinaya is extant in the chinese buddhist canon in its early history , the sarvāstivāda vinaya was the most common vinaya tradition in china however , chinese buddhism later settled on the dharmaguptaka vinaya in the early 8th century , daoan gained the support of emperor zhongzong of tang , and an imperial edict was issued that the saṃgha in china should use only the dharmaguptaka vinaya for ordination scholars at present have '' a nearly complete collection of sūtras from the sarvāstivāda school '' thanks to a recent discovery in afghanistan of roughly two-thirds of the dīrgha āgama in sanskrit various other abhidharma works were written by sarvāstivāda masters , some are more concise manuals of abhidharma , others critiqued the orthodox vaibhāṣika views or provided a defense of the orthodoxy sarvāstivādin meditation teachers also worked on the dhyāna sutras , a group of early buddhist meditation texts which were translated into chinese and became influential in the development of chinese buddhist meditation methods

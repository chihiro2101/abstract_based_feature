the sarvāstivāda argued that all dharmas exist in the past , present and future , the '' three times '' vasubandhu 's abhidharmakośakārikā states , '' he who affirms the existence of the dharmas of the three time periods past , present and future is held to be a sarvāstivādin '' although there is some dispute over how the word '' sarvāstivāda '' is to be analyzed , the general consensus is that it is to be parsed into three parts : sarva '' all '' or '' every '' + asti '' exist '' + vada '' speak '' , '' say '' or '' theory '' this equates perfectly with the chinese term , shuōyīqièyǒu bù , taisho 27 , n1545 which is literally '' the sect that speaks of the existence of everything , '' as used by xuanzang and other translators the sarvāstivāda was also known by other names , particularly hetuvada and yuktivada according to charles prebish , '' there is a great deal of mystery surrounding the rise and early development of the sarvāstivādin school according to some accounts , the sarvāstivādins emerged from the sthavira nikāya , a small group of conservatives , who split from the reformist majority mahāsāṃghikas at the second buddhist council 126 and the origins of the sarvāstivāda have also been related to ashoka sending majjhantika ( sanskrit : madhyāntika ) on a mission to gandhara , which had an early presence of the sarvāstivāda the sarvāstivādins in turn are believed to have given rise to the mulasarvastivada sect , although the relationship between these two groups has not yet been fully determined according to prebish , '' this episode corresponds well with one sarvāstivādin tradition stating that madhyantika converted the city of kasmir , which seems to have close ties with gandhara '' a third tradition says that a community of sarvāstivādin monks was established at mathura by the patriarch upagupta 127–150 ce ) emperor of the kushan empire , during which time they were greatly strengthened , and became one of the dominant sects of buddhism in north india for centuries , flourishing throughout northwest india , north india , and central asia when the sarvāstivāda school held a synod in kashmir during the reign of kanishka ii ( c 158-176 ) , the most important sarvāstivāda abhidharma text , the astagrantha of katyayaniputra was rewritten and revised in sanskrit though the gandharan astagrantha had many vibhaṣas ( commentaries ) , the new kashmiri jñānaprasthāna had a sanskrit mahavibhasa , compiled by the kashmir sarvāstivāda synod this new vaibhāṣika orthodoxy , however , was not readily accepted by all sarvāstivādins xuanzang described in many details the characteristics of kucha , and probably visited the kizil caves of the religion of the people of kucha , he says that they were sarvastivadas and writes : , also available in : the vaibhāṣika was formed by adherents of the mahavibhasa ( mvś ) during the council of kashmir the vaibhāśika-sarvāstivāda , which had by far the most '' comprehensive edifice of doctrinal systematics '' of the early buddhist schools , '' one does not find anywhere else a body of doctrine as organized or as complete as theirs '' moreover , the evolving nature of the vaibhāṣika views must be recognized as well in various texts , they also referred to their tradition as yuktavāda ( the doctrine of logic ) , as well as hetuvāda ( the doctrine of causes ) the vaibhāṣika school saw itself as the orthodox sarvāstivāda tradition , and they were united in their doctrinal defense of the theory of '' all exists '' ( sarvām asti ) while the vaibhāṣikas held that dharmas of the three times all exist , they held that only present dharmas have '' efficacy '' ( karitra ) , thus they were able to explain how the present seems to function differently than the past or future these differences were accepted as long as they did not contradict the doctrine of '' all exists '' and can be seen in the mvś , which outlines the four different interpretations of this doctrine by the ‘ four great ābhidharmikas of the sarvāstivāda ’ : dharmatrāta , buddhadeva , vasumitra and ghoṣaka in order to explain how it is possible for a dharma to remain the same and yet also undergo change as it moves through the three times , the vaibhāṣika held that dharmas have a constant essence ( svabhava ) which persists through the three times the sautrāntika ( '' those who uphold the sūtras '' ) , also known as dārṣṭāntikas ( who may or may not have been a separate but related group ) , did not uphold the mahavibhasa , but rather emphasized the buddhist sūtras as being authoritative westerhoff , jan , the golden age of indian buddhist philosophy , oxford university press , 2018 , p they studied the same abhidharma texts as other sarvāstivādins , but in a more critical way according to kl dhammajoti , they eventually came to repudiate the sarvāstivāda doctrine of '' all exists he is famous for his abhidharmakośa , a very influential abhidharma work , with an auto commentary that defends sautrāntika views there is much uncertainty as to the relationship of the mūlasarvāstivāda ( meaning root or original sarvāstivāda ) school and the others also , they seem to have been influential in indonesia by the 7th century , as noted by yijing various other abhidharma works were written by sarvāstivāda masters , some are more concise manuals of abhidharma , others critiqued the orthodox vaibhāṣika views or provided a defense of the orthodoxy in traditions of tibetan buddhism , which follow the mūlasarvāstivāda vinaya , red robes are regarded as characteristic of their tradition the is thought to have been authored around 150 ce , around the time of kaniṣka ( 127–151 ce ) of the kushan empire 410 étienne lamotte has also pointed out that a sarvāstivāda master is known to have stated that the mahāyāna prajñā sūtras were to be found amongst their vaipulya sūtras

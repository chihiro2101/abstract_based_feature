although aerial photography was first used extensively in the first world war , it was only in the second world war that specialized imagery intelligence operations were initiated these planes had a maximum speed of 396 & nbsp ; mph at 30,000 feet with their armaments removed , and were used for photo-reconnaissance missions the systematic collection and interpretation of the huge amounts of aerial reconnaissance intelligence data soon became imperative unlocking buckinghamshire 's past the central interpretation unit ( ciu ) was later amalgamated with the bomber command damage assessment section and the night photographic interpretation section of no 3 photographic reconnaissance unit , raf oakington , in 1942 allied central interpretation unit ( aciu ) during 1942 and 1943 , the ciu gradually expanded and was involved in the planning stages of practically every operation of the war , and in every aspect of intelligence american personnel had for some time formed an increasing part of the ciu and on 1 may 1944 this was finally recognised by changing the title of the unit to the allied central interpretation unit ( aciu ) sidney cotton 's aerial photographs were far ahead of their time immediately after world war ii , long range aerial reconnaissance was taken up by adapted jet bombers – such as the english electric canberra , and its american development , the martin b-57 – capable of flying higher or faster than the enemy since the early 1960s , in the united states aerial and satellite reconnaissance has been coordinated by the national reconnaissance office early photographic reconnaissance satellites used photographic film , which was exposed on-orbit and returned to earth for developing this was the first successful recovery of film from an orbiting satellite and the first aerial recovery of an object returning from earth orbit unmanned aerial vehicles have been developed for imagery and signals intelligence since 1985 , commercial vendors of satellite imagery have entered the market , beginning with the french spot satellites , which had resolutions between 5 and 20 metres like first phase imagery analysis , second phase imagery analysis is generally catalyzed by a local commander 's priority intelligence requirements , at least in the context of a military operational setting third phase imagery analysis is generally conducted in order to satisfy strategic intelligence questions or to otherwise explore existing data in the search of '' discovery intelligence third phase imagery analysis incorporates supporting information and intelligence from other intelligence gathering disciplines and is , therefore , generally conducted in support of a multi-source intelligence team introduction to imagery intelligence via globalsecurity australian defence satellite communications station , geraldton joint australian-us intelligence facility - pine gap

although aerial photography was first used extensively in the first world war , it was only in the second world war that specialized imagery intelligence operations were initiated in 1928 , the raf developed an electric heating system for the aerial camera this allowed reconnaissance aircraft to take pictures from very high altitudes without the camera parts freezing these planes had a maximum speed of 396 & nbsp ; mph at 30,000 feet with their armaments removed , and were used for photo-reconnaissance missions the systematic collection and interpretation of the huge amounts of aerial reconnaissance intelligence data soon became imperative beginning in 1941 , raf medmenham was the main interpretation centre for photographic reconnaissance operations in the european and mediterranean theatres allied central interpretation unit ( aciu ) during 1942 and 1943 , the ciu gradually expanded and was involved in the planning stages of practically every operation of the war , and in every aspect of intelligence american personnel had for some time formed an increasing part of the ciu and on 1 may 1944 this was finally recognised by changing the title of the unit to the allied central interpretation unit ( aciu ) jones , photographs were used to establish the size and the characteristic launching mechanisms for both the v-1 flying bomb and the v-2 rocket highly specialized and secretive strategic reconnaissance aircraft , or spy planes , such as the lockheed u-2 and its successor , the sr-71 blackbird were developed by the united states the first successful mission concluded on 1960-08-19 with the mid-air recovery by a c-119 of film from the corona mission code-named discoverer 14 because of a tradeoff between area covered and ground resolution , not all reconnaissance satellites have been designed for high resolution ; the kh-5-argon program had a ground resolution of 140 meters and was intended for mapmaking these satellites used charge-coupled devices , predecessors to modern digital cameras , rather than film low- and high-flying planes have been used all through the last century to gather intelligence about the enemy due to the need to produce near-real time intelligence assessments based upon collected imagery , first phase imagery analysis is rarely compared to collateral intelligence third phase imagery analysis is generally conducted in order to satisfy strategic intelligence questions or to otherwise explore existing data in the search of '' discovery intelligence introduction to imagery intelligence via globalsecurity australian defence satellite communications station , geraldton joint australian-us intelligence facility - pine gap

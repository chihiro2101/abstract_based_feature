although aerial photography was first used extensively in the first world war , it was only in the second world war that specialized imagery intelligence operations were initiated the aircraft were fitted with five cameras which were heated to ensure good results the systematic collection and interpretation of the huge amounts of aerial reconnaissance intelligence data soon became imperative beginning in 1941 , raf medmenham was the main interpretation centre for photographic reconnaissance operations in the european and mediterranean theatres unlocking buckinghamshire 's past the central interpretation unit ( ciu ) was later amalgamated with the bomber command damage assessment section and the night photographic interpretation section of no 3 photographic reconnaissance unit , raf oakington , in 1942 allied central interpretation unit ( aciu ) during 1942 and 1943 , the ciu gradually expanded and was involved in the planning stages of practically every operation of the war , and in every aspect of intelligence two renowned archaeologists also worked there as interpreters : dorothy garrod , the first woman to hold an oxbridge chair , and glyn daniel , who went on to gain popular acclaim as the host of the television game show animal , vegetable or mineral ? together with other members of his reconnaissance squadron , he pioneered the technique of high-altitude , high-speed photography that was instrumental in revealing the locations of many crucial military and intelligence targets highly specialized and secretive strategic reconnaissance aircraft , or spy planes , such as the lockheed u-2 and its successor , the sr-71 blackbird were developed by the united states since the early 1960s , in the united states aerial and satellite reconnaissance has been coordinated by the national reconnaissance office early photographic reconnaissance satellites used photographic film , which was exposed on-orbit and returned to earth for developing because of a tradeoff between area covered and ground resolution , not all reconnaissance satellites have been designed for high resolution ; the kh-5-argon program had a ground resolution of 140 meters and was intended for mapmaking kh-11 series of satellites , first launched in 1976 , was made by lockheed , the same contractor who built the hubble space telescope unmanned aerial vehicles have been developed for imagery and signals intelligence some of the multi-spectral sensors , such as thermal measurement , are more electro-optical masint than true imint platforms due to the need to produce near-real time intelligence assessments based upon collected imagery , first phase imagery analysis is rarely compared to collateral intelligence third phase imagery analysis incorporates supporting information and intelligence from other intelligence gathering disciplines and is , therefore , generally conducted in support of a multi-source intelligence team

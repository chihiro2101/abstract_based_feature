although aerial photography was first used extensively in the first world war , it was only in the second world war that specialized imagery intelligence operations were initiated this allowed reconnaissance aircraft to take pictures from very high altitudes without the camera parts freezing in 1939 , sidney cotton and flying officer maurice longbottom of the raf suggested that airborne reconnaissance may be a task better suited to fast , small aircraft which would use their speed and high service ceiling to avoid detection and interception the systematic collection and interpretation of the huge amounts of aerial reconnaissance intelligence data soon became imperative beginning in 1941 , raf medmenham was the main interpretation centre for photographic reconnaissance operations in the european and mediterranean theatres unlocking buckinghamshire 's past the central interpretation unit ( ciu ) was later amalgamated with the bomber command damage assessment section and the night photographic interpretation section of no 3 photographic reconnaissance unit , raf oakington , in 1942 cotton also worked on ideas such as a prototype specialist reconnaissance aircraft and further refinements of photographic equipment as a result , the crews of these aircraft were invariably specially selected and trained since the early 1960s , in the united states aerial and satellite reconnaissance has been coordinated by the national reconnaissance office early photographic reconnaissance satellites used photographic film , which was exposed on-orbit and returned to earth for developing the first successful mission concluded on 1960-08-19 with the mid-air recovery by a c-119 of film from the corona mission code-named discoverer 14 because of a tradeoff between area covered and ground resolution , not all reconnaissance satellites have been designed for high resolution ; the kh-5-argon program had a ground resolution of 140 meters and was intended for mapmaking due to the need to produce near-real time intelligence assessments based upon collected imagery , first phase imagery analysis is rarely compared to collateral intelligence '' third phase imagery analysis hinges on the use of a large repository of historical imagery as well as access to a variety of sources of information third phase imagery analysis incorporates supporting information and intelligence from other intelligence gathering disciplines and is , therefore , generally conducted in support of a multi-source intelligence team the exploitation of imagery at this level of analysis is typically conducted with the intention of producing geoint ( geoint ) introduction to imagery intelligence via globalsecurity australian defence satellite communications station , geraldton joint australian-us intelligence facility - pine gap

although aerial photography was first used extensively in the first world war , it was only in the second world war that specialized imagery intelligence operations were initiated in 1928 , the raf developed an electric heating system for the aerial camera this allowed reconnaissance aircraft to take pictures from very high altitudes without the camera parts freezing these planes had a maximum speed of 396 & nbsp ; mph at 30,000 feet with their armaments removed , and were used for photo-reconnaissance missions the systematic collection and interpretation of the huge amounts of aerial reconnaissance intelligence data soon became imperative beginning in 1941 , raf medmenham was the main interpretation centre for photographic reconnaissance operations in the european and mediterranean theatres unlocking buckinghamshire 's past the central interpretation unit ( ciu ) was later amalgamated with the bomber command damage assessment section and the night photographic interpretation section of no 3 photographic reconnaissance unit , raf oakington , in 1942 allied central interpretation unit ( aciu ) during 1942 and 1943 , the ciu gradually expanded and was involved in the planning stages of practically every operation of the war , and in every aspect of intelligence together with other members of his reconnaissance squadron , he pioneered the technique of high-altitude , high-speed photography that was instrumental in revealing the locations of many crucial military and intelligence targets flying these aircraft became an exceptionally demanding task , as much because of the aircraft 's extreme speed and altitude as it was because of the risk of being captured as spy early photographic reconnaissance satellites used photographic film , which was exposed on-orbit and returned to earth for developing kh-11 series of satellites , first launched in 1976 , was made by lockheed , the same contractor who built the hubble space telescope unmanned aerial vehicles have been developed for imagery and signals intelligence were the hubble space telescope , with a 2.4 m telescope , designed for photographing earth , it would be diffraction-limited to resolutions greater than 16 & nbsp ; cm ( 6 & nbsp ; inches ) for green light ( \lambda \approx 550 nm ) at its orbital altitude of 590 & nbsp ; km like first phase imagery analysis , second phase imagery analysis is generally catalyzed by a local commander 's priority intelligence requirements , at least in the context of a military operational setting third phase imagery analysis incorporates supporting information and intelligence from other intelligence gathering disciplines and is , therefore , generally conducted in support of a multi-source intelligence team united states department of agriculture geospatial data availability for haiti ( february 2007 ) ( study on availability of commercial imagery in 2007 which summarizes collection systems and data products

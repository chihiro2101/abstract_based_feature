although aerial photography was first used extensively in the first world war , it was only in the second world war that specialized imagery intelligence operations were initiated high quality images were made possible with a series of innovations in the decade leading up to the war in 1928 , the raf developed an electric heating system for the aerial camera these planes had a maximum speed of 396 & nbsp ; mph at 30,000 feet with their armaments removed , and were used for photo-reconnaissance missions the systematic collection and interpretation of the huge amounts of aerial reconnaissance intelligence data soon became imperative allied central interpretation unit ( aciu ) during 1942 and 1943 , the ciu gradually expanded and was involved in the planning stages of practically every operation of the war , and in every aspect of intelligence in 1945 , daily intake of material averaged 25,000 negatives and 60,000 prints american personnel had for some time formed an increasing part of the ciu and on 1 may 1944 this was finally recognised by changing the title of the unit to the allied central interpretation unit ( aciu ) cotton also worked on ideas such as a prototype specialist reconnaissance aircraft and further refinements of photographic equipment of particular significance in the success of the work of medmenham was the use of stereoscopic images , using a between plate overlap of exactly 60 % later offensives were also made against potential launch sites at wizernes and 96 other launch sites in northern france low- and high-flying planes have been used all through the last century to gather intelligence about the enemy satellites for imaging intelligence were usually placed in high-inclination low earth orbits , sometimes in sun-synchronous orbits to counter the threat posed by these '' eyes in the sky , '' the united states , ussr/russia , china and india have developed anti-satellite weapon ( either with the use of another 'killer satellite ' , or with some sort of earth- or air-launched missile ) third phase imagery analysis is generally conducted in order to satisfy strategic intelligence questions or to otherwise explore existing data in the search of '' discovery intelligence third phase imagery analysis incorporates supporting information and intelligence from other intelligence gathering disciplines and is , therefore , generally conducted in support of a multi-source intelligence team introduction to imagery intelligence via globalsecurity australian defence satellite communications station , geraldton joint australian-us intelligence facility - pine gap

messages in the eas are composed of four parts : a digitally encoded specific area message encoding ( same ) header , an attention signal , an audio announcement , and a digitally encoded end-of-message marker there are 77 radio stations designated as national primary stations in the primary entry point ( pep ) system to distribute presidential messages to other broadcast stations and cable systems the emergency action notification is the notice to broadcasters that the president of the united states or their designee will deliver a message over the eas via the pep system the government has stated that the system would allow a president to speak during a national emergency within 10 minutes the national public warning system , also known as the primary entry point ( pep ) stations , are a network of 77 radio stations that are , in coordination with fema , used to originate emergency alert and warning information to the public before , during , and after incidents and disasters pep stations are equipped with additional and backup communications equipment and power generators designed to enable them to continue broadcasting information to the public during and after an event the fema national radio system ( fnars ) '' provides primary entry point service to the emergency alert system '' , and acts as an emergency presidential link into the eas the fnars net control station is located at the mount weather emergency operations center once an ean is received by an eas participant from a pep station ( or any other participant ) the message then '' daisy chains ' '' through the network of participants '' daisy chains '' form when one station receives a message from multiple other stations and the station then forwards that message to multiple other stations on commercial broadcast stations , a attention signal of 853 & nbsp ; hz and 960 & nbsp ; hz sine waves is used instead , the same signal used by the older emergency broadcast system the '' two-tone '' system is no longer required as of 1998 , and is to be used only for audio alerts before eas messages the message ends with 3 bursts of the afsk '' eom '' , or end of message , which is the text nnnn , preceded each time by the binary 10101011 calibration government was instructed to create '' an effective , reliable , integrated , flexible , and comprehensive '' public warning system this was accomplished via expansions to the aforementioned pep network , and the development of the integrated public alert and warning system ( ipaws ) â€”a national aggregator and distributor of alert information using the xml-based common alerting protocol ( cap ) and an internet network the fcc requires all broadcast stations and multichannel video programming distributors ( mvpd ) , hereafter '' eas participants '' , to install and maintain fcc-certified eas decoders and encoders at their control points or headends these decoders continuously monitor the signals from other nearby broadcast stations for eas messages eas participants are required by federal law to relay emergency action notification ( ean ) messages immediately ( 47 cfr part 11.54 ) though an rwt does not need an audio or graphic message announcing the test , many stations provide them as a courtesy to the public in addition , television stations are not required to transmit a video message for weekly tests required monthly tests ( rmts ) are generally originated by the local or state primary station , a state emergency management agency , or by the national weather service and are then relayed by broadcast stations and cable channels they are not relayed on the noaa weather radio ( noaa/nws ) network as it is an initiation-only network and does not receive messages from the pep network the national test would transmit and relay an emergency action notification on november 9 , 2011 at 2:00 & nbsp ; p.m it was preceded by the first mandatory wireless emergency alert test the fifth npt occurred on august 7 , 2019 , moved up from past years to prevent it from occurring during the heart of the atlantic hurricane season the test focused exclusively on distribution to broadcast outlets and television providers via the primary entry point network , in order to gauge the efficiency of alert distribution in the event that the internet can not be used the number of event types in the national system has grown to eighty at first , all but three of the events ( civil emergency message , immediate evacuation , and emergency action notification national emergency ) were weather-related ( such as a tornado warning ) since then , several classes of non-weather emergencies have been added , including , in most states , the amber alert system for child abduction emergencies the alert was followed by dead air , and then audio from designated station 720 wgn in chicago being simulcast across almost every television and radio station in the chicago area and throughout much of illinois officials cited an error in the county 's code red system ; while the correct message was entered into the system , an error processing an abbreviated message for television resulted in the error tones from the eas were used in the trailer for the 2013 film olympus has fallen ; cable providers were fined 1.9 million by the federal communications commission ( fcc ) on march 3 , 2014 for misuse of eas tones

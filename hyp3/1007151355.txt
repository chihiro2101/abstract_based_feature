messages in the eas are composed of four parts : a digitally encoded specific area message encoding ( same ) header , an attention signal , an audio announcement , and a digitally encoded end-of-message marker there are 77 radio stations designated as national primary stations in the primary entry point ( pep ) system to distribute presidential messages to other broadcast stations and cable systems the emergency action notification is the notice to broadcasters that the president of the united states or their designee will deliver a message over the eas via the pep system the government has stated that the system would allow a president to speak during a national emergency within 10 minutes the national public warning system , also known as the primary entry point ( pep ) stations , are a network of 77 radio stations that are , in coordination with fema , used to originate emergency alert and warning information to the public before , during , and after incidents and disasters beginning with wjr/detroit and wlw/cincinnati in 2016 , fema began the process of constructing transportable studio shelters at the transmitters of 33 pep stations , which feature broadcasting equipment , emergency provisions , a rest area , and an air filtration system the fema national radio system ( fnars ) '' provides primary entry point service to the emergency alert system '' , and acts as an emergency presidential link into the eas '' daisy chains '' form when one station receives a message from multiple other stations and the station then forwards that message to multiple other stations this process creates many redundant paths through which the message may flow increasing the likelihood that the message will be received by all participants and adding to the survivability of the system the decoder then decides whether to ignore the message or to relay it on the air if the message applies to the local area served by the station ( following parameters set by the broadcaster ) the same header bursts are followed by an attention tone , which lasts between 8 and 25 seconds , depending on the originating station on commercial broadcast stations , a attention signal of 853 & nbsp ; hz and 960 & nbsp ; hz sine waves is used instead , the same signal used by the older emergency broadcast system these tones have become infamous , and can be considered both frightening and annoying by viewers ; in fact , the two tones , which form approximately the interval of a just major second at an unusually high pitch , were chosen specifically for their ability to draw attention , due to their unpleasantness on the human ear like the ebs , the attention signal is followed by a voice message describing the details of the alert the message ends with 3 bursts of the afsk '' eom '' , or end of message , which is the text nnnn , preceded each time by the binary 10101011 calibration government was instructed to create '' an effective , reliable , integrated , flexible , and comprehensive '' public warning system this was accomplished via expansions to the aforementioned pep network , and the development of the integrated public alert and warning system ( ipaws ) â€”a national aggregator and distributor of alert information using the xml-based common alerting protocol ( cap ) and an internet network ipaws can be used to distribute alert information to eas participants , supported mobile phones ( wireless emergency alerts ) , and other platforms the fcc requires all broadcast stations and multichannel video programming distributors ( mvpd ) , hereafter '' eas participants '' , to install and maintain fcc-certified eas decoders and encoders at their control points or headends eas participants are required by federal law to relay emergency action notification ( ean ) messages immediately ( 47 cfr part 11.54 ) broadcasters traditionally have been allowed to opt out of relaying other alerts such as severe weather , and child abduction emergencies ( amber alerts ) if they so choose ( in practice , severe weather coverage is usually handled by a station 's local news operation and on-air meteorologists , rather than processed through eas ) in addition to the audio messages transmitted by radio stations , television stations must broadcast a visual display containing the originator , event , location , time period , 47 & nbsp ; c.f.r in addition , television stations are not required to transmit a video message for weekly tests required monthly tests ( rmts ) are generally originated by the local or state primary station , a state emergency management agency , or by the national weather service and are then relayed by broadcast stations and cable channels no testing has to be done during a calendar week in which all parts of the eas ( header burst , attention signal , audio message , and end of message burst ) have been legitimately activated the fcc found that only half of participants received the message via ipaws , and some '' failed to receive or retransmit alerts due to erroneous equipment configuration , equipment readiness and upkeep issues , and confusion regarding eas rules and technical requirements '' , and that participation among low-power broadcasters was low at first , all but three of the events ( civil emergency message , immediate evacuation , and emergency action notification national emergency ) were weather-related ( such as a tornado warning ) cdt , an emergency action notification was accidentally issued in the state of illinois , when a new satellite receiver at the state 's eoc was accidentally connected to a live system before final internal testing of the new delivery path had been completed officials cited an error in the county 's code red system ; while the correct message was entered into the system , an error processing an abbreviated message for television resulted in the error local time , the hawaii emergency management agency ( hi-ema ) mistakenly 2018 hawaii false missile alert , which was claimed to be not a drill on april 7 , 2020 , the fcc proposed a 20,000 fine against new york city radio station wnew-fm , for using the attention signal during its morning show on october 3 , 2018 as part of a skit discussing the national periodic test held later that day after the fine was levied , various state broadcast associations in the united states submitted joint letters to the fcc , protesting against the fine , saying that the commission could have handled the matter better

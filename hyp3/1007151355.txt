messages in the eas are composed of four parts : a digitally encoded specific area message encoding ( same ) header , an attention signal , an audio announcement , and a digitally encoded end-of-message marker there are 77 radio stations designated as national primary stations in the primary entry point ( pep ) system to distribute presidential messages to other broadcast stations and cable systems the emergency action notification is the notice to broadcasters that the president of the united states or their designee will deliver a message over the eas via the pep system the government has stated that the system would allow a president to speak during a national emergency within 10 minutes . primary entry point stations the national public warning system , also known as the primary entry point ( pep ) stations , are a network of 77 radio stations that are , in coordination with fema , used to originate emergency alert and warning information to the public before , during , and after incidents and disasters pep stations are equipped with additional and backup communications equipment and power generators designed to enable them to continue broadcasting information to the public during and after an event the fema national radio system ( fnars ) '' provides primary entry point service to the emergency alert system '' , and acts as an emergency presidential link into the eas '' daisy chains '' form when one station receives a message from multiple other stations and the station then forwards that message to multiple other stations this process creates many redundant paths through which the message may flow increasing the likelihood that the message will be received by all participants and adding to the survivability of the system the '' two-tone '' system is no longer required as of 1998 , and is to be used only for audio alerts before eas messages like the ebs , the attention signal is followed by a voice message describing the details of the alert the message ends with 3 bursts of the afsk '' eom '' , or end of message , which is the text nnnn , preceded each time by the binary 10101011 calibration this was accomplished via expansions to the aforementioned pep network , and the development of the integrated public alert and warning system ( ipaws ) —a national aggregator and distributor of alert information using the xml-based common alerting protocol ( cap ) and an internet network under an fcc report and order issued in 2007 , eas participants would be required to migrate to digital equipment supporting cap within 180 days of the specification 's adoption by fema therefore , broadcasters must convert cap messages to legacy same headers to enable backwards compatibility with the existing '' daisy chain '' method of eas distribution , providing a backup distribution path the fcc requires all broadcast stations and multichannel video programming distributors ( mvpd ) , hereafter '' eas participants '' , to install and maintain fcc-certified eas decoders and encoders at their control points or headends eas participants are required by federal law to relay emergency action notification ( ean ) messages immediately ( 47 cfr part 11.54 ) in addition to the audio messages transmitted by radio stations , television stations must broadcast a visual display containing the originator , event , location , time period , 47 & nbsp ; c.f.r rwts are scheduled by the station on random days and times , ( though quite often during late night or early afternoon hours ) , and are generally not relayed required monthly tests ( rmts ) are generally originated by the local or state primary station , a state emergency management agency , or by the national weather service and are then relayed by broadcast stations and cable channels on february 3 , 2011 , the fcc announced plans and procedures for national eas tests , which involve all television and radio stations connected to the eas , as well as all cable and satellite services in the united states the national test would transmit and relay an emergency action notification on november 9 , 2011 at 2:00 & nbsp ; p.m a second national test , now classified as an npt , occurred on september 28 , 2016 as part of national preparedness month the test focused exclusively on distribution to broadcast outlets and television providers via the primary entry point network , in order to gauge the efficiency of alert distribution in the event that the internet can not be used the number of event types in the national system has grown to eighty at first , all but three of the events ( civil emergency message , immediate evacuation , and emergency action notification national emergency ) were weather-related ( such as a tornado warning ) since then , several classes of non-weather emergencies have been added , including , in most states , the amber alert system for child abduction emergencies in 2016 , three additional weather alert codes were authorized for use in relation to hurricane events , including extreme wind warning ( eww ) , storm surge warning ( ssw ) and storm surge watch ( ssa ) a study conducted following the incident reported that at least 11 % of residents actually saw the warning live , and that 63 % of those surveyed were '' a little or not at all concerned '' —citing a suspicious lack of detail in the message , which a legitimate alert would include about 15 minutes after the original message was sent , the alert was re-issued with an addendum clarifying that the alert was actually calling for a voluntary evacuation of fire island—a barrier island of long island tones from the eas were used in the trailer for the 2013 film olympus has fallen ; cable providers were fined 1.9 million by the federal communications commission ( fcc ) on march 3 , 2014 for misuse of eas tones

messages in the eas are composed of four parts : a digitally encoded specific area message encoding ( same ) header , an attention signal , an audio announcement , and a digitally encoded end-of-message marker the is the most critical part of the eas design there are 77 radio stations designated as national primary stations in the primary entry point ( pep ) system to distribute presidential messages to other broadcast stations and cable systems the emergency action notification is the notice to broadcasters that the president of the united states or their designee will deliver a message over the eas via the pep system the government has stated that the system would allow a president to speak during a national emergency within 10 minutes the national public warning system , also known as the primary entry point ( pep ) stations , are a network of 77 radio stations that are , in coordination with fema , used to originate emergency alert and warning information to the public before , during , and after incidents and disasters pep stations are equipped with additional and backup communications equipment and power generators designed to enable them to continue broadcasting information to the public during and after an event beginning with wjr/detroit and wlw/cincinnati in 2016 , fema began the process of constructing transportable studio shelters at the transmitters of 33 pep stations , which feature broadcasting equipment , emergency provisions , a rest area , and an air filtration system the fema national radio system ( fnars ) '' provides primary entry point service to the emergency alert system '' , and acts as an emergency presidential link into the eas '' daisy chains '' form when one station receives a message from multiple other stations and the station then forwards that message to multiple other stations this process creates many redundant paths through which the message may flow increasing the likelihood that the message will be received by all participants and adding to the survivability of the system on commercial broadcast stations , a attention signal of 853 & nbsp ; hz and 960 & nbsp ; hz sine waves is used instead , the same signal used by the older emergency broadcast system the '' two-tone '' system is no longer required as of 1998 , and is to be used only for audio alerts before eas messages ipaws can be used to distribute alert information to eas participants , supported mobile phones ( wireless emergency alerts ) , and other platforms under an fcc report and order issued in 2007 , eas participants would be required to migrate to digital equipment supporting cap within 180 days of the specification 's adoption by fema this officially occurred september 30 , 2010 , but the deadline was later delayed to june 30 , 2012 at the request of broadcasters the fcc has established that ipaws is not a full substitute for the existing same protocol , as it is vulnerable to situations that may make internet connectivity unavailable the fcc requires all broadcast stations and multichannel video programming distributors ( mvpd ) , hereafter '' eas participants '' , to install and maintain fcc-certified eas decoders and encoders at their control points or headends eas participants are required by federal law to relay emergency action notification ( ean ) messages immediately ( 47 cfr part 11.54 ) broadcasters traditionally have been allowed to opt out of relaying other alerts such as severe weather , and child abduction emergencies ( amber alerts ) if they so choose ( in practice , severe weather coverage is usually handled by a station 's local news operation and on-air meteorologists , rather than processed through eas ) required monthly tests ( rmts ) are generally originated by the local or state primary station , a state emergency management agency , or by the national weather service and are then relayed by broadcast stations and cable channels on february 3 , 2011 , the fcc announced plans and procedures for national eas tests , which involve all television and radio stations connected to the eas , as well as all cable and satellite services in the united states they are not relayed on the noaa weather radio ( noaa/nws ) network as it is an initiation-only network and does not receive messages from the pep network a third national periodic test occurred on september 27 , 2017 at first , all but three of the events ( civil emergency message , immediate evacuation , and emergency action notification national emergency ) were weather-related ( such as a tornado warning ) in 2016 , three additional weather alert codes were authorized for use in relation to hurricane events , including extreme wind warning ( eww ) , storm surge warning ( ssw ) and storm surge watch ( ssa ) other specialty receivers for am/fm/acssb ( lm ) are available only through mail-order , or in some places from federal , state , or local governments , especially where there is a potential hazard nearby such as a chemical factory the trend of cord cutting has led to concerns that viewers ' lessened use of broadcast media in favor of over-the-top content would inhibit their ability to receive emergency information ( notwithstanding wireless emergency alerts ) on may 19 , 2010 , noaa weather radio and csepp tone alert radios in the hermiston , oregon area , near the umatilla chemical depot , were activated with an eas alert shortly after 5 p.m local time , the hawaii emergency management agency ( hi-ema ) mistakenly 2018 hawaii false missile alert , which was claimed to be not a drill the errant emergency action notification was relayed to some broadcasters and cable systemsâ€”particularly those not configured to reject ean messages that did not match the current date cbs passed the edited tone through three quality rooms equipped with eas decoders and prescreened the episode to make sure it did n't trigger an actual alert

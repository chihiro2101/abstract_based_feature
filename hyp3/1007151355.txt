messages in the eas are composed of four parts : a digitally encoded specific area message encoding ( same ) header , an attention signal , an audio announcement , and a digitally encoded end-of-message marker there are 77 radio stations designated as national primary stations in the primary entry point ( pep ) system to distribute presidential messages to other broadcast stations and cable systems the emergency action notification is the notice to broadcasters that the president of the united states or their designee will deliver a message over the eas via the pep system the government has stated that the system would allow a president to speak during a national emergency within 10 minutes the national public warning system , also known as the primary entry point ( pep ) stations , are a network of 77 radio stations that are , in coordination with fema , used to originate emergency alert and warning information to the public before , during , and after incidents and disasters pep stations are equipped with additional and backup communications equipment and power generators designed to enable them to continue broadcasting information to the public during and after an event beginning with wjr/detroit and wlw/cincinnati in 2016 , fema began the process of constructing transportable studio shelters at the transmitters of 33 pep stations , which feature broadcasting equipment , emergency provisions , a rest area , and an air filtration system the fema national radio system ( fnars ) '' provides primary entry point service to the emergency alert system '' , and acts as an emergency presidential link into the eas the fnars net control station is located at the mount weather emergency operations center '' daisy chains '' form when one station receives a message from multiple other stations and the station then forwards that message to multiple other stations eas decoders compare the received headers against one another , looking for an exact match between any two , eliminating most errors which can cause an activation to fail on commercial broadcast stations , a attention signal of 853 & nbsp ; hz and 960 & nbsp ; hz sine waves is used instead , the same signal used by the older emergency broadcast system these tones have become infamous , and can be considered both frightening and annoying by viewers ; in fact , the two tones , which form approximately the interval of a just major second at an unusually high pitch , were chosen specifically for their ability to draw attention , due to their unpleasantness on the human ear the '' two-tone '' system is no longer required as of 1998 , and is to be used only for audio alerts before eas messages the message ends with 3 bursts of the afsk '' eom '' , or end of message , which is the text nnnn , preceded each time by the binary 10101011 calibration government was instructed to create '' an effective , reliable , integrated , flexible , and comprehensive '' public warning system this was accomplished via expansions to the aforementioned pep network , and the development of the integrated public alert and warning system ( ipaws ) â€”a national aggregator and distributor of alert information using the xml-based common alerting protocol ( cap ) and an internet network ipaws can be used to distribute alert information to eas participants , supported mobile phones ( wireless emergency alerts ) , and other platforms under an fcc report and order issued in 2007 , eas participants would be required to migrate to digital equipment supporting cap within 180 days of the specification 's adoption by fema the fcc has established that ipaws is not a full substitute for the existing same protocol , as it is vulnerable to situations that may make internet connectivity unavailable the fcc requires all broadcast stations and multichannel video programming distributors ( mvpd ) , hereafter '' eas participants '' , to install and maintain fcc-certified eas decoders and encoders at their control points or headends these decoders continuously monitor the signals from other nearby broadcast stations for eas messages eas participants are required to keep logs of all received messages logs may also be kept electronically inside the unit as long as there is access to an external printer or method to transfer them to a computer in addition to the audio messages transmitted by radio stations , television stations must broadcast a visual display containing the originator , event , location , time period , 47 & nbsp ; c.f.r rwts are scheduled by the station on random days and times , ( though quite often during late night or early afternoon hours ) , and are generally not relayed on february 3 , 2011 , the fcc announced plans and procedures for national eas tests , which involve all television and radio stations connected to the eas , as well as all cable and satellite services in the united states it was preceded by the first mandatory wireless emergency alert test at first , all but three of the events ( civil emergency message , immediate evacuation , and emergency action notification national emergency ) were weather-related ( such as a tornado warning ) on may 19 , 2010 , noaa weather radio and csepp tone alert radios in the hermiston , oregon area , near the umatilla chemical depot , were activated with an eas alert shortly after 5 p.m the incident prompted a public response from the randolph county sheriff 's department clarifying that there was no actual emergency tones from the eas were used in the trailer for the 2013 film olympus has fallen ; cable providers were fined 1.9 million by the federal communications commission ( fcc ) on march 3 , 2014 for misuse of eas tones

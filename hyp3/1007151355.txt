messages in the eas are composed of four parts : a digitally encoded specific area message encoding ( same ) header , an attention signal , an audio announcement , and a digitally encoded end-of-message marker there are 77 radio stations designated as national primary stations in the primary entry point ( pep ) system to distribute presidential messages to other broadcast stations and cable systems the emergency action notification is the notice to broadcasters that the president of the united states or their designee will deliver a message over the eas via the pep system the government has stated that the system would allow a president to speak during a national emergency within 10 minutes the national public warning system , also known as the primary entry point ( pep ) stations , are a network of 77 radio stations that are , in coordination with fema , used to originate emergency alert and warning information to the public before , during , and after incidents and disasters pep stations are equipped with additional and backup communications equipment and power generators designed to enable them to continue broadcasting information to the public during and after an event beginning with wjr/detroit and wlw/cincinnati in 2016 , fema began the process of constructing transportable studio shelters at the transmitters of 33 pep stations , which feature broadcasting equipment , emergency provisions , a rest area , and an air filtration system the fema national radio system ( fnars ) '' provides primary entry point service to the emergency alert system '' , and acts as an emergency presidential link into the eas the fnars net control station is located at the mount weather emergency operations center once an ean is received by an eas participant from a pep station ( or any other participant ) the message then '' daisy chains ' '' through the network of participants this process creates many redundant paths through which the message may flow increasing the likelihood that the message will be received by all participants and adding to the survivability of the system the same header bursts are followed by an attention tone , which lasts between 8 and 25 seconds , depending on the originating station on commercial broadcast stations , a attention signal of 853 & nbsp ; hz and 960 & nbsp ; hz sine waves is used instead , the same signal used by the older emergency broadcast system the '' two-tone '' system is no longer required as of 1998 , and is to be used only for audio alerts before eas messages government was instructed to create '' an effective , reliable , integrated , flexible , and comprehensive '' public warning system ipaws can be used to distribute alert information to eas participants , supported mobile phones ( wireless emergency alerts ) , and other platforms under an fcc report and order issued in 2007 , eas participants would be required to migrate to digital equipment supporting cap within 180 days of the specification 's adoption by fema therefore , broadcasters must convert cap messages to legacy same headers to enable backwards compatibility with the existing '' daisy chain '' method of eas distribution , providing a backup distribution path the fcc requires all broadcast stations and multichannel video programming distributors ( mvpd ) , hereafter '' eas participants '' , to install and maintain fcc-certified eas decoders and encoders at their control points or headends these decoders continuously monitor the signals from other nearby broadcast stations for eas messages broadcasters traditionally have been allowed to opt out of relaying other alerts such as severe weather , and child abduction emergencies ( amber alerts ) if they so choose ( in practice , severe weather coverage is usually handled by a station 's local news operation and on-air meteorologists , rather than processed through eas ) & nbsp ; ยง & nbsp ; 11.51 ( d ) and any extended text that is contained within the associated cap message on february 3 , 2011 , the fcc announced plans and procedures for national eas tests , which involve all television and radio stations connected to the eas , as well as all cable and satellite services in the united states the national test would transmit and relay an emergency action notification on november 9 , 2011 at 2:00 & nbsp ; p.m to reduce viewer confusion , the fcc stated that future national tests would be delivered under the new event code '' national periodic test '' ( '' npt '' ) , and list '' united states '' as its location a second national test , now classified as an npt , occurred on september 28 , 2016 as part of national preparedness month at first , all but three of the events ( civil emergency message , immediate evacuation , and emergency action notification national emergency ) were weather-related ( such as a tornado warning ) in 2016 , three additional weather alert codes were authorized for use in relation to hurricane events , including extreme wind warning ( eww ) , storm surge warning ( ssw ) and storm surge watch ( ssa ) the trend of cord cutting has led to concerns that viewers ' lessened use of broadcast media in favor of over-the-top content would inhibit their ability to receive emergency information ( notwithstanding wireless emergency alerts ) in a related incident , wizm-fm in la crosse , wisconsin accidentally triggered the eas on television station wkbt-dt by airing a recording of the false message during its morning show tones from the eas were used in the trailer for the 2013 film olympus has fallen ; cable providers were fined 1.9 million by the federal communications commission ( fcc ) on march 3 , 2014 for misuse of eas tones the company was also ordered to implement a three-year compliance plan to avoid any further incidents , including removing all eas tones or similar-sounding noises from its audio production libraries

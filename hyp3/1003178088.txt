many dsp applications have constraints on latency ; that is , for the system to work , the dsp operation must be completed within some fixed time , and deferred ( or batch ) processing is not viable most general-purpose microprocessors and operating systems can execute dsp algorithms successfully , but are not suitable for use in portable devices such as mobile phones and pdas because of power efficiency constraints a specialized dsp , however , will tend to provide a lower-cost solution , with better performance , lower latency , and no requirements for specialised cooling or large batteries for example , the ses-12 and ses-14 satellites from operator ses launched in 2018 , were both built by airbus defence and space with 25 % of capacity using dsp beyond frontiers broadgate publications ( september 2016 ) pp22 the architecture of a dsp is optimized specifically for digital signal processing most also support some of the features as an applications processor or microcontroller , since signal processing is rarely the only task of a system both traditional and dsp-optimized instruction sets are able to compute any arbitrary operation but an operation that might require multiple arm or x86 instructions to compute might require only one instruction in a dsp optimized instruction set multiple arithmetic units may require memory architectures to support several accesses per instruction cycle -- typically supporting reading 2 data values from 2 separate data buses and the next instruction ( from the instruction cache , or a 3rd program memory ) simultaneously '' memory and dsp processors '' '' dsp processors : memory architectures '' '' architecture of the digital signal processor '' '' arc xy memory dsp option '' '' adsp-bf533 blackfin processor hardware reference '' fixed-point arithmetic is often used to speed up arithmetic processing single-cycle operations to increase the benefits of pipelining hardware modulo addressing allows circular buffers to be implemented without having to test for wrapping bit-reversed addressing , a special addressing mode useful for calculating ffts exclusion of a memory management unit address generation unit prior to the advent of stand-alone digital signal processor ( dsp ) chips , early digital signal processing applications were typically implemented using bit-slice chips examples of these multipliers were a series from trw including the tdc1008 and tdc1010 , some of which included an accumulator , providing the requisite multiply–accumulate ( mac ) function electronic signal processing was revolutionized in the 1970s by the wide adoption of the mosfet ( metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor , or mos transistor ) , mos integrated circuit technology was the basis for the first single-chip microprocessors and microcontrollers in the early 1970s , and then the first single-chip dsps in the late 1970s another important development in digital signal processing was data compression linear predictive coding ( lpc ) was first developed by fumitada itakura of nagoya university and shuzo saito of nippon telegraph and telephone ( ntt ) in 1966 , and then further developed by bishnu s schroeder at bell labs during the early-to-mid-1970s , becoming a basis for the first speech synthesizer dsp chips in the late 1970s ahmed in the early 1970s , and has since been widely implemented in dsp chips , with many companies developing dsp chips based on dct technology two years later in 1978 , they produced the first speak & spell , with the technological centerpiece being the tms5100 , the industry 's first digital signal processor it was based on the harvard architecture , and so had separate instruction and data memory the processors have a multi-threaded architecture that allows up to 8 real-time threads per core , meaning that a 4 core device would support up to 32 real time threads nxp semiconductors produce dsps based on trimedia vliw technology , optimized for audio and video processing generally , dsps are dedicated integrated circuits ; however dsp functionality can also be produced by using field-programmable gate array chips ( fpgas ) digital signal controller graphics processing unit system on a chip hardware acceleration vision processing unit mdsp – a multiprocessor dsp opencl

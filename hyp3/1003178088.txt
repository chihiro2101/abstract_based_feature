thumb digital signal processing algorithms typically require a large number of mathematical operations to be performed quickly and repeatedly on a series of data samples many dsp applications have constraints on latency ; that is , for the system to work , the dsp operation must be completed within some fixed time , and deferred ( or batch ) processing is not viable most general-purpose microprocessors and operating systems can execute dsp algorithms successfully , but are not suitable for use in portable devices such as mobile phones and pdas because of power efficiency constraints beyond frontiers broadgate publications ( september 2016 ) pp22 the architecture of a dsp is optimized specifically for digital signal processing most also support some of the features as an applications processor or microcontroller , since signal processing is rarely the only task of a system by the standards of general-purpose processors , dsp instruction sets are often highly irregular ; while traditional instruction sets are made up of more general instructions that allow them to perform a wider variety of operations , instruction sets optimized for digital signal processing contain instructions for common mathematical operations that occur frequently in dsp calculations both traditional and dsp-optimized instruction sets are able to compute any arbitrary operation but an operation that might require multiple arm or x86 instructions to compute might require only one instruction in a dsp optimized instruction set one implication for software architecture is that hand-optimized assembly-code routines ( assembly programs ) are commonly packaged into libraries for re-use , instead of relying on advanced compiler technologies to handle essential algorithms even with modern compiler optimizations hand-optimized assembly code is more efficient and many common algorithms involved in dsp calculations are hand-written in order to take full advantage of the architectural optimizations multiple arithmetic units may require memory architectures to support several accesses per instruction cycle -- typically supporting reading 2 data values from 2 separate data buses and the next instruction ( from the instruction cache , or a 3rd program memory ) simultaneously '' dsp processors : memory architectures '' '' architecture of the digital signal processor '' '' arc xy memory dsp option '' special loop controls , such as architectural support for executing a few instruction words in a very tight loop without overhead for instruction fetches or exit testing -- such as zero-overhead looping '' zero overhead loops '' this description , often called a hardware design model , allows hardware designers to understand how their components fit into a system architecture and provides to software component designers important information needed for software development and integration hardware is also an expression used within the computer engineering industry to explicitly distinguish the ( electronic computer ) hardware from the software that runs on it the need to effectively model how separate physical components combine to form complex systems is important over a wide range of applications , including computers , personal digital assistants ( pdas ) , cell phones , surgical instrumentation , satellites , and submarines dsps are usually optimized for streaming data and use special memory architectures that are able to fetch multiple data or instructions at the same time , such as the harvard architecture or modified von neumann architecture , which use separate program and data memories ( sometimes even concurrent access on multiple data buses ) dsps frequently use multi-tasking operating systems , but have no support for virtual memory or memory protection electronic signal processing was revolutionized in the 1970s by the wide adoption of the mosfet ( metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor , or mos transistor ) , mos integrated circuit technology was the basis for the first single-chip microprocessors and microcontrollers in the early 1970s , and then the first single-chip dsps in the late 1970s another important development in digital signal processing was data compression linear predictive coding ( lpc ) was first developed by fumitada itakura of nagoya university and shuzo saito of nippon telegraph and telephone ( ntt ) in 1966 , and then further developed by bishnu s ahmed in the early 1970s , and has since been widely implemented in dsp chips , with many companies developing dsp chips based on dct technology two years later in 1978 , they produced the first speak & spell , with the technological centerpiece being the tms5100 , the industry 's first digital signal processor texas instruments produces the c6000 series dsps , which have clock speeds of 1.2 & nbsp ; ghz and implement separate instruction and data caches tms320c6474 chips each have three such dsps , and the newest generation c6000 chips support floating point as well as fixed point processing most dsps use fixed-point arithmetic , because in real world signal processing the additional range provided by floating point is not needed , and there is a large speed benefit and cost benefit due to reduced hardware complexity digital signal controller graphics processing unit system on a chip hardware acceleration vision processing unit mdsp â€“ a multiprocessor dsp opencl

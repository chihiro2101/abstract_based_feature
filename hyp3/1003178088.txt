thumb digital signal processing algorithms typically require a large number of mathematical operations to be performed quickly and repeatedly on a series of data samples signals ( perhaps from audio or video sensors ) are constantly converted from analog to digital , manipulated digitally , and then converted back to analog form many dsp applications have constraints on latency ; that is , for the system to work , the dsp operation must be completed within some fixed time , and deferred ( or batch ) processing is not viable most general-purpose microprocessors and operating systems can execute dsp algorithms successfully , but are not suitable for use in portable devices such as mobile phones and pdas because of power efficiency constraints a specialized dsp , however , will tend to provide a lower-cost solution , with better performance , lower latency , and no requirements for specialised cooling or large batteries for example , the ses-12 and ses-14 satellites from operator ses launched in 2018 , were both built by airbus defence and space with 25 % of capacity using dsp beyond frontiers broadgate publications ( september 2016 ) pp22 the architecture of a dsp is optimized specifically for digital signal processing most also support some of the features as an applications processor or microcontroller , since signal processing is rarely the only task of a system even with modern compiler optimizations hand-optimized assembly code is more efficient and many common algorithms involved in dsp calculations are hand-written in order to take full advantage of the architectural optimizations '' memory and dsp processors '' '' dsp processors : memory architectures '' '' architecture of the digital signal processor '' '' arc xy memory dsp option '' special loop controls , such as architectural support for executing a few instruction words in a very tight loop without overhead for instruction fetches or exit testing -- such as zero-overhead looping '' zero overhead loops '' floating-point unit integrated directly into the datapath pipelined architecture highly parallel multiplier–accumulators ( mac units ) hardware-controlled looping , to reduce or eliminate the overhead required for looping operations in engineering , hardware architecture refers to the identification of a system 's physical components and their interrelationships clear definition of a hardware architecture allows the various traditional engineering disciplines ( e.g hardware is also an expression used within the computer engineering industry to explicitly distinguish the ( electronic computer ) hardware from the software that runs on it dsps are usually optimized for streaming data and use special memory architectures that are able to fetch multiple data or instructions at the same time , such as the harvard architecture or modified von neumann architecture , which use separate program and data memories ( sometimes even concurrent access on multiple data buses ) electronic signal processing was revolutionized in the 1970s by the wide adoption of the mosfet ( metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor , or mos transistor ) , mos integrated circuit technology was the basis for the first single-chip microprocessors and microcontrollers in the early 1970s , and then the first single-chip dsps in the late 1970s schroeder at bell labs during the early-to-mid-1970s , becoming a basis for the first speech synthesizer dsp chips in the late 1970s two years later in 1978 , they produced the first speak & spell , with the technological centerpiece being the tms5100 , the industry 's first digital signal processor the ami s2811 '' signal processing peripheral '' , like many later dsps , has a hardware multiplier that enables it to do multiply–accumulate operation in a single instruction the s2281 was the first integrated circuit chip specifically designed as a dsp , and fabricated using vmos ( v-groove mos ) , a technology that had previously not been mass-produced tms320c6474 chips each have three such dsps , and the newest generation c6000 chips support floating point as well as fixed point processing perhaps the best known and most widely deployed is the ceva-teaklite dsp family , a classic memory-based architecture , with 16-bit or 32-bit word-widths and single or dual macs nxp semiconductors produce dsps based on trimedia vliw technology , optimized for audio and video processing digital signal controller graphics processing unit system on a chip hardware acceleration vision processing unit mdsp – a multiprocessor dsp opencl

thumb digital signal processing algorithms typically require a large number of mathematical operations to be performed quickly and repeatedly on a series of data samples signals ( perhaps from audio or video sensors ) are constantly converted from analog to digital , manipulated digitally , and then converted back to analog form many dsp applications have constraints on latency ; that is , for the system to work , the dsp operation must be completed within some fixed time , and deferred ( or batch ) processing is not viable most general-purpose microprocessors and operating systems can execute dsp algorithms successfully , but are not suitable for use in portable devices such as mobile phones and pdas because of power efficiency constraints a specialized dsp , however , will tend to provide a lower-cost solution , with better performance , lower latency , and no requirements for specialised cooling or large batteries beyond frontiers broadgate publications ( september 2016 ) pp22 the architecture of a dsp is optimized specifically for digital signal processing most also support some of the features as an applications processor or microcontroller , since signal processing is rarely the only task of a system by the standards of general-purpose processors , dsp instruction sets are often highly irregular ; while traditional instruction sets are made up of more general instructions that allow them to perform a wider variety of operations , instruction sets optimized for digital signal processing contain instructions for common mathematical operations that occur frequently in dsp calculations both traditional and dsp-optimized instruction sets are able to compute any arbitrary operation but an operation that might require multiple arm or x86 instructions to compute might require only one instruction in a dsp optimized instruction set '' dsp processors : memory architectures '' '' architecture of the digital signal processor '' '' arc xy memory dsp option '' floating-point unit integrated directly into the datapath pipelined architecture highly parallel multiplier–accumulators ( mac units ) hardware-controlled looping , to reduce or eliminate the overhead required for looping operations this description , often called a hardware design model , allows hardware designers to understand how their components fit into a system architecture and provides to software component designers important information needed for software development and integration hardware is also an expression used within the computer engineering industry to explicitly distinguish the ( electronic computer ) hardware from the software that runs on it the need to effectively model how separate physical components combine to form complex systems is important over a wide range of applications , including computers , personal digital assistants ( pdas ) , cell phones , surgical instrumentation , satellites , and submarines dsps frequently use multi-tasking operating systems , but have no support for virtual memory or memory protection operating systems that use virtual memory require more time for context switching among processes , which increases latency prior to the advent of stand-alone digital signal processor ( dsp ) chips , early digital signal processing applications were typically implemented using bit-slice chips there were reference designs from amd , but very often the specifics of a particular design were application specific electronic signal processing was revolutionized in the 1970s by the wide adoption of the mosfet ( metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor , or mos transistor ) , mos integrated circuit technology was the basis for the first single-chip microprocessors and microcontrollers in the early 1970s , and then the first single-chip dsps in the late 1970s another important development in digital signal processing was data compression two years later in 1978 , they produced the first speak & spell , with the technological centerpiece being the tms5100 , the industry 's first digital signal processor the s2281 was the first integrated circuit chip specifically designed as a dsp , and fabricated using vmos ( v-groove mos ) , a technology that had previously not been mass-produced analog devices produce the sharc-based dsp and range in performance from 66 & nbsp ; mhz/198 mflops ( million floating-point operations per second ) to 400 & nbsp ; mhz/2400 mflops microchip technology produces the pic24 based dspic line of dsps introduced in 2004 , the dspic is designed for applications needing a true dsp as well as a true microcontroller , such as motor control and in power supplies digital signal controller graphics processing unit system on a chip hardware acceleration vision processing unit mdsp – a multiprocessor dsp opencl

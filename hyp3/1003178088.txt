thumb digital signal processing algorithms typically require a large number of mathematical operations to be performed quickly and repeatedly on a series of data samples many dsp applications have constraints on latency ; that is , for the system to work , the dsp operation must be completed within some fixed time , and deferred ( or batch ) processing is not viable most general-purpose microprocessors and operating systems can execute dsp algorithms successfully , but are not suitable for use in portable devices such as mobile phones and pdas because of power efficiency constraints a specialized dsp , however , will tend to provide a lower-cost solution , with better performance , lower latency , and no requirements for specialised cooling or large batteries beyond frontiers broadgate publications ( september 2016 ) pp22 the architecture of a dsp is optimized specifically for digital signal processing most also support some of the features as an applications processor or microcontroller , since signal processing is rarely the only task of a system '' dsp processors : memory architectures '' '' architecture of the digital signal processor '' '' arc xy memory dsp option '' special loop controls , such as architectural support for executing a few instruction words in a very tight loop without overhead for instruction fetches or exit testing -- such as zero-overhead looping '' zero overhead loops '' this description , often called a hardware design model , allows hardware designers to understand how their components fit into a system architecture and provides to software component designers important information needed for software development and integration dsps frequently use multi-tasking operating systems , but have no support for virtual memory or memory protection hardware modulo addressing allows circular buffers to be implemented without having to test for wrapping bit-reversed addressing , a special addressing mode useful for calculating ffts exclusion of a memory management unit address generation unit prior to the advent of stand-alone digital signal processor ( dsp ) chips , early digital signal processing applications were typically implemented using bit-slice chips the amd 2901 bit-slice chip with its family of components was a very popular choice electronic signal processing was revolutionized in the 1970s by the wide adoption of the mosfet ( metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor , or mos transistor ) , mos integrated circuit technology was the basis for the first single-chip microprocessors and microcontrollers in the early 1970s , and then the first single-chip dsps in the late 1970s another important development in digital signal processing was data compression linear predictive coding ( lpc ) was first developed by fumitada itakura of nagoya university and shuzo saito of nippon telegraph and telephone ( ntt ) in 1966 , and then further developed by bishnu s it also set other milestones , being the first chip to use linear predictive coding to perform speech synthesis the chip was made possible with a 7µm pmos fabrication process the ami s2811 '' signal processing peripheral '' , like many later dsps , has a hardware multiplier that enables it to do multiply–accumulate operation in a single instruction it already had a special instruction set , with instructions like load-and-accumulate or multiply-and-accumulate it could work on 16-bit numbers and needed 390 & nbsp ; ns for a multiply–add operation the processors have a multi-threaded architecture that allows up to 8 real-time threads per core , meaning that a 4 core device would support up to 32 real time threads the blackfin family of embedded digital signal processors combine the features of a dsp with those of a general use processor generally , dsps are dedicated integrated circuits ; however dsp functionality can also be produced by using field-programmable gate array chips ( fpgas ) with a processing speed of 0.4 tflops , the chip can achieve better performance than current mainstream dsp chips digital signal controller graphics processing unit system on a chip hardware acceleration vision processing unit mdsp – a multiprocessor dsp opencl

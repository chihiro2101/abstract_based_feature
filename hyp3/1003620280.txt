a major task taken on by dennett in elbow room is to clearly describe just what people are as biology entities and why they find the issue of free will to be of significance in discussing what people are and why free will matters to them , dennett makes use of an evolutionary perspective for an animal like a wasp , this process of repeating the same behavior can go on indefinitely , the wasp never seeming to notice what is going on this is the type of mindless , pre-determined behavior that humans can avoid dennett points out the fact that as long as people see themselves as able to avoid futility , most people have seen enough of the free will issue dennett then invites all who are satisfied with this level of analysis to get on with living while he proceeds into the deeper hair-splitting aspects of the free will issue from a biological perspective , what is the difference between the wasp and a person ? the person can , through interaction with his or her environment , construct an internal mental model of the situation and figure out a successful behavioral strategy it is in this sense of people as animals with complex brains that can model reality and appear to choose among several possible behaviors that dennett says we have free will on one hand , we all feel like we have free will , a multitude of behavioral choices to select among since the 1920s , physicists have been trying to convince themselves that quantum indeterminacy can in some way explain free will dennett suggests that we can have another kind of free will , a type of free will which we can be perfectly happy with even if it does not give us the power to act in more than one way at any given time dennett has slowly , through the course of the book , stripped the idea of behavioral choice from his idea of free will people who break the rules set by society and get punished may be behaving in the only way they can , but if we did not hold them accountable for their actions , people would behave even worse than they do with the threat of punishment in elbow room , he tries to explain why all the attempts that people have made to prove that people have libertarian choice have failed and are , in the final analysis , not really important anyhow dennett , daniel , elbow room : the varieties of free will worth wanting , 1984

a major task taken on by dennett in elbow room is to clearly describe just what people are as biology entities and why they find the issue of free will to be of significance in discussing what people are and why free will matters to them , dennett makes use of an evolutionary perspective given the chance to repeat some futile behavior endlessly , people can notice the futility of it , and by an act of free will do something else dennett points out the fact that as long as people see themselves as able to avoid futility , most people have seen enough of the free will issue from a biological perspective , what is the difference between the wasp and a person ? the person can , through interaction with his or her environment , construct an internal mental model of the situation and figure out a successful behavioral strategy the wasp , with a much smaller brain and different genetic program , does not learn from its environment and instead is trapped in an endless and futile behavioral loop that is strictly determined by its genetic program it is in this sense of people as animals with complex brains that can model reality and appear to choose among several possible behaviors that dennett says we have free will on one hand , we all feel like we have free will , a multitude of behavioral choices to select among since dennett wrote elbow room ( 1984 ) there has been an ongoing attempt by some scientists to answer this question by suggesting that the brain is a device for controlling quantum indeterminacy so as to construct behavioral choice what the physicists seem to be trying to construct is a type of free will that involves a way for brains to make use of quantum indeterminacy so as to make choices that alter the universe in our favor , or if there are multiple universes , to choose among the possible universes dennett suggests that we can have another kind of free will , a type of free will which we can be perfectly happy with even if it does not give us the power to act in more than one way at any given time how can we have free will if we do not have indeterministic choice ? dennett emphasizes control over libertarian choice dennett asks us to look around at the universe and ask , can i even conceive of beings whose will is freer than our own ? for dennett , the answer to this question is , no , not really in elbow room , he tries to explain why all the attempts that people have made to prove that people have libertarian choice have failed and are , in the final analysis , not really important anyhow if this connection between our brains ' efforts to model reality and predict the future and so make possible good outcomes is disconnected from our sense of self and our will , then fatalism and self-destructive behaviors are close at hand

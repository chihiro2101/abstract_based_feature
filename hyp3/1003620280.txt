a major task taken on by dennett in elbow room is to clearly describe just what people are as biology entities and why they find the issue of free will to be of significance in discussing what people are and why free will matters to them , dennett makes use of an evolutionary perspective dennett describes the mechanical behavior of the digger wasp sphex given the chance to repeat some futile behavior endlessly , people can notice the futility of it , and by an act of free will do something else dennett points out the fact that as long as people see themselves as able to avoid futility , most people have seen enough of the free will issue dennett then invites all who are satisfied with this level of analysis to get on with living while he proceeds into the deeper hair-splitting aspects of the free will issue the deeper philosophical issue of free will can be framed as a paradox on the other hand , modern biology generally investigates humans as though the processes at work in them follow the same biological principles as those in wasps how , he asks , can random resolutions of quantum-level events provide people with any control over their behavior ? since dennett wrote elbow room ( 1984 ) there has been an ongoing attempt by some scientists to answer this question by suggesting that the brain is a device for controlling quantum indeterminacy so as to construct behavioral choice dennett argues that such efforts to salvage free will by finding a way out of the prison of determinism are wasted dennett discusses many types of free will ( 1984 ) in elbow room , he tries to explain why all the attempts that people have made to prove that people have libertarian choice have failed and are , in the final analysis , not really important anyhow the well-developed human sensation of having free will and being able to select among possible behaviors has strong survival value dennett , daniel , elbow room : the varieties of free will worth wanting , 1984

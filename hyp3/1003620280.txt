a major task taken on by dennett in elbow room is to clearly describe just what people are as biology entities and why they find the issue of free will to be of significance in discussing what people are and why free will matters to them , dennett makes use of an evolutionary perspective dennett describes the mechanical behavior of the digger wasp sphex for an animal like a wasp , this process of repeating the same behavior can go on indefinitely , the wasp never seeming to notice what is going on given the chance to repeat some futile behavior endlessly , people can notice the futility of it , and by an act of free will do something else we can take this as an operational definition of what people mean by free will dennett points out the fact that as long as people see themselves as able to avoid futility , most people have seen enough of the free will issue dennett then invites all who are satisfied with this level of analysis to get on with living while he proceeds into the deeper hair-splitting aspects of the free will issue it is in this sense of people as animals with complex brains that can model reality and appear to choose among several possible behaviors that dennett says we have free will since dennett wrote elbow room ( 1984 ) there has been an ongoing attempt by some scientists to answer this question by suggesting that the brain is a device for controlling quantum indeterminacy so as to construct behavioral choice dennett suggests that we can have another kind of free will , a type of free will which we can be perfectly happy with even if it does not give us the power to act in more than one way at any given time one final issue : if people do not have real behavioral choices , why not collapse into fatalism ? again , dennett 's argument is that we may not have behavioral choice , but we do have control of our behavior some say that dennett 's theory does not satisfactorily deal with the issue of why we feel so strongly that we do have behavioral choice according to dennett , belief in free will is a necessary condition for having free will dennett , daniel , elbow room : the varieties of free will worth wanting , 1984

a major task taken on by dennett in elbow room is to clearly describe just what people are as biology entities and why they find the issue of free will to be of significance in discussing what people are and why free will matters to them , dennett makes use of an evolutionary perspective dennett describes the mechanical behavior of the digger wasp sphex if an experimenter interrupts one of these steps the wasp will repeat that step again given the chance to repeat some futile behavior endlessly , people can notice the futility of it , and by an act of free will do something else dennett points out the fact that as long as people see themselves as able to avoid futility , most people have seen enough of the free will issue dennett then invites all who are satisfied with this level of analysis to get on with living while he proceeds into the deeper hair-splitting aspects of the free will issue it is in this sense of people as animals with complex brains that can model reality and appear to choose among several possible behaviors that dennett says we have free will on one hand , we all feel like we have free will , a multitude of behavioral choices to select among dennett argues that such efforts to salvage free will by finding a way out of the prison of determinism are wasted dennett suggests that we can have another kind of free will , a type of free will which we can be perfectly happy with even if it does not give us the power to act in more than one way at any given time dennett has slowly , through the course of the book , stripped the idea of behavioral choice from his idea of free will is it , then , moral to punish people who are unable to do other than break a rule ? yes , people have the right to come together and improve their condition by creating rules and enforcing them in elbow room , he tries to explain why all the attempts that people have made to prove that people have libertarian choice have failed and are , in the final analysis , not really important anyhow dennett , daniel , elbow room : the varieties of free will worth wanting , 1984

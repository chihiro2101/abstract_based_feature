in october 1859 , the steam clipper royal charter was wrecked in a strong storm off anglesey ; 450 & nbsp ; people lost their lives due to this loss , vice-admiral robert fitzroy introduced a warning service for shipping in february 1861 , using telegraph communications this remained the united kingdom 's met office primary responsibility for some time afterwards in 1911 , the met office began issuing marine weather forecasts which included gale and storm warnings via radio transmission for areas around great britain this service was discontinued during and following the first world war , between 1914 and june 1921 , and again during the second world war between 1939 and 1945 today , although most ships have onboard technology to provide the forecast 's information , they still use it to check their data on friday 30 may 2014 , for the first time in more than 90 years , bbc radio 4 failed to broadcast the shipping forecast at 0520 staff at broadcasting house were reading out the report but it was not transmitted 24 august 2017 was the 150th anniversary of the shipping forecast in august 1984 north utsire and south utsire were made , to harmonise with neighbours thus reduce viking finisterre was renamed fitzroy in 2002 , to end its conflicting with sea area names of the french and spanish services some names differ elsewhere ; notably the dutch knmi and norwegian counterpart names forties the fladen ground , while calls from dover to plymouth , , and the forecast follows the order above , a clockwise order whereby all but two ( irish sea and fair isle ) touch the last zone announced viking , forties , dogger , fisher , sole and bailey & ndash ; after sandbanks or relative shallows the malin sea was defined later than the shipping forecast area and has slightly different boundaries fitzroy & ndash ; after robert fitzroy , the first professional weather forecaster , captain of and founder of the met office the shipping forecast includes a '' general situation '' update for the british isles , followed by a forecast for inshore waters of the united kingdom , divided by area it begins with '' and now the shipping forecast , issued by the met office on behalf of the maritime and coastguard agency at xxxx today '' this format is followed quite strictly , although some continuity announcers read out the actual date of issue as opposed to the word '' today '' forecast times are spelled out as digits on the 24-hour clock , for example '' two-three-double-o '' , and barometric pressures are pronounced as whole numbers , for example '' a thousand and five '' extended shipping forecasts ( 0520 and 0048 ) also include weather reports from a list of additional coastal stations and automatic weather logging stations , which are known by their names , such as '' channel light vessel automatic '' ; these are the coastal weather stations ( rt√© radio 1 broadcasts similar coastal reports for ireland ) the extended forecast also includes an inshore waters forecast the shipping forecast is broadcast on bbc radio 4 because its longwave signal can be received clearly at sea all around the british isles regardless of time of day or radio conditions the shipping forecast should not be confused with similar broadcasts given by hm coastguard to vessels at sea tuned into marine vhf and mf radio frequencies hm coastguard 's broadcasts can only be heard by vessels or persons using or tuned into marine vhf and mf radio frequencies , whereas the shipping forecast can be heard by anyone tuned into bbc radio 4 similar outcry greeted the met office 's decision to rename finisterre to fitzroy , but in that case , the decision was carried through the bbc 's forecast for inshore waters

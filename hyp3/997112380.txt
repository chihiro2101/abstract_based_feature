in 1537 , commanding a large ottoman fleet , hayreddin barbarossa captured a number of aegean and ionian islands belonging to the republic of venice , namely syros , aegina , ios , paros , tinos , karpathos , kasos , and naxos , thus annexing the duchy of naxos to the ottoman empire the papal fleet under admiral marco grimani ( patriarch of aquileia ) and the venetian fleet under vincenzo capello arrived first prior to doria 's arrival , grimani attempted to land troops near the fortress of preveza , but he retreated to corfu after suffering a number of casualties in the ensuing encounter with ottoman forces barbarossa was still at the island of kos in the aegean sea at that time , but he soon arrived at preveza with the rest of the ottoman fleet , after capturing the island of kefalonia on the way sinan reis , one of his lieutenants , suggested landing troops at actium on the gulf of arta near preveza , an idea that barbarossa initially opposed , but which later proved to be important in securing the ottoman victory with the turks holding the fortress at actium , they could support barbarossa 's fleet with artillery fire from there , while doria had to keep his ships away from the coast as doria 's ships kept their distance from the coast , much concerned about adverse winds driving them onto a hostile shore , barbarossa had the advantageous interior position doria placed four of his fastest galleys under the command of his nephew giovanni andrea doria who was positioned in the center front , between gonzaga and the maltese knights the turks swiftly engaged the venetian , papal , and maltese ships , but doria hesitated to bring his center into action against barbarossa , which led to much tactical maneuvering but little fighting doria 's efforts to trap the ottoman ships between the cannon fire of his barques and galleys failed

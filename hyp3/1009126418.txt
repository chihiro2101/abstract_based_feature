a globally ambiguous sentence is one that has at least two distinct interpretations in this type of ambiguity , after one has read or heard the entire sentence , the ambiguity is still present rereading the sentence can not resolve the ambiguity because no feature of the representation ( i.e global ambiguities are often unnoticed because the reader tends to choose the meaning he or she understands to be more probable '' in this example , the baby could be wrapped in the green blanket or the woman could be using the green blanket as an instrument to hold the baby a locally ambiguous sentence is a sentence that contains an ambiguous phrase but has only one interpretation the ambiguity in a locally ambiguous sentence briefly persists and is resolved , i.e sometimes , local ambiguities can result in garden path sentence , in which a structurally sound sentence is difficult to interpret because one interpretation of the ambiguous region is not the ultimate coherent interpretation â€” lola by ray davies : :can mean '' lola and i are both glad i 'm a man '' , or '' i 'm glad lola and i are both men '' , or '' i 'm glad i 'm a man , and lola is also glad to be a man '' ray davies deliberately wrote this ambiguity into the song , referring to a cross-dresser : : can mean that john , using a telescope , saw a man on a mountain , or john saw a man on a mountain , with a mountain holding a telescope , or john seeing a man with a telescope the word left may refer to ( noun ) a politically left-wing party , or ( verb ) the past tense of leave behind the sentence may be parsed as either : '' british left-leaning politicians talk at length about the falklands '' or '' the british left cakes behind on the falklands '' aristotle writes about an influence of ambiguities on arguments and also about an influence of ambiguities depending on either combination or division of words : newspaper headlines are written in a telegram style ( headlinese ) which often zero copula , creating syntactic ambiguity one of the most enduring jokes from the famous comedian groucho marx was his quip that used a modifier attachment ambiguity : '' i shot an elephant in my pajamas '' another sentence , which emerged from early 1960s machine translation research , is '' time flies like an arrow ; fruit flies like a banana '' in the realm of advertising and marketing , one of the enduring advertisements for glad garbage bags states '' do n't get mad . syntactic and semantic ambiguity in contrast , in semantic ambiguity the structure remains the same , but the individual words are interpreted differently as in constraint-based theories , there is no restriction on the sources of information that can provide support for the different analyses of an ambiguous structure ; hence it is unrestricted they have also not yet developed the ability to acknowledge that ambiguous words and phrases can be interpreted multiple ways a detailed discussion of syntactic ambiguity differentiating syntactic ambiguity ( structural ambiguity ) from other types of ambiguity

a globally ambiguous sentence is one that has at least two distinct interpretations in this type of ambiguity , after one has read or heard the entire sentence , the ambiguity is still present rereading the sentence can not resolve the ambiguity because no feature of the representation ( i.e global ambiguities are often unnoticed because the reader tends to choose the meaning he or she understands to be more probable one example of a global ambiguity is '' the woman held the baby in the green blanket '' in this example , the baby could be wrapped in the green blanket or the woman could be using the green blanket as an instrument to hold the baby a locally ambiguous sentence is a sentence that contains an ambiguous phrase but has only one interpretation the ambiguity in a locally ambiguous sentence briefly persists and is resolved , i.e sometimes , local ambiguities can result in garden path sentence , in which a structurally sound sentence is difficult to interpret because one interpretation of the ambiguous region is not the ultimate coherent interpretation the sentence could be taken to mean that henry will depose the duke , or that the duke will depose henry â€” lola by ray davies : :can mean '' lola and i are both glad i 'm a man '' , or '' i 'm glad lola and i are both men '' , or '' i 'm glad i 'm a man , and lola is also glad to be a man '' : : can mean that john , using a telescope , saw a man on a mountain , or john saw a man on a mountain , with a mountain holding a telescope , or john seeing a man with a telescope the word left may refer to ( noun ) a politically left-wing party , or ( verb ) the past tense of leave behind waffles may be ( noun ) a type of batter cake , or ( verb ) the present tense of to talk at length syntactic or structural ambiguities are frequently found in humor and advertising '' in this advertisement the phrase '' get glad '' could be interpreted as having a linking verb followed by an adjective ( e.g . syntactic and semantic ambiguity in syntactic ambiguity , the same sequence of words is interpreted as having different syntactic structures most reanalysis models , like the unrestricted race model , are serial in nature , which implies that only one analysis can be evaluated at a time as in constraint-based theories , there is no restriction on the sources of information that can provide support for the different analyses of an ambiguous structure ; hence it is unrestricted thus , ambiguous sentences will take a shorter time to read compared to disambiguated sentences they have also not yet developed the ability to acknowledge that ambiguous words and phrases can be interpreted multiple ways a detailed discussion of syntactic ambiguity differentiating syntactic ambiguity ( structural ambiguity ) from other types of ambiguity

a globally ambiguous sentence is one that has at least two distinct interpretations in this type of ambiguity , after one has read or heard the entire sentence , the ambiguity is still present one example of a global ambiguity is '' the woman held the baby in the green blanket '' in this example , the baby could be wrapped in the green blanket or the woman could be using the green blanket as an instrument to hold the baby a locally ambiguous sentence is a sentence that contains an ambiguous phrase but has only one interpretation the ambiguity in a locally ambiguous sentence briefly persists and is resolved , i.e sometimes , local ambiguities can result in garden path sentence , in which a structurally sound sentence is difficult to interpret because one interpretation of the ambiguous region is not the ultimate coherent interpretation — henry vi ( 1.4.30 ) , by william shakespeare : :amphiboly occurs frequently in poetry , sometimes owing to the alteration of the natural order of words for metrical reasons — lola by ray davies : :can mean '' lola and i are both glad i 'm a man '' , or '' i 'm glad lola and i are both men '' , or '' i 'm glad i 'm a man , and lola is also glad to be a man '' : the word of the lord came to zechariah , son of berekiah , son of iddo , the prophet the word left may refer to ( noun ) a politically left-wing party , or ( verb ) the past tense of leave behind waffles may be ( noun ) a type of batter cake , or ( verb ) the present tense of to talk at length the sentence may be parsed as either : '' british left-leaning politicians talk at length about the falklands '' or '' the british left cakes behind on the falklands he based this on the headline '' violinist linked to jal 123 blossoms '' that mike o'connell had posted , asking what such a headline could be called '' in this advertisement the phrase '' get glad '' could be interpreted as having a linking verb followed by an adjective ( e.g in syntactic ambiguity , the same sequence of words is interpreted as having different syntactic structures on the other hand , when constraints support one analysis over the other , competition is weak and processing is undemanding according to the reanalysis model , processing difficulty occurs once the reader has realized that their sentence analysis is false ( with regards to the already adopted syntactic structure ) , and they must then return and reevaluate the structure '' research supports the reanalysis model as the most likely reason for why difficulty occurs in processing these ambiguous sentences as children read and interpret syntactically ambiguous sentences , the speed at which initial syntactic commitments are made is slower in children than in adults for high reading span subjects who had the best verbal working memory , they were overall faster than the low reading span subjects this was because the animate subjects had a greater propensity to create a garden-path sentence despite greater verbal working memory a detailed discussion of syntactic ambiguity differentiating syntactic ambiguity ( structural ambiguity ) from other types of ambiguity

a globally ambiguous sentence is one that has at least two distinct interpretations in this type of ambiguity , after one has read or heard the entire sentence , the ambiguity is still present rereading the sentence can not resolve the ambiguity because no feature of the representation ( i.e global ambiguities are often unnoticed because the reader tends to choose the meaning he or she understands to be more probable one example of a global ambiguity is '' the woman held the baby in the green blanket '' in this example , the baby could be wrapped in the green blanket or the woman could be using the green blanket as an instrument to hold the baby a locally ambiguous sentence is a sentence that contains an ambiguous phrase but has only one interpretation the ambiguity in a locally ambiguous sentence briefly persists and is resolved , i.e sometimes , local ambiguities can result in garden path sentence , in which a structurally sound sentence is difficult to interpret because one interpretation of the ambiguous region is not the ultimate coherent interpretation the sentence could be taken to mean that henry will depose the duke , or that the duke will depose henry newspaper headlines are written in a telegram style ( headlinese ) which often zero copula , creating syntactic ambiguity he based this on the headline '' violinist linked to jal 123 blossoms '' that mike o'connell had posted , asking what such a headline could be called syntactic or structural ambiguities are frequently found in humor and advertising one of the most enduring jokes from the famous comedian groucho marx was his quip that used a modifier attachment ambiguity : '' i shot an elephant in my pajamas more than one movie has used the comic line '' the peasants are revolting '' , which allows an interpretation of revolting as both a verb or adjective in syntactic ambiguity , the same sequence of words is interpreted as having different syntactic structures in contrast , in semantic ambiguity the structure remains the same , but the individual words are interpreted differently if probabilistic and linguistic constraints offer comparable support for each analysis , especially strong competition occurs according to the reanalysis model , processing difficulty occurs once the reader has realized that their sentence analysis is false ( with regards to the already adopted syntactic structure ) , and they must then return and reevaluate the structure the unrestricted race model states that analysis is affected prior to the introduction of ambiguity and affects which meaning is adopted ( based on probability ) before multiple analyses are able to be introduced in sentence 1 , however , the ambiguity of the reflexive pronoun “ herself ” is consistent with both the maid and the princess while adults tend to have a higher working memory span , they sometimes spend more time resolving the ambiguity but tend to be more accurate in their final interpretation a detailed discussion of syntactic ambiguity differentiating syntactic ambiguity ( structural ambiguity ) from other types of ambiguity

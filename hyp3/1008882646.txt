390 the joint is bathed in synovial fluid which is contained inside the synovial membrane called the joint capsule the knee is the largest joint and one of the most important joints in the body the main articular bodies of the femur are its lateral and medial condyles these diverge slightly distally and posteriorly , with the lateral condyle being wider in front than at the back while the medial condyle is of more constant width the pair of tibial condyles are separated by the intercondylar eminence composed of a lateral and a medial tubercle the patella also serves an articular body , and its posterior surface is referred to as the trochlea of the knee the articular capsule has a synovial and a fibrous membrane separated by fatty deposits anteriorly , the synovial membrane is attached on the margin of the cartilage both on the femur and the tibia , but on the femur , the suprapatellar bursa or recess extends the joint space proximally behind , the synovial membrane is attached to the margins of the two femoral condyles which produces two extensions similar to the anterior recess numerous bursae surround the knee joint cartilage ensures supple knee movement there are two types of joint cartilage in the knees : fibrous cartilage ( the meniscus ) and hyaline cartilage the menisci are flattened at the center of the knee joint , fused with the synovial membrane laterally , and can move over the tibial surface they also play a role in shock absorption , and may be cracked , or torn , when the knee is forcefully rotated and/or bent the anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) stretches from the lateral condyle of femur to the anterior intercondylar area this ligament prevents posterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur it is also occasionally called the patellar tendon because there is no definite separation between the quadriceps tendon ( which surrounds the patella ) and the area connecting the patella to the tibia 194 and also functions as a cap for the condyles of the femur laterally and medially to the patellar ligament the lateral retinaculum connect fibers from the vasti lateralis and medialis muscles to the tibia some fibers from the iliotibial tract radiate into the lateral retinaculum and the medial retinaculum receives some transverse fibers arising on the medial femoral epicondyle it is composed of three groups of fibers , one stretching between the two bones , and two fused with the medial meniscus '' fibular '' ) stretches from the lateral epicondyle of the femur to the head of fibula lastly , there are two ligaments on the dorsal side of the knee the knee permits flexion and extension about a virtual transverse axis , as well as a slight medial and lateral rotation about the axis of the lower leg in the flexed position the knee joint is called '' mobile '' because the femur and lateral meniscus move over the tibia during rotation , while the femur rolls and glides over both menisci during extension-flexion during extension , the femoral condyles glide and roll into a position which causes the complete unfolding of the tibial collateral ligament because of the oblique position of the cruciate ligaments at least a part of one of them is always tense and these ligaments control the joint as the collateral ligaments are relaxed the second major class of knee disorder involves a tear , slippage , or dislocation that impairs the structural ability of the knee to balance the leg ( patellofemoral instability syndrome ) prepatellar bursitis also known as housemaid 's knee is painful inflammation of the prepatellar bursa ( a frontal knee bursa ) often brought about by occupational activity such as roofing the anterior cruciate ligament is the most commonly injured ligament of the knee meniscus tears occur during sports often when the knee is twisted pain often occurs when one squats a completely torn tendon requires surgery but a partially torn tendon can be treated with leg immobilization followed by physical therapy in humans , the term '' knee '' refers to the joints between the femur , tibia , and patella , in the leg in insects and other animals , the term knee widely refers to any hinge joint .

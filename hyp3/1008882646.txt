390 the joint is bathed in synovial fluid which is contained inside the synovial membrane called the joint capsule the posterolateral corner of the knee is an area that has recently been the subject of renewed scrutiny and research the knee is the largest joint and one of the most important joints in the body at birth , the patella is just formed from cartilage , and this will ossify ( change to bone ) between the ages of three and five years the main articular bodies of the femur are its lateral and medial condyles the patella also serves an articular body , and its posterior surface is referred to as the trochlea of the knee anteriorly , the synovial membrane is attached on the margin of the cartilage both on the femur and the tibia , but on the femur , the suprapatellar bursa or recess extends the joint space proximally two non-communicative bursae are located in front of the patella and below the patellar tendon , and others are sometimes present cartilage is a thin , elastic tissue that protects the bone and makes certain that the joint surfaces can slide easily over each other there are two types of joint cartilage in the knees : fibrous cartilage ( the meniscus ) and hyaline cartilage hyaline cartilage covers the surface along which the joints move collagen fibres within the articular cartilage have been described by benninghoff as arising from the subchondral bone in a radial manner , building so called gothic arches as a result , new cracks and tears will form in the cartilage over time the articular disks of the knee-joint are called menisci because they only partly divide the joint space strong fibers run along the menisci from one attachment to the other , while weaker radial fibers are interlaced with the former the menisci are flattened at the center of the knee joint , fused with the synovial membrane laterally , and can move over the tibial surface the menisci serve to protect the ends of the bones from rubbing on each other and to effectively deepen the tibial sockets into which the femur attaches they also play a role in shock absorption , and may be cracked , or torn , when the knee is forcefully rotated and/or bent the knee is stabilized by a pair of cruciate ligaments injury to this ligament is uncommon but can occur as a direct result of forced trauma to the ligament 200 the posterior and anterior meniscofemoral ligaments stretch from the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus to the medial femoral condyle the patellar ligament connects the patella to the tuberosity of the tibia this very strong ligament helps give the patella its mechanical leverage , p it protects the medial side of the knee from being bent open by a stress applied to the lateral side of the knee ( a valgus force ) '' fibular '' ) stretches from the lateral epicondyle of the femur to the head of fibula it is separate from both the joint capsule and the lateral meniscus the knee joint is called '' mobile '' because the femur and lateral meniscus move over the tibia during rotation , while the femur rolls and glides over both menisci during extension-flexion during extension , the femoral condyles glide and roll into a position which causes the complete unfolding of the tibial collateral ligament knee pain is caused by trauma , misalignment , and degeneration as well as by conditions like arthritis any kind of work during which the knees undergo heavy stress may also be detrimental to cartilage some of the most common knee injuries are those to the medial side : medial knee injuries the menisci act as shock absorbers and separate the two ends of bone in the knee joint the degree of varus or valgus deformity can be quantified by the hip-knee-ankle angle , which is an angle between the femoral mechanical axis and the center of the ankle joint in humans , the term '' knee '' refers to the joints between the femur , tibia , and patella , in the leg in insects and other animals , the term knee widely refers to any hinge joint .

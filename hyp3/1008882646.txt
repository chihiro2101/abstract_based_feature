390 the joint is bathed in synovial fluid which is contained inside the synovial membrane called the joint capsule the knee is the largest joint and one of the most important joints in the body the main articular bodies of the femur are its lateral and medial condyles it is inserted into the thin anterior wall of the joint capsule anteriorly , the synovial membrane is attached on the margin of the cartilage both on the femur and the tibia , but on the femur , the suprapatellar bursa or recess extends the joint space proximally the suprapatellar bursa is prevented from being pinched during extension by the articularis genus muscle behind , the synovial membrane is attached to the margins of the two femoral condyles which produces two extensions similar to the anterior recess between these two extensions , the synovial membrane passes in front of the two cruciate ligaments at the center of the joint , thus forming a pocket direct inward two non-communicative bursae are located in front of the patella and below the patellar tendon , and others are sometimes present cartilage is a thin , elastic tissue that protects the bone and makes certain that the joint surfaces can slide easily over each other there are two types of joint cartilage in the knees : fibrous cartilage ( the meniscus ) and hyaline cartilage cartilage will wear over the years as a result , new cracks and tears will form in the cartilage over time the articular disks of the knee-joint are called menisci because they only partly divide the joint space strong fibers run along the menisci from one attachment to the other , while weaker radial fibers are interlaced with the former the menisci are flattened at the center of the knee joint , fused with the synovial membrane laterally , and can move over the tibial surface the ligaments surrounding the knee joint offer stability by limiting movements and , together with the menisci and several bursae , protect the articular capsule the anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) stretches from the lateral condyle of femur to the anterior intercondylar area it is often torn during twisting or bending of the knee the posterior cruciate ligament ( pcl ) stretches from medial condyle of femur to the posterior intercondylar area the transverse ligament stretches from the lateral meniscus to the medial meniscus it is composed of three groups of fibers , one stretching between the two bones , and two fused with the medial meniscus it is separate from both the joint capsule and the lateral meniscus the oblique popliteal ligament is a radiation of the tendon of the semimembranosus on the medial side , from where it is direct laterally and proximally the muscles responsible for the movement of the knee joint belong to either the anterior , medial or posterior compartment of the thigh the knee permits flexion and extension about a virtual transverse axis , as well as a slight medial and lateral rotation about the axis of the lower leg in the flexed position this center moves upward and backward during flexion , while the distance between the center and the articular surfaces of the femur changes dynamically with the decreasing curvature of the femoral condyles with the knee extended both the lateral and medial collateral ligaments , as well as the anterior part of the anterior cruciate ligament , are taut rotation is controlled by the twisted cruciate ligaments ; the two ligaments get twisted around each other during medial rotation of the tibia—which reduces the amount of rotation possible—while they become unwound during lateral rotation of the tibia knee pain is caused by trauma , misalignment , and degeneration as well as by conditions like arthritis one form of patellofemoral syndrome involves a tissue-related problem that creates pressure and irritation in the knee between the patella and the trochlea ( patellar compression syndrome ) , which causes pain some of the most common knee injuries are those to the medial side : medial knee injuries menisci injury may be innocuous and one may be able to walk after a tear , but soon swelling and pain set in overuse injuries of the knee include tendonitis , bursitis , muscle strains , and iliotibial band syndrome in quadrupeds such as dogs , horses , and mice , the homologous joints between the femur , tibia , and patella , in the hind leg , are known as the stifle joint

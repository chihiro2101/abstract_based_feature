390 the joint is bathed in synovial fluid which is contained inside the synovial membrane called the joint capsule the posterolateral corner of the knee is an area that has recently been the subject of renewed scrutiny and research the knee is the largest joint and one of the most important joints in the body it plays an essential role in movement related to carrying the body weight in horizontal ( running and walking ) and vertical ( jumping ) directions because it is the largest sesamoid bone in the human body , the ossification process takes significantly longer the main articular bodies of the femur are its lateral and medial condyles anteriorly , the synovial membrane is attached on the margin of the cartilage both on the femur and the tibia , but on the femur , the suprapatellar bursa or recess extends the joint space proximally behind , the synovial membrane is attached to the margins of the two femoral condyles which produces two extensions similar to the anterior recess between these two extensions , the synovial membrane passes in front of the two cruciate ligaments at the center of the joint , thus forming a pocket direct inward numerous bursae surround the knee joint four considerably smaller bursae are located on the back of the knee two non-communicative bursae are located in front of the patella and below the patellar tendon , and others are sometimes present cartilage ensures supple knee movement there are two types of joint cartilage in the knees : fibrous cartilage ( the meniscus ) and hyaline cartilage synovial fluid and the subchondral bone marrow serve both as nutrition sources for the hyaline cartilage the articular disks of the knee-joint are called menisci because they only partly divide the joint space the menisci are flattened at the center of the knee joint , fused with the synovial membrane laterally , and can move over the tibial surface the menisci serve to protect the ends of the bones from rubbing on each other and to effectively deepen the tibial sockets into which the femur attaches they also play a role in shock absorption , and may be cracked , or torn , when the knee is forcefully rotated and/or bent the ligaments surrounding the knee joint offer stability by limiting movements and , together with the menisci and several bursae , protect the articular capsule the acl is critically important because it prevents the tibia from being pushed too far anterior relative to the femur this ligament prevents posterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur the two menisci are attached to each other anteriorly by the ligament this very strong ligament helps give the patella its mechanical leverage , p '' tibial '' ) stretches from the medial epicondyle of the femur to the medial tibial condyle the mcl is partly covered by the pes anserinus and the tendon of the semimembranosus passes under it it protects the medial side of the knee from being bent open by a stress applied to the lateral side of the knee ( a valgus force ) the knee joint is called '' mobile '' because the femur and lateral meniscus move over the tibia during rotation , while the femur rolls and glides over both menisci during extension-flexion this center moves upward and backward during flexion , while the distance between the center and the articular surfaces of the femur changes dynamically with the decreasing curvature of the femoral condyles with the knee extended both the lateral and medial collateral ligaments , as well as the anterior part of the anterior cruciate ligament , are taut the final rotation is produced by a lateral rotation of the tibia in the non-weight-bearing leg , and by a medial rotation of the femur in the weight-bearing leg the menisci act as shock absorbers and separate the two ends of bone in the knee joint the degree of varus or valgus deformity can be quantified by the hip-knee-ankle angle , which is an angle between the femoral mechanical axis and the center of the ankle joint in quadrupeds such as dogs , horses , and mice , the homologous joints between the femur , tibia , and patella , in the hind leg , are known as the stifle joint in insects and other animals , the term knee widely refers to any hinge joint .

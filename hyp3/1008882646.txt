390 the joint is bathed in synovial fluid which is contained inside the synovial membrane called the joint capsule the knee is the largest joint and one of the most important joints in the body the main articular bodies of the femur are its lateral and medial condyles the radius of the condyles ' curvature in the sagittal plane becomes smaller toward the back the pair of tibial condyles are separated by the intercondylar eminence composed of a lateral and a medial tubercle the patella also serves an articular body , and its posterior surface is referred to as the trochlea of the knee on its posterior surface is a lateral and a medial articular surface , both of which communicate with the patellar surface which unites the two femoral condyles on the anterior side of the bone 's distal end the articular capsule has a synovial and a fibrous membrane separated by fatty deposits between these two extensions , the synovial membrane passes in front of the two cruciate ligaments at the center of the joint , thus forming a pocket direct inward hyaline cartilage covers the surface along which the joints move there are no blood vessels inside of the hyaline cartilage , the alimentation is performed per diffusion these two disks , the medial meniscus and the lateral meniscus , consist of connective tissue with extensive collagen fibers containing cartilage-like cells the menisci are flattened at the center of the knee joint , fused with the synovial membrane laterally , and can move over the tibial surface the ligaments surrounding the knee joint offer stability by limiting movements and , together with the menisci and several bursae , protect the articular capsule the anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) stretches from the lateral condyle of femur to the anterior intercondylar area the posterior cruciate ligament ( pcl ) stretches from medial condyle of femur to the posterior intercondylar area this ligament prevents posterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur 200 the posterior and anterior meniscofemoral ligaments stretch from the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus to the medial femoral condyle the posterior meniscofemoral ligament is more commonly present ( 30 % ) ; both ligaments are present less often it is also occasionally called the patellar tendon because there is no definite separation between the quadriceps tendon ( which surrounds the patella ) and the area connecting the patella to the tibia it is composed of three groups of fibers , one stretching between the two bones , and two fused with the medial meniscus it protects the medial side of the knee from being bent open by a stress applied to the lateral side of the knee ( a valgus force ) '' fibular '' ) stretches from the lateral epicondyle of the femur to the head of fibula it protects the lateral side from an inside bending force ( a varus force ) the oblique popliteal ligament is a radiation of the tendon of the semimembranosus on the medial side , from where it is direct laterally and proximally the knee permits flexion and extension about a virtual transverse axis , as well as a slight medial and lateral rotation about the axis of the lower leg in the flexed position the center of the transverse axis of the extension/flexion movements is located where both collateral ligaments and both cruciate ligaments intersect with the knee extended both the lateral and medial collateral ligaments , as well as the anterior part of the anterior cruciate ligament , are taut during extension , the femoral condyles glide and roll into a position which causes the complete unfolding of the tibial collateral ligament in the flexed position , the collateral ligaments are relaxed while the cruciate ligaments are taut any kind of work during which the knees undergo heavy stress may also be detrimental to cartilage minor tears of the anterior cruciate ligament may heal over time , but a torn acl requires surgery a completely torn tendon requires surgery but a partially torn tendon can be treated with leg immobilization followed by physical therapy in humans , the term '' knee '' refers to the joints between the femur , tibia , and patella , in the leg in insects and other animals , the term knee widely refers to any hinge joint .

390 the joint is bathed in synovial fluid which is contained inside the synovial membrane called the joint capsule the knee is the largest joint and one of the most important joints in the body at birth , the patella is just formed from cartilage , and this will ossify ( change to bone ) between the ages of three and five years because it is the largest sesamoid bone in the human body , the ossification process takes significantly longer the patella also serves an articular body , and its posterior surface is referred to as the trochlea of the knee anteriorly , the synovial membrane is attached on the margin of the cartilage both on the femur and the tibia , but on the femur , the suprapatellar bursa or recess extends the joint space proximally behind , the synovial membrane is attached to the margins of the two femoral condyles which produces two extensions similar to the anterior recess between these two extensions , the synovial membrane passes in front of the two cruciate ligaments at the center of the joint , thus forming a pocket direct inward there are two types of joint cartilage in the knees : fibrous cartilage ( the meniscus ) and hyaline cartilage the articular disks of the knee-joint are called menisci because they only partly divide the joint space strong fibers run along the menisci from one attachment to the other , while weaker radial fibers are interlaced with the former the ligaments surrounding the knee joint offer stability by limiting movements and , together with the menisci and several bursae , protect the articular capsule the acl is critically important because it prevents the tibia from being pushed too far anterior relative to the femur injury to this ligament is uncommon but can occur as a direct result of forced trauma to the ligament the two menisci are attached to each other anteriorly by the ligament some fibers from the iliotibial tract radiate into the lateral retinaculum and the medial retinaculum receives some transverse fibers arising on the medial femoral epicondyle '' tibial '' ) stretches from the medial epicondyle of the femur to the medial tibial condyle it is composed of three groups of fibers , one stretching between the two bones , and two fused with the medial meniscus it protects the medial side of the knee from being bent open by a stress applied to the lateral side of the knee ( a valgus force ) it is separate from both the joint capsule and the lateral meniscus it protects the lateral side from an inside bending force ( a varus force ) lastly , there are two ligaments on the dorsal side of the knee the extensors generally belong to the anterior compartment and the flexors to the posterior the two exceptions to this is gracilis , a flexor , which belongs to the medial compartment and sartorius , a flexor , in the anterior compartment the knee permits flexion and extension about a virtual transverse axis , as well as a slight medial and lateral rotation about the axis of the lower leg in the flexed position with the knee extended both the lateral and medial collateral ligaments , as well as the anterior part of the anterior cruciate ligament , are taut this terminal rotation is made possible by the shape of the medial femoral condyle , assisted by contraction of the popliteus muscle and the iliotibial tract and is caused by the stretching of the anterior cruciate ligament both cruciate ligaments are slightly unwinded and both lateral ligaments become taut in the flexed position , the collateral ligaments are relaxed while the cruciate ligaments are taut because of the oblique position of the cruciate ligaments at least a part of one of them is always tense and these ligaments control the joint as the collateral ligaments are relaxed furthermore , the dorsal fibers of the tibial collateral ligament become tensed during extreme medial rotation and the ligament also reduces the lateral rotation to 45–60° there are two menisci in the knee , the medial ( inner ) and the lateral ( outer ) in humans , the term '' knee '' refers to the joints between the femur , tibia , and patella , in the leg in quadrupeds such as dogs , horses , and mice , the homologous joints between the femur , tibia , and patella , in the hind leg , are known as the stifle joint in insects and other animals , the term knee widely refers to any hinge joint .

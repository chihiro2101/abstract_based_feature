in the us , mains electric power is referred to by several names including '' utility power '' , '' household power '' , '' household electricity '' , '' house current '' , '' powerline '' , '' domestic power '' , '' wall power '' , '' line power '' , '' ac power '' , '' city power '' , '' street power '' for a list of voltages , frequencies , and wall plugs by country , see mains electricity by country worldwide , many different mains power systems are found for the operation of household and light commercial electrical appliances and lighting the different systems are primarily characterized by their voltage frequency plugs and sockets ( receptacles or outlets ) earthing system ( grounding ) protection against overcurrent damage ( e.g the two commonly used frequencies are 50 & nbsp ; hz and 60 & nbsp ; hz foreign enclaves , such as large industrial plants or overseas military bases , may have a different standard voltage or frequency from the surrounding areas some city areas may use standards different from that of the surrounding countryside ( e.g regions in an effective state of anarchy may have no central electrical authority , with electric power provided by incompatible private sources many other combinations of voltage and utility frequency were formerly used , with frequencies between 25 & nbsp ; hz and 133 & nbsp ; hz and voltages from 100 & nbsp ; v to 250 & nbsp ; v the modern combinations of 230 & nbsp ; v/50 & nbsp ; hz and 120 & nbsp ; v/60 & nbsp ; hz , listed in iec 60038 , did not apply in the first few decades of the 20th century and are still not universal historically 110 & nbsp ; v , 115 & nbsp ; v and 117 & nbsp ; v have been used at different times and places in north america mains power is sometimes spoken of as 110 & nbsp ; v ; however , 120 & nbsp ; v is the nominal voltage nominal voltages gradually crept upward to 112 & nbsp ; v and 115 & nbsp ; v , or even 117 & nbsp ; v today , virtually all american homes and businesses have access to 120 and 240 & nbsp ; v at 60 & nbsp ; hz today most 60 & nbsp ; hz systems deliver nominal 120/240 & nbsp ; v , and most 50 & nbsp ; hz nominally 230 & nbsp ; v longer-term power outages , brown-outs and black outs and low reliability of supply generally increase costs to customers , who may have to invest in uninterruptible power supply or stand-by generator sets to provide power when the utility supply is unavailable or unusable

in the us , mains electric power is referred to by several names including '' utility power '' , '' household power '' , '' household electricity '' , '' house current '' , '' powerline '' , '' domestic power '' , '' wall power '' , '' line power '' , '' ac power '' , '' city power '' , '' street power '' for a list of voltages , frequencies , and wall plugs by country , see mains electricity by country worldwide , many different mains power systems are found for the operation of household and light commercial electrical appliances and lighting the different systems are primarily characterized by their voltage frequency plugs and sockets ( receptacles or outlets ) earthing system ( grounding ) protection against overcurrent damage ( e.g the two commonly used frequencies are 50 & nbsp ; hz and 60 & nbsp ; hz foreign enclaves , such as large industrial plants or overseas military bases , may have a different standard voltage or frequency from the surrounding areas many other combinations of voltage and utility frequency were formerly used , with frequencies between 25 & nbsp ; hz and 133 & nbsp ; hz and voltages from 100 & nbsp ; v to 250 & nbsp ; v the modern combinations of 230 & nbsp ; v/50 & nbsp ; hz and 120 & nbsp ; v/60 & nbsp ; hz , listed in iec 60038 , did not apply in the first few decades of the 20th century and are still not universal some areas of the uk still have 250 & nbsp ; volts for legacy reasons , but these also fall within the 10 % tolerance band of 230 & nbsp ; volts historically 110 & nbsp ; v , 115 & nbsp ; v and 117 & nbsp ; v have been used at different times and places in north america mains power is sometimes spoken of as 110 & nbsp ; v ; however , 120 & nbsp ; v is the nominal voltage it was an alternating current ( ac ) system using a siemens alternator supplying power for both street lights and consumers at two voltages , 250 & nbsp ; v for arc lamps , and 40 & nbsp ; v for incandescent lamps ac systems started appearing in the us in the mid-1880s , using higher distribution voltage stepped down via transformers to the same 110 & nbsp ; v customer utilization voltage that edison used the significant exceptions are in brazil , which has a synchronized 60 & nbsp ; hz grid with both 127 & nbsp ; v and 220 & nbsp ; v as standard voltages in different regions , and japan , which has two frequencies : 50 & nbsp ; hz for east japan and 60 & nbsp ; hz for west japan since these taps are not automatically controlled , they are used only to adjust the long-term average voltage at the service and not to regulate the voltage seen by the utility customer longer-term power outages , brown-outs and black outs and low reliability of supply generally increase costs to customers , who may have to invest in uninterruptible power supply or stand-by generator sets to provide power when the utility supply is unavailable or unusable

in the us , mains electric power is referred to by several names including '' utility power '' , '' household power '' , '' household electricity '' , '' house current '' , '' powerline '' , '' domestic power '' , '' wall power '' , '' line power '' , '' ac power '' , '' city power '' , '' street power '' this is also reflected in names of current and historical electricity monopolies such as hydro-qu√©bec , bc hydro , manitoba hydro , newfoundland and labrador hydro , and hydro one for a list of voltages , frequencies , and wall plugs by country , see mains electricity by country worldwide , many different mains power systems are found for the operation of household and light commercial electrical appliances and lighting the different systems are primarily characterized by their voltage frequency plugs and sockets ( receptacles or outlets ) earthing system ( grounding ) protection against overcurrent damage ( e.g the two commonly used frequencies are 50 & nbsp ; hz and 60 & nbsp ; hz single-phase or three-phase power is most commonly used today , although two-phase systems were used early in the 20th century regions in an effective state of anarchy may have no central electrical authority , with electric power provided by incompatible private sources many other combinations of voltage and utility frequency were formerly used , with frequencies between 25 & nbsp ; hz and 133 & nbsp ; hz and voltages from 100 & nbsp ; v to 250 & nbsp ; v the modern combinations of 230 & nbsp ; v/50 & nbsp ; hz and 120 & nbsp ; v/60 & nbsp ; hz , listed in iec 60038 , did not apply in the first few decades of the 20th century and are still not universal industrial plants with three-phase power will have different , higher voltages installed for large equipment ( and different sockets and plugs ) , but the common voltages listed here would still be found for lighting and portable equipment mains power is sometimes spoken of as 110 & nbsp ; v ; however , 120 & nbsp ; v is the nominal voltage today , virtually all american homes and businesses have access to 120 and 240 & nbsp ; v at 60 & nbsp ; hz today most 60 & nbsp ; hz systems deliver nominal 120/240 & nbsp ; v , and most 50 & nbsp ; hz nominally 230 & nbsp ; v the significant exceptions are in brazil , which has a synchronized 60 & nbsp ; hz grid with both 127 & nbsp ; v and 220 & nbsp ; v as standard voltages in different regions , and japan , which has two frequencies : 50 & nbsp ; hz for east japan and 60 & nbsp ; hz for west japan power quality can also be affected by distortions of the current or voltage waveform in the form of harmonics of the fundamental ( supply ) frequency , or non-harmonic intermodulation such as that caused by rfi or emi interference

in the us , mains electric power is referred to by several names including '' utility power '' , '' household power '' , '' household electricity '' , '' house current '' , '' powerline '' , '' domestic power '' , '' wall power '' , '' line power '' , '' ac power '' , '' city power '' , '' street power '' for a list of voltages , frequencies , and wall plugs by country , see mains electricity by country worldwide , many different mains power systems are found for the operation of household and light commercial electrical appliances and lighting the different systems are primarily characterized by their voltage frequency plugs and sockets ( receptacles or outlets ) earthing system ( grounding ) protection against overcurrent damage ( e.g the two commonly used frequencies are 50 & nbsp ; hz and 60 & nbsp ; hz single-phase or three-phase power is most commonly used today , although two-phase systems were used early in the 20th century regions in an effective state of anarchy may have no central electrical authority , with electric power provided by incompatible private sources many other combinations of voltage and utility frequency were formerly used , with frequencies between 25 & nbsp ; hz and 133 & nbsp ; hz and voltages from 100 & nbsp ; v to 250 & nbsp ; v the modern combinations of 230 & nbsp ; v/50 & nbsp ; hz and 120 & nbsp ; v/60 & nbsp ; hz , listed in iec 60038 , did not apply in the first few decades of the 20th century and are still not universal equipment ( with the exception of filament bulbs ) used in these countries is designed to accept any voltage within the specified range historically 110 & nbsp ; v , 115 & nbsp ; v and 117 & nbsp ; v have been used at different times and places in north america mains power is sometimes spoken of as 110 & nbsp ; v ; however , 120 & nbsp ; v is the nominal voltage in 2000 , australia converted to 230 & nbsp ; v as the nominal standard with a tolerance of +10 % /−6 % , this superseding the old 240 & nbsp ; v standard , as2926-1987 the world 's first large scale central plant—thomas edison ’ s holborn viaduct power station in london—started operation in january 1882 , providing direct current ( dc ) at 110 & nbsp ; v nominal voltages gradually crept upward to 112 & nbsp ; v and 115 & nbsp ; v , or even 117 & nbsp ; v today most 60 & nbsp ; hz systems deliver nominal 120/240 & nbsp ; v , and most 50 & nbsp ; hz nominally 230 & nbsp ; v

in the us , mains electric power is referred to by several names including '' utility power '' , '' household power '' , '' household electricity '' , '' house current '' , '' powerline '' , '' domestic power '' , '' wall power '' , '' line power '' , '' ac power '' , '' city power '' , '' street power '' for a list of voltages , frequencies , and wall plugs by country , see mains electricity by country worldwide , many different mains power systems are found for the operation of household and light commercial electrical appliances and lighting the different systems are primarily characterized by their voltage frequency plugs and sockets ( receptacles or outlets ) earthing system ( grounding ) protection against overcurrent damage ( e.g the two commonly used frequencies are 50 & nbsp ; hz and 60 & nbsp ; hz many other combinations of voltage and utility frequency were formerly used , with frequencies between 25 & nbsp ; hz and 133 & nbsp ; hz and voltages from 100 & nbsp ; v to 250 & nbsp ; v direct current ( dc ) has been almost completely displaced by alternating current ( ac ) in public power systems , but dc was used especially in some city areas to the end of the 20th century the modern combinations of 230 & nbsp ; v/50 & nbsp ; hz and 120 & nbsp ; v/60 & nbsp ; hz , listed in iec 60038 , did not apply in the first few decades of the 20th century and are still not universal the us energy information administration ( eia ) has published : estimated us residential electricity consumption by end use , for the year 2016 how is electricity used in u.s some areas of the uk still have 250 & nbsp ; volts for legacy reasons , but these also fall within the 10 % tolerance band of 230 & nbsp ; volts historically 110 & nbsp ; v , 115 & nbsp ; v and 117 & nbsp ; v have been used at different times and places in north america ac systems started appearing in the us in the mid-1880s , using higher distribution voltage stepped down via transformers to the same 110 & nbsp ; v customer utilization voltage that edison used ac circuits adopted the same form during the war of the currents , allowing lamps to be run at around 110 & nbsp ; v and major appliances to be connected to 220 & nbsp ; v the most common frequency was 133â…“ & nbsp ; hz the significant exceptions are in brazil , which has a synchronized 60 & nbsp ; hz grid with both 127 & nbsp ; v and 220 & nbsp ; v as standard voltages in different regions , and japan , which has two frequencies : 50 & nbsp ; hz for east japan and 60 & nbsp ; hz for west japan longer-term power outages , brown-outs and black outs and low reliability of supply generally increase costs to customers , who may have to invest in uninterruptible power supply or stand-by generator sets to provide power when the utility supply is unavailable or unusable

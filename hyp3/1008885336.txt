in the us , mains electric power is referred to by several names including '' utility power '' , '' household power '' , '' household electricity '' , '' house current '' , '' powerline '' , '' domestic power '' , '' wall power '' , '' line power '' , '' ac power '' , '' city power '' , '' street power '' in the uk , mains electric power is generally referred to as '' the mains '' more than half of power in canada is hydroelectricity , and mains electricity is often referred to there as '' hydro '' the two commonly used frequencies are 50 & nbsp ; hz and 60 & nbsp ; hz single-phase or three-phase power is most commonly used today , although two-phase systems were used early in the 20th century foreign enclaves , such as large industrial plants or overseas military bases , may have a different standard voltage or frequency from the surrounding areas many other combinations of voltage and utility frequency were formerly used , with frequencies between 25 & nbsp ; hz and 133 & nbsp ; hz and voltages from 100 & nbsp ; v to 250 & nbsp ; v direct current ( dc ) has been almost completely displaced by alternating current ( ac ) in public power systems , but dc was used especially in some city areas to the end of the 20th century the modern combinations of 230 & nbsp ; v/50 & nbsp ; hz and 120 & nbsp ; v/60 & nbsp ; hz , listed in iec 60038 , did not apply in the first few decades of the 20th century and are still not universal industrial plants with three-phase power will have different , higher voltages installed for large equipment ( and different sockets and plugs ) , but the common voltages listed here would still be found for lighting and portable equipment mains power is sometimes spoken of as 110 & nbsp ; v ; however , 120 & nbsp ; v is the nominal voltage in 2000 , australia converted to 230 & nbsp ; v as the nominal standard with a tolerance of +10 % /âˆ’6 % , this superseding the old 240 & nbsp ; v standard , as2926-1987 nominal voltages gradually crept upward to 112 & nbsp ; v and 115 & nbsp ; v , or even 117 & nbsp ; v today most 60 & nbsp ; hz systems deliver nominal 120/240 & nbsp ; v , and most 50 & nbsp ; hz nominally 230 & nbsp ; v the significant exceptions are in brazil , which has a synchronized 60 & nbsp ; hz grid with both 127 & nbsp ; v and 220 & nbsp ; v as standard voltages in different regions , and japan , which has two frequencies : 50 & nbsp ; hz for east japan and 60 & nbsp ; hz for west japan

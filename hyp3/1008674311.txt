in physics , a world line of an object ( approximated as a point in space , e.g a world line is a special type of curve in spacetime below an equivalent definition will be explained : a world line is a time-like curve in spacetime each point of a world line is an event that can be labeled with the time and the spatial position of the object at that time the world line of the earth is helix in spacetime ( a curve in a four-dimensional space ) and does not return to the same point each event can be labeled by four numbers : a time coordinate and three space coordinates ; thus spacetime is a four-dimensional space harvey : a curve m in spacetime is called a worldline of a particle if its tangent is future timelike at each point a world line traces out the path of a single point in spacetime once the object is not approximated as a mere point but has extended volume , it traces out not a world line but rather a world tube world lines as a tool to describe events the use of world lines in general relativity is basically the same as in special relativity , with the difference that spacetime can be curved world lines of free-falling particles or objects ( such as planets around the sun or an astronaut in space ) are called geodesics world lines in quantum field theory world lines and other physical concepts like the dirac sea are also used throughout the series in depth text on world lines and special relativity

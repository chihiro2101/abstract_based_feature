in physics , a world line of an object ( approximated as a point in space , e.g , a particle or observer ) is the sequence of spacetime events corresponding to the history of the object a world line is a special type of curve in spacetime below an equivalent definition will be explained : a world line is a time-like curve in spacetime each point of a world line is an event that can be labeled with the time and the spatial position of the object at that time the world line of the earth is helix in spacetime ( a curve in a four-dimensional space ) and does not return to the same point each event can be labeled by four numbers : a time coordinate and three space coordinates ; thus spacetime is a four-dimensional space harvey : a curve m in spacetime is called a worldline of a particle if its tangent is future timelike at each point a world line traces out the path of a single point in spacetime once the object is not approximated as a mere point but has extended volume , it traces out not a world line but rather a world tube each value of the parameter corresponds to a point in spacetime and varying the parameter traces out a line world lines in general relativity also , in general relativity , world lines are timelike curves in spacetime , where timelike curves fall within the lightcone world lines of free-falling particles or objects ( such as planets around the sun or an astronaut in space ) are called geodesics in depth text on world lines and special relativity

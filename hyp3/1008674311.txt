in physics , a world line of an object ( approximated as a point in space , e.g a world line is a special type of curve in spacetime below an equivalent definition will be explained : a world line is a time-like curve in spacetime each point of a world line is an event that can be labeled with the time and the spatial position of the object at that time the world line of the earth is helix in spacetime ( a curve in a four-dimensional space ) and does not return to the same point each event can be labeled by four numbers : a time coordinate and three space coordinates ; thus spacetime is a four-dimensional space the mathematical term for spacetime is a four-dimensional manifold a world line traces out the path of a single point in spacetime a world sheet is the analogous two-dimensional surface traced out by a one-dimensional line ( like a string ) traveling through spacetime image : brane-wlwswv.png 300px right thumb world line , worldsheet , and world volume , as they are derived from particles , strings , and branes each value of the parameter corresponds to a point in spacetime and varying the parameter traces out a line the use of world lines in general relativity is basically the same as in special relativity , with the difference that spacetime can be curved a metric exists and its dynamics are determined by the einstein field equations and are dependent on the mass-energy distribution in spacetime also , in general relativity , world lines are timelike curves in spacetime , where timelike curves fall within the lightcone in depth text on world lines and special relativity

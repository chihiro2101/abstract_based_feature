though not commonly referred to as optical mice , nearly all mechanical mice tracked movement using leds and photodiodes to detect when beams of infrared light did and did n't pass through holes in a pair of incremental rotary encoder wheels ( one for left/right , another for forward/back ) , driven by a rubberized ball thus , the primary distinction of “ optical mice ” is not their use of optics , but their complete lack of moving parts to track mouse movement , instead employing an entirely solid-state system the kirsch and lyon mouse types had very different behaviors , as the kirsch mouse used an x-y coordinate system embedded in the pad , and would not work correctly when the pad was rotated , while the lyon mouse used the x-y coordinate system of the mouse body , as mechanical mice do patent 4,751,505 optical mouse modern surface-independent optical mice work by using an optoelectronic sensor ( essentially , a tiny low-resolution video camera ) to take successive images of the surface on which the mouse operates this advance enabled the mouse to detect relative motion on a wide variety of surfaces , translating the movement of the mouse into the movement of the cursor and eliminating the need for a special mouse-pad the first commercially available , modern optical computer mice were the microsoft intellimouse with intellieye and intellimouse explorer , introduced in 1999 using technology developed by hewlett-packard other manufacturers soon followed microsoft 's lead using components manufactured by the hp spin-off agilent technologies , and over the next several years mechanical mice became obsolete the technology underlying the modern optical computer mouse is known as digital image correlation , a technology pioneered by the defense industry for tracking military targets optical mice use image sensors to image naturally occurring texture in materials such as wood , cloth , mouse pads and formica to understand how optical flow is used in optical mice , imagine two photographs of the same object except slightly offset from each other the amount that the edges of one photograph overhang the other represents the offset between the images , and in the case of an optical computer mouse the distance it has moved by describing an optical means that explicitly overcame the limitations of wheels , balls , and rollers used in contemporary computer mice , the optical mouse was anticipated in 2002 , gary gordon , derek knee , rajeev badyal and jason hartlove were awarded us patent 6,433,780 for an optical computer mouse that measured position using image correlation the laser mouse uses an infrared laser diode instead of an led to illuminate the surface beneath their sensor some mice , such as the logitech v450 848 & nbsp ; nm laser mouse , are capable of functioning on two aa batteries for a full year , due to the low power requirements of the infrared laser optical models outperform mechanical mice on uneven , slick , soft , sticky , or loose surfaces , and generally in mobile situations lacking mouse pads because optical mice render movement based on an image which the led ( or infrared diode ) lighting , use with multicolored mouse pads may result in unreliable performance ; however , laser mice do not suffer these problems and will track on such surfaces .

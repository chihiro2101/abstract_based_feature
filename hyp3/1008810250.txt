thus , the primary distinction of “ optical mice ” is not their use of optics , but their complete lack of moving parts to track mouse movement , instead employing an entirely solid-state system the optical mouse ultimately sold with the xerox star office computer used an inverted sensor chip packaging approach patented by lisa m patent 4,751,505 optical mouse modern surface-independent optical mice work by using an optoelectronic sensor ( essentially , a tiny low-resolution video camera ) to take successive images of the surface on which the mouse operates this advance enabled the mouse to detect relative motion on a wide variety of surfaces , translating the movement of the mouse into the movement of the cursor and eliminating the need for a special mouse-pad the first commercially available , modern optical computer mice were the microsoft intellimouse with intellieye and intellimouse explorer , introduced in 1999 using technology developed by hewlett-packard the technology underlying the modern optical computer mouse is known as digital image correlation , a technology pioneered by the defense industry for tracking military targets a simple binary-image version of digital image correlation was used in the 1980 lyon optical mouse these surfaces , when lit at a grazing angle by a light emitting diode , cast distinct shadows that resemble a hilly terrain lit at sunset images of these surfaces are captured in continuous succession and compared with each other to determine how far the mouse has moved to understand how optical flow is used in optical mice , imagine two photographs of the same object except slightly offset from each other the amount that the edges of one photograph overhang the other represents the offset between the images , and in the case of an optical computer mouse the distance it has moved optical mice mathematically process these images using cross correlation to calculate how much each successive image is offset from the previous one an optical mouse might use an image sensor having an 18 × 18 pixel array of monochromatic pixels one refinement would be accelerating the correlation process by using information from previous motions , and another refinement would be preventing deadbands when moving slowly by adding interpolation or frame-skipping , position measurement ) principles based on detecting and correlating microscopic , inherent features of the surface over which the navigation sensor travelled , and using position measurements of each end of a linear ( document ) image sensor to reconstruct an image of the document to do this , the mouse dims or blinks the laser or led when in standby mode ( each mouse has a different standby time ) because optical mice render movement based on an image which the led ( or infrared diode ) lighting , use with multicolored mouse pads may result in unreliable performance ; however , laser mice do not suffer these problems and will track on such surfaces .

thus , the primary distinction of “ optical mice ” is not their use of optics , but their complete lack of moving parts to track mouse movement , instead employing an entirely solid-state system predictive algorithms in the cpu of the mouse calculated the speed and direction over the grid the optical mouse ultimately sold with the xerox star office computer used an inverted sensor chip packaging approach patented by lisa m patent 4,751,505 optical mouse modern surface-independent optical mice work by using an optoelectronic sensor ( essentially , a tiny low-resolution video camera ) to take successive images of the surface on which the mouse operates a surface-independent coherent light optical mouse design was patented by stephen b the first commercially available , modern optical computer mice were the microsoft intellimouse with intellieye and intellimouse explorer , introduced in 1999 using technology developed by hewlett-packard other manufacturers soon followed microsoft 's lead using components manufactured by the hp spin-off agilent technologies , and over the next several years mechanical mice became obsolete the technology underlying the modern optical computer mouse is known as digital image correlation , a technology pioneered by the defense industry for tracking military targets a simple binary-image version of digital image correlation was used in the 1980 lyon optical mouse optical mice use image sensors to image naturally occurring texture in materials such as wood , cloth , mouse pads and formica these surfaces , when lit at a grazing angle by a light emitting diode , cast distinct shadows that resemble a hilly terrain lit at sunset optical mice mathematically process these images using cross correlation to calculate how much each successive image is offset from the previous one an optical mouse might use an image sensor having an 18 × 18 pixel array of monochromatic pixels by describing an optical means that explicitly overcame the limitations of wheels , balls , and rollers used in contemporary computer mice , the optical mouse was anticipated some small trackpads work like an optical mouse glass laser ( or glaser ) mice have the same capability of a laser mouse but work far better on mirror or transparent glass surfaces than other optical mice on those surfaces because optical mice render movement based on an image which the led ( or infrared diode ) lighting , use with multicolored mouse pads may result in unreliable performance ; however , laser mice do not suffer these problems and will track on such surfaces .

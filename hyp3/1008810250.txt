though not commonly referred to as optical mice , nearly all mechanical mice tracked movement using leds and photodiodes to detect when beams of infrared light did and did n't pass through holes in a pair of incremental rotary encoder wheels ( one for left/right , another for forward/back ) , driven by a rubberized ball thus , the primary distinction of “ optical mice ” is not their use of optics , but their complete lack of moving parts to track mouse movement , instead employing an entirely solid-state system predictive algorithms in the cpu of the mouse calculated the speed and direction over the grid lyon of xerox , used a 16-pixel visible-light image sensor with integrated motion detection on the same ntype ( 5µm ) mos integrated circuit chip , and tracked the motion of light dots in a dark field of a printed paper or similar mouse pad the kirsch and lyon mouse types had very different behaviors , as the kirsch mouse used an x-y coordinate system embedded in the pad , and would not work correctly when the pad was rotated , while the lyon mouse used the x-y coordinate system of the mouse body , as mechanical mice do the optical mouse ultimately sold with the xerox star office computer used an inverted sensor chip packaging approach patented by lisa m patent 4,751,505 optical mouse modern surface-independent optical mice work by using an optoelectronic sensor ( essentially , a tiny low-resolution video camera ) to take successive images of the surface on which the mouse operates a surface-independent coherent light optical mouse design was patented by stephen b the technology underlying the modern optical computer mouse is known as digital image correlation , a technology pioneered by the defense industry for tracking military targets a simple binary-image version of digital image correlation was used in the 1980 lyon optical mouse optical mice use image sensors to image naturally occurring texture in materials such as wood , cloth , mouse pads and formica to understand how optical flow is used in optical mice , imagine two photographs of the same object except slightly offset from each other optical mice mathematically process these images using cross correlation to calculate how much each successive image is offset from the previous one an optical mouse might use an image sensor having an 18 × 18 pixel array of monochromatic pixels manufacturers often engineer their optical mice—especially battery-powered wireless models—to save power when possible mechanical mice had lower average power requirements than their optical counterparts ; the power used by mice is relatively small , and only an important consideration when the power is derived from batteries , with their limited capacity because optical mice render movement based on an image which the led ( or infrared diode ) lighting , use with multicolored mouse pads may result in unreliable performance ; however , laser mice do not suffer these problems and will track on such surfaces .

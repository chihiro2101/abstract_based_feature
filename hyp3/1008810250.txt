thus , the primary distinction of “ optical mice ” is not their use of optics , but their complete lack of moving parts to track mouse movement , instead employing an entirely solid-state system lyon of xerox , used a 16-pixel visible-light image sensor with integrated motion detection on the same ntype ( 5µm ) mos integrated circuit chip , and tracked the motion of light dots in a dark field of a printed paper or similar mouse pad the kirsch and lyon mouse types had very different behaviors , as the kirsch mouse used an x-y coordinate system embedded in the pad , and would not work correctly when the pad was rotated , while the lyon mouse used the x-y coordinate system of the mouse body , as mechanical mice do the optical mouse ultimately sold with the xerox star office computer used an inverted sensor chip packaging approach patented by lisa m patent 4,751,505 optical mouse modern surface-independent optical mice work by using an optoelectronic sensor ( essentially , a tiny low-resolution video camera ) to take successive images of the surface on which the mouse operates the first commercially available , modern optical computer mice were the microsoft intellimouse with intellieye and intellimouse explorer , introduced in 1999 using technology developed by hewlett-packard other manufacturers soon followed microsoft 's lead using components manufactured by the hp spin-off agilent technologies , and over the next several years mechanical mice became obsolete a simple binary-image version of digital image correlation was used in the 1980 lyon optical mouse to understand how optical flow is used in optical mice , imagine two photographs of the same object except slightly offset from each other the amount that the edges of one photograph overhang the other represents the offset between the images , and in the case of an optical computer mouse the distance it has moved optical mice capture one thousand successive images or more per second optical mice mathematically process these images using cross correlation to calculate how much each successive image is offset from the previous one an optical mouse might use an image sensor having an 18 × 18 pixel array of monochromatic pixels tullis , where surface feature image sensing , image processing , and image correlation was realized by an integrated circuit to produce a position measurement this mouse uses a small infrared laser ( vcsel ) instead of an led and has significantly increased the resolution of the image taken by the mouse some mice , such as the logitech v450 848 & nbsp ; nm laser mouse , are capable of functioning on two aa batteries for a full year , due to the low power requirements of the infrared laser because optical mice render movement based on an image which the led ( or infrared diode ) lighting , use with multicolored mouse pads may result in unreliable performance ; however , laser mice do not suffer these problems and will track on such surfaces .

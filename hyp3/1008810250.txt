though not commonly referred to as optical mice , nearly all mechanical mice tracked movement using leds and photodiodes to detect when beams of infrared light did and did n't pass through holes in a pair of incremental rotary encoder wheels ( one for left/right , another for forward/back ) , driven by a rubberized ball thus , the primary distinction of “ optical mice ” is not their use of optics , but their complete lack of moving parts to track mouse movement , instead employing an entirely solid-state system the first two optical mice , first demonstrated by two independent inventors in december 1980 , had different basic designs : one of these , invented by steve kirsch of mit and mouse systems corporation , used an infrared led and a four-quadrant infrared sensor to detect grid lines printed with infrared absorbing ink on a special metallic surface predictive algorithms in the cpu of the mouse calculated the speed and direction over the grid lyon of xerox , used a 16-pixel visible-light image sensor with integrated motion detection on the same ntype ( 5µm ) mos integrated circuit chip , and tracked the motion of light dots in a dark field of a printed paper or similar mouse pad the kirsch and lyon mouse types had very different behaviors , as the kirsch mouse used an x-y coordinate system embedded in the pad , and would not work correctly when the pad was rotated , while the lyon mouse used the x-y coordinate system of the mouse body , as mechanical mice do the optical mouse ultimately sold with the xerox star office computer used an inverted sensor chip packaging approach patented by lisa m this advance enabled the mouse to detect relative motion on a wide variety of surfaces , translating the movement of the mouse into the movement of the cursor and eliminating the need for a special mouse-pad a surface-independent coherent light optical mouse design was patented by stephen b the first commercially available , modern optical computer mice were the microsoft intellimouse with intellieye and intellimouse explorer , introduced in 1999 using technology developed by hewlett-packard the technology underlying the modern optical computer mouse is known as digital image correlation , a technology pioneered by the defense industry for tracking military targets a simple binary-image version of digital image correlation was used in the 1980 lyon optical mouse optical mice use image sensors to image naturally occurring texture in materials such as wood , cloth , mouse pads and formica to understand how optical flow is used in optical mice , imagine two photographs of the same object except slightly offset from each other optical mice capture one thousand successive images or more per second depending on how fast the mouse is moving , each image will be offset from the previous one by a fraction of a pixel or as many as several pixels glass laser ( or glaser ) mice have the same capability of a laser mouse but work far better on mirror or transparent glass surfaces than other optical mice on those surfaces mechanical mice had lower average power requirements than their optical counterparts ; the power used by mice is relatively small , and only an important consideration when the power is derived from batteries , with their limited capacity

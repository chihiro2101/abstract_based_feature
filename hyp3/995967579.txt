the london county council had for many years wanted to connect its '' north side '' and '' south side '' tramway networks in order to be able to send '' north side '' trams for overhaul to the central repair depot at charlton in south east london in 1902 , it decided to build a subway from theobalds road in the north to the embankment underneath waterloo bridge to the south , from where a surface line would continue over the bridge legal problems delayed permission to build the subway and tram route and it was not until 1906 that permission to build was granted , and then not to cross the bridge because of a sewer at the northern end and the district line to the south it was decided to build the subway for single-deck trams only after leaving the subway at the south end , trams turned right along the embankment to westminster bridge or left on a service from bloomsbury to the hop exchange south from here the subway was built with a steel roof to aldwych tramway station and , because it was not initially planned to run a public service south of here , the tracks leading towards the strand were used as a depot with appropriate equipment and inspection pits in the parliamentary session of 1905 , plans were submitted for an additional station at the south end of the tunnel , under wellington street a new sharp curve was built under lancaster place to enable an exit through the western side wall of waterloo bridge and a triangular junction with the through line was constructed drivers of the trams recorded difficulty in climbing the ramp north from holborn tramway station and would sometimes roll all the way back to the station service patterns continued to change , especially with the opening of tram lines over blackfriars bridge on 14 september 1909 , and during the 1920s it was realised that to remain profitable the subway needed to be able to take double-deck trams in 1937 , the rebuilding of waterloo bridge required the diversion of the side entrance to the tramway to a new position centrally underneath the bridge , which opened on 21 november of that year in june 1958 , the london county council proposed making use of the subway for light traffic from waterloo bridge in order to reduce traffic congestion at its junction with strand and , in april 1962 , the go-ahead was given for part of the southern end of the subway to be used in 2012 , it was announced that crossrail 's tunnel contractor bam nuttall/ferrovial/kier ( bfk ) would form a grout shaft beneath the original tunnel of the old central london subway

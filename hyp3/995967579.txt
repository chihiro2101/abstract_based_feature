the london county council had for many years wanted to connect its '' north side '' and '' south side '' tramway networks in order to be able to send '' north side '' trams for overhaul to the central repair depot at charlton in south east london in 1902 , it decided to build a subway from theobalds road in the north to the embankment underneath waterloo bridge to the south , from where a surface line would continue over the bridge because of a sewer at the northern end and the district line to the south it was decided to build the subway for single-deck trams only after leaving the subway at the south end , trams turned right along the embankment to westminster bridge or left on a service from bloomsbury to the hop exchange the tracks passed through cast iron tubes underneath the fleet river before rising slightly to enter holborn tramway station south from here the subway was built with a steel roof to aldwych tramway station and , because it was not initially planned to run a public service south of here , the tracks leading towards the strand were used as a depot with appropriate equipment and inspection pits the opening of the new tramway along the embankment meant it was decided to link up with this route instead and the station was never built a new sharp curve was built under lancaster place to enable an exit through the western side wall of waterloo bridge and a triangular junction with the through line was constructed drivers of the trams recorded difficulty in climbing the ramp north from holborn tramway station and would sometimes roll all the way back to the station the replacement programme proceeded swiftly until 1940 , when the last of the pre-war series of conversions occurred , leaving only the south london trams and the subway routes 31 , 33 and 35 , the only north london tram routes to survive the war in 1937 , the rebuilding of waterloo bridge required the diversion of the side entrance to the tramway to a new position centrally underneath the bridge , which opened on 21 november of that year although following the same route along kingsway , it was not envisaged that the proposed cross river tram would use the subway in 2012 , it was announced that crossrail 's tunnel contractor bam nuttall/ferrovial/kier ( bfk ) would form a grout shaft beneath the original tunnel of the old central london subway

the london county council had for many years wanted to connect its '' north side '' and '' south side '' tramway networks in order to be able to send '' north side '' trams for overhaul to the central repair depot at charlton in south east london in 1902 , it decided to build a subway from theobalds road in the north to the embankment underneath waterloo bridge to the south , from where a surface line would continue over the bridge legal problems delayed permission to build the subway and tram route and it was not until 1906 that permission to build was granted , and then not to cross the bridge because of a sewer at the northern end and the district line to the south it was decided to build the subway for single-deck trams only the opening of the new tramway along the embankment meant it was decided to link up with this route instead and the station was never built a new sharp curve was built under lancaster place to enable an exit through the western side wall of waterloo bridge and a triangular junction with the through line was constructed more london tramway abandonments railway gazette 4 april 1952 page 391 through services commenced on 10 april 1908 from highbury station to tower bridge and to kennington , with a procession of six cars going south from the holborn through to kennington , then to elephant & castle in order to return through the subway to angel drivers of the trams recorded difficulty in climbing the ramp north from holborn tramway station and would sometimes roll all the way back to the station the replacement programme proceeded swiftly until 1940 , when the last of the pre-war series of conversions occurred , leaving only the south london trams and the subway routes 31 , 33 and 35 , the only north london tram routes to survive the war 1379 , with exits on both sides with folding doors , was constructed for feasibility tests through the subway , but these were unsuccessful as trolleybuses would have had to run on battery power through the subway , headroom restrictions making it impossible to use overhead current collection in june 1958 , the london county council proposed making use of the subway for light traffic from waterloo bridge in order to reduce traffic congestion at its junction with strand and , in april 1962 , the go-ahead was given for part of the southern end of the subway to be used although following the same route along kingsway , it was not envisaged that the proposed cross river tram would use the subway in 2012 , it was announced that crossrail 's tunnel contractor bam nuttall/ferrovial/kier ( bfk ) would form a grout shaft beneath the original tunnel of the old central london subway

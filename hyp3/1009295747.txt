bladder cancer characteristically causes blood in the urine , which may be visible or detectable only by microscope blood in the urine is the most common symptom in bladder cancer , and is painless visible blood in the urine may be of only short duration , and a urine test may be required to confirm non-visible blood between 80 and 90 % of people with bladder cancer initially presented with visible blood other possible symptoms include dysuria , frequent urination , or feeling the need to urinate without being able to do so these signs and symptoms are not specific to bladder cancer , and may also be caused by non-cancerous conditions , including prostate infections , overactive bladder or cystitis some rare forms of bladder cancer like urachal cancer produce mucin , which is then excreted in the urine causing it to be thick there is an almost linear relationship between smoking duration ( in years ) , pack-year and bladder cancer risk risk of bladder cancer decreases by 30 % within 1–4 years and continues to decrease by 60 % at 25 years after smoking cessation however , former smokers will most likely always be at a higher risk of bladder cancer compared to people who have never smoked opium consumption increases the risk of bladder cancer by 3-fold and concurrent use of opium and smoking increases the risk of bladder cancer by 5 times compared to the general population infection with schistosoma haematobium ( bilharzia or schistosomiasis ) may cause bladder cancer , specially of the squamous cell type n-nitroso compounds have been implicated in the pathogenesis of schistosomiasis related bladder cancer other causes of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder include chronic catheterizations in people with a spinal cord injury and history of treatment with cyclophosphamide people who undergo external beam radiotherapy ( ebrt ) for prostate cancer have a higher risk of developing invasive bladder cancer in addition to these major risk factors there are also numerous other modifiable factors that are less strongly ( i.e 10–20 % risk increase ) associated with bladder cancer , for example , obesity deletions of parts or whole of chromosome 9 is common in bladder cancer deletion of both copies of the gstm1 gene has a modest increase in risk of bladder cancer similarly , mutations in nat2 ( n-acetyltransferase ) is associated with increased risk for bladder cancer however , visual detection in any form listed above , is not sufficient for establishing pathological classification , cell type or the stage of the present tumor bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer accounting for 3.7 % of the new cancer cases it is the 5th most common cancer and 9th most common cause of cancer deaths bladder cancer is the ninth most common cancer in the uk accounting for 2.7 % of all the new cancers cases

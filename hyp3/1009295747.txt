bladder cancer characteristically causes blood in the urine , which may be visible or detectable only by microscope blood in the urine is the most common symptom in bladder cancer , and is painless visible blood in the urine may be of only short duration , and a urine test may be required to confirm non-visible blood between 80 and 90 % of people with bladder cancer initially presented with visible blood other possible symptoms include dysuria , frequent urination , or feeling the need to urinate without being able to do so some rare forms of bladder cancer like urachal cancer produce mucin , which is then excreted in the urine causing it to be thick there is an almost linear relationship between smoking duration ( in years ) , pack-year and bladder cancer risk smoking ( cigar , pipe , egyptian waterpipe and smokeless tobacco ) in any form increases the risk for bladder cancer risk of bladder cancer decreases by 30 % within 1–4 years and continues to decrease by 60 % at 25 years after smoking cessation however , former smokers will most likely always be at a higher risk of bladder cancer compared to people who have never smoked opium consumption increases the risk of bladder cancer by 3-fold and concurrent use of opium and smoking increases the risk of bladder cancer by 5 times compared to the general population infection with schistosoma haematobium ( bilharzia or schistosomiasis ) may cause bladder cancer , specially of the squamous cell type schistosoma eggs induces a chronic inflammatory state in the bladder wall resulting in tissue fibrosis n-nitroso compounds have been implicated in the pathogenesis of schistosomiasis related bladder cancer 10–20 % risk increase ) associated with bladder cancer , for example , obesity although these could be considered as minor effects , risk reduction in the general population could still be achieved by reducing the prevalence of a number of smaller risk factor together similarly , mutations in nat2 ( n-acetyltransferase ) is associated with increased risk for bladder cancer various single-nucleotide polymorphisms in psca gene present on chromosome 8 have shown to increase the risk for bladder cancer cytology is not very sensitive for low-grade or grade 1 tumors ( a negative result can not reliably exclude bladder cancer ) but has a high specificity ( a positive result reliably detects bladder cancer ) globally , in 2017 , bladder cancer resulted in 196,000 deaths , a 5.4 % ( age adjusted ) decrease from 2007 in 2018 , 30,700 canadians were living with bladder cancer , 9160 new cases were diagnosed and 2467 died from it it is the 5th most common cancer and 9th most common cause of cancer deaths bladder cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer in men and the 12th most common cancer in women between 2012 and 2016 annual rate of new bladder cancer cases decreased by one percent per year .

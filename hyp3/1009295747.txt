bladder cancer characteristically causes blood in the urine , which may be visible or detectable only by microscope blood in the urine is the most common symptom in bladder cancer , and is painless visible blood in the urine may be of only short duration , and a urine test may be required to confirm non-visible blood between 80 and 90 % of people with bladder cancer initially presented with visible blood these signs and symptoms are not specific to bladder cancer , and may also be caused by non-cancerous conditions , including prostate infections , overactive bladder or cystitis some rare forms of bladder cancer like urachal cancer produce mucin , which is then excreted in the urine causing it to be thick people with advanced disease may have pelvic or bony pain , lower-extremity edema , or flank pain there is an almost linear relationship between smoking duration ( in years ) , pack-year and bladder cancer risk smoking ( cigar , pipe , egyptian waterpipe and smokeless tobacco ) in any form increases the risk for bladder cancer risk of bladder cancer decreases by 30 % within 1â€“4 years and continues to decrease by 60 % at 25 years after smoking cessation however , former smokers will most likely always be at a higher risk of bladder cancer compared to people who have never smoked opium consumption increases the risk of bladder cancer by 3-fold and concurrent use of opium and smoking increases the risk of bladder cancer by 5 times compared to the general population thirty percent of bladder tumors probably result from occupational exposure in the workplace to carcinogens infection with schistosoma haematobium ( bilharzia or schistosomiasis ) may cause bladder cancer , specially of the squamous cell type people who undergo external beam radiotherapy ( ebrt ) for prostate cancer have a higher risk of developing invasive bladder cancer deletions of parts or whole of chromosome 9 is common in bladder cancer similarly , mutations in nat2 ( n-acetyltransferase ) is associated with increased risk for bladder cancer various single-nucleotide polymorphisms in psca gene present on chromosome 8 have shown to increase the risk for bladder cancer the flexible procedure allows for a visual inspection of the bladder , for minor remedial work to be undertaken and for samples of suspicious lesions to be taken for a biopsy other non-invasive urine based tests include the certndx bladder cancer assay , which detects fgfr3 mutation and urine bladder cancer test ( ubc ) , which is a sandwich elisa for cytokeratin 8/18 fragment this hypothesis is also supported by the fact that men undergoing androgen suppression therapy for unrelated reason seem to have a lower risk of developing bladder cancer bladder cancer is the 14th most common cancer and 16th most common cause of cancer death bladder cancer is the ninth most common cancer in the uk accounting for 2.7 % of all the new cancers cases between 2012 and 2016 annual rate of new bladder cancer cases decreased by one percent per year .

since the calculus is a query language for relational databases we first have to define a relational database the basic relational building block is the domain ( somewhat similar , but not equal to , a data type ) a table is an accepted visual representation of a relation ; a tuple is similar to the concept of a row ( note that this is a simplification from the full relational model where there is more than one domain and a header is not just a set of column names but also maps these column names to a domain the subset of c for which a tuple t is defined is called the domain of t ( not to be confused with the domain in the schema ) and denoted as dom ( t )

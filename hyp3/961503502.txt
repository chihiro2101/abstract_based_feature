since the calculus is a query language for relational databases we first have to define a relational database the basic relational building block is the domain ( somewhat similar , but not equal to , a data type ) although these relational concepts are mathematically defined , those definitions map loosely to traditional database concepts ) given a domain d we define a tuple over d as a partial function that maps some column names to an atomic value in d the formulas are defined given a database schema s ( d , r , h ) and a partial function type : v â‡¸ 2 c , called at type assignment , that assigns headers to some tuple variables

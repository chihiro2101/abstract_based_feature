deliberative democracy holds that , for a democratic decision to be legitimate , it must be preceded by authentic deliberation , not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting authentic deliberation is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power , such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups “ a blueprint for democratic law-making : give citizen juries the final say the roots of deliberative democracy can be traced back to aristotle and his notion of politics ; however , the german philosopher jürgen habermas ' work on communicative rationality and the public sphere is often identified as a major work in this area ( 2014 ) 'deliberative democracy ' , in : d thousand oaks , ca : sage publications , pp.214-216 deliberative democracy can be practiced by decision-makers in both representative democracy and direct democracy in elitist deliberative democracy , principles of deliberative democracy apply to elite societal decision-making bodies , such as legislatures and courts ; in populist deliberative democracy , principles of deliberative democracy apply to groups of lay citizens who are empowered to make decisions one purpose of populist deliberative democracy can be to use deliberation among a group of lay citizens to distill a more authentic public opinion about societal issues but not directly create binding law ; devices such as the deliberative opinion poll have been designed to achieve this goal another purpose of populist deliberative democracy can be to serve as a form of direct democracy , where deliberation among a group of lay citizens forms a '' public will '' and directly creates binding law if political decisions are made by deliberation but not by the people themselves or their elected representatives , then there is no democratic element ; this deliberative process is called elite deliberation joshua cohen , a student of john rawls , outlined conditions that he thinks constitute the root principles of the theory of deliberative democracy , in the article '' deliberation and democratic legitimacy '' in the 1989 book the good polity he outlines five main features of deliberative democracy , which include : an ongoing independent association with expected continuation the citizens consider deliberative procedure as the source of legitimacy , and prefer the causal history of legitimation for each law to be transparent and easily traceable to the deliberative process the participants suppose that they can act on the decision made ; the deliberative process is a sufficient reason to comply with the decision reached parties to deliberation are required to state reasons for their proposals , and proposals are accepted or rejected based on the reasons given , as the content of the very deliberation taking place participants are equal in two ways : formal : anyone can put forth proposals , criticize , and support measures substantive : the participants are not limited or bound by certain distributions of power , resources , or pre-existing norms '' deliberation aims at a rationally motivated consensus : it aims to find reasons acceptable to all who are committed to such a system of decision-making when consensus or something near enough is not possible , majority rule is used why deliberative democracy ? pp they state that deliberative democracy has four requirements , which refer to the kind of reasons that citizens and their representatives are expected to give to one another : reciprocal deliberative democracy takes on the role of an '' epistemic democracy '' in this way , as it thus has an epistemic value : it allows participants to deduce what is morally correct studies by james fishkin and others have found that deliberative democracy tends to produce outcomes which are superior to those in other forms of democracy former diplomat carne ross writes that in 2011 that the debates arising from deliberative democracy are also much more civil , collaborative , and evidence-based than the debates in traditional town hall meetings or in internet forums for ross , the key reason for this is that in deliberative democracy citizens are empowered by knowledge that their debates will have a measurable impact on society james fishkin 's 1991 work , '' democracy and deliberation '' , introduced a way to apply the theory of deliberative democracy to real-world decision making , by way of what he calls the deliberative opinion poll in the deliberative opinion poll , a statistically representative sample of the nation or a community is gathered to discuss an issue in conditions that further deliberation athenian democracy was both deliberative and largely direct : some decisions were made by representatives but most were made by ″the people″ directly the green party of the united states refers to its particular proposals for grassroots democracy and electoral reform by this name most recently , scholarship has focused on the emergence of a ‘ systemic approach ’ to the study of deliberation ( 2003 ) '' patriotic , not deliberative , democracy '' critical review of international social and political philosophy 6 , no '' can direct democracy be made deliberative ?

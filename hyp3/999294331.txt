deliberative democracy holds that , for a democratic decision to be legitimate , it must be preceded by authentic deliberation , not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting authentic deliberation is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power , such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups ” social policy , summer , 1998 , pp 5-9 if the decision-makers can not reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal , then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule the roots of deliberative democracy can be traced back to aristotle and his notion of politics ; however , the german philosopher jürgen habermas ' work on communicative rationality and the public sphere is often identified as a major work in this area for a brief overview of the roots and different streams of deliberative democracy , see ercan , s.a ( 2014 ) 'deliberative democracy ' , in : d thousand oaks , ca : sage publications , pp.214-216 deliberative democracy can be practiced by decision-makers in both representative democracy and direct democracy elster offers a summary of the various common definitions that academics use for the term in elitist deliberative democracy , principles of deliberative democracy apply to elite societal decision-making bodies , such as legislatures and courts ; in populist deliberative democracy , principles of deliberative democracy apply to groups of lay citizens who are empowered to make decisions another purpose of populist deliberative democracy can be to serve as a form of direct democracy , where deliberation among a group of lay citizens forms a '' public will '' and directly creates binding law if political decisions are made by deliberation but not by the people themselves or their elected representatives , then there is no democratic element ; this deliberative process is called elite deliberation fishkin 's model of deliberation experimenting with a democratic ideal : deliberative polling and public opinion joshua cohen , a student of john rawls , outlined conditions that he thinks constitute the root principles of the theory of deliberative democracy , in the article '' deliberation and democratic legitimacy '' in the 1989 book the good polity the citizens in the democracy structure their institutions such that deliberation is the deciding factor in the creation of the institutions and the institutions allow deliberation to continue the citizens consider deliberative procedure as the source of legitimacy , and prefer the causal history of legitimation for each law to be transparent and easily traceable to the deliberative process cohen presents deliberative democracy as more than a theory of legitimacy , and forms a body of substantive rights around it based on achieving '' ideal deliberation '' : it is free in two ways : the participants consider themselves bound solely by the results and preconditions of the deliberation participants are equal in two ways : formal : anyone can put forth proposals , criticize , and support measures thompson 's definition captures the elements that are found in most conceptions of deliberative democracy they state that deliberative democracy has four requirements , which refer to the kind of reasons that citizens and their representatives are expected to give to one another : reciprocal deliberative ideals often include '' face-to-face discussion , the implementation of good public pol- icy , decisionmaking competence , and critical mass '' according to proponents such as james fearon , another strength of deliberative democratic models is that they tend , more than any other model , to generate ideal conditions of impartiality , rationality and knowledge of the relevant facts deliberative democracy takes on the role of an '' epistemic democracy '' in this way , as it thus has an epistemic value : it allows participants to deduce what is morally correct strokes in her critical essay pathologies of deliberation ( chapter 5 of elster 1998 ) concedes there that a majority of academics interested agree with this view james fishkin 's 1991 work , '' democracy and deliberation '' , introduced a way to apply the theory of deliberative democracy to real-world decision making , by way of what he calls the deliberative opinion poll the group is then polled , and the results of the poll and the actual deliberation can be used both as a recommending force and in certain circumstances , to replace a vote consensus-based decision making similar to deliberative democracy is characteristic of the hunter gather band society thought to predominate in pre-historical times in a sense , this revived version was deliberative from its beginnings ; for example , in 1774 edmund burke made a famous speech where he called great britain 's parliament a deliberative assembly since 1994 , hundreds of implementations of direct deliberative democracy have taken place throughout the world the green party of the united states refers to its particular proposals for grassroots democracy and electoral reform by this name bessette coined the term '' deliberative democracy '' in his 1980 work '' deliberative democracy : the majority principle in republican government '' , and went on to elaborate and defend the notion in '' the mild voice of reason '' ( 1994 ) ) deliberative democracy : essays on reason and politics ( bohman , j “ deliberative democratic theory and empirical political science , ” annual review of political science 11 : 497-520

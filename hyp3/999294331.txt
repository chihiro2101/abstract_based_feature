in populist deliberative democracy , principles of deliberative democracy apply to groups of lay citizens who are empowered to make decisions another purpose of populist deliberative democracy can be to serve as a form of direct democracy , where deliberation among a group of lay citizens forms a '' public will '' and directly creates binding law “ a blueprint for democratic law-making : give citizen juries the final say if political decisions are made by deliberation but not by the people themselves or their elected representatives , then there is no democratic element ;

deliberative democracy holds that , for a democratic decision to be legitimate , it must be preceded by authentic deliberation , not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting authentic deliberation is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power , such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups ” social policy , summer , 1998 , pp 5-9 if the decision-makers can not reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal , then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule the roots of deliberative democracy can be traced back to aristotle and his notion of politics ; however , the german philosopher jürgen habermas ' work on communicative rationality and the public sphere is often identified as a major work in this area for a brief overview of the roots and different streams of deliberative democracy , see ercan , s.a ( 2014 ) 'deliberative democracy ' , in : d thousand oaks , ca : sage publications , pp.214-216 deliberative democracy can be practiced by decision-makers in both representative democracy and direct democracy in elitist deliberative democracy , principles of deliberative democracy apply to elite societal decision-making bodies , such as legislatures and courts ; in populist deliberative democracy , principles of deliberative democracy apply to groups of lay citizens who are empowered to make decisions one purpose of populist deliberative democracy can be to use deliberation among a group of lay citizens to distill a more authentic public opinion about societal issues but not directly create binding law ; devices such as the deliberative opinion poll have been designed to achieve this goal another purpose of populist deliberative democracy can be to serve as a form of direct democracy , where deliberation among a group of lay citizens forms a '' public will '' and directly creates binding law if political decisions are made by deliberation but not by the people themselves or their elected representatives , then there is no democratic element ; this deliberative process is called elite deliberation according to fishkin , this process attempts to indirectly filter the mass public opinion because representatives are better equipped with the knowledge of the common good than ordinary citizens experimenting with a democratic ideal : deliberative polling and public opinion he outlines five main features of deliberative democracy , which include : an ongoing independent association with expected continuation the citizens in the democracy structure their institutions such that deliberation is the deciding factor in the creation of the institutions and the institutions allow deliberation to continue this can be construed as the idea that in the legislative process , we '' owe '' one another reasons for our proposals cohen presents deliberative democracy as more than a theory of legitimacy , and forms a body of substantive rights around it based on achieving '' ideal deliberation '' : it is free in two ways : the participants consider themselves bound solely by the results and preconditions of the deliberation the participants suppose that they can act on the decision made ; the deliberative process is a sufficient reason to comply with the decision reached parties to deliberation are required to state reasons for their proposals , and proposals are accepted or rejected based on the reasons given , as the content of the very deliberation taking place thompson 's definition captures the elements that are found in most conceptions of deliberative democracy the technology used to record dissent and document opinions opposed to the majority is also useful to notarize bets , predictions and claims deliberative democracy takes on the role of an '' epistemic democracy '' in this way , as it thus has an epistemic value : it allows participants to deduce what is morally correct strokes in her critical essay pathologies of deliberation ( chapter 5 of elster 1998 ) concedes there that a majority of academics interested agree with this view for ross , the key reason for this is that in deliberative democracy citizens are empowered by knowledge that their debates will have a measurable impact on society james fishkin 's 1991 work , '' democracy and deliberation '' , introduced a way to apply the theory of deliberative democracy to real-world decision making , by way of what he calls the deliberative opinion poll this criticism has been made since deliberative democracy first arose in ancient athens athenian democracy was both deliberative and largely direct : some decisions were made by representatives but most were made by ″the people″ directly when democracy was revived as a political system about 2000 years later , decisions were made by representatives rather than directly by the people in a sense , this revived version was deliberative from its beginnings ; for example , in 1774 edmund burke made a famous speech where he called great britain 's parliament a deliberative assembly according to professor john dryzek , early work on deliberative democracy was part of efforts to develop a theory of democratic legitimacy bessette , joseph ( 1980 ) '' deliberative democracy : the majority principle in republican government , '' in how democratic is the constitution ? , washington , d.c ( 2003 ) '' patriotic , not deliberative , democracy '' critical review of international social and political philosophy 6 , no '' can direct democracy be made deliberative ?

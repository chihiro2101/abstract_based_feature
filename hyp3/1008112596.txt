glass fiber is formed when thin strands of silica-based or other formulation glass are extruded into many fibers with small diameters suitable for textile processing the technique of heating and drawing glass into fine fibers has been known for millennia ; however , the use of these fibers for textile applications is more recent until this time , all glass fiber had been manufactured as staple ( that is , clusters of short lengths of fiber ) the modern method for producing glass wool is the invention of games slayter working at the owens-illinois glass company ( toledo , ohio ) he first applied for a patent for a new process to make glass wool in 1933 the first commercial production of glass fiber was in 1936 in 1938 owens-illinois glass company and corning glass works joined to form the owens-corning fiberglas corporation when the two companies joined to produce and promote glass fiber , they introduced continuous filament glass fibers the most common types of glass fiber used in fiberglass is e-glass , which is borosilicate glass with less than 1 % w/w alkali oxides , mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics pure silica ( silicon dioxide ) , when cooled as fused quartz into a glass with no true melting point , can be used as a glass fiber for fiberglass , but has the drawback that it must be worked at very high temperatures ordinary a-glass ( '' a '' for '' alkali-lime '' ) or soda lime glass , crushed and ready to be remelted , as so-called cullet glass , was the first type of glass used for fiberglass e-glass ( '' e '' because of initial electrical application ) , is alkali free , and was the first glass formulation used for continuous filament formation it now makes up most of the fiberglass production in the world , and also is the single largest consumer of boron minerals globally because glass has an amorphous structure , its properties are the same along the fiber and across the fiber 26–28 , '' glass fiber—its properties related to the filament fiber diameter '' the viscosity of the molten glass is very important for manufacturing success platinum is used because the glass melt has a natural affinity for wetting it it is heated slightly to keep the glass at the correct temperature for fiber formation while some sizes are processing aids , others make the fiber have an affinity for a certain resin , if the fiber is to be used in a composite although both glass fiber and asbestos are made from silica filaments , naima claims that asbestos is more dangerous because of its crystalline structure , which causes it to cleave into smaller , more dangerous pieces , citing the u.s glass-reinforced plastic ( grp ) is a composite material or fiber-reinforced plastic made of a plastic reinforced by fine glass fibers whereas the plastic resins are strong in compressive loading and relatively weak in tensile strength , the glass fibers are very strong in tension but tend not to resist compression recycled glass fiber contains up to 40 % recycled glass

glass fiber is formed when thin strands of silica-based or other formulation glass are extruded into many fibers with small diameters suitable for textile processing the technique of heating and drawing glass into fine fibers has been known for millennia ; however , the use of these fibers for textile applications is more recent until this time , all glass fiber had been manufactured as staple ( that is , clusters of short lengths of fiber ) the modern method for producing glass wool is the invention of games slayter working at the owens-illinois glass company ( toledo , ohio ) he first applied for a patent for a new process to make glass wool in 1933 the first commercial production of glass fiber was in 1936 in 1938 owens-illinois glass company and corning glass works joined to form the owens-corning fiberglas corporation when the two companies joined to produce and promote glass fiber , they introduced continuous filament glass fibers the most common types of glass fiber used in fiberglass is e-glass , which is borosilicate glass with less than 1 % w/w alkali oxides , mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics pure silica ( silicon dioxide ) , when cooled as fused quartz into a glass with no true melting point , can be used as a glass fiber for fiberglass , but has the drawback that it must be worked at very high temperatures s-glass ( '' s '' for '' strength '' ) is used when high tensile strength ( modulus ) is important , and is thus important in composites for building and aircraft construction in contrast to carbon fiber , glass can undergo more elongation before it breaks during drawing , the process where the hot glass is pulled to reduce the diameter of the fiber , the viscosity must be relatively low however , if it is too low , the glass will form droplets instead of being drawn out into a fiber there are two main types of glass fiber manufacture and two main types of glass fiber product first , fiber is made either from a direct melt process or a marble remelt process the molten glass is extruded to the bushing to be formed into fiber this is a small metal furnace containing nozzles for the fiber to be formed through while some sizes are processing aids , others make the fiber have an affinity for a certain resin , if the fiber is to be used in a composite for staple fiber production , there are a number of ways to manufacture the fiber however , the safety of glass fiber is also being called into question , as research shows that the composition of this material ( asbestos and glass fiber are both silicate fibers ) can cause similar toxicity as asbestos the two materials may be used uniformly or the glass may be specifically placed in those portions of the structure that will experience tensile loads open-weave glass fiber grids are used to reinforce asphalt pavement

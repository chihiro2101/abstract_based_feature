glass fiber is formed when thin strands of silica-based or other formulation glass are extruded into many fibers with small diameters suitable for textile processing the technique of heating and drawing glass into fine fibers has been known for millennia ; however , the use of these fibers for textile applications is more recent until this time , all glass fiber had been manufactured as staple ( that is , clusters of short lengths of fiber ) the modern method for producing glass wool is the invention of games slayter working at the owens-illinois glass company ( toledo , ohio ) he first applied for a patent for a new process to make glass wool in 1933 the first commercial production of glass fiber was in 1936 in 1938 owens-illinois glass company and corning glass works joined to form the owens-corning fiberglas corporation when the two companies joined to produce and promote glass fiber , they introduced continuous filament glass fibers the most common types of glass fiber used in fiberglass is e-glass , which is borosilicate glass with less than 1 % w/w alkali oxides , mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics ordinary a-glass ( '' a '' for '' alkali-lime '' ) or soda lime glass , crushed and ready to be remelted , as so-called cullet glass , was the first type of glass used for fiberglass the strength of glass is usually tested and reported for '' virgin '' or pristine fibers—those that have just been manufactured the freshest , thinnest fibers are the strongest because the thinner fibers are more ductile moisture is easily adsorbed and can worsen microscopic cracks and surface defects , and lessen tenacity in contrast to carbon fiber , glass can undergo more elongation before it breaks 26–28 , '' glass fiber—its properties related to the filament fiber diameter '' however , if it is too low , the glass will form droplets instead of being drawn out into a fiber there are two main types of glass fiber manufacture and two main types of glass fiber product the marbles are taken to the fiber manufacturing facility where they are inserted into a can and remelted the molten glass is extruded to the bushing to be formed into fiber platinum is used because the glass melt has a natural affinity for wetting it however , the safety of glass fiber is also being called into question , as research shows that the composition of this material ( asbestos and glass fiber are both silicate fibers ) can cause similar toxicity as asbestos 1970s studies on rats found that fibrous glass of less than 3 μm in diameter and greater than 20 μm in length is a '' potent carcinogen '' recycled glass fiber contains up to 40 % recycled glass

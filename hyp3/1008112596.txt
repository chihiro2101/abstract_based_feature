glass fiber is formed when thin strands of silica-based or other formulation glass are extruded into many fibers with small diameters suitable for textile processing the technique of heating and drawing glass into fine fibers has been known for millennia ; however , the use of these fibers for textile applications is more recent until this time , all glass fiber had been manufactured as staple ( that is , clusters of short lengths of fiber ) the modern method for producing glass wool is the invention of games slayter working at the owens-illinois glass company ( toledo , ohio ) he first applied for a patent for a new process to make glass wool in 1933 the first commercial production of glass fiber was in 1936 in 1938 owens-illinois glass company and corning glass works joined to form the owens-corning fiberglas corporation when the two companies joined to produce and promote glass fiber , they introduced continuous filament glass fibers the most common types of glass fiber used in fiberglass is e-glass , which is borosilicate glass with less than 1 % w/w alkali oxides , mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics ordinary a-glass ( '' a '' for '' alkali-lime '' ) or soda lime glass , crushed and ready to be remelted , as so-called cullet glass , was the first type of glass used for fiberglass it is susceptible to chloride ion attack and is a poor choice for marine applications the strength of glass is usually tested and reported for '' virgin '' or pristine fibers—those that have just been manufactured because glass has an amorphous structure , its properties are the same along the fiber and across the fiber 26–28 , '' glass fiber—its properties related to the filament fiber diameter '' there are two main types of glass fiber manufacture and two main types of glass fiber product the molten glass is extruded to the bushing to be formed into fiber platinum is used because the glass melt has a natural affinity for wetting it when bushings were first used they were 100 % platinum , and the glass wetted the bushing so easily that it ran under the plate after exiting the nozzle and accumulated on the underside in the direct melt process , the bushing serves as a collector for the molten glass for staple fiber production , there are a number of ways to manufacture the fiber glass fiber has increased in popularity since the discovery that asbestos causes cancer and its subsequent removal from most products glass-reinforced plastic ( grp ) is a composite material or fiber-reinforced plastic made of a plastic reinforced by fine glass fibers recycled glass fiber contains up to 40 % recycled glass

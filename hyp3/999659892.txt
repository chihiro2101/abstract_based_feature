most greek uncial manuscripts were recopied in this period and their parchment leaves typically scraped clean for re-use consequently , surviving greek new testament manuscripts from before the ninth century are relatively rare , but nine ( over half of the total that survive ) witness a more-or-less pure alexandrian text these include the oldest near-complete manuscripts of the new testament : codex vaticanus graecus 1209 and codex sinaiticus ( believed to date from the early fourth century ) a number of substantial papyrus manuscripts of portions of the new testament survive from earlier still , and those that can be ascribed a text-type , such as and from the second to the third century , also tend to witness to the alexandrian text the earliest coptic versions of the bible ( into a sahidic variety of the late second century ) use the alexandrian text as a greek base ; although other second and third century translations ( into latin and syriac ) tend rather to conform to the western text-type around 17 such manuscripts have been discovered so far and so the alexandrian text-type is witnessed by around 30 surviving manuscripts , by no means all of which are associated with egypt although in that area , alexandrian witnesses are the most prevalent uncials : codex coislinianus , porphyrianus ( except acts , rev ) , dublinensis , sangallensis ( only in mark ) , zacynthius , athous lavrensis ( in mark and cath according to the present critics codices and b are the best alexandrian witnesses , which present the pure alexandrian text ehrman , the text of the new testament : its transmission , corruption and restoration , oxford university press , 2005 , p some of the manuscripts representing the alexandrian text-type have the byzantine corrections made by later hands ( papyrus 66 , codex sinaiticus , codex ephraemi , codex regius , and codex sangallensis ) when compared to witnesses of the byzantine text type , alexandrian manuscripts tend : to have a larger number of abrupt readings , such as the shorter ending of the gospel of mark , which finishes in the alexandrian text at mark 16:8 ( '' omission is supported by the manuscripts : sinaiticus , b , l , f 1 , 700 , vg , syr s , cop sa , bo , arm , geo also , there are a number of readings where the byzantine text displays variation between synoptic passages , that is not found in either the western or alexandrian texts , as in the rendering into greek of the aramaic last words of jesus , which are reported in the byzantine text as '' eloi , eloi the argument for the authoritative nature of the latter is that the much greater number of byzantine manuscripts copied in later centuries , in detriment to the alexandrian manuscripts , indicates a superior understanding by scribes of those being closer to the autographs starting with karl lachmann ( 1850 ) , manuscripts of the alexandrian text-type have been the most influential in modern , critical editions of the greek new testament , achieving widespread acceptance in the text of westcott & hort ( 1881 ) , and culminating in the united bible society 4th edition and nestle-aland 27th edition of the new testament after discovering the manuscripts and the neutral text and alexandrian text were unified

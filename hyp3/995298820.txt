individual rolls of 135 film are enclosed in single-spool , light-tight , metal cassettes to allow cameras to be loaded in daylight it has the same dimensions and perforation pitch as 35 mm movie film ( also called '' long pitch '' , ks-1870 , whereas 35 & nbsp ; mm professional motion picture camera films are always '' short pitch '' , bh-1866 ) most cameras require the film to be rewound before the camera is opened some motorized cameras unwind the film fully upon loading and then expose the images in reverse order , returning the film to the cassette ; this protects all images except the last one or two , should the camera back be accidentally opened 135 film has been made in several emulsion types and sensitivities ( film speeds ) , standardised by iso since the introduction of digital cameras the most usual films have colour emulsions of iso 100/21° to iso 800/30° the term 135 format usually refers to a 36 & times ; 24 & nbsp ; mm film format , commonly known as 35 & nbsp ; mm format the 36 & times ; 24 & nbsp ; mm format is common to digital image sensors , where it is typically referred to as full frame format other image formats have been applied to 135 film , such as the half-frame format of 18 & times ; 24 & nbsp ; mm which earned some popularity in the 1960s , and the 24 & times ; 24 & nbsp ; mm of the robot cameras the film is available in lengths for varying numbers of exposures the 135 film size is derived from earlier still cameras using lengths of 35 & nbsp ; mm cine film , the same size as , but with different perforations than , 135 film the 35 & nbsp ; mm film standard for motion picture film was established in thomas edison 's lab by william kennedy dickson the 70 & nbsp ; mm film was cut lengthwise into two equal width ( 35 & nbsp ; mm ) strips , spliced together end to end , and then perforated along both edges while the leica popularized the format , several 35 & nbsp ; mm still cameras used perforated movie film before the leica was introduced in the 1920s in 1909 , the french designed a device small-format photography , the '' '' , which used the 35 & nbsp ; mm perforated film to take consecutive hundred views in 18×24 & nbsp ; mm ) the first camera to take full-frame 24×36 & nbsp ; mm exposures seems to be the simplex , introduced in the u.s the leica camera designed by oskar barnack used 35 & nbsp ; mm film , and proved that a format as small as 24 & nbsp ; mm & times ; 36 & nbsp ; mm was suitable for professional photography this cassette was engineered so that it could be used in both leica and zeiss ikon contax cameras along with the camera for which it was invented , namely the kodak retina camera the designations 235 and 435 refer to 35 & nbsp ; mm film in daylight-loading spools , that could be loaded into leica or contax style reusable cassettes without need of a darkroom numerous other film formats waxed and waned in popularity , but by the 1970s , interchangeable-lens slr cameras and smaller rangefinders , from expensive leicas to '' point-and-shoot '' pocket cameras , were all using 35 & nbsp ; mm film , and manufacturers had proliferated digital slrs at a price ( and quality ) comparable with consumer-level 35 & nbsp ; mm slrs were developed , further reducing the demand for 135 film introductory 35 & nbsp ; mm slrs , compact film point-and-shoot cameras , and single-use cameras continue to be built and sold by a number of makers

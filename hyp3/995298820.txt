individual rolls of 135 film are enclosed in single-spool , light-tight , metal cassettes to allow cameras to be loaded in daylight it has the same dimensions and perforation pitch as 35 mm movie film ( also called '' long pitch '' , ks-1870 , whereas 35 & nbsp ; mm professional motion picture camera films are always '' short pitch '' , bh-1866 ) most cameras require the film to be rewound before the camera is opened some motorized cameras unwind the film fully upon loading and then expose the images in reverse order , returning the film to the cassette ; this protects all images except the last one or two , should the camera back be accidentally opened since the 1980s , film cassettes have been marked with a dx encoding 6-digit barcode pattern , which identifies the manufacturer and film type ( and thus processing method ) , and the number of exposures , for the use of photofinishing laboratories conforming cameras detect at least some of these areas ; only 3 contacts are needed to set a light meter for the 4 most popular film speeds 135 film has been made in several emulsion types and sensitivities ( film speeds ) , standardised by iso the term 135 format usually refers to a 36 & times ; 24 & nbsp ; mm film format , commonly known as 35 & nbsp ; mm format the 36 & times ; 24 & nbsp ; mm format is common to digital image sensors , where it is typically referred to as full frame format on 135 film , the longer dimension of the 36 & times ; 24 & nbsp ; mm frame runs parallel to the length of the film for each frame , the film advances 8 perforations other image formats have been applied to 135 film , such as the half-frame format of 18 & times ; 24 & nbsp ; mm which earned some popularity in the 1960s , and the 24 & times ; 24 & nbsp ; mm of the robot cameras unusual formats include the 24 & times ; 32 & nbsp ; mm and 24 & times ; 34 & nbsp ; mm on the early nikon rangefinders , and 24 & times ; 23 & nbsp ; mm for use with some stereo cameras in 1967 , the soviet kmz factory introduced a 24 & times ; 58 & nbsp ; mm panoramic format with its horizont camera ( descendants of which are called , in the roman alphabet , horizon ) the 135 film size is derived from earlier still cameras using lengths of 35 & nbsp ; mm cine film , the same size as , but with different perforations than , 135 film the 35 & nbsp ; mm film standard for motion picture film was established in thomas edison 's lab by william kennedy dickson the 70 & nbsp ; mm film was cut lengthwise into two equal width ( 35 & nbsp ; mm ) strips , spliced together end to end , and then perforated along both edges the original picture size was 18Ã—24 & nbsp ; mm ( half the full frame size later used in still photography ) while the leica popularized the format , several 35 & nbsp ; mm still cameras used perforated movie film before the leica was introduced in the 1920s in the earliest days , the photographer had to load the film into reusable cassettes and , at least for some cameras , cut the film leader since 35 & nbsp ; mm was preferred by both amateur and professional photographers , makers of film stock have long offered the widest range of different film speeds and types in the format a few digital slrs use '' full frame '' sensors , the same size as 135 film

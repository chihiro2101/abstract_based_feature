the amount of sewage sludge produced is proportional to the amount and concentration of wastewater treated , and it also depends on the type of wastewater treatment process used it can be expressed as kg dry solids per cubic metre of wastewater treated the total sludge production from a wastewater treatment process is the sum of sludge from primary settling tanks ( if they are part of the process configuration ) plus excess sludge from the biological treatment step for example , primary sedimentation produces about 110–170 & nbsp ; kg/ml of so-called primary sludge , with a value of 150 & nbsp ; kg/ml regarded as being typical for municipal wastewater in the u.s the sludge production is expressed as kg of dry solids produced per ml of wastewater treated ; one mega litre ( ml ) is 10 3 m 3 of the biological treatment processes , the activated sludge process produces about 70–100 & nbsp ; kg/ml of waste activated sludge , and a trickling filter process produces slightly less sludge from the biological part of the process : 60–100 & nbsp ; kg/ml this means that the total sludge production of an activated sludge process that uses primary sedimentation tanks is in the range of 180–270 & nbsp ; kg/ml , being the sum of primary sludge and waste activated sludge united states municipal wastewater treatment plants in 1997 produced about 7.7 million dry tons of sewage sludge , and about 6.8 million dry tons in 1998 according to epa estimates as of 2004 , about 60 % of all sewage sludge was applied to land as a soil amendment and fertilizer for growing crops comparative study of the methods used for treatment and final disposal of sewage sludge in european countries pathogens could easily remain undetected in untreated sewage sludge pathogens are not a significant health issue if sewage sludge is properly treated and site-specific management practices are followed several organic micro-pollutants such as endocrine disrupting compounds , pharmaceuticals and per-fluorinated compounds have been detected in sewage sludge samples around the world at concentrations ranging up to some hundreds mg/kg of dried sludge contribution of primary and secondary treatment on the removal of benzothiazoles , benzotriazoles , endocrine disruptors , pharmaceuticals and perfluorinated compounds in a sewage treatment plant in 2009 the epa released the targeted national sewage sludge study , which reports on the level of metals , chemicals , hormones , and other materials present in a statistical sample of sewage sludges silver is present to the degree of 20 & nbsp ; mg/kg of sludge , on average , while some sludges have up to 200 milligrams of silver per kilogram of sludge ; one outlier demonstrated a silver lode of 800–900 & nbsp ; mg per kg of sludge also in 2013 , after dhec request , the city of charlotte decided to stop land applying sewage sludge in south carolina while authorities investigated the source of pcb contamination contaminants of concern in sewage sludge are plasticizers , pdbes , and others generated by human activities , including personal care products and medicines synthetic fibers from fabrics persist in treated sewage sludge as well as in biosolids-treated soils and may thus serve as an indicator of past biosolids application the components of sludge have pollutant limits defined by the epa sewage sludge is produced from the wastewater treatment in sewage treatment plants and consists of two basic forms — raw primary sludge and secondary sludge , also known as activated sludge in the case of the activated sludge process kelessidis and stasinakis , 2012 following treatment , sewage sludge is either landfilled , dumped in the ocean , incinerated , applied on agricultural land or , in some cases , retailed or given away for free to the general public according to a review article published in 2012 , sludge reuse ( including direct agricultural application and composting ) was the predominant choice for sludge management in eu-15 ( 53 % of produced sludge ) , following by incineration ( 21 % of produced sludge ) . classes of sewage sludge after treatment ( united states ) in the united states , the following classes of sewage sludge after treatment are defined : class a sludge is typically dried and pasteurized , and is also known as '' exceptional '' quality it used to be common practice to dump sewage sludge into the ocean , however , this practice has stopped in many nations due to environmental concerns as well to domestic and international laws and treaties biosolids is a term widely used to denote the byproduct of domestic and commercial sewage treatment that is to be used in agriculture national regulations that dictate the practice of land application of treated sewage sludge differ widely and e.g depending on their level of treatment and resultant pollutant content , biosolids can be used in regulated applications for non-food agriculture , food agriculture , or distribution for unlimited use treated biosolids can be produced in cake , granular , pellet , or liquid form and are spread over land before being incorporated into the soil or injected directly into the soil by specialist contractors sludge can also be incinerated in sludge incineration plants which comes with its own set of environmental concerns ( air pollution , disposal of the ash ) have been correlated with exposure to class b untreated sludge and not class a treated sludge the ec encourages the use of sewage sludge in agriculture because it conserves organic matter and completes nutrient cycles this increase in the amount of sewage sludge accumulation in the eu can be due to the increase in the number of households that are connected to the sewage system the wider question is whether or not changes on the sea floor caused by the portion of sludge that settles are severe enough to justify the added operational cost and human health concerns of applying sludge to land

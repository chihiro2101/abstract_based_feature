the amount of sewage sludge produced is proportional to the amount and concentration of wastewater treated , and it also depends on the type of wastewater treatment process used the total sludge production from a wastewater treatment process is the sum of sludge from primary settling tanks ( if they are part of the process configuration ) plus excess sludge from the biological treatment step the sludge production is expressed as kg of dry solids produced per ml of wastewater treated ; one mega litre ( ml ) is 10 3 m 3 of the biological treatment processes , the activated sludge process produces about 70–100 & nbsp ; kg/ml of waste activated sludge , and a trickling filter process produces slightly less sludge from the biological part of the process : 60–100 & nbsp ; kg/ml this means that the total sludge production of an activated sludge process that uses primary sedimentation tanks is in the range of 180–270 & nbsp ; kg/ml , being the sum of primary sludge and waste activated sludge united states municipal wastewater treatment plants in 1997 produced about 7.7 million dry tons of sewage sludge , and about 6.8 million dry tons in 1998 according to epa estimates comparative study of the methods used for treatment and final disposal of sewage sludge in european countries kelessidis and stasinakis , 2012 production of sewage sludge can be reduced by conversion from flush toilets to dry toilets such as urine-diverting dry toilets and composting toilets pathogens are not a significant health issue if sewage sludge is properly treated and site-specific management practices are followed contribution of primary and secondary treatment on the removal of benzothiazoles , benzotriazoles , endocrine disruptors , pharmaceuticals and perfluorinated compounds in a sewage treatment plant in 2009 the epa released the targeted national sewage sludge study , which reports on the level of metals , chemicals , hormones , and other materials present in a statistical sample of sewage sludges there are potentially thousands other components of sludge that remain untested/undetected disposed of from modern society that also end up in sludge ( pharmaceuticals , nano particles , etc scdhec issued emergency regulatory order banning all pcb laden sewage sludge from being land applied on farm fields or deposited into landfills in south carolina also in 2013 , after dhec request , the city of charlotte decided to stop land applying sewage sludge in south carolina while authorities investigated the source of pcb contamination '' the maximum component pollutant limits by the us epa are : sewage sludge treatment is the process of removing contaminants from wastewater sewage sludge is produced from the wastewater treatment in sewage treatment plants and consists of two basic forms — raw primary sludge and secondary sludge , also known as activated sludge in the case of the activated sludge process sewage sludge is usually treated by one or several of the following treatment steps : lime stabilization , thickening , dewatering , drying , anaerobic digestion or composting regarding sludge stabilization processes , anaerobic and aerobic digestion seem to be the most common used methods in eu-27 comparative study of the methods used for treatment and final disposal of sewage sludge in european countries , waste management , vol . classes of sewage sludge after treatment ( united states ) in the united states , the following classes of sewage sludge after treatment are defined : class a sludge is typically dried and pasteurized , and is also known as '' exceptional '' quality after treatment , and dependent upon the quality of sludge produced ( for example with regards to heavy metal content ) , sewage sludge is most commonly either disposed of in landfills , dumped in the ocean or applied to land for its fertilizing properties , as pioneered by the product milorganite sewage sludge deposition in landfills can circulate human-virulent species of cryptosporidium and giardia pathogens national regulations that dictate the practice of land application of treated sewage sludge differ widely and e.g depending on their level of treatment and resultant pollutant content , biosolids can be used in regulated applications for non-food agriculture , food agriculture , or distribution for unlimited use use of sewage sludge has shown an increase in level of soil available phosphorus and soil salinity a phd thesis studying the addition of sludge to neutralize soil acidity concluded that the practice was not recommended if large amounts are used because the sludge produces acids when it oxidizes studies have indicated that pharmaceuticals and personal care products , which often adsorb to sludge during wastewater treatment , can persist in agricultural soils following biosolid application in 2014 the united states grocery chain whole foods banned produce grown in sewage sludge the nrc concluded that while there is no documented scientific evidence that sewage sludge regulations have failed to protect public health , there is persistent uncertainty on possible adverse health effects this increase in the amount of sewage sludge accumulation in the eu can be due to the increase in the number of households that are connected to the sewage system biosolids that meet the class b pathogen treatment and pollutant criteria , in accordance with the epa '' standards for the use or disposal of sewage sludge '' ( 40 cfr part 503 ) , can be land applied with formal site restrictions and strict record keeping since 1884 when sewage was first treated the amount of sludge has increased along with population and more advanced treatment technology ( secondary treatment in addition to primary treatment ) the us epa promulgated regulations – 40 cfr part 503 – that continued to allow the use of biosolids on land as fertilizers and soil amendments which had been previously allowed under part 257

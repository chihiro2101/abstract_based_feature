the amount of sewage sludge produced is proportional to the amount and concentration of wastewater treated , and it also depends on the type of wastewater treatment process used the total sludge production from a wastewater treatment process is the sum of sludge from primary settling tanks ( if they are part of the process configuration ) plus excess sludge from the biological treatment step for example , primary sedimentation produces about 110–170 & nbsp ; kg/ml of so-called primary sludge , with a value of 150 & nbsp ; kg/ml regarded as being typical for municipal wastewater in the u.s the sludge production is expressed as kg of dry solids produced per ml of wastewater treated ; one mega litre ( ml ) is 10 3 m 3 of the biological treatment processes , the activated sludge process produces about 70–100 & nbsp ; kg/ml of waste activated sludge , and a trickling filter process produces slightly less sludge from the biological part of the process : 60–100 & nbsp ; kg/ml this means that the total sludge production of an activated sludge process that uses primary sedimentation tanks is in the range of 180–270 & nbsp ; kg/ml , being the sum of primary sludge and waste activated sludge united states municipal wastewater treatment plants in 1997 produced about 7.7 million dry tons of sewage sludge , and about 6.8 million dry tons in 1998 according to epa estimates as of 2004 , about 60 % of all sewage sludge was applied to land as a soil amendment and fertilizer for growing crops comparative study of the methods used for treatment and final disposal of sewage sludge in european countries bacteria in class a sludge products can actually regrow under certain environmental conditions pathogens are not a significant health issue if sewage sludge is properly treated and site-specific management practices are followed several organic micro-pollutants such as endocrine disrupting compounds , pharmaceuticals and per-fluorinated compounds have been detected in sewage sludge samples around the world at concentrations ranging up to some hundreds mg/kg of dried sludge contribution of primary and secondary treatment on the removal of benzothiazoles , benzotriazoles , endocrine disruptors , pharmaceuticals and perfluorinated compounds in a sewage treatment plant one of the main concerns in the treated sludge is the concentrated metals content ( lead , arsenic , cadmium , thallium , etc low levels of constituents such as pcbs , dioxin , and brominated flame retardants , may remain in treated sludge there are potentially thousands other components of sludge that remain untested/undetected disposed of from modern society that also end up in sludge ( pharmaceuticals , nano particles , etc scdhec issued emergency regulatory order banning all pcb laden sewage sludge from being land applied on farm fields or deposited into landfills in south carolina also in 2013 , after dhec request , the city of charlotte decided to stop land applying sewage sludge in south carolina while authorities investigated the source of pcb contamination in february 2014 , the city of charlotte admitted pcbs have entered their sewage treatment centers as well sewage sludge treatment is the process of removing contaminants from wastewater sewage sludge is usually treated by one or several of the following treatment steps : lime stabilization , thickening , dewatering , drying , anaerobic digestion or composting regarding sludge stabilization processes , anaerobic and aerobic digestion seem to be the most common used methods in eu-27 comparative study of the methods used for treatment and final disposal of sewage sludge in european countries , waste management , vol kelessidis and stasinakis , 2012 following treatment , sewage sludge is either landfilled , dumped in the ocean , incinerated , applied on agricultural land or , in some cases , retailed or given away for free to the general public according to a review article published in 2012 , sludge reuse ( including direct agricultural application and composting ) was the predominant choice for sludge management in eu-15 ( 53 % of produced sludge ) , following by incineration ( 21 % of produced sludge ) . classes of sewage sludge after treatment ( united states ) in the united states , the following classes of sewage sludge after treatment are defined : class a sludge is typically dried and pasteurized , and is also known as '' exceptional '' quality ronald reagan signed the law that prohibited ocean dumping as a means of disposal of sewage sludge in 1988 biosolids is a term widely used to denote the byproduct of domestic and commercial sewage treatment that is to be used in agriculture national regulations that dictate the practice of land application of treated sewage sludge differ widely and e.g some of these chemicals , including potential endocrine disruptor triclosan , can also travel through the soil column and leach into agricultural tile drainage at detectable levels sludge can also be incinerated in sludge incineration plants which comes with its own set of environmental concerns ( air pollution , disposal of the ash ) european countries that joined the eu after 2004 favor landfills as a means of disposal for sewage sludge this increase in the amount of sewage sludge accumulation in the eu can be due to the increase in the number of households that are connected to the sewage system biosolids that meet the class b pathogen treatment and pollutant criteria , in accordance with the epa '' standards for the use or disposal of sewage sludge '' ( 40 cfr part 503 ) , can be land applied with formal site restrictions and strict record keeping

the amount of sewage sludge produced is proportional to the amount and concentration of wastewater treated , and it also depends on the type of wastewater treatment process used it can be expressed as kg dry solids per cubic metre of wastewater treated the total sludge production from a wastewater treatment process is the sum of sludge from primary settling tanks ( if they are part of the process configuration ) plus excess sludge from the biological treatment step for example , primary sedimentation produces about 110–170 & nbsp ; kg/ml of so-called primary sludge , with a value of 150 & nbsp ; kg/ml regarded as being typical for municipal wastewater in the u.s the sludge production is expressed as kg of dry solids produced per ml of wastewater treated ; one mega litre ( ml ) is 10 3 m 3 of the biological treatment processes , the activated sludge process produces about 70–100 & nbsp ; kg/ml of waste activated sludge , and a trickling filter process produces slightly less sludge from the biological part of the process : 60–100 & nbsp ; kg/ml this means that the total sludge production of an activated sludge process that uses primary sedimentation tanks is in the range of 180–270 & nbsp ; kg/ml , being the sum of primary sludge and waste activated sludge united states municipal wastewater treatment plants in 1997 produced about 7.7 million dry tons of sewage sludge , and about 6.8 million dry tons in 1998 according to epa estimates as of 2004 , about 60 % of all sewage sludge was applied to land as a soil amendment and fertilizer for growing crops comparative study of the methods used for treatment and final disposal of sewage sludge in european countries bacteria in class a sludge products can actually regrow under certain environmental conditions pathogens are not a significant health issue if sewage sludge is properly treated and site-specific management practices are followed they can become concentrated in sewage sludge several organic micro-pollutants such as endocrine disrupting compounds , pharmaceuticals and per-fluorinated compounds have been detected in sewage sludge samples around the world at concentrations ranging up to some hundreds mg/kg of dried sludge in 2009 the epa released the targeted national sewage sludge study , which reports on the level of metals , chemicals , hormones , and other materials present in a statistical sample of sewage sludges silver is present to the degree of 20 & nbsp ; mg/kg of sludge , on average , while some sludges have up to 200 milligrams of silver per kilogram of sludge ; one outlier demonstrated a silver lode of 800–900 & nbsp ; mg per kg of sludge barium is present at the rate of 500 & nbsp ; mg/kg , while manganese is present at the rate of 1 g/kg sludge in 2013 in south carolina pcbs were discovered in very high levels in wastewater sludge contaminants of concern in sewage sludge are plasticizers , pdbes , and others generated by human activities , including personal care products and medicines sewage sludge treatment is the process of removing contaminants from wastewater sewage sludge is produced from the wastewater treatment in sewage treatment plants and consists of two basic forms — raw primary sludge and secondary sludge , also known as activated sludge in the case of the activated sludge process regarding sludge stabilization processes , anaerobic and aerobic digestion seem to be the most common used methods in eu-27 comparative study of the methods used for treatment and final disposal of sewage sludge in european countries , waste management , vol kelessidis and stasinakis , 2012 following treatment , sewage sludge is either landfilled , dumped in the ocean , incinerated , applied on agricultural land or , in some cases , retailed or given away for free to the general public according to a review article published in 2012 , sludge reuse ( including direct agricultural application and composting ) was the predominant choice for sludge management in eu-15 ( 53 % of produced sludge ) , following by incineration ( 21 % of produced sludge ) . classes of sewage sludge after treatment ( united states ) after treatment , and dependent upon the quality of sludge produced ( for example with regards to heavy metal content ) , sewage sludge is most commonly either disposed of in landfills , dumped in the ocean or applied to land for its fertilizing properties , as pioneered by the product milorganite it used to be common practice to dump sewage sludge into the ocean , however , this practice has stopped in many nations due to environmental concerns as well to domestic and international laws and treaties biosolids is a term widely used to denote the byproduct of domestic and commercial sewage treatment that is to be used in agriculture depending on their level of treatment and resultant pollutant content , biosolids can be used in regulated applications for non-food agriculture , food agriculture , or distribution for unlimited use other studies report that plants uptake large quantities of heavy metals and toxic pollutants that are retained by produce , which is then consumed by humans treated sewage sludge has been used in the uk , europe and china agriculturally for more than 80 years , though there is increasing pressure in some countries to stop the practice of land application due to farm land contamination and public outrage the national research council published '' biosolids applied to land : advancing standards and practices '' in july 2002 the epa office of the inspector general ( oig ) completed two assessments in 2000 and 2002 of the epa sewage sludge program since 1884 when sewage was first treated the amount of sludge has increased along with population and more advanced treatment technology ( secondary treatment in addition to primary treatment )

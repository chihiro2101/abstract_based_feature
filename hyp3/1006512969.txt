the amount of sewage sludge produced is proportional to the amount and concentration of wastewater treated , and it also depends on the type of wastewater treatment process used it can be expressed as kg dry solids per cubic metre of wastewater treated the total sludge production from a wastewater treatment process is the sum of sludge from primary settling tanks ( if they are part of the process configuration ) plus excess sludge from the biological treatment step for example , primary sedimentation produces about 110–170 & nbsp ; kg/ml of so-called primary sludge , with a value of 150 & nbsp ; kg/ml regarded as being typical for municipal wastewater in the u.s the sludge production is expressed as kg of dry solids produced per ml of wastewater treated ; one mega litre ( ml ) is 10 3 m 3 of the biological treatment processes , the activated sludge process produces about 70–100 & nbsp ; kg/ml of waste activated sludge , and a trickling filter process produces slightly less sludge from the biological part of the process : 60–100 & nbsp ; kg/ml this means that the total sludge production of an activated sludge process that uses primary sedimentation tanks is in the range of 180–270 & nbsp ; kg/ml , being the sum of primary sludge and waste activated sludge united states municipal wastewater treatment plants in 1997 produced about 7.7 million dry tons of sewage sludge , and about 6.8 million dry tons in 1998 according to epa estimates as of 2004 , about 60 % of all sewage sludge was applied to land as a soil amendment and fertilizer for growing crops comparative study of the methods used for treatment and final disposal of sewage sludge in european countries pathogens could easily remain undetected in untreated sewage sludge they can become concentrated in sewage sludge several organic micro-pollutants such as endocrine disrupting compounds , pharmaceuticals and per-fluorinated compounds have been detected in sewage sludge samples around the world at concentrations ranging up to some hundreds mg/kg of dried sludge contribution of primary and secondary treatment on the removal of benzothiazoles , benzotriazoles , endocrine disruptors , pharmaceuticals and perfluorinated compounds in a sewage treatment plant silver is present to the degree of 20 & nbsp ; mg/kg of sludge , on average , while some sludges have up to 200 milligrams of silver per kilogram of sludge ; one outlier demonstrated a silver lode of 800–900 & nbsp ; mg per kg of sludge sewage treatment plants receive various forms of hazardous waste from hospitals , nursing homes , industry and households there are potentially thousands other components of sludge that remain untested/undetected disposed of from modern society that also end up in sludge ( pharmaceuticals , nano particles , etc also in 2013 , after dhec request , the city of charlotte decided to stop land applying sewage sludge in south carolina while authorities investigated the source of pcb contamination in february 2014 , the city of charlotte admitted pcbs have entered their sewage treatment centers as well sewage sludge treatment is the process of removing contaminants from wastewater sewage sludge is produced from the wastewater treatment in sewage treatment plants and consists of two basic forms — raw primary sludge and secondary sludge , also known as activated sludge in the case of the activated sludge process sewage sludge is usually treated by one or several of the following treatment steps : lime stabilization , thickening , dewatering , drying , anaerobic digestion or composting regarding sludge stabilization processes , anaerobic and aerobic digestion seem to be the most common used methods in eu-27 comparative study of the methods used for treatment and final disposal of sewage sludge in european countries , waste management , vol according to a review article published in 2012 , sludge reuse ( including direct agricultural application and composting ) was the predominant choice for sludge management in eu-15 ( 53 % of produced sludge ) , following by incineration ( 21 % of produced sludge ) in the united states , the following classes of sewage sludge after treatment are defined : class a sludge is typically dried and pasteurized , and is also known as '' exceptional '' quality after treatment , and dependent upon the quality of sludge produced ( for example with regards to heavy metal content ) , sewage sludge is most commonly either disposed of in landfills , dumped in the ocean or applied to land for its fertilizing properties , as pioneered by the product milorganite it used to be common practice to dump sewage sludge into the ocean , however , this practice has stopped in many nations due to environmental concerns as well to domestic and international laws and treaties biosolids is a term widely used to denote the byproduct of domestic and commercial sewage treatment that is to be used in agriculture national regulations that dictate the practice of land application of treated sewage sludge differ widely and e.g depending on their level of treatment and resultant pollutant content , biosolids can be used in regulated applications for non-food agriculture , food agriculture , or distribution for unlimited use studies have indicated that pharmaceuticals and personal care products , which often adsorb to sludge during wastewater treatment , can persist in agricultural soils following biosolid application residents living near class b sludge processing sites may experience asthma or pulmonary distress due to bioaerosols released from sludge fields in 2006 , the predicted sewage sludge growth rate was 10 million tons of sewage sludge per year since 1884 when sewage was first treated the amount of sludge has increased along with population and more advanced treatment technology ( secondary treatment in addition to primary treatment )

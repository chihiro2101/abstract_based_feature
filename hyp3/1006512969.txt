the amount of sewage sludge produced is proportional to the amount and concentration of wastewater treated , and it also depends on the type of wastewater treatment process used the total sludge production from a wastewater treatment process is the sum of sludge from primary settling tanks ( if they are part of the process configuration ) plus excess sludge from the biological treatment step for example , primary sedimentation produces about 110–170 & nbsp ; kg/ml of so-called primary sludge , with a value of 150 & nbsp ; kg/ml regarded as being typical for municipal wastewater in the u.s the sludge production is expressed as kg of dry solids produced per ml of wastewater treated ; one mega litre ( ml ) is 10 3 m 3 of the biological treatment processes , the activated sludge process produces about 70–100 & nbsp ; kg/ml of waste activated sludge , and a trickling filter process produces slightly less sludge from the biological part of the process : 60–100 & nbsp ; kg/ml this means that the total sludge production of an activated sludge process that uses primary sedimentation tanks is in the range of 180–270 & nbsp ; kg/ml , being the sum of primary sludge and waste activated sludge as of 2004 , about 60 % of all sewage sludge was applied to land as a soil amendment and fertilizer for growing crops comparative study of the methods used for treatment and final disposal of sewage sludge in european countries kelessidis and stasinakis , 2012 production of sewage sludge can be reduced by conversion from flush toilets to dry toilets such as urine-diverting dry toilets and composting toilets pathogens could easily remain undetected in untreated sewage sludge micro-pollutants are compounds which are normally found at concentrations up to microgram per liter and milligram per kilogram in the aquatic and terrestrial environment , respectively , and they are considered to be potential threats to environmental ecosystems they can become concentrated in sewage sludge each of these disposal options comes with myriad potential & nbsp ; — and in some cases proven & nbsp ; — human health and environment impacts several organic micro-pollutants such as endocrine disrupting compounds , pharmaceuticals and per-fluorinated compounds have been detected in sewage sludge samples around the world at concentrations ranging up to some hundreds mg/kg of dried sludge contribution of primary and secondary treatment on the removal of benzothiazoles , benzotriazoles , endocrine disruptors , pharmaceuticals and perfluorinated compounds in a sewage treatment plant silver is present to the degree of 20 & nbsp ; mg/kg of sludge , on average , while some sludges have up to 200 milligrams of silver per kilogram of sludge ; one outlier demonstrated a silver lode of 800–900 & nbsp ; mg per kg of sludge sewage treatment plants receive various forms of hazardous waste from hospitals , nursing homes , industry and households low levels of constituents such as pcbs , dioxin , and brominated flame retardants , may remain in treated sludge there are potentially thousands other components of sludge that remain untested/undetected disposed of from modern society that also end up in sludge ( pharmaceuticals , nano particles , etc also in 2013 , after dhec request , the city of charlotte decided to stop land applying sewage sludge in south carolina while authorities investigated the source of pcb contamination the term '' pollutant '' is defined as part of the epa 503 rule sewage sludge is produced from the wastewater treatment in sewage treatment plants and consists of two basic forms — raw primary sludge and secondary sludge , also known as activated sludge in the case of the activated sludge process sewage sludge is usually treated by one or several of the following treatment steps : lime stabilization , thickening , dewatering , drying , anaerobic digestion or composting . classes of sewage sludge after treatment ( united states ) in the united states , the following classes of sewage sludge after treatment are defined : class a sludge is typically dried and pasteurized , and is also known as '' exceptional '' quality both classes of sludge may still contain radioactive or pharmaceutical wastes sewage sludge deposition in landfills can circulate human-virulent species of cryptosporidium and giardia pathogens biosolids is a term widely used to denote the byproduct of domestic and commercial sewage treatment that is to be used in agriculture use of sewage sludge has shown an increase in level of soil available phosphorus and soil salinity studies have indicated that pharmaceuticals and personal care products , which often adsorb to sludge during wastewater treatment , can persist in agricultural soils following biosolid application a cautionary approach to land application of biosolids has been advocated by some for regions where soils have lower capacities for toxics absorption or due to the presence of unknowns in sewage biosolids use of sewage sludge is prohibited for produce to be labeled usda-certified organic in 2011 , the epa commissioned a study at the united states national research council ( nrc ) to determine the health risks of sludge the eu has directives in place to encourage the use of sewage sludge in agriculture , in a way that will not harm the soil , humans , and the environment are not harmed since 1884 when sewage was first treated the amount of sludge has increased along with population and more advanced treatment technology ( secondary treatment in addition to primary treatment )

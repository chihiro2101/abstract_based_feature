the house was then owned by thomas fitton , who had inherited it by marriage in 1316 , and it remained in the possession of the fitton family until 1611 the original house was replaced in the 15th and 16th & nbsp ; centuries it is considered by the architectural historians peter de & nbsp ; figueiredo and julian treuherz that the site of the house was originally moated , and that its plan was that of a quadrangle , forming a courtyard house in 1579 the house was inherited by sir edward fitton iii on the death of his father , sir edward fitton ii sir edward iii was the father of mary fitton , a maid of honour to queen elizabeth and a candidate for the '' dark lady '' of shakespeare 's sonnets following the death of sir & nbsp ; edward fitton , 2nd & nbsp ; baronet in 1643 , the estate passed to sir & nbsp ; charles gerard , later the first earl of macclesfield there was a dispute about the legal ownership of the estate between sir & nbsp ; charles and his cousin alexander fitton , which was resolved in sir charles 's favour in 1663 demolition of parts of the house took place in about 1700 , and it is thought by de & nbsp ; figueiredo and treuherz that the west range was removed , possibly including the gatehouse the estate remained with the gerards , until it was bought by william stanhope , who later became the first earl of harrington , and it remained with this family until 1935 the house was owned by the cheshire antiquary raymond richards until his death in 1978 richards collected items from historic buildings that were being demolished in the 1960s , either incorporating them into the house or displaying them in the grounds the house is still owned and run by the richards family gawsworth old hall is a timber-framed house in the cheshire black-and-white tradition , roofed in kerridge sandstone in the north range , and on the south front , the timber frame has been encased in brick , with timbering applied to its outer surface the entrance hall leads into the longest range , the eastern range , consisting of the long hall , at the north end , and the dining room the dining room leads into a room now known as the green room , which is canted ten degrees to the east this was also originally open to the roof , but was not a great hall de & nbsp ; figueiredo and treuherz are of the opinion that this was originally a larger , separate structure , probably a barn , and incorporated into the main building when the east range was built to the west of this is the drawing room , the principal living room of the hall , which has been little altered since the middle of the 16th & nbsp ; century the house 's principal bedroom is the hall room , much of which has survived from the early 16th & nbsp ; century there is some doubt regarding the dating of the creation of the garden , but it is generally accepted that it comprised an elizabethan pleasure garden immediately to the west is the grade & nbsp ; i listed church of st james , to the north beyond a fish pond is the grade & nbsp ; ii listed gawsworth new hall , and nearby is the grade & nbsp ; i listed gawsworth old rectory the old hall was listed grade & nbsp ; i on 25 & nbsp ; july 1952 grade i listed buildings in cheshire east listed buildings in gawsworth

an ecoregion , sometimes called a bioregion , is '' a relatively large area of land or water that contains a geographically distinct assemblage of natural communities '' ecoregions are an obvious and objective way to understand physical geography they also enable organization of ecology and climate data , including ranges of animals and plants this wikiproject will create articles on all the terrestrial , marine , and freshwater ecoregions on earth using a consistent naming scheme link to these ecoregion articles when you need to describe broad-scale ecology the project will allow users to navigate logically from the entire planet earth down into the ecozones and ecoregions , and their bordering rivers , seas , and oceans we now have articles for all of the wwf terrestrial ecoregions â€“ about 865 depending on definitions to see which ones they are , go to the project 's full checklist : a checklist of terrestrial ecoregions on en-wikipedia you can use the suggested references in the right hand column to get information for the articles for example , the 'aleutian islands tundra ' ecoregion covers the same islands as the aleutian islands article two things need to be checked on these ecoregions : ( a ) do the ecoregion and main article subject really refer to the same area ? if not , a separate ecoregion article may be warranted list of ecoregions ( wwf ) : terrestrial , marine , and freshwater ecoregions for the entire world you can see which countries have missing or incomplete ecoregion articles and create or expand them , or create a missing country list list of ecoregions in north america ( cec ) list of ecoregions in the united states ( epa ) similarly , it would be good to upgrade each of the biome articles to '' b '' status , as they are the base for a lot of common information when an article for a country , protected area , mountain range , water body , etc needs general information on its environment and ecology , link to the appropriate ecoregion ( s ) create missing articles for marine and freshwater ecoregions the wikimedia commons maps of ecoregions category contains hundreds of ecoregion maps that can be used in ecoregion articles wwf databases include terrestrial and marine ecoregions , as well as thousands of species distributions in terms of ecoregions add the template to the top of the talk page of any article which is in the scope of this project the origins of the flora , and the floral affiliations with and distinctions from with neighboring ecoregions a list of article references article assessments help project members prioritise improvements to articles related to ecoregions user : cleveland13 - interested in improving ecoregion articles for a college project wikiproject watchlist - wikiproject ecoregions

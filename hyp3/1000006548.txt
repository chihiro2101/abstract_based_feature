an ecoregion , sometimes called a bioregion , is '' a relatively large area of land or water that contains a geographically distinct assemblage of natural communities '' ecoregions are an obvious and objective way to understand physical geography they also enable organization of ecology and climate data , including ranges of animals and plants this wikiproject will create articles on all the terrestrial , marine , and freshwater ecoregions on earth using a consistent naming scheme link to these ecoregion articles when you need to describe broad-scale ecology this may be from articles on protected areas , mountains , rivers , lakes , and countries the project will allow users to navigate logically from the entire planet earth down into the ecozones and ecoregions , and their bordering rivers , seas , and oceans we now have articles for all of the wwf terrestrial ecoregions â€“ about 865 depending on definitions to see which ones they are , go to the project 's full checklist : a checklist of terrestrial ecoregions on en-wikipedia for example , the 'aleutian islands tundra ' ecoregion covers the same islands as the aleutian islands article so the ecoregion link is a redirect to the main article two things need to be checked on these ecoregions : ( a ) do the ecoregion and main article subject really refer to the same area ? if not , a separate ecoregion article may be warranted list of ecoregions ( wwf ) : terrestrial , marine , and freshwater ecoregions for the entire world lists of ecoregions by country you can see which countries have missing or incomplete ecoregion articles and create or expand them , or create a missing country list list of ecoregions in north america ( cec ) list of ecoregions in the united states ( epa ) create high-quality example articles currently there are no feature articles among the ecoregions the encyclopedia of earth contains articles for many ecoregions , the text of which is available under a creative commons attribution-sharealike 2.5 generic license the wikimedia commons maps of ecoregions category contains hundreds of ecoregion maps that can be used in ecoregion articles google earth layers for the wwf ecoregions interactive wwf ecoregions map from the wwf interactive wwf ecoregions map from national geographic epa ecoregions the atlas of global conservation from the nature conservancy has various statistics for all the wwf ecoregions , valid an account of major plant communities or habitat types , including their structure and predominant or characteristic species article assessments help project members prioritise improvements to articles related to ecoregions user : cleveland13 - interested in improving ecoregion articles for a college project wikiproject watchlist - wikiproject ecoregions

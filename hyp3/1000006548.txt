'' ecoregions are an obvious and objective way to understand physical geography this wikiproject will create articles on all the terrestrial , marine , and freshwater ecoregions on earth using a consistent naming scheme link to these ecoregion articles when you need to describe broad-scale ecology this may be from articles on protected areas , mountains , rivers , lakes , and countries the project will allow users to navigate logically from the entire planet earth down into the ecozones and ecoregions , and their bordering rivers , seas , and oceans we now have articles for all of the wwf terrestrial ecoregions â€“ about 865 depending on definitions to see which ones they are , go to the project 's full checklist : a checklist of terrestrial ecoregions on en-wikipedia create ecoregion-specific subsections in '' redirect '' articles so the ecoregion link is a redirect to the main article two things need to be checked on these ecoregions : ( a ) do the ecoregion and main article subject really refer to the same area ? if not , a separate ecoregion article may be warranted list of ecoregions ( wwf ) : terrestrial , marine , and freshwater ecoregions for the entire world list of ecoregions in north america ( cec ) list of ecoregions in the united states ( epa ) currently there are no feature articles among the ecoregions if anyone wishes to identify a candidate for upgrading to feature status , it would be a great help to the project similarly , it would be good to upgrade each of the biome articles to '' b '' status , as they are the base for a lot of common information add links to other articles that point to the ecoregion article should also refer to ecoregions when describing their range create missing articles for marine and freshwater ecoregions the encyclopedia of earth contains articles for many ecoregions , the text of which is available under a creative commons attribution-sharealike 2.5 generic license wwf databases include terrestrial and marine ecoregions , as well as thousands of species distributions in terms of ecoregions wikiproject watchlist - wikiproject ecoregions these include numbers of bird , mammal , and threatened species , percent habitat loss , and percent area formally protected add the template to all ecoregion articles and fill out as many fields as possible add the template to the top of the talk page of any article which is in the scope of this project article assessments help project members prioritise improvements to articles related to ecoregions wikiproject watchlist - wikiproject ecoregions

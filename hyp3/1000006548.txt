an ecoregion , sometimes called a bioregion , is '' a relatively large area of land or water that contains a geographically distinct assemblage of natural communities '' ecoregions are an obvious and objective way to understand physical geography they also enable organization of ecology and climate data , including ranges of animals and plants this wikiproject will create articles on all the terrestrial , marine , and freshwater ecoregions on earth using a consistent naming scheme link to these ecoregion articles when you need to describe broad-scale ecology this may be from articles on protected areas , mountains , rivers , lakes , and countries the project will allow users to navigate logically from the entire planet earth down into the ecozones and ecoregions , and their bordering rivers , seas , and oceans we now have articles for all of the wwf terrestrial ecoregions â€“ about 865 depending on definitions to see which ones they are , go to the project 's full checklist : a checklist of terrestrial ecoregions on en-wikipedia you can use the suggested references in the right hand column to get information for the articles list of ecoregions ( wwf ) : terrestrial , marine , and freshwater ecoregions for the entire world you can see which countries have missing or incomplete ecoregion articles and create or expand them , or create a missing country list list of ecoregions in north america ( cec ) list of ecoregions in the united states ( epa ) currently there are no feature articles among the ecoregions if anyone wishes to identify a candidate for upgrading to feature status , it would be a great help to the project similarly , it would be good to upgrade each of the biome articles to '' b '' status , as they are the base for a lot of common information add links to other articles that point to the ecoregion article create missing articles for marine and freshwater ecoregions google earth layers for the wwf ecoregions interactive wwf ecoregions map from the wwf interactive wwf ecoregions map from national geographic epa ecoregions wwf databases include terrestrial and marine ecoregions , as well as thousands of species distributions in terms of ecoregions wikiproject watchlist - wikiproject ecoregions as of 2006 , it is the pre-eminent soil classification system , replacing the previous fao soil classification are there other , more precise maps ? see : ftp : //ftp.fao.org/agl/agll/wrb/wrbdom.gif the wrb borrows from modern soil classification concepts , including usda soil taxonomy article assessments help project members prioritise improvements to articles related to ecoregions user : cleveland13 - interested in improving ecoregion articles for a college project wikiproject watchlist - wikiproject ecoregions

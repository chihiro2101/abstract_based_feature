three german ( arbeitsgruppe a , b and c ) and one french design team would be included in a competition , with each team producing two prototypes among the prototypes were porsche 's model 734 from team a , sporting a cast turret , and that of team b ( rheinmetall ) , whose cast turret was somewhat higher team c from borgward , designing a very futuristic tank , failed to have a prototype ready in time the porsche prototype ii was eventually selected as the winner of the contest in 1963 ; this did not come as a surprise : it had already been decided in 1961 to build a pre-series of 50 vehicles based on this design ; production of these was started that very year germany dropped france from the joint program after france repeatedly missed deadlines for its contribution to the program in february 1963 defence minister kai-uwe von hassel announced he would soon ask the defense committee in parliament to approve production of the tank germany also announced its agreement to develop a successor with the united states ; called mbt-70 , the program failed to materialize a tenable design production was set up at krauss-maffei of munich from early 1964 onward , with deliveries of the first batch between september 1965 and july 1966 the leopard was soon being purchased from germany by a number of nato members and other allies , including ( in chronological order ) belgium ( 1968 ) , the netherlands ( 1969 ) , norway ( 1970 ) , italy ( 1971 ) , denmark ( 1976 ) , australia ( 1976 ) , canada ( 1978 ) , turkey ( 1980 ) and greece ( 1981 ) greece , spain and chile , while still under dictatorships , purchased the french amx-30 instead after the first batch was delivered , the next three batches were the leopard 1a1 model , which included a new gun stabilization system from cadillac gage that allowed the tank to fire effectively on the move the 1a1 also added the now-famous '' skirts '' along the sides to protect the upper tracks , and a new thermal sleeve on the gun barrel to control heating between 1974 and 1977 , all of the machines in the first four batches were brought to the same leopard 1a1a1 standard , and given additional turret armour developed by blohm & voss the pzb 200 image intensification system was mounted in a large box on the upper right of the gun , creating the leopard 1a1a2 the a2 included a heavier and better armoured turret , and therefore did not receive the b & v armour add-ons as did the earlier machines the next 110 vehicles in the fifth batch were fitted with a new welded turret , which was equipped with a new armour consisting of two spaced steel plates with a plastic filling between them ( high-hardness armour , and a wedge-shaped gun mantlet , creating the leopard 1a3 upgrades were identical to the 1a2 models , the leopard 1a3a1 with the night sights , leopard 1a3a2 with the new radios , and the leopard 1a3a3 with both the 1a4 was externally similar to the 1a3 , but included a new computerized fire control system and the new emes 12a1 sighting system to aim it in addition , the commander was provided with his own independent night sighting system , the peri r12 the resulting leopard 1a5 was based on 1,225 vehicles of the leopard 1a1a1 model the turrets were again modified for the 1a5 , both in order to store all of the new equipment , as well as to move more of the ammunition into the rear of the turret , as opposed to the left side of the driver where it had previously been stored the new turret was also able to mount the newer 120 & nbsp ; mm gun from the leopard 2 if desired , although this option has not been used since then , almost all users of the leopard 1 have also applied similar changes to their own vehicles , and in most ways the 1a5 be considered the '' standard '' leopard 1 today in the netherlands , an improved version equivalent to the a5 called '' leopard 1 verbeterd '' ( improved ) was developed , the same version is used by the chilean army the project was ended in 1987 , as the leopard 2 was in widespread service at this point and the 1a5 offered a more reasonable upgrade path for a fraction of the cost marconi electronic systems once offered conversions to the marksman spaag for existing users of the leopard 1 ; the leopard 1 chassis would be used to carry the marksman turret the canadian army operates the beaver armoured vehicle-launched bridge , taurus arv , and badger aev , all based on the leopard 1 the main alteration has been the replacement of the turret with a raised superstructure that resembles the wheelhouse of a boat other modifications include the addition of working platforms , a nosing block , raised air intakes and an auxiliary power unit ; this has raised the weight of the vehicle from 42.5 tonnes to 50 tonnes the hippo has a fording depth of 2.95 & nbsp ; m ( 10 & nbsp ; ft ) and can pull vehicles up to 50 tonnes weight or push off from the beach a 240 tonne displacement landing craft during the 1973 yom kippur war , 1950s and 1960s generation tanks were badly beaten by wire-guided missiles , and it was realized that dramatically improved armour protection was needed in 1974 , the australian government confirmed the purchase of the leopard , with a total of 101 vehicles being acquired ( consisting of 90 mbts , five bridgelayers and six armoured recovery vehicles ) the leopard 1 was operated by the 1st armoured regiment and was officially withdrawn from service in july 2007 at the end of the 1990s , the remaining four regiments amalgamated into two tank regiments , the 1st/3rd lancers and the 2nd/4th lancers the 1st/3rd lancers is no longer a tank regiment , but a medium infantry battalion , identical to the rest of the medium infantry battalions of the belgian army except for having a single squadron of leopard 1a5 ( be ) in 1976 , prior to delivery of these new leopards , the canadian government leased 35 leopard 1a2 tanks from the contractor in order to begin training crews from the 4 canadian mechanized brigade group ( 4cmbg ) based in west germany starting in 2000 , the 114 leopard c1 tanks in service were upgraded to c2 standard at a cost of ca 139 million the leopard c2 is also equipped with thermal sights and emes 18 fire-control system of the obsolescent tanks , 23 were sold to companies in north america , four put in museums or used as monuments ( including two at the bovington tank museum ) , a brace of leopards , bovington tank museum and 21 used as hard targets on ranges its army , not entirely satisfied by the m60 patton ( 300 delivered , of those 200 were produced by oto-melara ) , placed its first order for the leopard 1 in 1970 , with 200 leopard 1a1 and 69 bergepanzer 2 delivered between 1971 and 1972 the last a1/a2 was retired in 2003 , with the last a5 going in 2008 , leaving the ariete as the sole tank in italian service the aevs , arvs , and avlbs have been reduced in number and some have been modified to work with the ariete – 128 leopard 1bes and 250 leopard 1a5s – 202 leopard 1vs , reduced to 150 ; 120 remaining in service the leopard c2 was in active service until 2015 and replaced with leopard 2s purchased from the netherlands and germany

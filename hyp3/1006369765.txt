team c from borgward , designing a very futuristic tank , failed to have a prototype ready in time at this time the tank weighed 40 tons and cost 250,000 each greece , spain and chile , while still under dictatorships , purchased the french amx-30 instead after the first batch was delivered , the next three batches were the leopard 1a1 model , which included a new gun stabilization system from cadillac gage that allowed the tank to fire effectively on the move the 1a1 also added the now-famous '' skirts '' along the sides to protect the upper tracks , and a new thermal sleeve on the gun barrel to control heating between 1974 and 1977 , all of the machines in the first four batches were brought to the same leopard 1a1a1 standard , and given additional turret armour developed by blohm & voss a further upgrade in the 1980s added leftover image-intensifier night sights , which were being handed down from the leopard 2 as they were themselves upgraded the pzb 200 image intensification system was mounted in a large box on the upper right of the gun , creating the leopard 1a1a2 a further upgrade with sem80/90 all-digital radios created the leopard 1a1a3 later improvements to the image intensifier created the leopard 1a1a4 the first 232 tanks of the fifth production batch were delivered as the leopard 1a2 between 1972 and 1974 however , they did receive the other upgrades ; the leopard 1a2a1 received the pzb 200 , the leopard 1a2a2 received digital radios , and the leopard 1a2a3 got both although the level of armour area density was equivalent to the a2 's new welded version , the internal volume was increased by 1.2 m³ and the effective protection level was increased by half the improved trp 2a independent sight was installed for the commander upgrades were identical to the 1a2 models , the leopard 1a3a1 with the night sights , leopard 1a3a2 with the new radios , and the leopard 1a3a3 with both the 1a4 was externally similar to the 1a3 , but included a new computerized fire control system and the new emes 12a1 sighting system to aim it the new equipment used up space and the ammunition load was reduced to 55 rounds , of which 42 were stored in the magazine to the left of the driver in 1980 , a research program was undertaken to study further improvements to the leopard 1 , providing it with a completely modern fire control system and fully effective night/bad-weather vision system the new turret was also able to mount the newer 120 & nbsp ; mm gun from the leopard 2 if desired , although this option has not been used after trials , the krupp-atlas elektronik emes 18 fire control system , which was developed from the emes 15 used on the leopard 2 , was selected in december 1983 the leopard tank could also be fitted with bolt-on polycarbonate ( lexan ) armour panels , which have increased the effectiveness of the armour since then , almost all users of the leopard 1 have also applied similar changes to their own vehicles , and in most ways the 1a5 be considered the '' standard '' leopard 1 today in the netherlands , an improved version equivalent to the a5 called '' leopard 1 verbeterd '' ( improved ) was developed , the same version is used by the chilean army marconi electronic systems once offered conversions to the marksman spaag for existing users of the leopard 1 ; the leopard 1 chassis would be used to carry the marksman turret the canadian army operates the beaver armoured vehicle-launched bridge , taurus arv , and badger aev , all based on the leopard 1 the united kingdom 's royal marines operate a vehicle known as the hippo beach armoured recovery vehicle the main alteration has been the replacement of the turret with a raised superstructure that resembles the wheelhouse of a boat this original gilded leopard ( vergoldeter leopard ) program expired in 1967 with no production order when this happened , the experimentalentwicklung team went public with their alternative design which they called the keiler ( a synonym of eber ) in 1971 , the minister of defence , helmut schmidt , decided to abandon the eber-project and build 17 prototypes of a leopard 2 , based on the keiler design , which had a turret with spaced sloped armour during the 1973 yom kippur war , 1950s and 1960s generation tanks were badly beaten by wire-guided missiles , and it was realized that dramatically improved armour protection was needed in 1974 , the australian government confirmed the purchase of the leopard , with a total of 101 vehicles being acquired ( consisting of 90 mbts , five bridgelayers and six armoured recovery vehicles ) 6 & 408 series ) that started in 1971 when the army decided it needed a replacement for its british centurions , which had served since 1952 and been deployed during the vietnam war the m88a2 hercules is concurrently replacing the leopard family of support variants in australian service mcphederan , ian leopard tanks up for grabs herald sun retrieved may 12 , 2016 the belgian army received their 334 leopard 1be between 1968 and 1971 starting in 2000 , the 114 leopard c1 tanks in service were upgraded to c2 standard at a cost of ca 139 million the tank squadron was augmented in mid september 2007 with the 20 leopard 2a6ms with slat bar type armour , then with the barracudda system added mid-2008 after an initial assessment of the performance of the leopard c2 in afghanistan , canada decided to invest in leopard 2 tanks in 2011 , greece is the largest user of leopard 1 tanks , having over 500 leopard 1a5 gr mbts as well as many st , biber and leguan versions – 128 leopard 1bes and 250 leopard 1a5s – 202 leopard 1vs , reduced to 150 ; 120 remaining in service only 10 arvs ( wisent ) , 6 aevs ( based on wisent ) , and 10 bridgelayers remain in service – 16 leopard 1 's as engineer and evacuation tanks the leopard c2 was in active service until 2015 and replaced with leopard 2s purchased from the netherlands and germany the remaining leopard 1 tanks are in long-term storage for resale

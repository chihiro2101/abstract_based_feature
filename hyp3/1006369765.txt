even before these first prototypes were finished , it had ( in 1959 ) been decided that a second phase with improved designs would be started : team a had to build 26 phase ii prototypes for testing , team b six the porsche prototype ii was eventually selected as the winner of the contest in 1963 ; this did not come as a surprise : it had already been decided in 1961 to build a pre-series of 50 vehicles based on this design ; production of these was started that very year this '' 0-series '' was modified with a new cast turret and several hull changes to raise the rear deck to provide more room in the engine compartment and move some of the radiators to the upper sides of the hull before mass production of the standard version started , it was also decided to add an optical range-finding system for better long-range gunnery , which required the turret to be somewhat taller , and added '' bumps '' on either side of the turret to mount the optics for triangulation germany dropped france from the joint program after france repeatedly missed deadlines for its contribution to the program germany also announced its agreement to develop a successor with the united states ; called mbt-70 , the program failed to materialize a tenable design production was set up at krauss-maffei of munich from early 1964 onward , with deliveries of the first batch between september 1965 and july 1966 the leopard was soon being purchased from germany by a number of nato members and other allies , including ( in chronological order ) belgium ( 1968 ) , the netherlands ( 1969 ) , norway ( 1970 ) , italy ( 1971 ) , denmark ( 1976 ) , australia ( 1976 ) , canada ( 1978 ) , turkey ( 1980 ) and greece ( 1981 ) after the first batch was delivered , the next three batches were the leopard 1a1 model , which included a new gun stabilization system from cadillac gage that allowed the tank to fire effectively on the move a further upgrade in the 1980s added leftover image-intensifier night sights , which were being handed down from the leopard 2 as they were themselves upgraded the pzb 200 image intensification system was mounted in a large box on the upper right of the gun , creating the leopard 1a1a2 the a2 included a heavier and better armoured turret , and therefore did not receive the b & v armour add-ons as did the earlier machines however , they did receive the other upgrades ; the leopard 1a2a1 received the pzb 200 , the leopard 1a2a2 received digital radios , and the leopard 1a2a3 got both upgrades were identical to the 1a2 models , the leopard 1a3a1 with the night sights , leopard 1a3a2 with the new radios , and the leopard 1a3a3 with both in addition , the commander was provided with his own independent night sighting system , the peri r12 in 1980 , a research program was undertaken to study further improvements to the leopard 1 , providing it with a completely modern fire control system and fully effective night/bad-weather vision system the decision was made to base the upgrades on the earlier models , which were no longer competitive the new turret was also able to mount the newer 120 & nbsp ; mm gun from the leopard 2 if desired , although this option has not been used the leopard tank could also be fitted with bolt-on polycarbonate ( lexan ) armour panels , which have increased the effectiveness of the armour the leopard 1a6 prototype was a single leopard 1 a1a1 testbed , modified with additional armour on the turret and equipped with a 120 & nbsp ; mm l/44 gun the project was ended in 1987 , as the leopard 2 was in widespread service at this point and the 1a5 offered a more reasonable upgrade path for a fraction of the cost simultaneous to the production of the battle tanks , a number of engineering , bridging and recovery vehicles were developed , as well as a number of versions used in the anti-aircraft role the most well known leopard variants are the bridgelayer '' biber '' ( beaver ) , '' bergepanzer 2 '' armoured recovery vehicle , '' pionierpanzer 2 dachs '' ( badger ) armoured engineer vehicle and the '' gepard '' self-propelled anti-aircraft gun marconi electronic systems once offered conversions to the marksman spaag for existing users of the leopard 1 ; the leopard 1 chassis would be used to carry the marksman turret the canadian army operates the beaver armoured vehicle-launched bridge , taurus arv , and badger aev , all based on the leopard 1 the united kingdom 's royal marines operate a vehicle known as the hippo beach armoured recovery vehicle the hippo is a conversion of a leopard 1a5 chassis by alvis moelv the main alteration has been the replacement of the turret with a raised superstructure that resembles the wheelhouse of a boat other modifications include the addition of working platforms , a nosing block , raised air intakes and an auxiliary power unit ; this has raised the weight of the vehicle from 42.5 tonnes to 50 tonnes the hippo has a fording depth of 2.95 & nbsp ; m ( 10 & nbsp ; ft ) and can pull vehicles up to 50 tonnes weight or push off from the beach a 240 tonne displacement landing craft almost as soon as the leopard was introduced into service in 1965 , porsche was awarded a contract to study further improvements to the existing design , while waiting deliveries of the mbt-70 in the mid-1970s in that year , it had already become obvious that the mbt-70 would be a failure in 1971 , the minister of defence , helmut schmidt , decided to abandon the eber-project and build 17 prototypes of a leopard 2 , based on the keiler design , which had a turret with spaced sloped armour in 1974 , the australian government confirmed the purchase of the leopard , with a total of 101 vehicles being acquired ( consisting of 90 mbts , five bridgelayers and six armoured recovery vehicles ) 6 & 408 series ) that started in 1971 when the army decided it needed a replacement for its british centurions , which had served since 1952 and been deployed during the vietnam war in march 2004 , the decision was made to replace the leopard 1 with reconditioned us m1 abrams the leopard 1 was operated by the 1st armoured regiment and was officially withdrawn from service in july 2007 after an initial assessment of the performance of the leopard c2 in afghanistan , canada decided to invest in leopard 2 tanks the older leopard c2 tanks are considered to become completely obsolete by 2015 , but specific plans for them have not yet been announced greece bought its first 104 leopard 1a3 gr tanks during 1983–1984 its army , not entirely satisfied by the m60 patton ( 300 delivered , of those 200 were produced by oto-melara ) , placed its first order for the leopard 1 in 1970 , with 200 leopard 1a1 and 69 bergepanzer 2 delivered between 1971 and 1972 – 60 leopard , 30 1a5 and 30 1v , all acquired from chile – 501 leopard 1a5gr and 19 leopard 1a4gr in service , some of the remaining 85 leopard 1a4gr and 170 leopard 1v/inl have been converted to support vehicles or have been used for parts , the rest will be scrapped – 230 leopard 1a5dk , replaced with leopard 2 the leopard c2 was in active service until 2015 and replaced with leopard 2s purchased from the netherlands and germany

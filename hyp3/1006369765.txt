in june 1957 , west germany and the french fourth republic signed an agreement to develop a common tank , designated in german europa-panzer three german ( arbeitsgruppe a , b and c ) and one french design team would be included in a competition , with each team producing two prototypes the porsche prototype ii was eventually selected as the winner of the contest in 1963 ; this did not come as a surprise : it had already been decided in 1961 to build a pre-series of 50 vehicles based on this design ; production of these was started that very year this '' 0-series '' was modified with a new cast turret and several hull changes to raise the rear deck to provide more room in the engine compartment and move some of the radiators to the upper sides of the hull in february 1963 defence minister kai-uwe von hassel announced he would soon ask the defense committee in parliament to approve production of the tank in july the defence ministry ordered 1,500 tanks with production to take place between 1965 and 1970 germany also announced its agreement to develop a successor with the united states ; called mbt-70 , the program failed to materialize a tenable design the leopard was soon being purchased from germany by a number of nato members and other allies , including ( in chronological order ) belgium ( 1968 ) , the netherlands ( 1969 ) , norway ( 1970 ) , italy ( 1971 ) , denmark ( 1976 ) , australia ( 1976 ) , canada ( 1978 ) , turkey ( 1980 ) and greece ( 1981 ) after the first batch was delivered , the next three batches were the leopard 1a1 model , which included a new gun stabilization system from cadillac gage that allowed the tank to fire effectively on the move a further upgrade in the 1980s added leftover image-intensifier night sights , which were being handed down from the leopard 2 as they were themselves upgraded a further upgrade with sem80/90 all-digital radios created the leopard 1a1a3 later improvements to the image intensifier created the leopard 1a1a4 the a2 included a heavier and better armoured turret , and therefore did not receive the b & v armour add-ons as did the earlier machines however , they did receive the other upgrades ; the leopard 1a2a1 received the pzb 200 , the leopard 1a2a2 received digital radios , and the leopard 1a2a3 got both the next 110 vehicles in the fifth batch were fitted with a new welded turret , which was equipped with a new armour consisting of two spaced steel plates with a plastic filling between them ( high-hardness armour , and a wedge-shaped gun mantlet , creating the leopard 1a3 upgrades were identical to the 1a2 models , the leopard 1a3a1 with the night sights , leopard 1a3a2 with the new radios , and the leopard 1a3a3 with both the leopard 1a4 formed the sixth batch of 250 vehicles , delivery starting in 1974 the 1a4 was externally similar to the 1a3 , but included a new computerized fire control system and the new emes 12a1 sighting system to aim it in addition , the commander was provided with his own independent night sighting system , the peri r12 the resulting leopard 1a5 was based on 1,225 vehicles of the leopard 1a1a1 model since then , almost all users of the leopard 1 have also applied similar changes to their own vehicles , and in most ways the 1a5 be considered the '' standard '' leopard 1 today the leopard 1a6 prototype was a single leopard 1 a1a1 testbed , modified with additional armour on the turret and equipped with a 120 & nbsp ; mm l/44 gun simultaneous to the production of the battle tanks , a number of engineering , bridging and recovery vehicles were developed , as well as a number of versions used in the anti-aircraft role the most well known leopard variants are the bridgelayer '' biber '' ( beaver ) , '' bergepanzer 2 '' armoured recovery vehicle , '' pionierpanzer 2 dachs '' ( badger ) armoured engineer vehicle and the '' gepard '' self-propelled anti-aircraft gun marconi electronic systems once offered conversions to the marksman spaag for existing users of the leopard 1 ; the leopard 1 chassis would be used to carry the marksman turret the canadian army operates the beaver armoured vehicle-launched bridge , taurus arv , and badger aev , all based on the leopard 1 the hippo has a fording depth of 2.95 & nbsp ; m ( 10 & nbsp ; ft ) and can pull vehicles up to 50 tonnes weight or push off from the beach a 240 tonne displacement landing craft this original gilded leopard ( vergoldeter leopard ) program expired in 1967 with no production order these were considered promising enough that seven more were ordered , this time powered by the mtu engine designed for the mbt-70 when this happened , the experimentalentwicklung team went public with their alternative design which they called the keiler ( a synonym of eber ) in 1971 , the minister of defence , helmut schmidt , decided to abandon the eber-project and build 17 prototypes of a leopard 2 , based on the keiler design , which had a turret with spaced sloped armour the decision was made to allow the tank to increase its weight to the next classification , military loading class 60 ( tonnes ) , and a new design effort was started , with the spaced armour replaced with a much denser perforated armour assemblage the new design would go on to augment and , after the cold war , sometimes replace the leopard in many countries ' armies the leopard 1 was operated by the 1st armoured regiment and was officially withdrawn from service in july 2007 the belgian army received their 334 leopard 1be between 1968 and 1971 the first regiment to receive the leopard was the 4th lancers , followed by the 1st lancers , 2nd lancers , 3rd lancers , 8th lancers , 1st guides , 2nd guides and finally the 2nd mounted rifles at the end of the cold war , there was a drastic cut in the number of tanks and 128 were sold to brazil at that time , four regiments were still equipped with the leopard 1a5 ( be ) as a replacement for the centurion tank , canada acquired 127 leopard c1 tanks ( equivalent to leopard 1a3 with laser rangefinder ) in 1978–79 for its land forces , with 114 being put into service most of these tanks were stationed in germany during the cold war , with a few retained at canadian forces base gagetown , new brunswick for training greece bought its first 104 leopard 1a3 gr tanks during 1983–1984 at the end , italy was the biggest customer of the leopard outside germany ( 920 plus 250 special versions ) ; the only one with a licence production ; the only country that produced both m60 and leopard 1 – 128 leopard 1bes and 250 leopard 1a5s – 202 leopard 1vs , reduced to 150 ; 120 remaining in service – 114 leopard c2s ( updated leopard 1a5 ) , reduced to 66 in the early 2000s

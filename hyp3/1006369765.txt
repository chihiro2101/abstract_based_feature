in june 1957 , west germany and the french fourth republic signed an agreement to develop a common tank , designated in german europa-panzer three german ( arbeitsgruppe a , b and c ) and one french design team would be included in a competition , with each team producing two prototypes among the prototypes were porsche 's model 734 from team a , sporting a cast turret , and that of team b ( rheinmetall ) , whose cast turret was somewhat higher even before these first prototypes were finished , it had ( in 1959 ) been decided that a second phase with improved designs would be started : team a had to build 26 phase ii prototypes for testing , team b six the porsche prototype ii was eventually selected as the winner of the contest in 1963 ; this did not come as a surprise : it had already been decided in 1961 to build a pre-series of 50 vehicles based on this design ; production of these was started that very year germany dropped france from the joint program after france repeatedly missed deadlines for its contribution to the program in february 1963 defence minister kai-uwe von hassel announced he would soon ask the defense committee in parliament to approve production of the tank germany also announced its agreement to develop a successor with the united states ; called mbt-70 , the program failed to materialize a tenable design production was set up at krauss-maffei of munich from early 1964 onward , with deliveries of the first batch between september 1965 and july 1966 the leopard was soon being purchased from germany by a number of nato members and other allies , including ( in chronological order ) belgium ( 1968 ) , the netherlands ( 1969 ) , norway ( 1970 ) , italy ( 1971 ) , denmark ( 1976 ) , australia ( 1976 ) , canada ( 1978 ) , turkey ( 1980 ) and greece ( 1981 ) after the first batch was delivered , the next three batches were the leopard 1a1 model , which included a new gun stabilization system from cadillac gage that allowed the tank to fire effectively on the move a less important change was to use rectangular rubber blocks fastened to the treads with a single pin instead of the earlier two-pin '' shaped '' versions the rubber blocks could be easily replaced with metal x-shaped crampons for movement on ice and snow in the winter a further upgrade in the 1980s added leftover image-intensifier night sights , which were being handed down from the leopard 2 as they were themselves upgraded later improvements to the image intensifier created the leopard 1a1a4 the first 232 tanks of the fifth production batch were delivered as the leopard 1a2 between 1972 and 1974 however , they did receive the other upgrades ; the leopard 1a2a1 received the pzb 200 , the leopard 1a2a2 received digital radios , and the leopard 1a2a3 got both although the level of armour area density was equivalent to the a2 's new welded version , the internal volume was increased by 1.2 m³ and the effective protection level was increased by half upgrades were identical to the 1a2 models , the leopard 1a3a1 with the night sights , leopard 1a3a2 with the new radios , and the leopard 1a3a3 with both the leopard 1a4 formed the sixth batch of 250 vehicles , delivery starting in 1974 the 1a4 was externally similar to the 1a3 , but included a new computerized fire control system and the new emes 12a1 sighting system to aim it the new equipment used up space and the ammunition load was reduced to 55 rounds , of which 42 were stored in the magazine to the left of the driver in 1980 , a research program was undertaken to study further improvements to the leopard 1 , providing it with a completely modern fire control system and fully effective night/bad-weather vision system the resulting leopard 1a5 was based on 1,225 vehicles of the leopard 1a1a1 model the new turret was also able to mount the newer 120 & nbsp ; mm gun from the leopard 2 if desired , although this option has not been used the emes 18 included two new sights on the top of the turret , and no longer required the '' bumps '' as did the earlier optical systems since then , almost all users of the leopard 1 have also applied similar changes to their own vehicles , and in most ways the 1a5 be considered the '' standard '' leopard 1 today the leopard 1a6 prototype was a single leopard 1 a1a1 testbed , modified with additional armour on the turret and equipped with a 120 & nbsp ; mm l/44 gun simultaneous to the production of the battle tanks , a number of engineering , bridging and recovery vehicles were developed , as well as a number of versions used in the anti-aircraft role the most well known leopard variants are the bridgelayer '' biber '' ( beaver ) , '' bergepanzer 2 '' armoured recovery vehicle , '' pionierpanzer 2 dachs '' ( badger ) armoured engineer vehicle and the '' gepard '' self-propelled anti-aircraft gun the canadian army operates the beaver armoured vehicle-launched bridge , taurus arv , and badger aev , all based on the leopard 1 the hippo has a fording depth of 2.95 & nbsp ; m ( 10 & nbsp ; ft ) and can pull vehicles up to 50 tonnes weight or push off from the beach a 240 tonne displacement landing craft gilded leopard , eber and keiler almost as soon as the leopard was introduced into service in 1965 , porsche was awarded a contract to study further improvements to the existing design , while waiting deliveries of the mbt-70 in the mid-1970s this original gilded leopard ( vergoldeter leopard ) program expired in 1967 with no production order in 1971 , the minister of defence , helmut schmidt , decided to abandon the eber-project and build 17 prototypes of a leopard 2 , based on the keiler design , which had a turret with spaced sloped armour in 1974 , the australian government confirmed the purchase of the leopard , with a total of 101 vehicles being acquired ( consisting of 90 mbts , five bridgelayers and six armoured recovery vehicles ) the first leopards subsequently arrived in australia from germany in 1976 , ending a selection and trial process ( against the us m60 hunnicutt , p 6 & 408 series ) that started in 1971 when the army decided it needed a replacement for its british centurions , which had served since 1952 and been deployed during the vietnam war denmark was the only scandinavian country to send a significant tank force to support their peacekeeping operations in croatia and bosnia in 2001 , the greek army decided to upgrade 104 leopard 1a4gr and 120 leopard 1v to the a5+ version , costing 234 million dollars the turkish army upgraded its leopard 1 tanks to a version called the leopard 1t 'volkan ' – 128 leopard 1bes and 250 leopard 1a5s – 202 leopard 1vs , reduced to 150 ; 120 remaining in service – 114 leopard c2s ( updated leopard 1a5 ) , reduced to 66 in the early 2000s

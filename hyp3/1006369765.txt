in june 1957 , west germany and the french fourth republic signed an agreement to develop a common tank , designated in german europa-panzer three german ( arbeitsgruppe a , b and c ) and one french design team would be included in a competition , with each team producing two prototypes among the prototypes were porsche 's model 734 from team a , sporting a cast turret , and that of team b ( rheinmetall ) , whose cast turret was somewhat higher the porsche prototype ii was eventually selected as the winner of the contest in 1963 ; this did not come as a surprise : it had already been decided in 1961 to build a pre-series of 50 vehicles based on this design ; production of these was started that very year in february 1963 defence minister kai-uwe von hassel announced he would soon ask the defense committee in parliament to approve production of the tank in july the defence ministry ordered 1,500 tanks with production to take place between 1965 and 1970 germany also announced its agreement to develop a successor with the united states ; called mbt-70 , the program failed to materialize a tenable design the leopard was soon being purchased from germany by a number of nato members and other allies , including ( in chronological order ) belgium ( 1968 ) , the netherlands ( 1969 ) , norway ( 1970 ) , italy ( 1971 ) , denmark ( 1976 ) , australia ( 1976 ) , canada ( 1978 ) , turkey ( 1980 ) and greece ( 1981 ) it is also key to note that germany has a strict export-policy for their military equipment after the first batch was delivered , the next three batches were the leopard 1a1 model , which included a new gun stabilization system from cadillac gage that allowed the tank to fire effectively on the move a less important change was to use rectangular rubber blocks fastened to the treads with a single pin instead of the earlier two-pin '' shaped '' versions between 1974 and 1977 , all of the machines in the first four batches were brought to the same leopard 1a1a1 standard , and given additional turret armour developed by blohm & voss the pzb 200 image intensification system was mounted in a large box on the upper right of the gun , creating the leopard 1a1a2 a further upgrade with sem80/90 all-digital radios created the leopard 1a1a3 later improvements to the image intensifier created the leopard 1a1a4 the first 232 tanks of the fifth production batch were delivered as the leopard 1a2 between 1972 and 1974 the a2 included a heavier and better armoured turret , and therefore did not receive the b & v armour add-ons as did the earlier machines however , they did receive the other upgrades ; the leopard 1a2a1 received the pzb 200 , the leopard 1a2a2 received digital radios , and the leopard 1a2a3 got both upgrades were identical to the 1a2 models , the leopard 1a3a1 with the night sights , leopard 1a3a2 with the new radios , and the leopard 1a3a3 with both the leopard 1a4 formed the sixth batch of 250 vehicles , delivery starting in 1974 in 1980 , a research program was undertaken to study further improvements to the leopard 1 , providing it with a completely modern fire control system and fully effective night/bad-weather vision system the resulting leopard 1a5 was based on 1,225 vehicles of the leopard 1a1a1 model the new turret was also able to mount the newer 120 & nbsp ; mm gun from the leopard 2 if desired , although this option has not been used after trials , the krupp-atlas elektronik emes 18 fire control system , which was developed from the emes 15 used on the leopard 2 , was selected in december 1983 the emes 18 included two new sights on the top of the turret , and no longer required the '' bumps '' as did the earlier optical systems a crucial part of the upgrade was the introduction of more effective ammunition , including new apfsds rounds the leopard tank could also be fitted with bolt-on polycarbonate ( lexan ) armour panels , which have increased the effectiveness of the armour the leopard 1a6 prototype was a single leopard 1 a1a1 testbed , modified with additional armour on the turret and equipped with a 120 & nbsp ; mm l/44 gun simultaneous to the production of the battle tanks , a number of engineering , bridging and recovery vehicles were developed , as well as a number of versions used in the anti-aircraft role marconi electronic systems once offered conversions to the marksman spaag for existing users of the leopard 1 ; the leopard 1 chassis would be used to carry the marksman turret the canadian army operates the beaver armoured vehicle-launched bridge , taurus arv , and badger aev , all based on the leopard 1 this original gilded leopard ( vergoldeter leopard ) program expired in 1967 with no production order in 1971 , the minister of defence , helmut schmidt , decided to abandon the eber-project and build 17 prototypes of a leopard 2 , based on the keiler design , which had a turret with spaced sloped armour in 1974 , the australian government confirmed the purchase of the leopard , with a total of 101 vehicles being acquired ( consisting of 90 mbts , five bridgelayers and six armoured recovery vehicles ) 6 & 408 series ) that started in 1971 when the army decided it needed a replacement for its british centurions , which had served since 1952 and been deployed during the vietnam war the m88a2 hercules is concurrently replacing the leopard family of support variants in australian service the leopard 1 was operated by the 1st armoured regiment and was officially withdrawn from service in july 2007 two leopard 2 büffel armoured recovery vehicles were acquired at the same time in 1976 , denmark acquired 120 leopard 1a3 tanks , which were designated leopard 1 dk italy had to replace an enormous amount of m47 patton ( over 2,000 were received by us stocks ) but , unlike other nato members , did not instigate a national project to archive this its army , not entirely satisfied by the m60 patton ( 300 delivered , of those 200 were produced by oto-melara ) , placed its first order for the leopard 1 in 1970 , with 200 leopard 1a1 and 69 bergepanzer 2 delivered between 1971 and 1972 – 128 leopard 1bes and 250 leopard 1a5s – 202 leopard 1vs , reduced to 150 ; 120 remaining in service – 920 ( +250 special versions ) , retired by the end of 2008 ( replaced by ariete main battle tank ) , the aevs , arvs and ablvs remain in service – 172 originally ; replaced by leopard 2

human vision is confined to a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum called visible light some animals such as the mantis shrimp and trout can see using much more of the infrared and/or ultraviolet spectrum than humans sufficient intensity range is simply the ability to see with very small quantities of light many animals have better night vision than humans do , the result of one or more differences in the morphology and anatomy of their eyes in bright light conditions , most of the retinal is not in the photoreceptors , but is outside of the eye it takes about 45 minutes of dark for all of the photoreceptor proteins to be recharged with active retinal , but most of the night vision adaptation occurs within the first five minutes in the dark right rhodopsin in the human rods is insensitive to the longer red wavelengths , so traditionally many people use red light to help preserve night vision therefore , using red light to navigate would not desensitize the receptors used to detect star light using red light for night vision is less effective for people with redâ€“green color blindness , due to their insensitivity to red light optics , 13 , 024010 , 2008 nocturnal mammals have rods with unique properties that make enhanced night vision possible the image is said to become '' intensified '' because the output visible light is brighter than the incoming light , and this effect directly relates to the difference in passive and active night vision goggles the resulting scene , which is apparently dark to a human observer , appears as a monochrome image on a normal display device because active infrared night-vision systems can incorporate illuminators that produce high levels of infrared light , the resulting images are typically higher resolution than other night-vision technologies laser range gated imaging is another form of active night vision which utilizes a high powered pulsed light source for illumination and imaging before the introduction of image intensifiers , night glasses were the only method of night vision , and thus were widely utilized , especially at sea a specific type of nvd , the night vision goggle ( nvg ) is a night vision device with dual eyepieces night vision goggles combined with magnification lenses constitutes night vision binoculars often night glasses also have a fairly large exit pupil of 7 & nbsp ; mm or more to let all gathered light into the user 's eye

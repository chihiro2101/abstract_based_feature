night-useful spectral range techniques can sense radiation that is invisible to a human observer human vision is confined to a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum called visible light some animals such as the mantis shrimp and trout can see using much more of the infrared and/or ultraviolet spectrum than humans sufficient intensity range is simply the ability to see with very small quantities of light many animals have better night vision than humans do , the result of one or more differences in the morphology and anatomy of their eyes enhanced intensity range is achieved via technological means through the use of an image intensifier , gain multiplication ccd , or other very low-noise and high-sensitivity arrays of photodetectors the retinal must diffuse from the vision cell , out of the eye , and circulate via the blood to the liver where it is regenerated in bright light conditions , most of the retinal is not in the photoreceptors , but is outside of the eye in dark conditions only the rod cells have enough sensitivity to respond and to trigger vision right rhodopsin in the human rods is insensitive to the longer red wavelengths , so traditionally many people use red light to help preserve night vision this is found in many nocturnal animals and some deep sea animals , and is the cause of eyeshine optics , 13 , 024010 , 2008 nocturnal mammals have rods with unique properties that make enhanced night vision possible night vision technologies can be broadly divided into three main categories : image intensifier , active lighting , and thermal imaging thermographic camera are excellent tools for night vision a specific type of nvd , the night vision goggle ( nvg ) is a night vision device with dual eyepieces night vision goggles combined with magnification lenses constitutes night vision binoculars often night glasses also have a fairly large exit pupil of 7 & nbsp ; mm or more to let all gathered light into the user 's eye night vision systems can also be installed in vehicles

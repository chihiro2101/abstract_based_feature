human vision is confined to a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum called visible light many animals have better night vision than humans do , the result of one or more differences in the morphology and anatomy of their eyes all photoreceptor cells in the vertebrate eye contain molecules of photoreceptor protein which is a combination of the protein photopsin in cone cell , rhodopsin in rod cell , and retinal ( a small photoreceptor molecule ) another theory posits that since stars typically emit light with shorter wavelengths , the light from stars will be in the blue-green color spectrum therefore , using red light to navigate would not desensitize the receptors used to detect star light using red light for night vision is less effective for people with red–green color blindness , due to their insensitivity to red light many animals have a tissue layer called the tapetum lucidum in the back of the eye that reflects light back through the retina , increasing the amount of light available for it to capture , but reducing the sharpness of the focus of the image optics , 13 , 024010 , 2008 nocturnal mammals have rods with unique properties that make enhanced night vision possible night vision technologies can be broadly divided into three main categories : image intensifier , active lighting , and thermal imaging examples of such technologies include night glasses and low light cameras the image is said to become '' intensified '' because the output visible light is brighter than the incoming light , and this effect directly relates to the difference in passive and active night vision goggles active infrared night-vision combines infrared illumination of spectral range 700–1,000 & nbsp ; nm ( just below the visible spectrum of the human eye ) with ccd cameras sensitive to this light however , since active infrared light can be detected by night-vision goggles , there can be a risk of giving away position in tactical military operations laser range gated imaging is another form of active night vision which utilizes a high powered pulsed light source for illumination and imaging before the introduction of image intensifiers , night glasses were the only method of night vision , and thus were widely utilized , especially at sea a specific type of nvd , the night vision goggle ( nvg ) is a night vision device with dual eyepieces night vision goggles combined with magnification lenses constitutes night vision binoculars large lenses can gather and concentrate light , thus intensifying light with purely optical means and enabling the user to see better in the dark than with the naked eye alone

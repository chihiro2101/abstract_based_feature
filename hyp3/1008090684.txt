night-useful spectral range techniques can sense radiation that is invisible to a human observer human vision is confined to a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum called visible light some animals such as the mantis shrimp and trout can see using much more of the infrared and/or ultraviolet spectrum than humans sufficient intensity range is simply the ability to see with very small quantities of light many animals have better night vision than humans do , the result of one or more differences in the morphology and anatomy of their eyes enhanced intensity range is achieved via technological means through the use of an image intensifier , gain multiplication ccd , or other very low-noise and high-sensitivity arrays of photodetectors the retinal must diffuse from the vision cell , out of the eye , and circulate via the blood to the liver where it is regenerated right rhodopsin in the human rods is insensitive to the longer red wavelengths , so traditionally many people use red light to help preserve night vision another theory posits that since stars typically emit light with shorter wavelengths , the light from stars will be in the blue-green color spectrum using red light for night vision is less effective for people with red–green color blindness , due to their insensitivity to red light optics , 13 , 024010 , 2008 nocturnal mammals have rods with unique properties that make enhanced night vision possible night vision technologies can be broadly divided into three main categories : image intensifier , active lighting , and thermal imaging examples of such technologies include night glasses and low light cameras active infrared night-vision combines infrared illumination of spectral range 700–1,000 & nbsp ; nm ( just below the visible spectrum of the human eye ) with ccd cameras sensitive to this light laser range gated imaging is another form of active night vision which utilizes a high powered pulsed light source for illumination and imaging a specific type of nvd , the night vision goggle ( nvg ) is a night vision device with dual eyepieces night vision goggles combined with magnification lenses constitutes night vision binoculars other types include monocular night vision devices with only one eyepiece which may be mounted to firearms as night sights

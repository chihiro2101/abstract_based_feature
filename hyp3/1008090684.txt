human vision is confined to a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum called visible light sufficient intensity range is simply the ability to see with very small quantities of light many animals have better night vision than humans do , the result of one or more differences in the morphology and anatomy of their eyes enhanced intensity range is achieved via technological means through the use of an image intensifier , gain multiplication ccd , or other very low-noise and high-sensitivity arrays of photodetectors '' sensory reception : human vision : structure and function of the human eye '' vol right rhodopsin in the human rods is insensitive to the longer red wavelengths , so traditionally many people use red light to help preserve night vision red light only slowly depletes the rhodopsin stores in the rods , and instead is viewed by the red sensitive cone cells using red light for night vision is less effective for people with red–green color blindness , due to their insensitivity to red light optics , 13 , 024010 , 2008 nocturnal mammals have rods with unique properties that make enhanced night vision possible examples of such technologies include night glasses and low light cameras in the military context , image intensifiers are often called '' low light tv '' since the video signal is often transmitted to a display within a control center the image is said to become '' intensified '' because the output visible light is brighter than the incoming light , and this effect directly relates to the difference in passive and active night vision goggles active infrared night-vision combines infrared illumination of spectral range 700–1,000 & nbsp ; nm ( just below the visible spectrum of the human eye ) with ccd cameras sensitive to this light thermographic camera are excellent tools for night vision before the introduction of image intensifiers , night glasses were the only method of night vision , and thus were widely utilized , especially at sea a specific type of nvd , the night vision goggle ( nvg ) is a night vision device with dual eyepieces other types include monocular night vision devices with only one eyepiece which may be mounted to firearms as night sights an automotive night vision system is used to improve a vehicle driver 's perception and seeing distance in darkness or poor weather

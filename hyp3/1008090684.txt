night-useful spectral range techniques can sense radiation that is invisible to a human observer human vision is confined to a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum called visible light sufficient intensity range is simply the ability to see with very small quantities of light many animals have better night vision than humans do , the result of one or more differences in the morphology and anatomy of their eyes enhanced intensity range is achieved via technological means through the use of an image intensifier , gain multiplication ccd , or other very low-noise and high-sensitivity arrays of photodetectors it takes about 45 minutes of dark for all of the photoreceptor proteins to be recharged with active retinal , but most of the night vision adaptation occurs within the first five minutes in the dark in dark conditions only the rod cells have enough sensitivity to respond and to trigger vision right rhodopsin in the human rods is insensitive to the longer red wavelengths , so traditionally many people use red light to help preserve night vision red light only slowly depletes the rhodopsin stores in the rods , and instead is viewed by the red sensitive cone cells using red light for night vision is less effective for people with redâ€“green color blindness , due to their insensitivity to red light night vision technologies can be broadly divided into three main categories : image intensifier , active lighting , and thermal imaging this causes the image screen to illuminate with a picture in the same pattern as the light that strikes the photocathode and on a wavelength the human eye can see laser range gated imaging is another form of active night vision which utilizes a high powered pulsed light source for illumination and imaging they are widely used to complement new or existing security networks , and for night vision on aircraft , where they are commonly referred to as '' flir '' ( for '' forward-looking infrared '' ) before the introduction of image intensifiers , night glasses were the only method of night vision , and thus were widely utilized , especially at sea lately , night vision technology has become more widely available for civilian use night vision goggles combined with magnification lenses constitutes night vision binoculars night vision systems can also be installed in vehicles

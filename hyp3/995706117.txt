this group has the defining characteristic that all the component elements have 5 electrons in their outermost shell , that is 2 electrons in the s & nbsp ; subshell and 3 unpaired electrons in the p & nbsp ; subshell they are therefore 3 & nbsp ; electrons short of filling their outermost electron shell in their non-ionized state the most important elements of this group are nitrogen ( n ) , which in its diatomic form is the principal component of air , and phosphorus ( p ) , which , like nitrogen , is essential to all known forms of life these are in the form of re a m b pn c , where m is a carbon group or boron group element and pn is any pnictogen except nitrogen these compounds are between ionic and covalent compounds and thus have unusual bonding properties this is the property of these elements which leads to their potential toxicity , most evident in phosphorus , arsenic and antimony paradoxically , it is this strong bonding which causes nitrogen and bismuth 's reduced toxicity ( when in molecules ) , as these form strong bonds with other atoms which are difficult to split , creating very unreactive molecules for example , n 2 , the diatomic form of nitrogen , is used as an inert gas in situations where using argon or another noble gas would be too expensive formation of multiple bonds is facilitated by their five valence electrons whereas the octet rule permits a pnictogen for accepting three electrons on covalent bonding because 5 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 3 , it leaves unused two electrons in a lone pair unless there is a positive charge around ( like in ) the light pnictogens ( nitrogen , phosphorus , and arsenic ) tend to form −3 charges when reduced , completing their octet however heavier pnictogens are more likely to form the +3 oxidation state than lighter ones due to the s-shell electrons becoming more stabilized department of chemistry , angelo state university , texas phosphorus forms a +iii oxide which is stable at room temperature , phosphorous acid , and several trihalides , although the triiodide is unstable arsenic forms +iii compounds with oxygen as arsenites , arsenous acid , and arsenic ( iii ) oxide , and it forms all four trihalides moscovium is predicted to form all four trihalides , of which all but the trifluoride are predicted to be soluble in water it is also predicted to form an oxychloride and oxybromide in the +iii oxidation state for nitrogen , the +5 state is typically serves as only a formal explanation of molecules like dinitrogen pentoxide , as the high electronegativity of nitrogen causes the electrons to be shared almost evenly pnictogen compounds with coordination number & nbsp ; 5 are hypervalent pentamethylpnictogen ( v ) compounds exist for arsenic , antimony , and bismuth however , for bismuth , the +5 oxidation state becomes rare due to the relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbitals known as the inert pair effect , so that the 6s electrons are reluctant to bond chemically nitrogen forms nitrogen oxide in which the nitrogen can take on a variety of oxidation states , including +ii , +iv , and even some mixed-valence compounds and very unstable +vi oxidation state likewise , diimide , which has two nitrogen atoms double-bonded to each other , and diazene have nitrogen in the oxidation state of −1 a corresponding compound for antimony is sb 2 ( c 6 h 5 ) 4 , where the antimony 's oxidation state is +ii this is predicted to cause +i to be a common oxidation state for moscovium , although it also occurs to a lesser extent for bismuth and nitrogen the pnictogens consist of two non-metals ( one gas , one solid ) , two metalloids , one metal , and one element with unknown chemical properties all the elements in the group are solids at room temperature , except for nitrogen which is gaseous at room temperature for instance , at stp nitrogen is a transparent non-metallic gas , while bismuth is a silvery-white metal phosphorus 's density is 1.82 g/cm 3 at stp , arsenic 's is 5.72 g/cm 3 , antimony 's is 6.68 g/cm 3 , and bismuth 's is 9.79 g/cm 3 nitrogen 's melting point is −210 & nbsp ; °c and its boiling point is −196 & nbsp ; °c arsenic is one of only two elements to sublimate at standard pressure ; it does this at 603 & nbsp ; °c it was not until several years later , in 1772 , that daniel rutherford realized that the gas was indeed nitrogen brandt initially thought that he had discovered the philosopher 's stone , but eventually realized that this was not the case antimony compounds were used in dyes in the babylonian times phosphorus makes up 0.1 % of the earth 's crust , making it the 11th most abundant element there arsenic makes up 100 parts per billion of a typical human by weight if an oxide ore of antimony contains less than 30 % antimony by weight , the ore is reduced in a blast furnace nitrogen gas is completely nontoxic , but breathing in pure nitrogen gas is deadly , because it causes nitrogen asphyxiation

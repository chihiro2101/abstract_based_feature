this group has the defining characteristic that all the component elements have 5 electrons in their outermost shell , that is 2 electrons in the s & nbsp ; subshell and 3 unpaired electrons in the p & nbsp ; subshell the russell–saunders term symbol of the ground state in all elements in the group is 4 s the most important elements of this group are nitrogen ( n ) , which in its diatomic form is the principal component of air , and phosphorus ( p ) , which , like nitrogen , is essential to all known forms of life binary compounds of the group can be referred to collectively as pnictides these are in the form of re a m b pn c , where m is a carbon group or boron group element and pn is any pnictogen except nitrogen this is the property of these elements which leads to their potential toxicity , most evident in phosphorus , arsenic and antimony for example , n 2 , the diatomic form of nitrogen , is used as an inert gas in situations where using argon or another noble gas would be too expensive formation of multiple bonds is facilitated by their five valence electrons whereas the octet rule permits a pnictogen for accepting three electrons on covalent bonding because 5 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 3 , it leaves unused two electrons in a lone pair unless there is a positive charge around ( like in ) when a pnictogen forms only three single bonds , effects of the lone pair typically result in trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry the light pnictogens ( nitrogen , phosphorus , and arsenic ) tend to form −3 charges when reduced , completing their octet however heavier pnictogens are more likely to form the +3 oxidation state than lighter ones due to the s-shell electrons becoming more stabilized '' group 5a — the pnictogens '' ( also , technically , only ammonia and phosphane have the pnictogen in the −3 oxidation state because , for the rest , the pnictogen is less electronegative than hydrogen nitrogen forms a limited number of stable iii compounds nitrogen trifluoride is the only stable nitrogen trihalide , with nitrogen trichloride , nitrogen tribromide and nitrogen triiodide being explosive—nitrogen triiodide being so shock-sensitive that the touch of a feather detonates it its trihalides , antimony trifluoride , antimony trichloride , antimony tribromide , and antimony triiodide , like all pnictogen trihalides , each have trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry the +3 oxidation state is bismuth 's most common oxidation state because its ability to form the +5 oxidation state is hindered by relativistic quantum chemistry , effects that are even more pronounced concerning moscovium moscovium ( iii ) is predicted to behave similarly to bismuth ( iii ) moscovium is predicted to form all four trihalides , of which all but the trifluoride are predicted to be soluble in water it is also predicted to form an oxychloride and oxybromide in the +iii oxidation state for nitrogen , the +5 state is typically serves as only a formal explanation of molecules like dinitrogen pentoxide , as the high electronegativity of nitrogen causes the electrons to be shared almost evenly phosphorus even forms mixed oxide-halides , known as oxyhalides , like phosphorus oxychloride , and mixed pentahalides , like phosphorus trifluorodichloride pentamethylpnictogen ( v ) compounds exist for arsenic , antimony , and bismuth a corresponding compound for antimony is sb 2 ( c 6 h 5 ) 4 , where the antimony 's oxidation state is +ii it is expected that moscovium will have an inert pair effect for both the 7s and the 7p 1/2 electrons , as the binding energy of the lone 7p 3/2 electron is noticeably lower than that of the 7p 1/2 electrons this is predicted to cause +i to be a common oxidation state for moscovium , although it also occurs to a lesser extent for bismuth and nitrogen all the elements in the group are solids at room temperature , except for nitrogen which is gaseous at room temperature nitrogen and bismuth , despite both being pnictogens , are very different in their physical properties the density of the pnictogens increase towards the heavier pnictogens antimony 's melting point is 631 & nbsp ; °c and its boiling point is 1587 & nbsp ; °c arsenic , antimony , and bismuth all have rhombohedral crystal structures the name pentels ( from greek , , five ) also at one time stood for this group the soils contain 1 part per million of antimony on average , and seawater contains 300 parts per trillion of antimony on average the soils contain approximately 0.25 parts per million of bismuth , and seawater contains 400 parts per trillion of bismuth if the ore contains 45 % to 60 % antimony by weight , antimony is obtained by heating the ore , also known as liquidation if an oxide ore of antimony contains less than 30 % antimony by weight , the ore is reduced in a blast furnace nitrogen gas is completely nontoxic , but breathing in pure nitrogen gas is deadly , because it causes nitrogen asphyxiation

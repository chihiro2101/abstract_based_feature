like other groups , the members of this family show similar patterns in electron configuration , especially in the outermost shells , resulting in trends in chemical behavior this group has the defining characteristic that all the component elements have 5 electrons in their outermost shell , that is 2 electrons in the s & nbsp ; subshell and 3 unpaired electrons in the p & nbsp ; subshell the russell–saunders term symbol of the ground state in all elements in the group is 4 s the most important elements of this group are nitrogen ( n ) , which in its diatomic form is the principal component of air , and phosphorus ( p ) , which , like nitrogen , is essential to all known forms of life binary compounds of the group can be referred to collectively as pnictides these are in the form of re a m b pn c , where m is a carbon group or boron group element and pn is any pnictogen except nitrogen these compounds are between ionic and covalent compounds and thus have unusual bonding properties university of bristol these elements are also noted for their stability in compounds due to their tendency for forming double and triple covalent bonds paradoxically , it is this strong bonding which causes nitrogen and bismuth 's reduced toxicity ( when in molecules ) , as these form strong bonds with other atoms which are difficult to split , creating very unreactive molecules formation of multiple bonds is facilitated by their five valence electrons whereas the octet rule permits a pnictogen for accepting three electrons on covalent bonding because 5 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 3 , it leaves unused two electrons in a lone pair unless there is a positive charge around ( like in ) the light pnictogens ( nitrogen , phosphorus , and arsenic ) tend to form −3 charges when reduced , completing their octet '' group 5a — the pnictogens '' these include iii-v semiconductors , including gallium arsenide , the second-most widely-used semiconductor after silicon nitrogen trifluoride is the only stable nitrogen trihalide , with nitrogen trichloride , nitrogen tribromide and nitrogen triiodide being explosive—nitrogen triiodide being so shock-sensitive that the touch of a feather detonates it arsenic forms +iii compounds with oxygen as arsenites , arsenous acid , and arsenic ( iii ) oxide , and it forms all four trihalides bismuth ( iii ) forms an oxide , an oxychloride , an oxynitrate , and a sulfide for nitrogen , the +5 state is typically serves as only a formal explanation of molecules like dinitrogen pentoxide , as the high electronegativity of nitrogen causes the electrons to be shared almost evenly nitrogen ( v ) fluoride is only theoretical and has not been synthesized phosphorus even forms mixed oxide-halides , known as oxyhalides , like phosphorus oxychloride , and mixed pentahalides , like phosphorus trifluorodichloride this causes bismuth ( v ) oxide to be unstable and bismuth ( v ) fluoride to be more reactive than the other pnictogen pentafluorides , making it an extremely powerful fluorinating agent nitrogen forms nitrogen oxide in which the nitrogen can take on a variety of oxidation states , including +ii , +iv , and even some mixed-valence compounds and very unstable +vi oxidation state likewise , diimide , which has two nitrogen atoms double-bonded to each other , and diazene have nitrogen in the oxidation state of −1 a corresponding compound for antimony is sb 2 ( c 6 h 5 ) 4 , where the antimony 's oxidation state is +ii antimony tetroxide is a mixed-valence compound , where half of the antimony atoms are in the +3 oxidation state , and the other half are in the +5 oxidation state it is expected that moscovium will have an inert pair effect for both the 7s and the 7p 1/2 electrons , as the binding energy of the lone 7p 3/2 electron is noticeably lower than that of the 7p 1/2 electrons phosphorus 's density is 1.82 g/cm 3 at stp , arsenic 's is 5.72 g/cm 3 , antimony 's is 6.68 g/cm 3 , and bismuth 's is 9.79 g/cm 3 phosphorus has a melting point of 44 & nbsp ; °c and a boiling point of 280 & nbsp ; °c bismuth 's melting point is 271 & nbsp ; °c and its boiling point is 1564 & nbsp ; °c arsenic , antimony , and bismuth all have rhombohedral crystal structures the nitrogen compound sal ammoniac ( ammonium chloride ) has been known since the time of the ancient egyptians nitrogen makes up 25 parts per million of the earth 's crust , 5 parts per million of soil on average , 100 to 500 parts per trillion of seawater , and 78 % of dry air phosphorus occurs in minerals of the apatite family which are the main components of the phosphate rocks the soils contain 1 to 10 parts per million of arsenic , and seawater contains 1.6 parts per billion of arsenic arsenic makes up 100 parts per billion of a typical human by weight some arsenic exists in elemental form , but most arsenic is found in the arsenic minerals orpiment , realgar , arsenopyrite , and enargite bismuth makes up 48 parts per billion of the earth 's crust , making it the 70th most abundant element there nitrogen gas is completely nontoxic , but breathing in pure nitrogen gas is deadly , because it causes nitrogen asphyxiation

this group has the defining characteristic that all the component elements have 5 electrons in their outermost shell , that is 2 electrons in the s & nbsp ; subshell and 3 unpaired electrons in the p & nbsp ; subshell the russell–saunders term symbol of the ground state in all elements in the group is 4 s the most important elements of this group are nitrogen ( n ) , which in its diatomic form is the principal component of air , and phosphorus ( p ) , which , like nitrogen , is essential to all known forms of life binary compounds of the group can be referred to collectively as pnictides various properties that some pnictides have include being diamagnetic and paramagnetic at room temperature , being transparent , and generating electricity when heated these are in the form of re a m b pn c , where m is a carbon group or boron group element and pn is any pnictogen except nitrogen university of bristol these elements are also noted for their stability in compounds due to their tendency for forming double and triple covalent bonds this is the property of these elements which leads to their potential toxicity , most evident in phosphorus , arsenic and antimony when these substances react with various chemicals of the body , they create strong free radicals not easily processed by the liver , where they accumulate for example , n 2 , the diatomic form of nitrogen , is used as an inert gas in situations where using argon or another noble gas would be too expensive because 5 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 3 , it leaves unused two electrons in a lone pair unless there is a positive charge around ( like in ) when a pnictogen forms only three single bonds , effects of the lone pair typically result in trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry the light pnictogens ( nitrogen , phosphorus , and arsenic ) tend to form −3 charges when reduced , completing their octet however heavier pnictogens are more likely to form the +3 oxidation state than lighter ones due to the s-shell electrons becoming more stabilized '' group 5a — the pnictogens '' department of chemistry , angelo state university , texas pnictogens can react with hydrogen to form pnictogen hydrides such as ammonia ( also , technically , only ammonia and phosphane have the pnictogen in the −3 oxidation state because , for the rest , the pnictogen is less electronegative than hydrogen nitrogen forms a limited number of stable iii compounds nitrogen trifluoride is the only stable nitrogen trihalide , with nitrogen trichloride , nitrogen tribromide and nitrogen triiodide being explosive—nitrogen triiodide being so shock-sensitive that the touch of a feather detonates it arsenic forms +iii compounds with oxygen as arsenites , arsenous acid , and arsenic ( iii ) oxide , and it forms all four trihalides antimony forms antimony trioxide and antimonite but not oxyacids its trihalides , antimony trifluoride , antimony trichloride , antimony tribromide , and antimony triiodide , like all pnictogen trihalides , each have trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry the +3 oxidation state is bismuth 's most common oxidation state because its ability to form the +5 oxidation state is hindered by relativistic quantum chemistry , effects that are even more pronounced concerning moscovium moscovium ( iii ) is predicted to behave similarly to bismuth ( iii ) pentamethylpnictogen ( v ) compounds exist for arsenic , antimony , and bismuth likewise , diimide , which has two nitrogen atoms double-bonded to each other , and diazene have nitrogen in the oxidation state of −1 a corresponding compound for antimony is sb 2 ( c 6 h 5 ) 4 , where the antimony 's oxidation state is +ii antimony tetroxide is a mixed-valence compound , where half of the antimony atoms are in the +3 oxidation state , and the other half are in the +5 oxidation state this is predicted to cause +i to be a common oxidation state for moscovium , although it also occurs to a lesser extent for bismuth and nitrogen all the elements in the group are solids at room temperature , except for nitrogen which is gaseous at room temperature nitrogen and bismuth , despite both being pnictogens , are very different in their physical properties nitrogen 's melting point is −210 & nbsp ; °c and its boiling point is −196 & nbsp ; °c arsenic is one of only two elements to sublimate at standard pressure ; it does this at 603 & nbsp ; °c antimony 's melting point is 631 & nbsp ; °c and its boiling point is 1587 & nbsp ; °c arsenic makes up 100 parts per billion of a typical human by weight if the ore contains 25 % to 45 % antimony by weight , then crude antimony is produced by smelting the ore in a blast furnace nitrogen gas is completely nontoxic , but breathing in pure nitrogen gas is deadly , because it causes nitrogen asphyxiation

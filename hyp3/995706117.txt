this group has the defining characteristic that all the component elements have 5 electrons in their outermost shell , that is 2 electrons in the s & nbsp ; subshell and 3 unpaired electrons in the p & nbsp ; subshell they are therefore 3 & nbsp ; electrons short of filling their outermost electron shell in their non-ionized state the russell–saunders term symbol of the ground state in all elements in the group is 4 s the most important elements of this group are nitrogen ( n ) , which in its diatomic form is the principal component of air , and phosphorus ( p ) , which , like nitrogen , is essential to all known forms of life binary compounds of the group can be referred to collectively as pnictides various properties that some pnictides have include being diamagnetic and paramagnetic at room temperature , being transparent , and generating electricity when heated these are in the form of re a m b pn c , where m is a carbon group or boron group element and pn is any pnictogen except nitrogen university of bristol these elements are also noted for their stability in compounds due to their tendency for forming double and triple covalent bonds this is the property of these elements which leads to their potential toxicity , most evident in phosphorus , arsenic and antimony for example , n 2 , the diatomic form of nitrogen , is used as an inert gas in situations where using argon or another noble gas would be too expensive the light pnictogens ( nitrogen , phosphorus , and arsenic ) tend to form −3 charges when reduced , completing their octet however heavier pnictogens are more likely to form the +3 oxidation state than lighter ones due to the s-shell electrons becoming more stabilized ( also , technically , only ammonia and phosphane have the pnictogen in the −3 oxidation state because , for the rest , the pnictogen is less electronegative than hydrogen these include iii-v semiconductors , including gallium arsenide , the second-most widely-used semiconductor after silicon nitrogen forms a limited number of stable iii compounds nitrogen ( iii ) oxide can only be isolated at low temperatures , and nitrous acid is unstable nitrogen trifluoride is the only stable nitrogen trihalide , with nitrogen trichloride , nitrogen tribromide and nitrogen triiodide being explosive—nitrogen triiodide being so shock-sensitive that the touch of a feather detonates it arsenic forms +iii compounds with oxygen as arsenites , arsenous acid , and arsenic ( iii ) oxide , and it forms all four trihalides the +3 oxidation state is bismuth 's most common oxidation state because its ability to form the +5 oxidation state is hindered by relativistic quantum chemistry , effects that are even more pronounced concerning moscovium pentamethylpnictogen ( v ) compounds exist for arsenic , antimony , and bismuth however , for bismuth , the +5 oxidation state becomes rare due to the relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbitals known as the inert pair effect , so that the 6s electrons are reluctant to bond chemically this effect is even more pronounced for moscovium , prohibiting it from attaining a +5 oxidation state likewise , diimide , which has two nitrogen atoms double-bonded to each other , and diazene have nitrogen in the oxidation state of −1 a corresponding compound for antimony is sb 2 ( c 6 h 5 ) 4 , where the antimony 's oxidation state is +ii phosphorus has the +1 oxidation state in hypophosphorous acid and the +4 oxidation state in hypophosphoric acid it is expected that moscovium will have an inert pair effect for both the 7s and the 7p 1/2 electrons , as the binding energy of the lone 7p 3/2 electron is noticeably lower than that of the 7p 1/2 electrons this is predicted to cause +i to be a common oxidation state for moscovium , although it also occurs to a lesser extent for bismuth and nitrogen the pnictogens consist of two non-metals ( one gas , one solid ) , two metalloids , one metal , and one element with unknown chemical properties nitrogen and bismuth , despite both being pnictogens , are very different in their physical properties for instance , at stp nitrogen is a transparent non-metallic gas , while bismuth is a silvery-white metal phosphorus 's density is 1.82 g/cm 3 at stp , arsenic 's is 5.72 g/cm 3 , antimony 's is 6.68 g/cm 3 , and bismuth 's is 9.79 g/cm 3 nitrogen 's melting point is −210 & nbsp ; °c and its boiling point is −196 & nbsp ; °c antimony 's melting point is 631 & nbsp ; °c and its boiling point is 1587 & nbsp ; °c the soils contain approximately 0.25 parts per million of bismuth , and seawater contains 400 parts per trillion of bismuth bismuth most commonly occurs as the mineral bismuthinite , but bismuth also occurs in elemental form or in sulfide ores if the ore contains 25 % to 45 % antimony by weight , then crude antimony is produced by smelting the ore in a blast furnace antimony currency was briefly used in the 1930s in parts of china , but this use was discontinued as antimony is both soft and toxic many nitrogen compounds such as hydrogen cyanide and nitrogen-based explosives are also highly dangerous

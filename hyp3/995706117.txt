like other groups , the members of this family show similar patterns in electron configuration , especially in the outermost shells , resulting in trends in chemical behavior this group has the defining characteristic that all the component elements have 5 electrons in their outermost shell , that is 2 electrons in the s & nbsp ; subshell and 3 unpaired electrons in the p & nbsp ; subshell they are therefore 3 & nbsp ; electrons short of filling their outermost electron shell in their non-ionized state the russell–saunders term symbol of the ground state in all elements in the group is 4 s the most important elements of this group are nitrogen ( n ) , which in its diatomic form is the principal component of air , and phosphorus ( p ) , which , like nitrogen , is essential to all known forms of life binary compounds of the group can be referred to collectively as pnictides these are in the form of re a m b pn c , where m is a carbon group or boron group element and pn is any pnictogen except nitrogen university of bristol these elements are also noted for their stability in compounds due to their tendency for forming double and triple covalent bonds paradoxically , it is this strong bonding which causes nitrogen and bismuth 's reduced toxicity ( when in molecules ) , as these form strong bonds with other atoms which are difficult to split , creating very unreactive molecules for example , n 2 , the diatomic form of nitrogen , is used as an inert gas in situations where using argon or another noble gas would be too expensive formation of multiple bonds is facilitated by their five valence electrons whereas the octet rule permits a pnictogen for accepting three electrons on covalent bonding because 5 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 3 , it leaves unused two electrons in a lone pair unless there is a positive charge around ( like in ) '' group 5a — the pnictogens '' these include iii-v semiconductors , including gallium arsenide , the second-most widely-used semiconductor after silicon nitrogen ( iii ) oxide can only be isolated at low temperatures , and nitrous acid is unstable nitrogen trifluoride is the only stable nitrogen trihalide , with nitrogen trichloride , nitrogen tribromide and nitrogen triiodide being explosive—nitrogen triiodide being so shock-sensitive that the touch of a feather detonates it arsenic forms +iii compounds with oxygen as arsenites , arsenous acid , and arsenic ( iii ) oxide , and it forms all four trihalides bismuth ( iii ) forms an oxide , an oxychloride , an oxynitrate , and a sulfide it is also predicted to form an oxychloride and oxybromide in the +iii oxidation state at least two also form related fluoride-anions , hexafluorophosphate and hexafluoroantimonate , that function as non-coordinating anions phosphorus even forms mixed oxide-halides , known as oxyhalides , like phosphorus oxychloride , and mixed pentahalides , like phosphorus trifluorodichloride pentamethylpnictogen ( v ) compounds exist for arsenic , antimony , and bismuth this causes bismuth ( v ) oxide to be unstable and bismuth ( v ) fluoride to be more reactive than the other pnictogen pentafluorides , making it an extremely powerful fluorinating agent this effect is even more pronounced for moscovium , prohibiting it from attaining a +5 oxidation state similarly , realgar has arsenic-arsenic bonds , so the arsenic 's oxidation state is +ii a corresponding compound for antimony is sb 2 ( c 6 h 5 ) 4 , where the antimony 's oxidation state is +ii antimony tetroxide is a mixed-valence compound , where half of the antimony atoms are in the +3 oxidation state , and the other half are in the +5 oxidation state it is expected that moscovium will have an inert pair effect for both the 7s and the 7p 1/2 electrons , as the binding energy of the lone 7p 3/2 electron is noticeably lower than that of the 7p 1/2 electrons this is predicted to cause +i to be a common oxidation state for moscovium , although it also occurs to a lesser extent for bismuth and nitrogen the pnictogens consist of two non-metals ( one gas , one solid ) , two metalloids , one metal , and one element with unknown chemical properties all the elements in the group are solids at room temperature , except for nitrogen which is gaseous at room temperature nitrogen and bismuth , despite both being pnictogens , are very different in their physical properties for instance , at stp nitrogen is a transparent non-metallic gas , while bismuth is a silvery-white metal antimony 's melting point is 631 & nbsp ; °c and its boiling point is 1587 & nbsp ; °c in the 1760s two scientists , henry cavendish and joseph priestley , isolated nitrogen from air , but neither realized the presence of an undiscovered element arsenic compounds have been known for at least 5000 years , and the ancient greek theophrastus recognized the arsenic minerals called realgar and orpiment the name pentels ( from greek , , five ) also at one time stood for this group bismuth most commonly occurs as the mineral bismuthinite , but bismuth also occurs in elemental form or in sulfide ores

the name '' avon '' is a cognate of the welsh word afon '' river '' , both being derived from the common brittonic , '' river '' '' river avon '' , therefore , literally means '' river river '' ; several other english and scottish rivers share the name the avon ( county ) that existed from 1974 to 1996 was named after the river , and covered bristol , bath , and the lower avon valley the avon rises east of the town of chipping sodbury in south gloucestershire , just north of the village of acton turville ordnance survey 1:25,000 scale explorer map sheet 168 stroud , tetbury & malmesbury this tributary is known locally as the ingleburn , which in old english means 'english river ' here , the two rivers almost meet but their path is blocked by a rocky outcrop of the cotswolds , almost creating an island for the ancient hilltop town of malmesbury to sit on upstream of this confluence the river is sometimes referred to as the 'river avon ( sherston branch ) ' to distinguish it from the tetbury branch the avon valley between bradford on avon and bath is a classic geographical example of a valley where four forms of ground transport are found : road , rail , river , canal the river passes under the avoncliff and dundas aqueducts and at freshford is joined by the somerset river frome it is a grade i listed structure , and was the first canal structure to be designated as a scheduled monument in 1951 it then flows past claverton pumping station , which pumped water from the river avon by warleigh weir into the canal , using power from the flow of the river the water flows down a leat to the pumping station , where it powers a water wheel , wide and in diameter , with 48 & nbsp ; wooden slats each rocking beam in turn drives an 18 & nbsp ; in ( 0.5 & nbsp ; m ) diameter lift pump , which also take their supply from the mill leat the avon then flows through bathford , where it is joined by the bybrook river , and bathampton where it passes under the bathampton toll bridge named after the 3rd duke of cleveland , it spans the river avon at bathwick , and enabled further development of georgian bath to take place on the south side of the river it is named after frances pulteney , heiress in 1767 of the bathwick estate across the river from bath pulteney bridge stood for less than 20 years in the form that adam created some 700 metres below pulteney weir , the river is joined by the kennet and avon canal which connects through bath locks the avon above bath remains navigable as far as bathampton where there is the remains of a flash lock however , the lock past the weir below pulteney bridge was demolished when the weir was reconstructed , so passage between the sections is only possible for dinghies and canoes using the roller slipway on the side of the weir beyond its junction with the kennet and avon canal , the avon flows through keynsham towards bristol in november 2011 the navigation between bath and bristol was closed because of safety concerns about victoria bridge alongside the lock is a pub , whose garden extends over the lock to the small island between the lock and weir netham lock is the point at netham in bristol at which boats from the river avon , gain access to bristol 's bristol harbour access to the harbour is only possible during the day when the lock keeper will open the gates unless the water level in the river between netham and hanham is above or below the level of the harbour the original course is held at a constant level by lock gates ( designed by jessop ) and is known as the bristol harbour it was largely the challenge of navigating this section that sealed the fate of the floating harbour as commercial docks and saw them replaced by docks at avonmouth where the avon joins the severn estuary before reaching its mouth it is joined by the river trym at sea mills which was the site of portus abonae , a roman port shortly after , it passes the village of pill on the south bank where the pill hobblers were based in order to tow ships up the river to bristol and where yachts and other boats still have moorings in chapel pill and crockerne pill the main span is long , and the bridge is long , with an air draught above mean high water level of the river then serves two major dock areas the avonmouth docks are on the north side of the river and are one of the uk 's major ports for chilled foods , especially fruit and vegetables at netham weir where the new cut carries the flow away from bristol harbour the typical range for the depth of the river is to with the highest ever recorded being for the purpose of water quality monitoring and improvement the river is divided into several catchment management areas ; south of malmesbury , bristol avon rural and bristol avon urban the river avon had been navigable from bristol to bath during the early years of the 13th century but construction of mills on the river forced its closure various points along the river including the valley around freshford are at risk of fluvial flooding , as a result of sediment entering the river and narrowing the channel

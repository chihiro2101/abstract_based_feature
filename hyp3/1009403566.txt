'' murray rothbard ( 24 february 2011 ) francis hutcheson : teacher of adam smith , mises institute ( excerpted from an austrian perspective on the history of economic thought ) hutcheson was educated at killyleagh , and went on to scotland to study at the university of glasgow , where he spent 1710 to 1718 in the study of philosophy , classics and general literature , and afterwards in the study of theology , receiving his degree in 1712 facing suspicions about his '' irish '' roots and his association with new licht theologian john simson ( then under investigation by scottish ecclesiastical courts ) , a ministry for him in scotland was unlikely to be a success , so he returned to ireland to pursue a career in academia dr william king , the church of ireland lord archbishop of dublin , who refused to prosecute hutcheson in the archbishop 's court for keeping a school without the episcopal licence dr hugh boulter , lord archbishop of armagh , seem to have been cordial , and his biographer , speaking of '' the inclination of his friends to serve him , the schemes proposed to him for obtaining promotion '' , etc in 1725 hutcheson married his cousin mary , daughter of francis wilson of longford retrieved 2012-05-17 the oxford companion to philosophy oxford university press , 1995 retrieved 2012-05-17 and in 1728 , the essay on the nature and conduct of the passions and affections and illustrations upon the moral sense in 1729 , hutcheson succeeded his old master , gershom carmichael , in the chair of moral philosophy at the university of glasgow , being the first professor there to lecture in english instead of latin he appreciated having leisure for his favourite studies ; '' non-levi igitur laetitia commovebar cum almam matrem academiam me , suum olim alumnum , in libertatem asseruisse audiveram '' ( i was , therefore , moved by no mean frivolous pleasure when i had heard that my alma mater had delivered me , its one time alumnus , into freedom during his time as a lecturer in glasgow college he taught and influenced adam smith , the economist and philosopher '' the order of topics discussed in the economic portion of hutcheson ’ s system of moral philosophy , 1755 is repeated by smith in his glasgow lectures and again in the wealth of nations '' however , it was likely something other than hutcheson 's written work that had such a great influence on smith his roots as a minister indeed shone through in his lectures , which endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy but also to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives ( appropriately acquiring the epithet , preacher of philosophy ) unlike smith , hutcheson was not a system builder ; rather , it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as '' the never to be forgotten hutcheson '' , a title that smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people , his good friend david hume and influential mentor , hutcheson after his death , his son , francis hutcheson published much the longest of his works , a system of moral philosophy , in three books ( 2 vols according to hutcheson , man has a variety of senses , internal as well as external , reflex as well as direct , the general definition of a sense being '' any determination of our minds to receive ideas independently on our will , and to have perceptions of pleasure and pain '' ( essay on the nature and conduct of the passions , sect it is plain , as the author confesses , that there may be '' other perceptions , distinct from all these classes , '' and , in fact , there seems to be no limit to the number of '' senses '' in which a psychological division of this kind might result '' his principal design , '' he says in the preface to the two first treatises , '' is to show that human nature was not left quite indifferent in the affair of virtue , to form to itself observations concerning the advantage or disadvantage of actions , and accordingly to regulate its conduct he has made virtue a lovely form , to excite our pursuit of it , and has given us strong affections to be the springs of each virtuous action by the intellectual part of this process , we refer the action or habit to a certain class ; but no sooner is the intellectual process complete than there is excited in us a feeling similar to what myriads of actions and habits of ( apparently ) the same class excited in us on former occasions all mankind may approve of that which is virtuous or makes for the general good , but they entertain the most widely divergent opinions and frequently arrive at directly opposite conclusions as to particular actions and habits but though hutcheson usually describes the moral faculty as acting instinctively and immediately , he does not , like butler , conflate the moral faculty with the moral standard he thus anticipates the utilitarianism of bentham—and not only in principle , but even in the use of the phrase '' the greatest happiness for the greatest number '' ( inquiry concerning moral good and evil , sect intuition has no possible connection with an empirical calculation of results , and hutcheson in adopting such a criterion practically denies his fundamental assumption connected with hutcheson 's virtual adoption of the utilitarian standard is a kind of moral algebra , proposed for the purpose of '' computing the morality of actions moreover , he acknowledges that , though self-love does not merit approbation , neither , except in its extreme forms , did it merit condemnation , indeed the satisfaction of the dictates of self-love is one of the very conditions of the preservation of society to a study of the writings of shaftesbury and hutcheson we might , probably , in large measure , attribute the unequivocal adoption of the utilitarian standard by hume , and , if this be the case , the name of hutcheson connects itself , through hume , with the names of priestley , paley and bentham thus , in stating his theory of the moral sense , hutcheson is peculiarly careful to repudiate the doctrine of innate ideas ( see , for instance , inquiry concerning moral good and evil , sect we thus see that , not only directly but also through the replies that it called forth , the system of hutcheson , or at least the system of hutcheson combined with that of shaftesbury , contributed , in large measure , to the formation and development of some of the most important of the modern schools of ethics hutcheson 's early inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue , introducing his perennial association of '' unalienable rights '' with the collective right to resist oppressive government , was used at harvard college as a textbook as early as the 1730s francis alison , the professor of moral philosophy at the college of philadelphia , was a former student of hutcheson who closely followed hutcheson 's thought another signer of the declaration of independence , john witherspoon of the college of new jersey ( now princeton university ) , relied heavily on hutcheson 's views in his own lectures on moral philosophy

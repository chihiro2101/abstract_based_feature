he is thought to have been born at drumalig in the parish of saintfield , county down , in modern-day northern ireland '' murray rothbard ( 24 february 2011 ) francis hutcheson : teacher of adam smith , mises institute ( excerpted from an austrian perspective on the history of economic thought ) hutcheson was educated at killyleagh , and went on to scotland to study at the university of glasgow , where he spent 1710 to 1718 in the study of philosophy , classics and general literature , and afterwards in the study of theology , receiving his degree in 1712 facing suspicions about his '' irish '' roots and his association with new licht theologian john simson ( then under investigation by scottish ecclesiastical courts ) , a ministry for him in scotland was unlikely to be a success , so he returned to ireland to pursue a career in academia dr william king , the church of ireland lord archbishop of dublin , who refused to prosecute hutcheson in the archbishop 's court for keeping a school without the episcopal licence dr hugh boulter , lord archbishop of armagh , seem to have been cordial , and his biographer , speaking of '' the inclination of his friends to serve him , the schemes proposed to him for obtaining promotion '' , etc to the period of his dublin residence are also to be referred the thoughts on laughter ( 1725 ) ( a criticism of thomas hobbes ) and the observations on the fable of the bees , being in all six letters contributed to hibernicus ' letters , a periodical that appeared in dublin ( 1725–1727 , 2nd ed at the end of the same period occurred the controversy in the london journal with gilbert burnet ( probably the second son of the rt in 1729 , hutcheson succeeded his old master , gershom carmichael , in the chair of moral philosophy at the university of glasgow , being the first professor there to lecture in english instead of latin he appreciated having leisure for his favourite studies ; '' non-levi igitur laetitia commovebar cum almam matrem academiam me , suum olim alumnum , in libertatem asseruisse audiveram during his time as a lecturer in glasgow college he taught and influenced adam smith , the economist and philosopher '' the order of topics discussed in the economic portion of hutcheson ’ s system of moral philosophy , 1755 is repeated by smith in his glasgow lectures and again in the wealth of nations hutcheson was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the university of glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students , colleagues , and even ordinary residents of glasgow with the fervour and earnestness of his orations unlike smith , hutcheson was not a system builder ; rather , it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as '' the never to be forgotten hutcheson '' , a title that smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people , his good friend david hume and influential mentor , hutcheson his importance is , however , due almost entirely to his ethical writings , and among these primarily to the four essays and the letters published during his time in dublin obvious and fundamental points of agreement between the two authors include the analogy drawn between beauty and virtue , the functions assigned to the moral sense , the position that the benevolent feelings form an original and irreducible part of our nature , and the unhesitating adoption of the principle that the test of virtuous action is its tendency to promote the general welfare according to hutcheson , man has a variety of senses , internal as well as external , reflex as well as direct , the general definition of a sense being '' any determination of our minds to receive ideas independently on our will , and to have perceptions of pleasure and pain '' ( essay on the nature and conduct of the passions , sect he does not attempt to give an exhaustive enumeration of these '' senses , '' but , in various parts of his works , he specifies , besides the five external senses commonly recognized ( which he hints might be added to ) : consciousness , by which each man has a perception of himself and of all that is going on in his own mind ( metaph of these '' senses , '' the '' moral sense '' plays the most important part in hutcheson 's ethical system '' passing over the appeal to final causes involved in this passage , as well as the assumption that the '' moral sense '' has had no growth or history , but was '' implanted '' in man exactly as found among the more civilized races ( an assumption common to both hutcheson and butler ) , his use of the term '' sense '' tends to obscure the real nature of the process of moral judgement all mankind may approve of that which is virtuous or makes for the general good , but they entertain the most widely divergent opinions and frequently arrive at directly opposite conclusions as to particular actions and habits nonetheless , hutcheson , both by his phraseology and the language he uses to describe the process of moral approbation , has done much to favour that loose , popular view of morality which , ignoring the necessity of deliberation and reflection , encourages hasty resolves and unpremeditated judgements the term '' moral sense '' ( which , it may be noticed , had already been employed by shaftesbury , not only , as william whewell suggests , in the margin , but also in the text of his inquiry ) , if invariably coupled with the term '' moral judgement , '' would be open to little objection ; but , taken alone , as designating the complex process of moral approbation , it is liable to lead not only to serious misapprehension but to grave practical errors the test or criterion of right action is with hutcheson , as with shaftesbury , its tendency to promote the general welfare of mankind he thus anticipates the utilitarianism of bentham—and not only in principle , but even in the use of the phrase '' the greatest happiness for the greatest number '' ( inquiry concerning moral good and evil , sect intuition has no possible connection with an empirical calculation of results , and hutcheson in adopting such a criterion practically denies his fundamental assumption this is substantially the same as the doctrine propounded by hobbes and locke ( to the latter of whom hutcheson refers in a note ) , namely that our will is determined by motives in conjunction with our general character and habit of mind , and that the only true liberty is the liberty of acting as we will , not the liberty of willing as we will it is easy to trace the influence of hutcheson 's ethical theories on the systems of hume and adam smith the prominence given by these writers to the analysis of moral action and moral approbation with the attempt to discriminate the respective provinces of the reason and the emotions in these processes , is undoubtedly due to the influence of hutcheson to a study of the writings of shaftesbury and hutcheson we might , probably , in large measure , attribute the unequivocal adoption of the utilitarian standard by hume , and , if this be the case , the name of hutcheson connects itself , through hume , with the names of priestley , paley and bentham thus , the analogy between beauty and virtue , which was so favourite a topic with shaftesbury , is prominent in the writings of hutcheson also norman fiering , a specialist in the intellectual history of colonial new england , has described francis hutcheson as '' probably the most influential and respected moral philosopher in america in the eighteenth century '' wills ' view has been partially supported by samuel fleischacker , who agreed that it is '' perfectly reasonable to see hutcheson ’ s influence behind the appeals to sentiment that jefferson put into his draft of the declaration

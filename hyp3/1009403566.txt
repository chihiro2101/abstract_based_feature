philosophiae moralis institutio compendiaria , ethices et jurisprudentiae naturalis elementa continens , lib after his death , his son , francis hutcheson published much the longest of his works , a system of moral philosophy , in three books ( 2 vols thus hutcheson dealt with metaphysics , logic and ethics according to hutcheson , man has a variety of senses , internal as well as external , reflex as well as direct , the general definition of a sense being '' any determination of our minds to receive ideas independently on our will , and to have perceptions of pleasure and pain '' ( essay on the nature and conduct of the passions , sect he does not attempt to give an exhaustive enumeration of these '' senses , '' but , in various parts of his works , he specifies , besides the five external senses commonly recognized ( which he hints might be added to ) : consciousness , by which each man has a perception of himself and of all that is going on in his own mind ( metaph of these '' senses , '' the '' moral sense '' plays the most important part in hutcheson 's ethical system '' his principal design , '' he says in the preface to the two first treatises , '' is to show that human nature was not left quite indifferent in the affair of virtue , to form to itself observations concerning the advantage or disadvantage of actions , and accordingly to regulate its conduct the author of nature has much better furnished us for a virtuous conduct than our moralists seem to imagine , by almost as quick and powerful instructions as we have for the preservation of our bodies for , as established by hume , this act consists of two parts : an act of deliberation leading to an intellectual judgement ; and a reflex feeling of satisfaction at actions we consider good , and of dissatisfaction at those we consider bad nonetheless , hutcheson , both by his phraseology and the language he uses to describe the process of moral approbation , has done much to favour that loose , popular view of morality which , ignoring the necessity of deliberation and reflection , encourages hasty resolves and unpremeditated judgements but though hutcheson usually describes the moral faculty as acting instinctively and immediately , he does not , like butler , conflate the moral faculty with the moral standard he thus anticipates the utilitarianism of benthamâ€”and not only in principle , but even in the use of the phrase '' the greatest happiness for the greatest number '' ( inquiry concerning moral good and evil , sect hutcheson does not seem to have seen an inconsistency between this external criterion with his fundamental ethical principle connected with hutcheson 's virtual adoption of the utilitarian standard is a kind of moral algebra , proposed for the purpose of '' computing the morality of actions hutcheson 's other distinctive ethical doctrine is what has been called the '' benevolent theory '' of morals this is substantially the same as the doctrine propounded by hobbes and locke ( to the latter of whom hutcheson refers in a note ) , namely that our will is determined by motives in conjunction with our general character and habit of mind , and that the only true liberty is the liberty of acting as we will , not the liberty of willing as we will the prominence given by these writers to the analysis of moral action and moral approbation with the attempt to discriminate the respective provinces of the reason and the emotions in these processes , is undoubtedly due to the influence of hutcheson in the sphere of mental philosophy and logic hutcheson 's contributions are by no means so important or original as in that of moral philosophy thus , in estimating hutcheson 's position , we find that in particular questions he stands nearer to locke , but in the general spirit of his philosophy he seems to approach more closely to his scottish successors the latter reason leads him to call attention to the beauty perceived in universal truths , in the operations of general causes and in moral principles and actions we thus see that , not only directly but also through the replies that it called forth , the system of hutcheson , or at least the system of hutcheson combined with that of shaftesbury , contributed , in large measure , to the formation and development of some of the most important of the modern schools of ethics francis alison , the professor of moral philosophy at the college of philadelphia , was a former student of hutcheson who closely followed hutcheson 's thought john adams read hutcheson 's short introduction to moral philosophy shortly after graduating from harvard

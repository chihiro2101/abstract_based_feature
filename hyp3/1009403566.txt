and a reflex feeling of satisfaction at actions we consider good , and of dissatisfaction at those we consider bad hutcheson recognizes this obvious distinction in his analysis of the mental process preceding moral action , and does not ignore it , even when writing on the moral approbation or disapprobation that follows action nonetheless , hutcheson , both by his phraseology and the language he uses to describe the process of moral approbation , has done much to favour that loose , popular view of morality which , ignoring the necessity of deliberation and reflection , encourages hasty resolves and unpremeditated judgements but though hutcheson usually describes the moral faculty as acting instinctively and immediately , he does not , like butler , conflate the moral faculty with the moral standard the test or criterion of right action is with hutcheson , as with shaftesbury , its tendency to promote the general welfare of mankind he thus anticipates the utilitarianism of bentham—and not only in principle , but even in the use of the phrase '' the greatest happiness for the greatest number '' ( inquiry concerning moral good and evil , sect connected with hutcheson 's virtual adoption of the utilitarian standard is a kind of moral algebra , proposed for the purpose of '' computing the morality of actions in the sphere of mental philosophy and logic hutcheson 's contributions are by no means so important or original as in that of moral philosophy amongst the more important points in which hutcheson diverges from locke is his account of the idea of personal identity , which he appears to have regarded as made known to us directly by consciousness in this latter work the author maintains , in opposition to hutcheson , that actions are – in themselves right or wrong , that right and wrong are simple ideas incapable of analysis , and that these ideas are perceived immediately by the understanding see also martineau , types of ethical theory ( london , 1902 ) ;

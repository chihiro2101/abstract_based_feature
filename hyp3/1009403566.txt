he was the '' son of a presbyterian minister of ulster scottish stock , who was born in ireland '' murray rothbard ( 24 february 2011 ) francis hutcheson : teacher of adam smith , mises institute ( excerpted from an austrian perspective on the history of economic thought ) hutcheson was educated at killyleagh , and went on to scotland to study at the university of glasgow , where he spent 1710 to 1718 in the study of philosophy , classics and general literature , and afterwards in the study of theology , receiving his degree in 1712 facing suspicions about his '' irish '' roots and his association with new licht theologian john simson ( then under investigation by scottish ecclesiastical courts ) , a ministry for him in scotland was unlikely to be a success , so he returned to ireland to pursue a career in academia dr william king , the church of ireland lord archbishop of dublin , who refused to prosecute hutcheson in the archbishop 's court for keeping a school without the episcopal licence in 1725 hutcheson married his cousin mary , daughter of francis wilson of longford retrieved 2012-05-17 the oxford companion to philosophy oxford university press , 1995 retrieved 2012-05-17 and in 1728 , the essay on the nature and conduct of the passions and affections and illustrations upon the moral sense to the period of his dublin residence are also to be referred the thoughts on laughter ( 1725 ) ( a criticism of thomas hobbes ) and the observations on the fable of the bees , being in all six letters contributed to hibernicus ' letters , a periodical that appeared in dublin ( 1725–1727 , 2nd ed during his time as a lecturer in glasgow college he taught and influenced adam smith , the economist and philosopher '' the order of topics discussed in the economic portion of hutcheson ’ s system of moral philosophy , 1755 is repeated by smith in his glasgow lectures and again in the wealth of nations '' however , it was likely something other than hutcheson 's written work that had such a great influence on smith hutcheson was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the university of glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students , colleagues , and even ordinary residents of glasgow with the fervour and earnestness of his orations his roots as a minister indeed shone through in his lectures , which endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy but also to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives ( appropriately acquiring the epithet , preacher of philosophy ) in addition to the works named , the following were published during hutcheson 's lifetime : a pamphlet entitled considerations on patronage ( 1735 ) ; philosophiae moralis institutio compendiaria , ethices et jurisprudentiae naturalis elementa continens , lib after his death , his son , francis hutcheson published much the longest of his works , a system of moral philosophy , in three books ( 2 vols obvious and fundamental points of agreement between the two authors include the analogy drawn between beauty and virtue , the functions assigned to the moral sense , the position that the benevolent feelings form an original and irreducible part of our nature , and the unhesitating adoption of the principle that the test of virtuous action is its tendency to promote the general welfare according to hutcheson , man has a variety of senses , internal as well as external , reflex as well as direct , the general definition of a sense being '' any determination of our minds to receive ideas independently on our will , and to have perceptions of pleasure and pain '' ( essay on the nature and conduct of the passions , sect it is plain , as the author confesses , that there may be '' other perceptions , distinct from all these classes , '' and , in fact , there seems to be no limit to the number of '' senses '' in which a psychological division of this kind might result of these '' senses , '' the '' moral sense '' plays the most important part in hutcheson 's ethical system '' his principal design , '' he says in the preface to the two first treatises , '' is to show that human nature was not left quite indifferent in the affair of virtue , to form to itself observations concerning the advantage or disadvantage of actions , and accordingly to regulate its conduct '' passing over the appeal to final causes involved in this passage , as well as the assumption that the '' moral sense '' has had no growth or history , but was '' implanted '' in man exactly as found among the more civilized races ( an assumption common to both hutcheson and butler ) , his use of the term '' sense '' tends to obscure the real nature of the process of moral judgement for , as established by hume , this act consists of two parts : an act of deliberation leading to an intellectual judgement ; and a reflex feeling of satisfaction at actions we consider good , and of dissatisfaction at those we consider bad the test or criterion of right action is with hutcheson , as with shaftesbury , its tendency to promote the general welfare of mankind but surely , by the common consent of civilized men , prudence , temperance , cleanliness , industry , self-respect and , in general , the personal virtues '' , are regarded , and rightly regarded , as fitting objects of moral approbation but , in the synopsis metaphysicae , he touches on it in three places , briefly stating both sides of the question , but evidently inclining to what he designates as the opinion of the stoics , in opposition to what he designates as the opinion of the peripatetics this is substantially the same as the doctrine propounded by hobbes and locke ( to the latter of whom hutcheson refers in a note ) , namely that our will is determined by motives in conjunction with our general character and habit of mind , and that the only true liberty is the liberty of acting as we will , not the liberty of willing as we will the prominence given by these writers to the analysis of moral action and moral approbation with the attempt to discriminate the respective provinces of the reason and the emotions in these processes , is undoubtedly due to the influence of hutcheson thus , in stating his theory of the moral sense , hutcheson is peculiarly careful to repudiate the doctrine of innate ideas ( see , for instance , inquiry concerning moral good and evil , sect his speculations on this subject are contained in the inquiry concerning beauty , order , harmony and design , the first of the two treatises published in 1725 see also martineau , types of ethical theory ( london , 1902 ) ;

freegans ' goal of reduced participation in capitalism and tactics of recovering wasted goods shares elements with the diggers , an anarchist street theater group based in haight-ashbury in san francisco in the 1960s that organized free housing and clinics and gave away food rescue the word '' freegan '' itself was allegedly invented in 1994 by keith mchenry , the co-founder of food not bombs—an anarchist group that distributes free vegetarian meals as a protest against militarism and as a way of providing '' solidarity not charity '' —to refer to vegans who eat animal products if they find them in a dumpster studies usually find that most people that participate in practices associated with freeganism , such as dumpster diving for food , do so for economic reasons freegans are usually distinguished as being a subset of this population which has an ideological or political motivation for recovering waste or avoiding consumption , although some freegans also say that they do so for amusement , to acquire free goods , or out of religious conviction in many cases , though , freegans critique vegans by arguing that vegans ignore the environmental and labor impacts of the products they buy and corporate ownership of many vegan product lines freegans ' rejection of veganism is often tied to their discovery of food waste , estimated as up to 40 % of the food supply in the united states and other western countries for many , statistics about the ecological impacts of food waste—up to 12 % of global cropland and 23 % of global freshwater goes to produce food which is never consumed —serve as justification for a complete rejection of the capitalist food system moreover , the presence of food in supermarket dumpsters shows , according to some freegans , that the vegan theory of social change is flawed , because markets do not efficiently translate consumer preferences into changes in production freegans are best known for recovering discarded food from commercial establishments , a practice known as '' dumpster diving '' or '' urban foraging '' in north america , '' skipping '' , '' bin raiding '' , or '' skipitarianism '' in the uk , '' skip dipping '' in australia , '' containern '' in germany , or '' doing the duck '' in new zealand freegan diets are thus made possible by the range of practices that produce commercial food waste that is nonetheless still edible , such as conservative sell-by dates , the deliberate overstocking of certain perishable products ( like baked goods ) , or aesthetic criteria for fruits and vegetables however , dumpster diving is not limited to rummaging for food ; freegans report recovering clothing , books , appliances , bicycles , and furniture from commercial dumpsters as well although some freegans are reluctant to share their sites and strategies for '' urban foraging '' , others—like those in freegan.info—have organized public events to raise awareness of food waste and recruit other practitioners in new york city , freegan.info often distributes recovered food items for free in an ad-hoc manner after trash tours freeganism is also critiqued both by other radical movements and by mainstream commentators for the fact that its signature practice—dumpster diving—depends on the capitalist food system that freegans claim to be rejecting these actions could be seen as part of a broader criminalization of acts of survival—like sleeping in public places , sharing food without a permit , or recovering aluminum cans to re-sell—that has affected freegans as well as affiliated groups like food not bombs and the homeless other analyses of the origins of contemporary public policy initiatives around food waste have also concluded that freeganism contributed to new initiatives , like the french law on food waste or the u.s

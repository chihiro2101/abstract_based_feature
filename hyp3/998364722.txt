freegans ' goal of reduced participation in capitalism and tactics of recovering wasted goods shares elements with the diggers , an anarchist street theater group based in haight-ashbury in san francisco in the 1960s that organized free housing and clinics and gave away food rescue the word '' freegan '' itself was allegedly invented in 1994 by keith mchenry , the co-founder of food not bombs—an anarchist group that distributes free vegetarian meals as a protest against militarism and as a way of providing '' solidarity not charity '' —to refer to vegans who eat animal products if they find them in a dumpster studies usually find that most people that participate in practices associated with freeganism , such as dumpster diving for food , do so for economic reasons freegans are usually distinguished as being a subset of this population which has an ideological or political motivation for recovering waste or avoiding consumption , although some freegans also say that they do so for amusement , to acquire free goods , or out of religious conviction freeganism 's initial practitioners and forerunners like food not bombs were explicitly anti-capitalist , arguing that capitalism is responsible for excessive consumption , the abuse of human laborers and non-human animals , and the waste of resources freegan practices in theory reject the commoditization of basic necessities , the imperative of economic growth , and an economy based on money exchange rather than free gifting or sharing in many cases , though , freegans critique vegans by arguing that vegans ignore the environmental and labor impacts of the products they buy and corporate ownership of many vegan product lines freegans ' rejection of veganism is often tied to their discovery of food waste , estimated as up to 40 % of the food supply in the united states and other western countries for many , statistics about the ecological impacts of food waste—up to 12 % of global cropland and 23 % of global freshwater goes to produce food which is never consumed —serve as justification for a complete rejection of the capitalist food system freegans are best known for recovering discarded food from commercial establishments , a practice known as '' dumpster diving '' or '' urban foraging '' in north america , '' skipping '' , '' bin raiding '' , or '' skipitarianism '' in the uk , '' skip dipping '' in australia , '' containern '' in germany , or '' doing the duck '' in new zealand however , dumpster diving is not limited to rummaging for food ; freegans report recovering clothing , books , appliances , bicycles , and furniture from commercial dumpsters as well although some freegans are reluctant to share their sites and strategies for '' urban foraging '' , others—like those in freegan.info—have organized public events to raise awareness of food waste and recruit other practitioners the group freegan.info has made the disgust attached to wasted food part of its messaging , arguing that social disapprobation should instead fall on those who throw out food , rather than those who recover it a typical response is that freegan practices are not limited to dumpster diving , but include also actions like guerilla gardening , wild food foraging , or sewing or bike repair '' skill shares '' that are more fully autonomous from the conventional economy other analyses of the origins of contemporary public policy initiatives around food waste have also concluded that freeganism contributed to new initiatives , like the french law on food waste or the u.s fallingfruit.org/freegan—falling fruit 's global map of freegan resources trashwiki—freegan wiki-encyclopedia of dumpster-diving spots freegan.info—100 pages on freegan theory & practice with events and directories primarily in nyc freegan.at—austrian freegan page ( english version ) freegan ! me—a community and listing of resources for freegans around the world

freegans ' goal of reduced participation in capitalism and tactics of recovering wasted goods shares elements with the diggers , an anarchist street theater group based in haight-ashbury in san francisco in the 1960s that organized free housing and clinics and gave away food rescue the word '' freegan '' itself was allegedly invented in 1994 by keith mchenry , the co-founder of food not bombs—an anarchist group that distributes free vegetarian meals as a protest against militarism and as a way of providing '' solidarity not charity '' —to refer to vegans who eat animal products if they find them in a dumpster '' from 2005 , freegan.info organized regular events including sewing and bicycle workshops , wild food foraging expeditions , and '' trash tours '' —public dumpster dives open to the public and to media studies usually find that most people that participate in practices associated with freeganism , such as dumpster diving for food , do so for economic reasons freegans are usually distinguished as being a subset of this population which has an ideological or political motivation for recovering waste or avoiding consumption , although some freegans also say that they do so for amusement , to acquire free goods , or out of religious conviction freeganism 's initial practitioners and forerunners like food not bombs were explicitly anti-capitalist , arguing that capitalism is responsible for excessive consumption , the abuse of human laborers and non-human animals , and the waste of resources the word '' freegan '' originated as a play on the label '' veganism '' and research on freegan.info in new york found that most participants were vegetarian or vegan prior to becoming freegan freegans ' rejection of veganism is often tied to their discovery of food waste , estimated as up to 40 % of the food supply in the united states and other western countries freegan diets are thus made possible by the range of practices that produce commercial food waste that is nonetheless still edible , such as conservative sell-by dates , the deliberate overstocking of certain perishable products ( like baked goods ) , or aesthetic criteria for fruits and vegetables however , dumpster diving is not limited to rummaging for food ; freegans report recovering clothing , books , appliances , bicycles , and furniture from commercial dumpsters as well although some freegans are reluctant to share their sites and strategies for '' urban foraging '' , others—like those in freegan.info—have organized public events to raise awareness of food waste and recruit other practitioners just as freegans argue food waste should be recovered and redistributed , many argue that unoccupied buildings are a form of '' waste '' to be reclaimed contact with waste is seen as a taboo and socially unacceptable in most developed countries , and freegans are often associated with stigmatized and racialized groups like the homeless or even compared to scavenging '' pest '' animals like raccoons a typical response is that freegan practices are not limited to dumpster diving , but include also actions like guerilla gardening , wild food foraging , or sewing or bike repair '' skill shares '' that are more fully autonomous from the conventional economy other analyses of the origins of contemporary public policy initiatives around food waste have also concluded that freeganism contributed to new initiatives , like the french law on food waste or the u.s freegans : diving into the wealth of food waste in america

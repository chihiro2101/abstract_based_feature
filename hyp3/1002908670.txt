the lance ( greek : λόγχη , lonkhē ) is mentioned in the gospel of john , but not the synoptic gospels the gospel states that the romans planned to break jesus ' legs , a practice known as crurifragium , which was a method of hastening death during a crucifixion in most variants of the orthodox divine liturgy , the priest lances the host ( prosphora ) with a spear ( liturgy ) before it is divided in honor of the trinity , the theotokos ( virgin mary ) , and various other remembrances the deacon recites the relevant passage from the gospel of john , along with sections of the acts of the apostles dealing with commemoration of the saints in the miniature , the name loginos ( λογινοϲ ) is written in greek characters above the head of the soldier who is thrusting his lance into christ 's side there have been three or four major relics that are claimed to be the holy lance or parts of it a relic described as the holy lance in rome is preserved beneath the dome of saint peter 's basilica , although the catholic church makes no claim as to its authenticity a lance is mentioned in the so-called breviarius at the church of the holy sepulchre the alleged presence in jerusalem of the relic is attested by cassiodorus ( c according to the chronicon paschale , the point of the lance , which had been broken off , was given in the same year to nicetas , who took it to constantinople and deposited it in the church of hagia sophia , and later to the church of the virgin of the pharos as for the larger portion of the lance , arculpus claimed he saw it at the church of the holy sepulchre around 670 in jerusalem , but there is otherwise no mention of it after the sack in 615 at any rate , its presence at constantinople seems to be clearly attested by various pilgrims , particularly russians , and , though it was deposited in various churches in succession , it seems possible to trace it and distinguish it from the relic of the point '' the lance which pierced our lord 's side '' was among the relics at constantinople shown in the 1430s to pedro tafur , who added '' god grant that in the fall of constantinople they have not fallen into the hands of the ottoman empire , for they will have been ill-treated and handled with little reverence thusasne because of the presence of other rival lances in paris ( the point that had been separated from the lance ) , nuremberg ( see holy lance in vienna below ) , and armenia ( see holy lance in echmiadzin below ) in the tenth century , the holy roman emperors came into possession of the lance , according to sources from the time of otto i ( 912–973 ) it was only in the thirteenth century that the lance became identified with that of longinus , which had been used to pierce christ 's side and had been drenched in water and the blood of christ the manuscript does not specify precisely where it was kept , but the holy lance gives a description that exactly matches the lance , the monastery gate , since the thirteenth century precisely , the name of geghardavank ( monastery of the holy lance ) in the 18th century , roman cardinal benedict xiv claimed the antiochian lance was a fake having decided that the blood on the spear was that of the wounded saviour – jesus is never named in the opera – wagner has the blood manifest itself in the grail rather than on the spearhead

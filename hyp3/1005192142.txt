radio waves in the uhf band travel almost entirely by line-of-sight propagation ( los ) and ground reflection ; unlike in the hf band there is little to no reflection from the ionosphere ( skywave propagation ) , or ground wave since the wavelengths of uhf waves are comparable to the size of buildings , trees , vehicles and other common objects , reflection and diffraction from these objects can cause fading due to multipath propagation , especially in built-up urban areas since uhf transmission is limited by the visual horizon to 30–40 & nbsp ; miles ( 48–64 & nbsp ; km ) and usually to shorter distances by local terrain , it allows the same frequency channels to be reused by other users in neighboring geographic areas ( frequency reuse ) radio repeaters are used to retransmit uhf signals when a distance greater than the line of sight is required occasionally when conditions are right , uhf radio waves can travel long distances by tropospheric ducting as the atmosphere warms and cools throughout the day due to the short wavelengths , uhf antennas are conveniently stubby and short ; at uhf frequencies a monopole antenna , the most common omnidirectional antenna is between 2.5 and 25 & nbsp ; cm long uhf wavelengths are short enough that efficient transmitting antennas are small enough to mount on handheld and mobile devices , so these frequencies are used for two-way land mobile radio systems , such as walkie-talkies , two way radios in vehicles , and for portable wireless devices ; cordless phones and cell phones the short wavelengths also allow high gain antennas to be conveniently small high gain antennas for point-to-point communication links and uhf television reception are usually yagi , log periodic , corner reflectors , or reflective array antennas today , much of the bandwidth has been reallocated to land mobile , trunked radio and mobile telephone use 430–450 & nbsp ; mhz : amateur radio ( 70 & nbsp ; cm band ) 470–806 & nbsp ; mhz : terrestrial television ( with select channels in the 700 & nbsp ; mhz band left vacant ) 1452–1492 & nbsp ; mhz : digital audio broadcasting ( l band ) many other frequency assignments for canada and mexico are similar to their us counterparts 863 & ndash ; 865 & nbsp ; mhz : used for licence-exempt wireless systems 960 & ndash ; 1215 & nbsp ; mhz : aeronautical radionavigation 1240 & ndash ; 1300 & nbsp ; mhz : amateur radio ( 23 cm band ) 1300 & ndash ; 1350 & nbsp ; mhz : long range radar systems 1350 & ndash ; 1390 & nbsp ; mhz : military air traffic control and mobile telemetry systems at test ranges 1390 & ndash ; 1395 & nbsp ; mhz : proposed wireless medical telemetry service 1668.4 & ndash ; 1670 & nbsp ; mhz : radio astronomy observations a , b , c 15 & nbsp ; mhz ; d , e , f , g , h 5 & nbsp ; mhz 1920 & ndash ; 1930 & nbsp ; mhz : dect cordless telephone 1930 & ndash ; 2000 & nbsp ; mhz : pcs base stations—order is a , d , b , e , f , c , g , h blocks

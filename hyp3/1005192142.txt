radio waves in the uhf band travel almost entirely by line-of-sight propagation ( los ) and ground reflection ; unlike in the hf band there is little to no reflection from the ionosphere ( skywave propagation ) , or ground wave since the wavelengths of uhf waves are comparable to the size of buildings , trees , vehicles and other common objects , reflection and diffraction from these objects can cause fading due to multipath propagation , especially in built-up urban areas atmospheric moisture reduces , or attenuates , the strength of uhf signals over long distances , and the attenuation increases with frequency since uhf transmission is limited by the visual horizon to 30–40 & nbsp ; miles ( 48–64 & nbsp ; km ) and usually to shorter distances by local terrain , it allows the same frequency channels to be reused by other users in neighboring geographic areas ( frequency reuse ) occasionally when conditions are right , uhf radio waves can travel long distances by tropospheric ducting as the atmosphere warms and cools throughout the day due to the short wavelengths , uhf antennas are conveniently stubby and short ; at uhf frequencies a monopole antenna , the most common omnidirectional antenna is between 2.5 and 25 & nbsp ; cm long for television broadcasting specialized vertical radiators that are mostly modifications of the slot antenna or reflective array antenna are used : the slotted cylinder , zig-zag , and panel antennas since at uhf frequencies transmitting antennas are small enough to install on portable devices , the uhf spectrum is used worldwide for land mobile radio systems , two-way radios used for voice communication for commercial , industrial , public safety , and military purposes 430–450 & nbsp ; mhz : amateur radio ( 70 & nbsp ; cm band ) 470–806 & nbsp ; mhz : terrestrial television ( with select channels in the 700 & nbsp ; mhz band left vacant ) 1452–1492 & nbsp ; mhz : digital audio broadcasting ( l band ) many other frequency assignments for canada and mexico are similar to their us counterparts channels 49-60 are in the process of being cleared , to allow these channels to be allocated for 5g cellular communication , however , channels 55 and 56 are being used for com 7 and com 8 multiplexes for hd services the 2.45 & nbsp ; ghz frequency is the standard for use by microwave ovens , adjacent to the frequencies allocated for bluetooth network devices the spectrum from 806 & nbsp ; mhz to 890 & nbsp ; mhz ( uhf channels 70–83 ) was taken away from tv broadcast services in 1983 , primarily for analog mobile telephony the fcc has allowed americans to connect any device and any application to the 22 & nbsp ; mhz of radio spectrum that people are calling the 700 & nbsp ; mhz band 1668.4 & ndash ; 1670 & nbsp ; mhz : radio astronomy observations a , b , c 15 & nbsp ; mhz ; d , e , f , g , h 5 & nbsp ; mhz 1920 & ndash ; 1930 & nbsp ; mhz : dect cordless telephone 1930 & ndash ; 2000 & nbsp ; mhz : pcs base stations—order is a , d , b , e , f , c , g , h blocks

radio waves in the uhf band travel almost entirely by line-of-sight propagation ( los ) and ground reflection ; unlike in the hf band there is little to no reflection from the ionosphere ( skywave propagation ) , or ground wave uhf radio waves are blocked by hills and can not travel beyond the horizon , but can penetrate foliage and buildings for indoor reception since the wavelengths of uhf waves are comparable to the size of buildings , trees , vehicles and other common objects , reflection and diffraction from these objects can cause fading due to multipath propagation , especially in built-up urban areas atmospheric moisture reduces , or attenuates , the strength of uhf signals over long distances , and the attenuation increases with frequency since uhf transmission is limited by the visual horizon to 30–40 & nbsp ; miles ( 48–64 & nbsp ; km ) and usually to shorter distances by local terrain , it allows the same frequency channels to be reused by other users in neighboring geographic areas ( frequency reuse ) occasionally when conditions are right , uhf radio waves can travel long distances by tropospheric ducting as the atmosphere warms and cools throughout the day due to the short wavelengths , uhf antennas are conveniently stubby and short ; at uhf frequencies a monopole antenna , the most common omnidirectional antenna is between 2.5 and 25 & nbsp ; cm long uhf wavelengths are short enough that efficient transmitting antennas are small enough to mount on handheld and mobile devices , so these frequencies are used for two-way land mobile radio systems , such as walkie-talkies , two way radios in vehicles , and for portable wireless devices ; cordless phones and cell phones higher gain omnidirectional uhf antennas can be made of collinear arrays of dipoles and are used for mobile base stations and sector antenna high gain antennas for point-to-point communication links and uhf television reception are usually yagi , log periodic , corner reflectors , or reflective array antennas 430–450 & nbsp ; mhz : amateur radio ( 70 & nbsp ; cm band ) 470–806 & nbsp ; mhz : terrestrial television ( with select channels in the 700 & nbsp ; mhz band left vacant ) 1452–1492 & nbsp ; mhz : digital audio broadcasting ( l band ) many other frequency assignments for canada and mexico are similar to their us counterparts the 2.45 & nbsp ; ghz frequency is the standard for use by microwave ovens , adjacent to the frequencies allocated for bluetooth network devices the fcc has allowed americans to connect any device and any application to the 22 & nbsp ; mhz of radio spectrum that people are calling the 700 & nbsp ; mhz band 1395 & ndash ; 1400 & nbsp ; mhz : wireless medical telemetry service 1400 & ndash ; 1427 & nbsp ; mhz : earth exploration , radio astronomy , and space research 1427 & ndash ; 1432 & nbsp ; mhz : wireless medical telemetry service 1432 & ndash ; 1435 & nbsp ; mhz : proposed wireless medical telemetry service a , b , c 15 & nbsp ; mhz ; d , e , f , g , h 5 & nbsp ; mhz 1920 & ndash ; 1930 & nbsp ; mhz : dect cordless telephone 1930 & ndash ; 2000 & nbsp ; mhz : pcs base stations—order is a , d , b , e , f , c , g , h blocks

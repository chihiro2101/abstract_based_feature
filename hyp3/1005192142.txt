radio waves in the uhf band travel almost entirely by line-of-sight propagation ( los ) and ground reflection ; unlike in the hf band there is little to no reflection from the ionosphere ( skywave propagation ) , or ground wave since the wavelengths of uhf waves are comparable to the size of buildings , trees , vehicles and other common objects , reflection and diffraction from these objects can cause fading due to multipath propagation , especially in built-up urban areas since uhf transmission is limited by the visual horizon to 30–40 & nbsp ; miles ( 48–64 & nbsp ; km ) and usually to shorter distances by local terrain , it allows the same frequency channels to be reused by other users in neighboring geographic areas ( frequency reuse ) due to the short wavelengths , uhf antennas are conveniently stubby and short ; at uhf frequencies a monopole antenna , the most common omnidirectional antenna is between 2.5 and 25 & nbsp ; cm long uhf wavelengths are short enough that efficient transmitting antennas are small enough to mount on handheld and mobile devices , so these frequencies are used for two-way land mobile radio systems , such as walkie-talkies , two way radios in vehicles , and for portable wireless devices ; cordless phones and cell phones omnidirectional uhf antennas used on mobile devices are usually short whips , sleeve dipoles , rubber ducky antennas or the planar inverted f antenna ( pifa ) used in cellphones high gain antennas for point-to-point communication links and uhf television reception are usually yagi , log periodic , corner reflectors , or reflective array antennas since at uhf frequencies transmitting antennas are small enough to install on portable devices , the uhf spectrum is used worldwide for land mobile radio systems , two-way radios used for voice communication for commercial , industrial , public safety , and military purposes uhf cb ( land mobile service ) : 476–477 & nbsp ; mhz television broadcasting uses uhf channels between 503 and 694 & nbsp ; mhz fixed point-to-point link 450.4875 - 451.5125 & nbsp ; mhz land mobile service 457.50625 - 459.9875 & nbsp ; mhz mobile satellite service : 406.0000 - 406.1000 & nbsp ; mhz segment and service examples : land mobile for private , australian , state and territory government , rail industry and mobile-satellite 380 & ndash ; 399.9 & nbsp ; mhz : terrestrial trunked radio ( tetra ) service for emergency use 430 & ndash ; 440 & nbsp ; mhz : amateur radio ( 70 cm band ) 446.0 & ndash ; 446.2 & nbsp ; mhz : european unlicensed pmr service > pmr446 457 & ndash ; 464 & nbsp ; mhz : scanning telemetry and telecontrol , assigned mostly to the water , gas , and electricity industries 606 & ndash ; 614 & nbsp ; mhz : radio microphones and radio-astronomy 470 & ndash ; 862 & nbsp ; mhz : previously used for analogue tv channels 21–69 ( until 2012 ) 694-790 & nbsp ; mhz : i.e the spectrum from 806 & nbsp ; mhz to 890 & nbsp ; mhz ( uhf channels 70–83 ) was taken away from tv broadcast services in 1983 , primarily for analog mobile telephony 1395 & ndash ; 1400 & nbsp ; mhz : wireless medical telemetry service 1400 & ndash ; 1427 & nbsp ; mhz : earth exploration , radio astronomy , and space research 1427 & ndash ; 1432 & nbsp ; mhz : wireless medical telemetry service 1432 & ndash ; 1435 & nbsp ; mhz : proposed wireless medical telemetry service 1668.4 & ndash ; 1670 & nbsp ; mhz : radio astronomy observations a , b , c 15 & nbsp ; mhz ; d , e , f , g , h 5 & nbsp ; mhz 1920 & ndash ; 1930 & nbsp ; mhz : dect cordless telephone 1930 & ndash ; 2000 & nbsp ; mhz : pcs base stations—order is a , d , b , e , f , c , g , h blocks

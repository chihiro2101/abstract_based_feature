nearly all cell membranes in animals , plants and fungi maintain a voltage difference between the exterior and interior of the cell , called the membrane potential a typical voltage across an animal cell membrane is −70 mv in most types of cells , the membrane potential usually stays fairly constant in some types of electrically active cells , including neurons and muscle cells , the voltage fluctuations frequently take the form of a rapid upward spike followed by a rapid fall in muscle cells , a typical action potential lasts about a fifth of a second in some other types of cells and plants , an action potential may last three seconds or more the large membrane-embedded proteins , in contrast , provide channels through which ions can pass across the membrane action potentials are driven by channel proteins whose configuration switches between closed and open states as a function of the voltage difference between the interior and exterior of the cell these voltage-sensitive proteins are known as voltage-gated ion channels all cells in animal body tissues are electrically polarized – in other words , they maintain a voltage difference across the cell 's plasma membrane , known as the membrane potential this electrical polarization results from a complex interplay between protein structures embedded in the membrane called ion pumps and ion channels in neurons , the types of ion channels in the membrane usually vary across different parts of the cell , giving the dendrites , axon , and cell body different electrical properties action potentials are triggered when enough depolarization accumulates to bring the membrane potential up to threshold the shape of the action potential is stereotyped ; this means that the rise and fall usually have approximately the same amplitude and time course for all action potentials in a given cell action potentials result from the presence in a cell 's membrane of special types of voltage-gated ion channels ion channels switch between conformations at unpredictable times : the membrane potential determines the rate of transitions and the probability per unit time of each type of transition voltage-gated ion channels are capable of producing action potentials because they can give rise to positive feedback loops : the membrane potential controls the state of the ion channels , but the state of the ion channels controls the membrane potential thus , in some situations , a rise in the membrane potential can cause ion channels to open , thereby causing a further rise in the membrane potential the time and amplitude trajectory of the action potential are determined by the biophysical properties of the voltage-gated ion channels that produce it several types of channels capable of producing the positive feedback necessary to generate an action potential do exist the most intensively studied type of voltage-dependent ion channels comprises the sodium channels involved in fast nerve conduction when the membrane potential is low , the channel spends most of its time in the deactivated ( closed ) state if the membrane potential is raised above a certain level , the channel shows increased probability of transitioning to the activated ( open ) state it tends then to stay inactivated for some time , but , if the membrane potential becomes low again , the channel will eventually transition back to the deactivated state these equations have been extensively modified by later research , but form the starting point for most theoretical studies of action potential biophysics as the membrane potential is increased , sodium channel open , allowing the entry of sodium ions into the cell the sodium channels close at the peak of the action potential , while potassium continues to leave the cell the efflux of potassium ions decreases the membrane potential or hyperpolarizes the cell thus , the cell fires , producing an action potential neurotoxins aimed at the ion channels of insects have been effective insecticides ; one example is the synthetic permethrin , which prolongs the activation of the sodium channels involved in action potentials in 1902 and again in 1912 , julius bernstein advanced the hypothesis that the action potential resulted from a change in the permeation of the axonal membrane to ions julius bernstein was also the first to introduce the nernst equation for resting potential across the membrane ; this was generalized by david e

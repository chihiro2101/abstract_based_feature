nearly all cell membranes in animals , plants and fungi maintain a voltage difference between the exterior and interior of the cell , called the membrane potential in most types of cells , the membrane potential usually stays fairly constant some types of cells , however , are electrically active in the sense that their voltages fluctuate over time in some types of electrically active cells , including neurons and muscle cells , the voltage fluctuations frequently take the form of a rapid upward spike followed by a rapid fall in muscle cells , a typical action potential lasts about a fifth of a second in some other types of cells and plants , an action potential may last three seconds or more the large membrane-embedded proteins , in contrast , provide channels through which ions can pass across the membrane action potentials are driven by channel proteins whose configuration switches between closed and open states as a function of the voltage difference between the interior and exterior of the cell all cells in animal body tissues are electrically polarized – in other words , they maintain a voltage difference across the cell 's plasma membrane , known as the membrane potential in neurons , the types of ion channels in the membrane usually vary across different parts of the cell , giving the dendrites , axon , and cell body different electrical properties as a result , some parts of the membrane of a neuron may be excitable ( capable of generating action potentials ) , whereas others are not recent studies have shown that the most excitable part of a neuron is the part after the axon hillock ( the point where the axon leaves the cell body ) , which is called the initial segment , but the axon and cell body are also excitable in most cases each excitable patch of membrane has two important levels of membrane potential : the resting potential , which is the value the membrane potential maintains as long as nothing perturbs the cell , and a higher value called the threshold potential at the axon hillock of a typical neuron , the resting potential is around –70 millivolts ( mv ) and the threshold potential is around –55 mv synaptic inputs to a neuron cause the membrane to depolarize or hyperpolarize ; that is , they cause the membrane potential to rise or fall action potentials are triggered when enough depolarization accumulates to bring the membrane potential up to threshold the shape of the action potential is stereotyped ; this means that the rise and fall usually have approximately the same amplitude and time course for all action potentials in a given cell many types of neurons emit action potentials constantly at rates of up to 10–100 per second however , some types are much quieter , and may go for minutes or longer without emitting any action potentials action potentials result from the presence in a cell 's membrane of special types of voltage-gated ion channels a voltage-gated ion channel is a cluster of proteins embedded in the membrane that has three key properties : it is capable of assuming more than one conformation the transition between conformations is influenced by the membrane potential thus , in some situations , a rise in the membrane potential can cause ion channels to open , thereby causing a further rise in the membrane potential an action potential occurs when this positive feedback cycle ( hodgkin cycle ) proceeds explosively the time and amplitude trajectory of the action potential are determined by the biophysical properties of the voltage-gated ion channels that produce it several types of channels capable of producing the positive feedback necessary to generate an action potential do exist voltage-gated sodium channels are responsible for the fast action potentials involved in nerve conduction slower action potentials in muscle cells and some types of neurons are generated by voltage-gated calcium channels the inward flow of sodium ions increases the concentration of positively charged cations in the cell and causes depolarization , where the potential of the cell is higher than the cell 's resting potential the sodium channels close at the peak of the action potential , while potassium continues to leave the cell one function of action potentials is rapid , long-range signaling within the organism ; the conduction velocity can exceed 110 & nbsp ; m/s , which is one-third the speed of sound neurotoxins aimed at the ion channels of insects have been effective insecticides ; one example is the synthetic permethrin , which prolongs the activation of the sodium channels involved in action potentials

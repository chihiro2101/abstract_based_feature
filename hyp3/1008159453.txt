nearly all cell membranes in animals , plants and fungi maintain a voltage difference between the exterior and interior of the cell , called the membrane potential a typical voltage across an animal cell membrane is −70 mv in most types of cells , the membrane potential usually stays fairly constant in some types of electrically active cells , including neurons and muscle cells , the voltage fluctuations frequently take the form of a rapid upward spike followed by a rapid fall in some other types of cells and plants , an action potential may last three seconds or more the large membrane-embedded proteins , in contrast , provide channels through which ions can pass across the membrane action potentials are driven by channel proteins whose configuration switches between closed and open states as a function of the voltage difference between the interior and exterior of the cell all cells in animal body tissues are electrically polarized – in other words , they maintain a voltage difference across the cell 's plasma membrane , known as the membrane potential in neurons , the types of ion channels in the membrane usually vary across different parts of the cell , giving the dendrites , axon , and cell body different electrical properties each excitable patch of membrane has two important levels of membrane potential : the resting potential , which is the value the membrane potential maintains as long as nothing perturbs the cell , and a higher value called the threshold potential action potentials are triggered when enough depolarization accumulates to bring the membrane potential up to threshold the shape of the action potential is stereotyped ; this means that the rise and fall usually have approximately the same amplitude and time course for all action potentials in a given cell many types of neurons emit action potentials constantly at rates of up to 10–100 per second action potentials result from the presence in a cell 's membrane of special types of voltage-gated ion channels a voltage-gated ion channel is a cluster of proteins embedded in the membrane that has three key properties : it is capable of assuming more than one conformation at least one of the conformations creates a channel through the membrane that is permeable to specific types of ions the transition between conformations is influenced by the membrane potential voltage-gated ion channels are capable of producing action potentials because they can give rise to positive feedback loops : the membrane potential controls the state of the ion channels , but the state of the ion channels controls the membrane potential thus , in some situations , a rise in the membrane potential can cause ion channels to open , thereby causing a further rise in the membrane potential an action potential occurs when this positive feedback cycle ( hodgkin cycle ) proceeds explosively the time and amplitude trajectory of the action potential are determined by the biophysical properties of the voltage-gated ion channels that produce it slower action potentials in muscle cells and some types of neurons are generated by voltage-gated calcium channels the most intensively studied type of voltage-dependent ion channels comprises the sodium channels involved in fast nerve conduction it tends then to stay inactivated for some time , but , if the membrane potential becomes low again , the channel will eventually transition back to the deactivated state as the membrane potential is increased , sodium channel open , allowing the entry of sodium ions into the cell this is followed by the opening of potassium channel that permit the exit of potassium ions from the cell the inward flow of sodium ions increases the concentration of positively charged cations in the cell and causes depolarization , where the potential of the cell is higher than the cell 's resting potential the efflux of potassium ions decreases the membrane potential or hyperpolarizes the cell being an all-or-none signal that does not decay with transmission distance , the action potential has similar advantages to digital electronics in 1902 and again in 1912 , julius bernstein advanced the hypothesis that the action potential resulted from a change in the permeation of the axonal membrane to ions they made the first actual recording of the electrical changes across the neuronal membrane that mediate the action potential image : membranecircuit.svg thumb 336px right equivalent electrical circuit for the hodgkin–huxley model of the action potential

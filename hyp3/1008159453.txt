nearly all cell membranes in animals , plants and fungi maintain a voltage difference between the exterior and interior of the cell , called the membrane potential a typical voltage across an animal cell membrane is −70 mv in most types of cells , the membrane potential usually stays fairly constant in some types of electrically active cells , including neurons and muscle cells , the voltage fluctuations frequently take the form of a rapid upward spike followed by a rapid fall in muscle cells , a typical action potential lasts about a fifth of a second in some other types of cells and plants , an action potential may last three seconds or more these voltage-sensitive proteins are known as voltage-gated ion channels all cells in animal body tissues are electrically polarized – in other words , they maintain a voltage difference across the cell 's plasma membrane , known as the membrane potential in neurons , the types of ion channels in the membrane usually vary across different parts of the cell , giving the dendrites , axon , and cell body different electrical properties as a result , some parts of the membrane of a neuron may be excitable ( capable of generating action potentials ) , whereas others are not each excitable patch of membrane has two important levels of membrane potential : the resting potential , which is the value the membrane potential maintains as long as nothing perturbs the cell , and a higher value called the threshold potential synaptic inputs to a neuron cause the membrane to depolarize or hyperpolarize ; that is , they cause the membrane potential to rise or fall when an action potential is triggered , the membrane potential abruptly shoots upward and then equally abruptly shoots back downward , often ending below the resting level , where it remains for some period of time the shape of the action potential is stereotyped ; this means that the rise and fall usually have approximately the same amplitude and time course for all action potentials in a given cell action potentials result from the presence in a cell 's membrane of special types of voltage-gated ion channels a voltage-gated ion channel is a cluster of proteins embedded in the membrane that has three key properties : it is capable of assuming more than one conformation at least one of the conformations creates a channel through the membrane that is permeable to specific types of ions thus , a voltage-gated ion channel tends to be open for some values of the membrane potential , and closed for others ion channels switch between conformations at unpredictable times : the membrane potential determines the rate of transitions and the probability per unit time of each type of transition voltage-gated ion channels are capable of producing action potentials because they can give rise to positive feedback loops : the membrane potential controls the state of the ion channels , but the state of the ion channels controls the membrane potential thus , in some situations , a rise in the membrane potential can cause ion channels to open , thereby causing a further rise in the membrane potential an action potential occurs when this positive feedback cycle ( hodgkin cycle ) proceeds explosively voltage-gated sodium channels are responsible for the fast action potentials involved in nerve conduction slower action potentials in muscle cells and some types of neurons are generated by voltage-gated calcium channels the most intensively studied type of voltage-dependent ion channels comprises the sodium channels involved in fast nerve conduction as the membrane potential is increased , sodium channel open , allowing the entry of sodium ions into the cell the inward flow of sodium ions increases the concentration of positively charged cations in the cell and causes depolarization , where the potential of the cell is higher than the cell 's resting potential the sodium channels close at the peak of the action potential , while potassium continues to leave the cell the efflux of potassium ions decreases the membrane potential or hyperpolarizes the cell neurotoxins aimed at the ion channels of insects have been effective insecticides ; one example is the synthetic permethrin , which prolongs the activation of the sodium channels involved in action potentials i m and v m represent the current through , and the voltage across , a small patch of membrane , respectively the most important and accurate of the early neural models is the hodgkin–huxley model , which describes the action potential by a coupled set of four ordinary differential equations ( odes )

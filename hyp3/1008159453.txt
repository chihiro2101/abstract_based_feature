nearly all cell membranes in animals , plants and fungi maintain a voltage difference between the exterior and interior of the cell , called the membrane potential in most types of cells , the membrane potential usually stays fairly constant some types of cells , however , are electrically active in the sense that their voltages fluctuate over time in muscle cells , a typical action potential lasts about a fifth of a second the large membrane-embedded proteins , in contrast , provide channels through which ions can pass across the membrane action potentials are driven by channel proteins whose configuration switches between closed and open states as a function of the voltage difference between the interior and exterior of the cell these voltage-sensitive proteins are known as voltage-gated ion channels all cells in animal body tissues are electrically polarized – in other words , they maintain a voltage difference across the cell 's plasma membrane , known as the membrane potential as a result , some parts of the membrane of a neuron may be excitable ( capable of generating action potentials ) , whereas others are not each excitable patch of membrane has two important levels of membrane potential : the resting potential , which is the value the membrane potential maintains as long as nothing perturbs the cell , and a higher value called the threshold potential at the axon hillock of a typical neuron , the resting potential is around –70 millivolts ( mv ) and the threshold potential is around –55 mv synaptic inputs to a neuron cause the membrane to depolarize or hyperpolarize ; that is , they cause the membrane potential to rise or fall action potentials are triggered when enough depolarization accumulates to bring the membrane potential up to threshold the shape of the action potential is stereotyped ; this means that the rise and fall usually have approximately the same amplitude and time course for all action potentials in a given cell however , some types are much quieter , and may go for minutes or longer without emitting any action potentials action potentials result from the presence in a cell 's membrane of special types of voltage-gated ion channels thus , a voltage-gated ion channel tends to be open for some values of the membrane potential , and closed for others in most cases , however , the relationship between membrane potential and channel state is probabilistic and involves a time delay voltage-gated ion channels are capable of producing action potentials because they can give rise to positive feedback loops : the membrane potential controls the state of the ion channels , but the state of the ion channels controls the membrane potential thus , in some situations , a rise in the membrane potential can cause ion channels to open , thereby causing a further rise in the membrane potential the time and amplitude trajectory of the action potential are determined by the biophysical properties of the voltage-gated ion channels that produce it several types of channels capable of producing the positive feedback necessary to generate an action potential do exist voltage-gated sodium channels are responsible for the fast action potentials involved in nerve conduction the most intensively studied type of voltage-dependent ion channels comprises the sodium channels involved in fast nerve conduction when the membrane potential is low , the channel spends most of its time in the deactivated ( closed ) state if the membrane potential is raised above a certain level , the channel shows increased probability of transitioning to the activated ( open ) state it tends then to stay inactivated for some time , but , if the membrane potential becomes low again , the channel will eventually transition back to the deactivated state however , the likelihood of a channel 's transitioning from the inactivated state directly to the activated state is very low : a channel in the inactivated state is refractory until it has transitioned back to the deactivated state hodgkin and huxley approached the problem by developing a set of differential equations for the parameters that govern the ion channel states , known as the hodgkin–huxley model neurotoxins aimed at the ion channels of insects have been effective insecticides ; one example is the synthetic permethrin , which prolongs the activation of the sodium channels involved in action potentials in 1902 and again in 1912 , julius bernstein advanced the hypothesis that the action potential resulted from a change in the permeation of the axonal membrane to ions image : membranecircuit.svg thumb 336px right equivalent electrical circuit for the hodgkin–huxley model of the action potential

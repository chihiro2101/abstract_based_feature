nearly all cell membranes in animals , plants and fungi maintain a voltage difference between the exterior and interior of the cell , called the membrane potential in most types of cells , the membrane potential usually stays fairly constant in some types of electrically active cells , including neurons and muscle cells , the voltage fluctuations frequently take the form of a rapid upward spike followed by a rapid fall in muscle cells , a typical action potential lasts about a fifth of a second in some other types of cells and plants , an action potential may last three seconds or more all cells in animal body tissues are electrically polarized – in other words , they maintain a voltage difference across the cell 's plasma membrane , known as the membrane potential this electrical polarization results from a complex interplay between protein structures embedded in the membrane called ion pumps and ion channels as a result , some parts of the membrane of a neuron may be excitable ( capable of generating action potentials ) , whereas others are not each excitable patch of membrane has two important levels of membrane potential : the resting potential , which is the value the membrane potential maintains as long as nothing perturbs the cell , and a higher value called the threshold potential action potentials are triggered when enough depolarization accumulates to bring the membrane potential up to threshold the shape of the action potential is stereotyped ; this means that the rise and fall usually have approximately the same amplitude and time course for all action potentials in a given cell a voltage-gated ion channel is a cluster of proteins embedded in the membrane that has three key properties : it is capable of assuming more than one conformation at least one of the conformations creates a channel through the membrane that is permeable to specific types of ions the transition between conformations is influenced by the membrane potential thus , a voltage-gated ion channel tends to be open for some values of the membrane potential , and closed for others voltage-gated ion channels are capable of producing action potentials because they can give rise to positive feedback loops : the membrane potential controls the state of the ion channels , but the state of the ion channels controls the membrane potential thus , in some situations , a rise in the membrane potential can cause ion channels to open , thereby causing a further rise in the membrane potential an action potential occurs when this positive feedback cycle ( hodgkin cycle ) proceeds explosively the time and amplitude trajectory of the action potential are determined by the biophysical properties of the voltage-gated ion channels that produce it several types of channels capable of producing the positive feedback necessary to generate an action potential do exist voltage-gated sodium channels are responsible for the fast action potentials involved in nerve conduction slower action potentials in muscle cells and some types of neurons are generated by voltage-gated calcium channels the most intensively studied type of voltage-dependent ion channels comprises the sodium channels involved in fast nerve conduction the higher the membrane potential the greater the probability of activation during an action potential , most channels of this type go through a cycle deactivated→activated→inactivated→deactivated as the membrane potential is increased , sodium channel open , allowing the entry of sodium ions into the cell the sodium channels close at the peak of the action potential , while potassium continues to leave the cell for small voltage increases from rest , the potassium current exceeds the sodium current and the voltage returns to its normal resting value , typically −70 & nbsp ; mv however , if the voltage increases past a critical threshold , typically 15 & nbsp ; mv higher than the resting value , the sodium current dominates this results in a runaway condition whereby the positive feedback from the sodium current activates even more sodium channels one function of action potentials is rapid , long-range signaling within the organism ; the conduction velocity can exceed 110 & nbsp ; m/s , which is one-third the speed of sound in 1902 and again in 1912 , julius bernstein advanced the hypothesis that the action potential resulted from a change in the permeation of the axonal membrane to ions

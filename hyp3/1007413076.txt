there have been theatrical performances in stratford-upon-avon since at least shakespeare 's day , though the first recorded performance of a play written by shakespeare himself was in 1746 when parson joseph greene , master of stratford grammar school , organised a charitable production to fund the restoration of shakespeare 's funerary monument the first building erected to commemorate shakespeare was david garrick 's jubilee pavilion in 1769 , and there have been at least 17 buildings used to perform shakespeare 's plays since the first permanent commemorative building to shakespeare 's works in the town was a theatre built in 1827 , in the gardens of new place , but has long since been demolished the rsc 's history began with the shakespeare memorial theatre , which was the brainchild of a local brewer , charles edward flower the theatre , a victorian-gothic building seating just over 700 people , opened on 23 april 1879 , with a performance of much ado about nothing , a title which gave ammunition to several critics the memorial , a red brick gothic cathedral , designed by dodgshun and unsworth of westminster , was unkindly described by bernard shaw as '' an admirable building , adaptable to every purpose except that of a theatre '' from 1919 , under the direction of william bridges-adams and after a slow start , its resident new shakespeare company became one of the most prestigious in britain the theatre received a royal charter of incorporation in 1925 , which gave it status her modernist plans for an art deco structure came under fire from many directions but the new building was opened triumphantly on shakespeare 's birthday , 23 april 1932 timeline : 1932 – new shakespeare memorial theatre opens , abutting the remains of the old 1961 – chartered name of the corporation and the stratford theatre becomes ‘ royal shakespeare in 1959 , while still the director-designate of the memorial theatre , peter hall announced that the formation of a permanent company would be a primary objective the rsc was formally established on 20 march 1961 with the royal announcement that the shakespeare memorial theatre would henceforth be known as the royal shakespeare theatre and the company as the royal shakespeare company '' john barton had been appointed associate director in january 1960 , and was followed in 1962 by michel saint-denis , peter brook and clifford williams who joined the company as resident directors in 1962 , strong opposition to the establishment of a london base for the rsc came from the royal national theatre which – led by viscount chandos and laurence olivier – wished to be the sole subsidised company operating in london following a deal with prince littler , managing director of associated theatre properties , the rsc established the aldwych theatre as its london base for productions transferred from stratford to london , its stage redesigned to match the rst 's apron stage at the insistence of sir trevor nunn ( who had taken over as artistic director in 1968 ) , the company hired the place off the euston road in london and constructed its own theatre space for an audience of 330 , seated on raked wooden benches in december 1973 buzz goodbody , the company 's first female director , colin chambers inside the royal shakespeare company : creativity and the institution , abingdon : routledge , 2004 , p the name chosen for the new studio space was favoured within the company because it implied an alternative theatre , but also because it is a quotation from hamlet in august 1976 , nunn staged macbeth with a minimalist set at the other place , playing for 2 hours 15 minutes without an interval summing up this triumphant period , the guardian critic michael billington later wrote : '' in 1977 the rsc struck gold this was , in fact , the perihelion of trevor nunn 's ten-year reign as the company 's sole artistic director and chief executive ( in 1978 he began to share power with terry hands ) in march 2008 , the rsc launched a manifesto 'stand up for shakespeare ' , a campaign to promote a positive experience of shakespeare for children and young people the project began with shakespeare

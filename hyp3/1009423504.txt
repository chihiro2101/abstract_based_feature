most laestadians in finland are part of the national lutheran church of finland , but in america , where there is no official lutheran church , they founded their own denomination , which split into several sub-groups in the mid-20th century the three large main branches are conservative laestadianism ( corresponds to the laestadian lutheran church , in north america known to other laestadians as the '' heidemans '' after 20th-century leader paul a heideman ) ; the firstborn ( in north america , '' old apostolic lutheran church '' ( '' esikoinens '' to other laestadian denominations ) ; and rauhan sana ( '' word of peace '' ) , known in usa and canada as the apostolic lutheran church of america ( to other laestadians , the '' mickelsens '' after 20th-century leader reverend andrew mickelsen in finland , the elämän sana ( '' the word of life '' ) group , as the most '' mainline '' of the different branches of laestadianism , has been prominent within the hierarchy of the evangelical lutheran church of finland : two members have been elected bishops of oulu , and one has served as military bishop ( head chaplain of the finnish defence forces and the equivalent of a major general ) all branches share many essential teachings including a central emphasis on the lutheran doctrine of justification ( forgiveness and grace ) another core teaching concerns essential differences in lifestyle and beliefs between true believers on one hand , and false christians ( sometimes distinguished as living faith versus dead faith ) and unbelievers on the other the leadership of the smaller third main sub-group , the federation , has continued to regard the other sub-groups as of living faith , after having unsuccessfully sought to preserve unity within laestadianism when its larger counterparts ' leaders in the 1930s called for , and later required , dissociation from the federation and other laestadian denominations thus it is a common practice among laestadians in or out of church at any time , but especially during the church service prior to the rite of holy communion , to be confessing their sins to one another or , occasionally , to one of the church ministers performing the sacrament when greeting each other , laestadians say '' god 's peace '' in english ( or in finnish : '' jumalan tervehdys '' meaning god 's greeting or welcome ) '' worldliness '' is discouraged , and laestadians frown on pre-marital sex and on alcohol consumption except in the sacrament of holy communion conservative laestadians frown upon worldly vices such as dancing , television , birth control , rhythmic music , make-up , earrings , movies , tattoos , and cursing especially large numbers of firstborn apostolic lutherans and many members of the most conservative congregations within the word of peace group , for examples , do not use birth control because they believe that a child is a gift from god ; therefore , many laestadian families are large within firstborn laestadianism in scandinavia , the most important yearly events are the christmas services in gällivare and the midsummer services in lahti , where thousands of firstborn laestadians gather each year from different countries image : larslevilaestadius.jpg thumb left lars levi laestadius ( 1800–1861 ) the name of the movement stems from lars levi laestadius ( 1800–1861 ) , a swedes sámi preacher and administrator for the church of sweden in sápmi who was also a noted botanist laestadius started the movement when working as a pastor for the church of sweden in northern sweden in the 1840s laestadius met a sami woman named milla clementsdotter from föllinge in the municipality of krokom in jämtland during an 1844 inspection tour of åsele two great challenges laestadius had faced since his early days as a church minister were the indifference of his sámi parishioners , who had been forced by the swedish government to convert from their sami shamanism to lutheranism , and the misery caused them by alcoholism the spiritual understanding laestadius acquired and shared in his new sermons '' filled with vivid metaphors from the lives of the sami that they could understand , an account from the sámi cultural perspective recalls a new desire among the sámi to learn to read and a bustle and energy in the church , with people confessing their sins , crying and praying for forgiveness—within laestadianism this was known as liikutukset , a kind of ecstasy a faction within laestadianism has believed that the movement is a contemporary descendant of an unbroken line of living christianity via the moravian church , luther , the bohemian brethren , the lollards , and the waldensians all the way back to the primitive church ( first apostolic lutheran church ) , sweden and finland ( svr ) ) 5 file : family tree of laestadianism in sweden 2010.png family tree of laestadianism in sweden lars levi laestadius and the sami læstadianism and its role in the loss of the traditional sámi worldview , by viktor 'vulle ' cornell laestadianism lars levi laestadius and the revival in lapland , by warren h

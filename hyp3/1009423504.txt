most laestadians in finland are part of the national lutheran church of finland , but in america , where there is no official lutheran church , they founded their own denomination , which split into several sub-groups in the mid-20th century the three large main branches are conservative laestadianism ( corresponds to the laestadian lutheran church , in north america known to other laestadians as the '' heidemans '' after 20th-century leader paul a heideman ) ; the firstborn ( in north america , '' old apostolic lutheran church '' ( '' esikoinens '' to other laestadian denominations ) ; and rauhan sana ( '' word of peace '' ) , known in usa and canada as the apostolic lutheran church of america ( to other laestadians , the '' mickelsens '' after 20th-century leader reverend andrew mickelsen in finland , the elämän sana ( '' the word of life '' ) group , as the most '' mainline '' of the different branches of laestadianism , has been prominent within the hierarchy of the evangelical lutheran church of finland : two members have been elected bishops of oulu , and one has served as military bishop ( head chaplain of the finnish defence forces and the equivalent of a major general ) the leaders of the two largest laestadian sub-groups , the conservative laestadians and firstborn laestadians , have for decades excluded each other and all other laestadian sub-groups from the kingdom of heaven even though the denominations ' core doctrines are nearly indistinguishable laestadianism holds that when a christian has committed a sin , whether in thought or deed , she or he should confess the sin to another believer thus it is a common practice among laestadians in or out of church at any time , but especially during the church service prior to the rite of holy communion , to be confessing their sins to one another or , occasionally , to one of the church ministers performing the sacrament because a laestadian takes very seriously the proposition that grace exists only for one whose sins have been specifically forgiven , there is scarcely another rite in this movement that would rival the importance of the declaration of forgiveness especially large numbers of firstborn apostolic lutherans and many members of the most conservative congregations within the word of peace group , for examples , do not use birth control because they believe that a child is a gift from god ; therefore , many laestadian families are large within firstborn laestadianism in scandinavia , the most important yearly events are the christmas services in gällivare and the midsummer services in lahti , where thousands of firstborn laestadians gather each year from different countries the central association of the finnish associations of peace ( srk ) publishes a triple finnish translation ( 1776 , 1933/1938 , and 1992 ) that is used as both a study and a service bible by conservative laestadian preachers laestadius started the movement when working as a pastor for the church of sweden in northern sweden in the 1840s laestadius met a sami woman named milla clementsdotter from föllinge in the municipality of krokom in jämtland during an 1844 inspection tour of åsele she belonged to a revival movement within the church of sweden led by pastor pehr brandell of the parish of nora in the municipality of kramfors in ångermanland and characterized by pietistic and moravian influences she told laestadius about her spiritual experiences on her journey to a truly living christianity , and after the meeting laestadius felt he had come to understand the secret of living faith he had had a deep experience of having entered a state of grace , of having received god 's forgiveness for his sins and of at last truly seeing the path that leads to eternal life his sermons acquired , in his own words , '' a new kind of colour '' to which people began to respond the movement began to spread from sweden to finland and norway , particularly among the sámi and the kvens additionally , in the early days of the movement , laestadius , in order to find common ground with his parishioners , borrowed the sámis ’ own familiar pagan deities and concepts and adapted them to christianity ( old apostolic lutheran church ) , finland ( esikoislestadiolaiset ry ) , sweden , norway , russia , latvia ) 3 file : family tree of laestadianism in finland 6.png family tree of laestadianism in finland and karelia file : family tree of laestadianism in sweden 2010.png family tree of laestadianism in sweden lars levi laestadius and the sami læstadianism and its role in the loss of the traditional sámi worldview , by viktor 'vulle ' cornell laestadianism lars levi laestadius and the revival in lapland , by warren h

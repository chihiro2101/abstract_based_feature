organization in finland and north america most laestadians in finland are part of the national lutheran church of finland , but in america , where there is no official lutheran church , they founded their own denomination , which split into several sub-groups in the mid-20th century because of doctrinal opinion differences and personality conflicts , the movement split into 19 branches , of which about 15 are active today the three large main branches are conservative laestadianism ( corresponds to the laestadian lutheran church , in north america known to other laestadians as the '' heidemans '' after 20th-century leader paul a heideman ) ; the firstborn ( in north america , '' old apostolic lutheran church '' ( '' esikoinens '' to other laestadian denominations ) ; and rauhan sana ( '' word of peace '' ) , known in usa and canada as the apostolic lutheran church of america ( to other laestadians , the '' mickelsens '' after 20th-century leader reverend andrew mickelsen in finland , the elämän sana ( '' the word of life '' ) group , as the most '' mainline '' of the different branches of laestadianism , has been prominent within the hierarchy of the evangelical lutheran church of finland : two members have been elected bishops of oulu , and one has served as military bishop ( head chaplain of the finnish defence forces and the equivalent of a major general ) another core teaching concerns essential differences in lifestyle and beliefs between true believers on one hand , and false christians ( sometimes distinguished as living faith versus dead faith ) and unbelievers on the other the leaders of the two largest laestadian sub-groups , the conservative laestadians and firstborn laestadians , have for decades excluded each other and all other laestadian sub-groups from the kingdom of heaven even though the denominations ' core doctrines are nearly indistinguishable the church teaches that every believer has the authority to testify that others ' sins are forgiven , sometimes referred to as the audible declaration of the forgiveness of sins thus it is a common practice among laestadians in or out of church at any time , but especially during the church service prior to the rite of holy communion , to be confessing their sins to one another or , occasionally , to one of the church ministers performing the sacrament because a laestadian takes very seriously the proposition that grace exists only for one whose sins have been specifically forgiven , there is scarcely another rite in this movement that would rival the importance of the declaration of forgiveness conservative laestadians frown upon worldly vices such as dancing , television , birth control , rhythmic music , make-up , earrings , movies , tattoos , and cursing the central association of the finnish associations of peace ( srk ) publishes a triple finnish translation ( 1776 , 1933/1938 , and 1992 ) that is used as both a study and a service bible by conservative laestadian preachers image : larslevilaestadius.jpg thumb left lars levi laestadius ( 1800–1861 ) the name of the movement stems from lars levi laestadius ( 1800–1861 ) , a swedes sámi preacher and administrator for the church of sweden in sápmi who was also a noted botanist she belonged to a revival movement within the church of sweden led by pastor pehr brandell of the parish of nora in the municipality of kramfors in ångermanland and characterized by pietistic and moravian influences he had had a deep experience of having entered a state of grace , of having received god 's forgiveness for his sins and of at last truly seeing the path that leads to eternal life the movement began to spread from sweden to finland and norway , particularly among the sámi and the kvens he preferred his followers to be known simply as '' christians '' , but others started to call them '' laestadians another factor in the rise of laestadianism among the sámi was that the state-mandated boarding schools soon came to be populated by laestadian personnel finally , laestadianism was a faith that the sámi could identify as originating from within inasmuch as laestadius himself professed to have come to know the true living faith only upon his encounter with the poor abused sámi woman , milla clementsdotter ( apostolic lutheran church of america ) , sweden , norway , canada ( alc ) , guatemala , nigeria , india , togo ( alc ) and kenya ) 4 file : family tree of laestadianism in finland 6.png family tree of laestadianism in finland and karelia lars levi laestadius and the sami læstadianism and its role in the loss of the traditional sámi worldview , by viktor 'vulle ' cornell laestadianism lars levi laestadius and the revival in lapland , by warren h

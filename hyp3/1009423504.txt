most laestadians in finland are part of the national lutheran church of finland , but in america , where there is no official lutheran church , they founded their own denomination , which split into several sub-groups in the mid-20th century because of doctrinal opinion differences and personality conflicts , the movement split into 19 branches , of which about 15 are active today the three large main branches are conservative laestadianism ( corresponds to the laestadian lutheran church , in north america known to other laestadians as the '' heidemans '' after 20th-century leader paul a heideman ) ; the firstborn ( in north america , '' old apostolic lutheran church '' ( '' esikoinens '' to other laestadian denominations ) ; and rauhan sana ( '' word of peace '' ) , known in usa and canada as the apostolic lutheran church of america ( to other laestadians , the '' mickelsens '' after 20th-century leader reverend andrew mickelsen another core teaching concerns essential differences in lifestyle and beliefs between true believers on one hand , and false christians ( sometimes distinguished as living faith versus dead faith ) and unbelievers on the other the leaders of the two largest laestadian sub-groups , the conservative laestadians and firstborn laestadians , have for decades excluded each other and all other laestadian sub-groups from the kingdom of heaven even though the denominations ' core doctrines are nearly indistinguishable the church teaches that every believer has the authority to testify that others ' sins are forgiven , sometimes referred to as the audible declaration of the forgiveness of sins laestadianism holds that when a christian has committed a sin , whether in thought or deed , she or he should confess the sin to another believer thus it is a common practice among laestadians in or out of church at any time , but especially during the church service prior to the rite of holy communion , to be confessing their sins to one another or , occasionally , to one of the church ministers performing the sacrament because a laestadian takes very seriously the proposition that grace exists only for one whose sins have been specifically forgiven , there is scarcely another rite in this movement that would rival the importance of the declaration of forgiveness when greeting each other , laestadians say '' god 's peace '' in english ( or in finnish : '' jumalan tervehdys '' meaning god 's greeting or welcome ) '' worldliness '' is discouraged , and laestadians frown on pre-marital sex and on alcohol consumption except in the sacrament of holy communion some conservative elements within the church go even further in rejecting the ways of the world , for examples , refusing to buy insurance , prohibiting their children 's participation in organized school sports , and removing their car radios the central association of the finnish associations of peace ( srk ) publishes a triple finnish translation ( 1776 , 1933/1938 , and 1992 ) that is used as both a study and a service bible by conservative laestadian preachers image : larslevilaestadius.jpg thumb left lars levi laestadius ( 1800–1861 ) the name of the movement stems from lars levi laestadius ( 1800–1861 ) , a swedes sámi preacher and administrator for the church of sweden in sápmi who was also a noted botanist laestadius started the movement when working as a pastor for the church of sweden in northern sweden in the 1840s laestadius met a sami woman named milla clementsdotter from föllinge in the municipality of krokom in jämtland during an 1844 inspection tour of åsele she belonged to a revival movement within the church of sweden led by pastor pehr brandell of the parish of nora in the municipality of kramfors in ångermanland and characterized by pietistic and moravian influences another factor in the rise of laestadianism among the sámi was that the state-mandated boarding schools soon came to be populated by laestadian personnel ( apostolic lutheran church of america ) , sweden , norway , canada ( alc ) , guatemala , nigeria , india , togo ( alc ) and kenya ) 4 file : family tree of laestadianism in sweden 2010.png family tree of laestadianism in sweden file : family tree of laestadianism in norway.jpg family tree of laestadianism in norway lars levi laestadius and the sami læstadianism and its role in the loss of the traditional sámi worldview , by viktor 'vulle ' cornell laestadianism lars levi laestadius and the revival in lapland , by warren h

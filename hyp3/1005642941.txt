an '' informal discussion of the concepts and definitions '' in a working paper published by food and agriculture organization of the united nations in 2014 reviewed english , spanish and french definitions of the concept of '' family farm '' definitions referred to one or more of labor , management , size , provision of family livelihood , residence , family ties and generational aspects , community and social networks , subsistence orientation , patrimony , land ownership and family investment identifying the '' family farm '' – an informal discussion of the concepts and definitions the disparity of definitions reflects national and geographical differences in cultures , rural land tenure , and rural economies , as well as the different purposes for which definitions are coined the food and agriculture organization of the united nations defines a '' family farm '' as one that relies primarily on family members for labour and management in some usages , '' family farm '' implies that the farm remains within the ownership of a family over a number of generations being special-purpose definitions , the definitions found in laws or regulations may differ substantially from commonly understood meanings of '' family farm '' for example , in the united states , under federal farm ownership loan regulations , the definition of a '' family farm '' does not specify the nature of farm ownership , and management of the farm is either by the borrower , or by members operating the farm when a loan is made to a corporation , co-operative or other entity the complete definition can be found in the us code of federal regulations 7 cfr 1943.4 manorialism was characterised by the vesting of legal and economic power in a lord of the manor , supported economically from his own direct landholding in a manor ( sometimes called a fief ) , and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the peasant population under the jurisdiction of himself and his manorial court manorialism died slowly and piecemeal , along with its most vivid feature in the landscape , the open field system under the tenant system , a farm may be worked by the same family over many generations , but what is inherited is not the farm 's estate itself but the lease on the estate in much of europe , serfdom was abolished only in the modern period , in western europe after the french revolution , in russia serfdom in russia '' in the inheritance system known as salic patrimony ( also gavelkind in its exceptional survival in medieval kent ) refers to this clan-based possession of real estate property , particularly in germanic context much of germanic europe has a history of overlap or conflict between the feudal system of manoralism , where the estate is owned by noblemen and leased to the tenants or worked by serfs , and the germanic system of free farmers working landed estates heritable within their clan or family historical prevalence of the germanic system of independent estates or höfe resulted in dispersed settlement ( streusiedlung ) structure , as opposed to the village-centered settlements of manoralism höfeordnung is the german legal term for the inheritance laws regarding family farms , deriving from inheritance under medieval saxon law the family farms established in imperial russia were again collectivization in the soviet union , but the emigration of european farmers displaced by the industrial revolution contributed to the emergence of a system of family estates in the americas ( homestead act of 1862 ) it is in these nations very often a political rallying cry against change in agricultural policy , most commonly in france , japan , and the united states , where rural lifestyles are often regarded as desirable for example , pat buchanan and ralph nader , both candidates for the office of president of the united states , held rural rallies together and spoke for measures to preserve the so-called family farm the social roles of family farms are much changed today according to the united states department of agriculture , ninety-eight percent of all farms in the u.s two percent of farms are not family farms , and those two percent make up fourteen percent of total agricultural output in the united states , although half of them have total sales of less than 50,000 per year overall , ninety-one percent of farms in the united states are considered '' small family farms '' ( with sales of less than 250,000 per year ) , and those farms produce twenty-seven percent of u.s viable farms on a scale sufficient to support modern families at an income level commensurate with urban and suburban upper-middle-class families are often large scale operations , both in area and capital requirements these farms , family owned and operated in a technologically and economically conventional manner , produce crops and animal products oriented to national and international markets , rather than to local markets as fuel prices rise , foods shipped to national and international markets are already rising in price a usda survey conducted in 2011 estimated that family farms account for 85 percent of us farm production and 85 percent of us gross farm income large family farms ( gcfi 1,000,000 to 4,999,999 ) ; 2 percent of all us farms , 14 percent of total us farm area ; median net farm income 476,234 in canada , the number of '' family farms '' can not be inferred closely , because of the nature of census data , which do not distinguish family and non-family farm partnerships 2014 international year of family farming sub-saharan agriculture was mostly defined by slash-and-burn subsistence farming , historically spread by the bantu expansion '' in southern africa , '' on peasant family farms at the 66th session of the united nations general assembly , 2014 was formally declared to be the '' international year of family farming '' ( iyff )

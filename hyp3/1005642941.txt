it defines a farm as '' any place from which 1,000 or more of agricultural products were produced and sold , or normally would have been sold , during a given year the food and agriculture organization of the united nations defines a '' family farm '' as one that relies primarily on family members for labour and management in some usages , '' family farm '' implies that the farm remains within the ownership of a family over a number of generations being special-purpose definitions , the definitions found in laws or regulations may differ substantially from commonly understood meanings of '' family farm '' for example , in the united states , under federal farm ownership loan regulations , the definition of a '' family farm '' does not specify the nature of farm ownership , and management of the farm is either by the borrower , or by members operating the farm when a loan is made to a corporation , co-operative or other entity in the collapse of the western roman empire , the largely roman villa of the latifundia remained among the few political-cultural centres of a fragmented europe manorialism was characterised by the vesting of legal and economic power in a lord of the manor , supported economically from his own direct landholding in a manor ( sometimes called a fief ) , and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the peasant population under the jurisdiction of himself and his manorial court that law still retains many archaic terms and principles pertinent to a feudal social order under the tenant system , a farm may be worked by the same family over many generations , but what is inherited is not the farm 's estate itself but the lease on the estate in contrast to the roman system of latifundia and the derived system of manoralism , the germanic peoples had a system based on heritable estates owned by individual sibb '' in the inheritance system known as salic patrimony ( also gavelkind in its exceptional survival in medieval kent ) refers to this clan-based possession of real estate property , particularly in germanic context much of germanic europe has a history of overlap or conflict between the feudal system of manoralism , where the estate is owned by noblemen and leased to the tenants or worked by serfs , and the germanic system of free farmers working landed estates heritable within their clan or family the recharacterized compound bauernhof was formed in the early modern period to designate family farming estates , while meierhof designated a manorial estate , and the unmarked term hof was increasingly used for the royal or noble court the estate as a whole is referred to by the collective gehöft ( 15th century ) ; the corresponding slavic concept being khutor höfeordnung is the german legal term for the inheritance laws regarding family farms , deriving from inheritance under medieval saxon law mechanization enabled the cultivation of much larger areas than what was typical for the traditional estates aimed at subsistence farming , resulting in the emergence of a smaller number of large farms , with the displaced population partly contributing to the new class of wage labour and partly emigrating to the new world or the russian empire ( following the serfdom in russia ) the family farms established in imperial russia were again collectivization in the soviet union , but the emigration of european farmers displaced by the industrial revolution contributed to the emergence of a system of family estates in the americas ( homestead act of 1862 ) thomas jefferson 's argument that a large number of family estates are a factor in ensuring the stability of democracy was repeatedly used in support of subsidies it is in these nations very often a political rallying cry against change in agricultural policy , most commonly in france , japan , and the united states , where rural lifestyles are often regarded as desirable farm wives often need to find work away from the farm to supplement farm income and children sometimes have no interest in farming as their chosen field of work according to the united states department of agriculture , ninety-eight percent of all farms in the u.s overall , ninety-one percent of farms in the united states are considered '' small family farms '' ( with sales of less than 250,000 per year ) , and those farms produce twenty-seven percent of u.s farms : numbers , size , and ownership '' depending on the type and size of independently owned operation , some limiting factors are : economies of scale : larger farms are able to bargain more competitively , purchase more competitively , profit from economic highs , and weather lows more readily through monetary inertia than smaller farms technology user agreements : a less publicly known factor , patented ge seed that is widely used for many crops , like cotton and soy , comes with restrictions on use , which can even include who the crop can be sold to for example , on the small farming end , in many jurisdictions , there are severe limits or prohibitions on the sale of livestock , dairy and eggs mid-size and larger family farms account for 60 percent of us farm production and dominate us production of cotton , cash grain and hogs large family farms ( gcfi 1,000,000 to 4,999,999 ) ; 2 percent of all us farms , 14 percent of total us farm area ; median net farm income 476,234 about 98 percent of us family corporations owning farms are small , with no more than 10 shareholders ; average net farm income of family corporate farms was 189,400 in 2012 analysis of data for 59,000 farms in the 12 member states of the european community found that in 1989 , about three-quarters of the farms were family farms , producing just over half of total agricultural output

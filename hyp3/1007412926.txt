the existence of 36 righteous people is first mentioned in the talmud : : there are no less than 36 righteous people in the world who greet the shekhinah in each generation sanhedrin 97b , sukkah 45b another talmudic passage mentions the righteous people , most of them unknown , who sustain the world however , it gives a number other than 36 : : '' a homer of barley , and a half-homer of barley '' - this refers to 45 righteous who cause the world to be sustained chullin 92a these two sources were combined into the idea that the world is sustained by 36 righteous people the idea of 36 righteous became fully fleshed out in later generations : as a mystical concept , the number 36 is even more intriguing it is said that at all times there are 36 special people in the world , and that were it not for them , all of them , if even one of them was missing , the world would come to an end the two hebrew letters for 36 are the lamed , which is 30 , and the vav , which is 6 the baal shem tov wrote that '' just as there are 36 hidden righteous , there are 36 revealed righteous in fact , tradition has it that should a person claim to be one of the 36 , that is proof positive that they are certainly not one since the 36 are each exemplars of anavah , ( '' humility '' ) , having such a virtue would preclude against one ’ s self-proclamation of being among the special righteous lamedvavnik , is the yiddish term for one of the 36 humble righteous ones or tzadikim mentioned in kabbalah or jewish mysticism since nobody knows who the lamedvavniks are , not even themselves , every jew should act as if he or she might be one of them ; i.e it is also said that one of these 36 could potentially be the jewish messiah if the world is ready for them to reveal themselves in gematria ( a form of jewish numerology ) , the number 18 stands for '' life '' , because the hebrew letters that spell chai , meaning '' living '' , add up to 18 it is also possible for a lamedvavnik to reveal themselves as such , although that rarely happens—a lamedvavniks status as an exemplar of humility would preclude it jorge luis borges has an entry for the '' lamed wufniks '' in his book of imaginary beings ( 1957-1969 ) they are the secret kings and queens of this world '' with the implication that he was one of the tzadikim in the 1999 novel keeping faith by jodi picoult , the main character , faith white , is believed to be one of the lamed vovnik by rabbi solomon so what is the lesson ? the lesson is to treat each other.as if we might be one the 2019 novel “ 36 righteous men ” by best-selling author steven pressfield derives its title and some material from the idea of the lamed vav

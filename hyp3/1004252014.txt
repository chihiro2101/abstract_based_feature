in the same year , 45 families of the agro-pastoralist community in west of borama town lost 123 of their cattle which represented 41 % of the total cattle population of the community in 2011 , a severe long drought had hit the coastal districts lughaya , zeila districts for the last three years and affected the livelihood of pastoralists in these areas the drought has internally displaced 10,000 families of pastoralists fishers development sector '' ministry of national planning and development , awda '' p.47 the coast is about 300 & nbsp ; km long from sahil region in the east and republic of djibouti in the west the two districts of lughaya and zeila are coastal towns in the region and are respectively the capital cities of the two districts pastoralists depend on their animals for living and despise fishing as the livelihood of impoverished people that has no livestock of their own despite the vast marine resources available , as indicated in somaliland national development plan , fishing plays a very limited role in the economy of coastal towns second , the coastal towns have no easy access to major urban centers where demand for fish consumption is high the mountainous zone stretches east to west and in not less than 70 & nbsp ; km from coastal plains demand for fish has become higher since the livestock export ban was lifted in 2009 fourth , both zeila and lughaya occur on straight coastline without natural shelter , absence of fishing ports ( jetty ) and landing sites finally , the sector is constrained by the absence of institutional capacity including ice-making and fish storage facilities in coastal towns besides , availability of fishing gear , spare parts and lack of fishing gear repairs and maintenance skills are major bottlenecks of the fishing industry in the region since the collapse of socialist regime , industry and commerce sector '' ministry of national planning and development , awdal '' the low capital level categories include petty trading activities solely established to generate daily subsistence for their owner-managers and are not in the real sense of the word profit-oriented they are mostly dominated by female and a few male individuals and have no shop centers and are run in open air most of them are family owned or co-owned and managed by a group of individuals , have shop centers , licensed , involved in provisions of goods and services second , lack proximate port facilities in the coastal towns of lughaya and zeila cause high transportation cost of imported commodities mining development sector '' ministry of national planning and development , awda '' even the method of identifying the exact site to mine gemstones is very precarious it takes months to produce a hundred grams of gemstone and the amount of effort and money expended on its excavation often exceeds the income generated there are frequent conflicts , mismanagement , and theft among the groups the regional ministry of ministry of planning ( somaliland ) panning and development 55 '' ministry of national planning and development , somaliland '' the mandate of the ministry includes : • collection and analysis of data and other relevant information in collaboration with the regional offices and other sectors • registration of lngos working in the region and coordinating their development activities • coordination of the regional development activities of international and local organizations according to the regional development plan starting from the north along the sea is coastal zone which stretches from sahil region in the east to republic of djibouti in north west the coastal zone is brutally hot , sometimes more than 45-degree celsius , during the summer , from may to september , and receives lesser rain than other zones in the region this zone is locally known '' guban '' which means '' burned '' in english and its dwellers are called '' qorax-joog '' ( sun dwellers ) because of its low rainfall , the vegetation in coastal plains consists of different types of grasses and a few hardy scattered acacia trees all dry rivers from mountainous zone end up in coastal plains and during the rainy season runs -offs from mountainous zone end up in the low coastal plains and bring alluvial soil he also wrote about the rich vegetation and the presence of wild animals such as elephants , antelopes , lions , leopards , black panthers , and different types of birds next coastal zone in the south is the mountainous zone otherwise known golis the mountainous zone is 600 to 1000 meters above the sea level and gets gu‟ rains during the months of april to september some areas of this zone adjacent to coastal areas also get some of winter ( hais ) rains received by the coastal zone people in this zone were pastoralists and reared goats and sheep and a few camels with the introduction of farming , the livestock population has also declined as the wild animals it is an upland terrain ( plateau ) which is about 1100 to 1300 meters above the sea level and gets more rain during the gu‟ season the ogo zone is densely populated and suffered the worst environmental degradation the reserved lands were closed off during the rainy seasons and solely opened for livestock grazing during the dry season when pastures become scarce furthermore , the situation of the environment deteriorated further during the civil wars when law and order collapsed following the fall of the socialist regime as reported by the baki district commissioner , charcoal business is causing unprecedented environmental destruction in baki district every day about 15 trucks carrying hundreds of tones of charcoal head off for borama , gebilay , hargeisa , and zeila towns road sector '' ministry of national planning and development , awdal '' p.64 because of the topographical features of the region , road transport is an impediment to development of the region the topographical features of the region make road transport very discouraging : sandy coastal plains and range of mountains coastal plains are very sandy and a lot of dry rivers from mountains zone pass through coastal plains and have been depositing sands for centuries the coastal and mountainous zones are indeed economically very potential but are the least developed so far absence of serviceable inter-regional roads networks and feeders roads are the main challenges to the development of fisheries , agriculture , and mining sectors since zeila occurs in the coastal zone , it is very hot during the summer season and life is difficult without adequate water supply the mountainous zone consists of a string of mountains that extend east to west , south of the coastal zone the bore wells are practically owned by the operators , who fix the price of water for livestock and human consumption federico battera ( 2005 ) states about the awdal region : '' awdal is mainly inhabited by the gadabuursi confederation of clans the awdal region consists of four districts : borama district baki district lughaya district zeila district

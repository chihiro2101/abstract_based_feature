world vision in the same year , 45 families of the agro-pastoralist community in west of borama town lost 123 of their cattle which represented 41 % of the total cattle population of the community in 2011 , a severe long drought had hit the coastal districts lughaya , zeila districts for the last three years and affected the livelihood of pastoralists in these areas fishers development sector '' ministry of national planning and development , awda '' p.47 the coast is about 300 & nbsp ; km long from sahil region in the east and republic of djibouti in the west the two districts of lughaya and zeila are coastal towns in the region and are respectively the capital cities of the two districts with the exception of a few fishers in the coastal towns , most of the people in lughaya and zeila districts are pastoralists that rear camels , sheep and goats in the coastal plains pastoralists depend on their animals for living and despise fishing as the livelihood of impoverished people that has no livestock of their own despite the vast marine resources available , as indicated in somaliland national development plan , fishing plays a very limited role in the economy of coastal towns these topographical features of both zones severely discourage truck owners and , as a result , cause very high transportation charges and long travel duration fourth , both zeila and lughaya occur on straight coastline without natural shelter , absence of fishing ports ( jetty ) and landing sites finally , the sector is constrained by the absence of institutional capacity including ice-making and fish storage facilities in coastal towns p.50 the numbers and the scope businesses enterprises have spread dramatically like a bush fire most of them are involved in different types commercial activities such retailing , wholesaling , service provision their capital base varies from several thousand to several tens of thousands of us dollars they are a few in numbers and are involved in either service sector such as remittance , merchandising , import-export trading , or run small scale manufacturing industries despite the sector plays an important role in the economy of the region , it is constrained by , first , absence of financial institutions for financing existing and potential business opportunities second , lack proximate port facilities in the coastal towns of lughaya and zeila cause high transportation cost of imported commodities third , lack affordable energy discourages potential investment opportunities finally , the institutional capacity of the sector to provide necessary technical support services is missing the only mining activity in the region is gemstones mining development sector '' ministry of national planning and development , awda '' very few individuals buy stones from the miners and take to unreliable outside markets some individuals work together , sharing effort and costs , and equally any income generated the regional ministry of ministry of planning ( somaliland ) panning and development 55 '' ministry of national planning and development , somaliland '' is responsible for the implementation of national development policy in the region the mandate of the ministry includes : • collection and analysis of data and other relevant information in collaboration with the regional offices and other sectors • ensuring the implementation and supervision of a three-year regional development plan of sectors • registration of lngos working in the region and coordinating their development activities • coordination of the regional development activities of international and local organizations according to the regional development plan awdal environment protection region , '' ministry of national planning and development , awdal '' the coastal zone is brutally hot , sometimes more than 45-degree celsius , during the summer , from may to september , and receives lesser rain than other zones in the region this zone is locally known '' guban '' which means '' burned '' in english and its dwellers are called '' qorax-joog '' ( sun dwellers ) because of its low rainfall , the vegetation in coastal plains consists of different types of grasses and a few hardy scattered acacia trees he also wrote about the rich vegetation and the presence of wild animals such as elephants , antelopes , lions , leopards , black panthers , and different types of birds some areas of this zone adjacent to coastal areas also get some of winter ( hais ) rains received by the coastal zone the zone is also characterized by the existence of many dry rivers with running water streams throughout the year the third topographical zone in the region is the ogo zone which runs parallel next to mountainous zone in the south it is an upland terrain ( plateau ) which is about 1100 to 1300 meters above the sea level and gets more rain during the gu‟ season there had been three such sites in borama , jir-jir , libaaxley , and baki which were reserved for wildlife and livestock grazing the reserved lands were closed off during the rainy seasons and solely opened for livestock grazing during the dry season when pastures become scarce forester camps were also established for the protection wild animals and for maintenance of wildlife habitats furthermore , the situation of the environment deteriorated further during the civil wars when law and order collapsed following the fall of the socialist regime every day about 15 trucks carrying hundreds of tones of charcoal head off for borama , gebilay , hargeisa , and zeila towns p.64 because of the topographical features of the region , road transport is an impediment to development of the region the coastal and mountainous zones are indeed economically very potential but are the least developed so far absence of serviceable inter-regional roads networks and feeders roads are the main challenges to the development of fisheries , agriculture , and mining sectors public works , housing , and transport since the collapse of the late siyad barre regime in 1990 , most of the public buildings in all districts are occupied by idps and/or refugee returnees there had been a total of 64 of public offices and houses in the region ( 40 in borama , 12 in baki and 12 in lughaya ) like other regions , charcoal and fire woods are the main fuel sources utilized for household , businesses and other institutions that are involved in food services in the region as a result of this , the only reliable water sources in the coastal zones are strategically placed bore wells both for human and livestock consumption since zeila occurs in the coastal zone , it is very hot during the summer season and life is difficult without adequate water supply borama is the regional capital of the region and has the largest population in the region

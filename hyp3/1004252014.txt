in the same year , 45 families of the agro-pastoralist community in west of borama town lost 123 of their cattle which represented 41 % of the total cattle population of the community in 2011 , a severe long drought had hit the coastal districts lughaya , zeila districts for the last three years and affected the livelihood of pastoralists in these areas awdal is the third region that has the longest coastline in somaliland p.47 the coast is about 300 & nbsp ; km long from sahil region in the east and republic of djibouti in the west the two districts of lughaya and zeila are coastal towns in the region and are respectively the capital cities of the two districts pastoralists depend on their animals for living and despise fishing as the livelihood of impoverished people that has no livestock of their own despite the vast marine resources available , as indicated in somaliland national development plan , fishing plays a very limited role in the economy of coastal towns first the demand for fish consumption is very low in the coastal towns due to limited population densities , and as result of this , a very small number of artisan fishermen are engaged in subsistence type of fishing and use small boats just to feed their families and meet the available market the fishing communities in coastal towns of zeila and lughaya are separated from major towns in the region by sandy coastal plains which stretch more than 60 70 & nbsp ; km from the sea and more than 120 & nbsp ; km from east to west behind sandy coastal plains in the south , transportation in the mountainous zone , with deep gorges , valleys and dry river beds cutting deep in the zone , is very difficult and risky the mountainous zone stretches east to west and in not less than 70 & nbsp ; km from coastal plains these topographical features of both zones severely discourage truck owners and , as a result , cause very high transportation charges and long travel duration fourth , both zeila and lughaya occur on straight coastline without natural shelter , absence of fishing ports ( jetty ) and landing sites finally , the sector is constrained by the absence of institutional capacity including ice-making and fish storage facilities in coastal towns since the collapse of socialist regime , industry and commerce sector '' ministry of national planning and development , awdal '' the low capital level categories include petty trading activities solely established to generate daily subsistence for their owner-managers and are not in the real sense of the word profit-oriented their capital base varies from less than a hundred dollar to several hundred us dollars and can be classified as survival businesses the medium level enterprises have more capital bases than the low levels their capital base varies from several thousand to several tens of thousands of us dollars their capital is estimated to several hundred thousands of us dollars despite the sector plays an important role in the economy of the region , it is constrained by , first , absence of financial institutions for financing existing and potential business opportunities second , lack proximate port facilities in the coastal towns of lughaya and zeila cause high transportation cost of imported commodities third , lack affordable energy discourages potential investment opportunities finally , the institutional capacity of the sector to provide necessary technical support services is missing p53 many people are involved in mining gemstones in a very primitive manner even the method of identifying the exact site to mine gemstones is very precarious gemstone mining generates a limited but unreliable income for the miners it takes months to produce a hundred grams of gemstone and the amount of effort and money expended on its excavation often exceeds the income generated the regional ministry of ministry of planning ( somaliland ) panning and development 55 '' ministry of national planning and development , somaliland '' is responsible for the implementation of national development policy in the region the mandate of the ministry includes : • collection and analysis of data and other relevant information in collaboration with the regional offices and other sectors • registration of lngos working in the region and coordinating their development activities • coordination of the regional development activities of international and local organizations according to the regional development plan the coastal zone comprises sandy coastal plains that stretch up 70 & nbsp ; km south into mountainous zone , otherwise known golis range , which is about 500–1000 meters above the sea level the coastal zone is brutally hot , sometimes more than 45-degree celsius , during the summer , from may to september , and receives lesser rain than other zones in the region the coastal zone usually gets its rain during the winter season when other zones are in dry season because of its low rainfall , the vegetation in coastal plains consists of different types of grasses and a few hardy scattered acacia trees all dry rivers from mountainous zone end up in coastal plains and during the rainy season runs -offs from mountainous zone end up in the low coastal plains and bring alluvial soil a colonial governor from zeila travelled along the coastal zone in 1887and described the rich vegetations and heavy forests along the banks of dry rivers in the coastal plains , some of which with running streams the mountainous zone is 600 to 1000 meters above the sea level and gets gu‟ rains during the months of april to september some areas of this zone adjacent to coastal areas also get some of winter ( hais ) rains received by the coastal zone the zone is also characterized by the existence of many dry rivers with running water streams throughout the year with the introduction of farming , the livestock population has also declined as the wild animals the third topographical zone in the region is the ogo zone which runs parallel next to mountainous zone in the south p.64 because of the topographical features of the region , road transport is an impediment to development of the region it takes about 3 to 4 hours for a truck to travel from lughaya to zeila which is about 150 & nbsp ; km apart due to sandy plains and sandy dry river beds besides , the distance between zeila and borama is about 250 & nbsp ; km and it takes about 8 hours for a truck to travel between the two towns due to the poor condition of the road the coastal and mountainous zones are indeed economically very potential but are the least developed so far absence of serviceable inter-regional roads networks and feeders roads are the main challenges to the development of fisheries , agriculture , and mining sectors there are only 10 staff people in the region including a security guard at the present , and they share two available offices other districts do not have administration offices , nor other essential sector infrastructure the many attempts of forming public-private partnership ( ppp ) with private companies by borama municipality , representing borama power station , ended in vain starting from the northern part of the region along the sea is the coastal zone which is about 500 to 700 meters above the sea level besides human and livestock consumption , the water sources are used for the irrigation of fruit and vegetable farms borama is the regional capital of the region and has the largest population in the region

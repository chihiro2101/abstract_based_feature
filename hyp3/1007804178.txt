the stages of historical mongolic are : pre-proto-mongolic , from approximately the 4th century ad until the 12th century ad , influenced by common turkic , and previously by bulgar turkic proto-mongolic , from approximately the 13th century ad , spoken around the time of genghis khan it was introduced in the 1940s in the mongolian people 's republic under soviet influence , after a brief period where latin was used as the official script vovin ( 2018 ) suggests that the ruanruan language of the rouran khaganate was a mongolic language , close but not identical to middle mongolian the classification and numbers of speakers above follow janhunen ( 2006 ) except for southern mongolic , which follows nugteren ( 2011 ) ( 2005:193â€“194 ) there is a tendency to call central mongolian a language consisting of mongolian proper , oirat and buryat , while ordos ( and implicitly also khamnigan ) is seen as a variety of mongolian proper the mongolic languages , 364-390 proto-mongolic can be clearly identified chronologically with the language spoken by the mongols during genghis khan 's early expansion in the 1200-1210s in the case of early pre-proto-mongolic , certain loanwords in the mongolic languages point to early contact with oghur ( pre-proto-bulgaric ) turkic , also known as r-turkic proto-mongolic , the ancestor language of the modern mongolic languages , is very close to middle mongol , the language spoken at the time of genghis khan and the mongol empire an exception would be the voice suffix like -caga- 'do together ' , which can be reconstructed from the modern languages but is not attested in middle mongol juha janhunen ( 2006 ) classified the khitan language into the '' para-mongolic '' family , meaning that it is related to the mongolic languages as a sister group , rather than as a direct descendant of proto-mongolic

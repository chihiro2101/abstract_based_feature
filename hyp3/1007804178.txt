the stages of historical mongolic are : pre-proto-mongolic , from approximately the 4th century ad until the 12th century ad , influenced by common turkic , and previously by bulgar turkic proto-mongolic , from approximately the 13th century ad , spoken around the time of genghis khan after the mongolian democratic revolution in 1990 , the traditional mongolian script was considered to replace cyrillic , but this plan was not adopted contemporary mongolic languages are classified as follows vovin ( 2018 ) suggests that the ruanruan language of the rouran khaganate was a mongolic language , close but not identical to middle mongolian the classification and numbers of speakers above follow janhunen ( 2006 ) except for southern mongolic , which follows nugteren ( 2011 ) within mongolian proper , they then draw a distinction between khalkha on the one hand and southern mongolian ( containing everything else ) on the other hand the mongolic languages , 364-390 proto-mongolic , the ancestor language of the modern mongolic languages , is very close to middle mongol , the language spoken at the time of genghis khan and the mongol empire believed that at least some of their constituent tribes spoke a mongolian language , though there is still some argument that a particular variety of turkic may have been spoken among them juha janhunen ( 2006 ) classified the khitan language into the '' para-mongolic '' family , meaning that it is related to the mongolic languages as a sister group , rather than as a direct descendant of proto-mongolic vovin ( 2015 ) identified the extinct tuyuhun language as yet another para-mongolic language

cobe was an explorer class satellite , with technology borrowed heavily from iras , but with some unique characteristics cobe would have to operate for a minimum of 6 months , and constrain the amount of radio interference from the ground , cobe and other satellites as well as radiative interference from the earth , sun and moon the need to control systematic error in the measurement of the cmb anisotropy and measuring the zodiacal cloud at different elongation angles for subsequent modeling required that the satellite rotate at a 0.8 rpm spin rate the overriding considerations were the need for full sky coverage , the need to eliminate stray radiation from the instruments and the need to maintain thermal stability of the dewar and the instruments a 900 & nbsp ; km altitude orbit with a 99Â° inclination was chosen as it fit within the capabilities of either a shuttle ( with an auxiliary propulsion on cobe ) or a delta rocket the last two important parts pertaining to the cobe mission were the dewar and sun-earth shield the conical sun-earth shield protected the instruments from direct solar and earth based radiation as well as radio interference from earth and the cobe 's transmitting antenna the science mission was conducted by the three instruments detailed previously : dirbe , firas and the dmr cobe 's instruments would fulfill each of their objectives as well as making observations that would have implications outside cobe 's initial scope this finding would have been the detection of the black-body distribution of cmb that firas on cobe was to measure the dmr was able to spend four years mapping the detectable anisotropy of cosmic background radiation as it was the only instrument not dependent on the dewar 's supply of helium to keep it cooled on top of the findings dirbe had on galaxies , it also made two other significant contributions to science the exact star formation history can not unambiguously be resolved by cobe and further observations must be made in the future on june 30 , 2001 , nasa launched a follow-up mission to cobe led by dmr deputy principal investigator charles l

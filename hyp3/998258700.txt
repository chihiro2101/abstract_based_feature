cobe was an explorer class satellite , with technology borrowed heavily from iras , but with some unique characteristics cobe would have to operate for a minimum of 6 months , and constrain the amount of radio interference from the ground , cobe and other satellites as well as radiative interference from the earth , sun and moon the need to control systematic error in the measurement of the cmb anisotropy and measuring the zodiacal cloud at different elongation angles for subsequent modeling required that the satellite rotate at a 0.8 rpm spin rate a 900 & nbsp ; km altitude orbit with a 99Â° inclination was chosen as it fit within the capabilities of either a shuttle ( with an auxiliary propulsion on cobe ) or a delta rocket this altitude was a good compromise between earth 's radiation and the charged particle in earth 's radiation belts at higher altitudes the last two important parts pertaining to the cobe mission were the dewar and sun-earth shield the conical sun-earth shield protected the instruments from direct solar and earth based radiation as well as radio interference from earth and the cobe 's transmitting antenna cobe 's instruments would fulfill each of their objectives as well as making observations that would have implications outside cobe 's initial scope during the approximately 15-year-long period between the proposal and launch of cobe , there were two significant astronomical developments this finding would have been the detection of the black-body distribution of cmb that firas on cobe was to measure the cosmic microwave background fluctuations are extremely faint , only one part in 100,000 compared to the 2.73 kelvins average temperature of the radiation field cobe observations provide important constraints on the cosmic star formation rate , and help us calculate the ebl spectrum for various star formation histories on june 30 , 2001 , nasa launched a follow-up mission to cobe led by dmr deputy principal investigator charles l following wmap , the european space agency 's probe , planck has continued to increase the resolution at which the background has been mapped .

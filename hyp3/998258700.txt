cobe would have to operate for a minimum of 6 months , and constrain the amount of radio interference from the ground , cobe and other satellites as well as radiative interference from the earth , sun and moon the need to control systematic error in the measurement of the cmb anisotropy and measuring the zodiacal cloud at different elongation angles for subsequent modeling required that the satellite rotate at a 0.8 rpm spin rate the spin axis is also tilted back from the orbital velocity vector as a precaution against possible deposits of residual atmospheric gas on the optics as well against the infrared glow that would result from fast neutral particles hitting its surfaces at extremely high speed in order to meet the twin demands of slow rotation and three-axis attitude control , a sophisticated pair of yaw angular momentum wheels were employed with their axis oriented along the spin axis the overriding considerations were the need for full sky coverage , the need to eliminate stray radiation from the instruments and the need to maintain thermal stability of the dewar and the instruments the orbit combined with the spin axis made it possible to keep the earth and the sun continually below the plane of the shield , allowing a full sky scan every six months the conical sun-earth shield protected the instruments from direct solar and earth based radiation as well as radio interference from earth and the cobe 's transmitting antenna the science mission was conducted by the three instruments detailed previously : dirbe , firas and the dmr cobe 's instruments would fulfill each of their objectives as well as making observations that would have implications outside cobe 's initial scope the density ripples are believed to have produced structure formation as observed in the universe today : clusters of galaxies and vast regions devoid of galaxies ( nasa ) dirbe also detected 10 new far-ir emitting galaxies in the region not surveyed by iras as well as nine other candidates in the weak far-ir that may be spiral galaxies a direct measurement of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) can also provide important constraints on the integrated cosmological history of star formation , metal and dust production , and the conversion of starlight into infrared emissions by dust cobe observations provide important constraints on the cosmic star formation rate , and help us calculate the ebl spectrum for various star formation histories the exact star formation history can not unambiguously be resolved by cobe and further observations must be made in the future

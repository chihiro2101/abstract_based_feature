cobe was an explorer class satellite , with technology borrowed heavily from iras , but with some unique characteristics cobe would have to operate for a minimum of 6 months , and constrain the amount of radio interference from the ground , cobe and other satellites as well as radiative interference from the earth , sun and moon the overriding considerations were the need for full sky coverage , the need to eliminate stray radiation from the instruments and the need to maintain thermal stability of the dewar and the instruments a 900 & nbsp ; km altitude orbit with a 99Â° inclination was chosen as it fit within the capabilities of either a shuttle ( with an auxiliary propulsion on cobe ) or a delta rocket was chosen to allow cobe to follow the boundary between sunlight and darkness on earth throughout the year the last two important parts pertaining to the cobe mission were the dewar and sun-earth shield the conical sun-earth shield protected the instruments from direct solar and earth based radiation as well as radio interference from earth and the cobe 's transmitting antenna the instruments overlapped in wavelength coverage , providing consistency check on measurements in the regions of spectral overlap and assistance in discriminating signals from our galaxy , solar system and cmb cobe 's instruments would fulfill each of their objectives as well as making observations that would have implications outside cobe 's initial scope it was found that this cloud , which as seen from earth is zodiacal light , was not centered on the sun , as previously thought , but on a place in space a few million kilometers away a direct measurement of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) can also provide important constraints on the integrated cosmological history of star formation , metal and dust production , and the conversion of starlight into infrared emissions by dust cobe observations provide important constraints on the cosmic star formation rate , and help us calculate the ebl spectrum for various star formation histories the exact star formation history can not unambiguously be resolved by cobe and further observations must be made in the future on june 30 , 2001 , nasa launched a follow-up mission to cobe led by dmr deputy principal investigator charles l

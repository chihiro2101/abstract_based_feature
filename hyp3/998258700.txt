cobe was an explorer class satellite , with technology borrowed heavily from iras , but with some unique characteristics cobe would have to operate for a minimum of 6 months , and constrain the amount of radio interference from the ground , cobe and other satellites as well as radiative interference from the earth , sun and moon the overriding considerations were the need for full sky coverage , the need to eliminate stray radiation from the instruments and the need to maintain thermal stability of the dewar and the instruments a 900 & nbsp ; km altitude orbit with a 99Â° inclination was chosen as it fit within the capabilities of either a shuttle ( with an auxiliary propulsion on cobe ) or a delta rocket the dewar was a 650-liter superfluid helium cryostat designed to keep the firas and dirbe instruments cooled during the duration of the mission the conical sun-earth shield protected the instruments from direct solar and earth based radiation as well as radio interference from earth and the cobe 's transmitting antenna the science mission was conducted by the three instruments detailed previously : dirbe , firas and the dmr cobe 's instruments would fulfill each of their objectives as well as making observations that would have implications outside cobe 's initial scope this finding would have been the detection of the black-body distribution of cmb that firas on cobe was to measure with these developments serving as a backdrop to cobe 's mission , scientists eagerly awaited results from firas on top of the findings dirbe had on galaxies , it also made two other significant contributions to science cobe observations provide important constraints on the cosmic star formation rate , and help us calculate the ebl spectrum for various star formation histories on june 30 , 2001 , nasa launched a follow-up mission to cobe led by dmr deputy principal investigator charles l the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe has clarified and expanded upon cobe 's accomplishments

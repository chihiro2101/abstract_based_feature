cobe was an explorer class satellite , with technology borrowed heavily from iras , but with some unique characteristics cobe would have to operate for a minimum of 6 months , and constrain the amount of radio interference from the ground , cobe and other satellites as well as radiative interference from the earth , sun and moon the need to control systematic error in the measurement of the cmb anisotropy and measuring the zodiacal cloud at different elongation angles for subsequent modeling required that the satellite rotate at a 0.8 rpm spin rate the overriding considerations were the need for full sky coverage , the need to eliminate stray radiation from the instruments and the need to maintain thermal stability of the dewar and the instruments a 900 & nbsp ; km altitude orbit with a 99° inclination was chosen as it fit within the capabilities of either a shuttle ( with an auxiliary propulsion on cobe ) or a delta rocket the last two important parts pertaining to the cobe mission were the dewar and sun-earth shield the dewar was a 650-liter superfluid helium cryostat designed to keep the firas and dirbe instruments cooled during the duration of the mission the conical sun-earth shield protected the instruments from direct solar and earth based radiation as well as radio interference from earth and the cobe 's transmitting antenna cobe 's instruments would fulfill each of their objectives as well as making observations that would have implications outside cobe 's initial scope with these developments serving as a backdrop to cobe 's mission , scientists eagerly awaited results from firas a direct measurement of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) can also provide important constraints on the integrated cosmological history of star formation , metal and dust production , and the conversion of starlight into infrared emissions by dust by looking at the results from dirbe and firas in the 140 to 5000 μm we can detect that the integrated ebl intensity is ≈16 & nbsp ; nw/ ( m 2 ·sr ) cobe observations provide important constraints on the cosmic star formation rate , and help us calculate the ebl spectrum for various star formation histories the exact star formation history can not unambiguously be resolved by cobe and further observations must be made in the future

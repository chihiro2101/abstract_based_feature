sartre 's existentialism shares its philosophical starting point with rené descartes : the first thing we can be aware of is our existence , even when doubting everything else ( cogito ergo sum ) this dizziness occurs '' in the face of one 's freedom and responsibility for giving a meaning to reality '' 3-4 as an important break with descartes , sartre rejects the primacy of knowledge ( a rejection summed up in the phrase '' existence precedes essence '' ) and offers a different conception of knowledge and consciousness important ideas in being and nothingness build on edmund husserl 's phenomenology to both philosophers , consciousness is intentional , meaning that there is only consciousness of something for sartre , intentionality implies that there is no form of self that is hidden inside consciousness ( such as husserl 's transcendental ego ) an ego must be a structure outside consciousness , so that there can be consciousness of the ego in the introduction , sartre sketches his own theory of consciousness , being , and phenomena through criticism of both earlier phenomenologists ( most notably husserl and heidegger ) as well as idealism , rationalism , and empiricism while being-in-itself is something that can only be approximated by human being , being-for-itself is the being of consciousness from sartre 's phenomenological point of view , nothingness is an experienced reality and can not be a merely subjective mistake the absence of a friend and absence of money hint at a being of nothingness in the first chapter , sartre develops a theory of nothingness which is central to the whole book , especially to his account for bad faith and freedom though '' it is evident that non-being always appears within the limits of a human expectation '' , l'être et le néant , p not being able to see , is part of a totality : the life of the blind man in this world 58 in the totality of consciousness and phenomenon ( heidegger 's being-in-the-world ) , both can be considered separately , but exist only as a whole ( intentionality of consciousness ) the human attitude of inquiry , of asking questions , puts consciousness at distance from the world as bad faith , sartre describes one 's self-deception about the human reality , one must believe that their social role is equivalent to their human existence says sartre , '' i am never any one of my attitudes , any one of my actions yet , existents ( human beings ) must maintain a balance between existence , their roles , and nothingness to become authentic beings to live and project into the future as a project of a self , while keeping out of bad faith and living by the will of the self is living life authentically sartre has a very low opinion of conventional ethics , condemning it as a tool of the bourgeoisie to control the masses by viewing one 's ego as it once was rather than as it currently is , one ends up negating the current self and replacing it with a past self that no longer exists the mere possible presence of another person causes one to gaze and see one 's world as it appears to the other this transformation is most clear when one sees a mannequin that one confuses for a real person for a moment the other person is a '' threat to the order and arrangement of your whole world.your world is suddenly haunted by the other 's values , over which you have no control '' this is a state of emotional alienation whereby a person avoids experiencing their subjectivity by identifying themselves with '' the look '' of the other these relationships are a profound manifestation of '' bad faith '' as the for-itself is replaced with the other 's freedom sartre explains that '' the look '' is the basis for sexual desire , declaring that a biological motivation for sex does not exist this involves the mutual recognition of subjectivity of some sort , as sartre describes : '' i make myself flesh in order to impel the other to realize for herself and for me her own flesh my caress causes my flesh to be born for me insofar as it is for the other flesh causing her to be born as flesh it is this dichotomy that causes anguish , because choice ( subjectivity ) represents a limit on freedom within an otherwise unbridled range of thoughts however , sartre contends our conscious choices ( leading to often unconscious actions ) run counter to our intellectual freedom '' further : in other words , sartre views freud 's unconscious to be a scapegoat for the paradox of simultaneously knowing and not knowing the same information toward the end of being and nothingness , sartre attempts to adapt some of freud 's ideas , and thereby develop an '' existential psychoanalysis '' in which causal categories are replaced by teleological categories being and nothingness is considered sartre 's most important philosophical work , and the most important non-fiction expression of his existentialism davis credited sartre with being the first author to present

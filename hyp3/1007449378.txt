sartre 's existentialism shares its philosophical starting point with rené descartes : the first thing we can be aware of is our existence , even when doubting everything else ( cogito ergo sum ) this dizziness occurs '' in the face of one 's freedom and responsibility for giving a meaning to reality '' 3-4 as an important break with descartes , sartre rejects the primacy of knowledge ( a rejection summed up in the phrase '' existence precedes essence '' ) and offers a different conception of knowledge and consciousness important ideas in being and nothingness build on edmund husserl 's phenomenology to both philosophers , consciousness is intentional , meaning that there is only consciousness of something for sartre , intentionality implies that there is no form of self that is hidden inside consciousness ( such as husserl 's transcendental ego ) an ego must be a structure outside consciousness , so that there can be consciousness of the ego in the introduction , sartre sketches his own theory of consciousness , being , and phenomena through criticism of both earlier phenomenologists ( most notably husserl and heidegger ) as well as idealism , rationalism , and empiricism based on an examination of the nature of phenomena , he describes the nature of two types of being , being-in-itself ( the being of things ) and being-for-itself while being-in-itself is something that can only be approximated by human being , being-for-itself is the being of consciousness in the first chapter , sartre develops a theory of nothingness which is central to the whole book , especially to his account for bad faith and freedom though '' it is evident that non-being always appears within the limits of a human expectation '' , l'être et le néant , p the concrete nothingness differs from mere abstract inexistence , such as the square circle 58 in the totality of consciousness and phenomenon ( heidegger 's being-in-the-world ) , both can be considered separately , but exist only as a whole ( intentionality of consciousness ) '' for sartre , this is how nothingness can exist at all non-being can neither be part of the being-in-itself nor can it be as a complement of it as bad faith , sartre describes one 's self-deception about the human reality sartre , l'être et le néant , p , one must believe that their social role is equivalent to their human existence it is also essential for an existent to understand that negation allows the self to enter what sartre calls the '' great human stream '' nothingness , in terms of bad faith , is characterized by sartre as the internal negation which separates pure existence and identity , and thus we are subject to playing our lives out in a similar manner however , sartre takes a stance against characterizing bad faith in terms of '' mere social positions '' this literally means that , like the café waiter , the speaker is not his condition or social categorization , but is a speaker consumed by bad faith thus , we must realize what we are ( beings who exist ) and what we are not ( a social/historical preoccupation ) in order to step out of bad faith yet , existents ( human beings ) must maintain a balance between existence , their roles , and nothingness to become authentic beings additionally , an important tenet of bad faith is that we must enact a bit of '' good faith '' in order to take advantage of our role to reach an authentic existence to live and project into the future as a project of a self , while keeping out of bad faith and living by the will of the self is living life authentically being '' a moral person '' is one of the most severe forms of bad faith sartre essentially characterizes this as '' the faith of bad faith '' which is and should not be , in sartre 's opinion , at the heart of one 's existence by viewing one 's ego as it once was rather than as it currently is , one ends up negating the current self and replacing it with a past self that no longer exists in order to maintain the person 's own being , the person must control the other , but must also control the freedom of the other '' as freedom '' sartre believes that it is often created as a means of making the unbearable anguish of a person 's relationship to their '' facticity '' ( all of the concrete details against the background of which human freedom exists and is limited , such as birthplace and time ) bearable instead , '' double reciprocal incarnation '' is a form of mutual awareness which sartre takes to be at the heart of the sexual experience sartre thinks that the postulation of a censor within the psychic economy is therefore redundant : at the level of the censor , we still encounter the same problem of a consciousness that hides something from itself while marcel noted the influence of heidegger on '' the form at least '' of being and nothingness , he also observed that sartre diverged from the views expressed by heidegger in being and time ( 1927 ) in important ways , and that sartre 's contributions were original he wrote that sartre 's argument that freud 's theory of repression is internally flawed is based on a misunderstanding of freud , and that sartre 's attempts to adapt freud 's ideas are of greater interest sheets-johnstone believed sartre presented a subtle analysis of human sexuality bob zunjic : sartre 's being and

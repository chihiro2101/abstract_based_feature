sartre 's existentialism shares its philosophical starting point with rené descartes : the first thing we can be aware of is our existence , even when doubting everything else ( cogito ergo sum ) this dizziness occurs '' in the face of one 's freedom and responsibility for giving a meaning to reality '' 3-4 as an important break with descartes , sartre rejects the primacy of knowledge ( a rejection summed up in the phrase '' existence precedes essence '' ) and offers a different conception of knowledge and consciousness important ideas in being and nothingness build on edmund husserl 's phenomenology to both philosophers , consciousness is intentional , meaning that there is only consciousness of something for sartre , intentionality implies that there is no form of self that is hidden inside consciousness ( such as husserl 's transcendental ego ) an ego must be a structure outside consciousness , so that there can be consciousness of the ego in the introduction , sartre sketches his own theory of consciousness , being , and phenomena through criticism of both earlier phenomenologists ( most notably husserl and heidegger ) as well as idealism , rationalism , and empiricism while being-in-itself is something that can only be approximated by human being , being-for-itself is the being of consciousness from sartre 's phenomenological point of view , nothingness is an experienced reality and can not be a merely subjective mistake in the first chapter , sartre develops a theory of nothingness which is central to the whole book , especially to his account for bad faith and freedom 51-52 for him , nothingness is not just a mental concept that sums up negative judgements such as '' pierre is not here '' and '' i have no money '' though '' it is evident that non-being always appears within the limits of a human expectation '' , l'être et le néant , p not being able to see , is part of a totality : the life of the blind man in this world '' for sartre , this is how nothingness can exist at all by bringing nothingness into the world , consciousness does not annihilate the being of things , but changes its relation to it as bad faith , sartre describes one 's self-deception about the human reality 107-108 this essentially means that in being a waiter , grocer , etc , one must believe that their social role is equivalent to their human existence the great human stream arises from a singular realization that nothingness is a state of mind in which we can become anything , in reference to our situation , that we desire the difference between existence and identity projection remains at the heart of human subjects who are swept up by their own condition , their '' bad faith '' sartre consistently mentions that in order to get out of bad faith , one must realize that one 's existence and one 's formal projection of a self are distinctly separate and within the means of human control nothingness , in terms of bad faith , is characterized by sartre as the internal negation which separates pure existence and identity , and thus we are subject to playing our lives out in a similar manner an example is something that is what it is ( existence ) and something that is what it is not ( a waiter defined by his occupation ) says sartre , '' i am never any one of my attitudes , any one of my actions this literally means that , like the café waiter , the speaker is not his condition or social categorization , but is a speaker consumed by bad faith additionally , an important tenet of bad faith is that we must enact a bit of '' good faith '' in order to take advantage of our role to reach an authentic existence sartre essentially characterizes this as '' the faith of bad faith '' which is and should not be , in sartre 's opinion , at the heart of one 's existence bad faith also results when individuals begin to view their life as made up of distinct past events the mere possible presence of another person causes one to gaze and see one 's world as it appears to the other the world is now the other person 's world , a foreign world that no longer comes from the self , but from the other sartre explains that '' the look '' is the basis for sexual desire , declaring that a biological motivation for sex does not exist this involves the mutual recognition of subjectivity of some sort , as sartre describes : '' i make myself flesh in order to impel the other to realize for herself and for me her own flesh marcel considered sartre 's analysis of bad faith '' one of the most outstanding and solid '' parts of being and nothingness , writing that it prevented sartre 's arguments from being purely abstract the philosopher frederick copleston described sartre 's view that all human actions are the result of free choice as '' highly implausible '' , though he noted that sartre had ways of defending his position he also expressed sympathy for marcel 's criticism of sartre , and described sartre 's view of freedom as both '' nihilistic '' and possibly inconsistent with some of sartre 's other views davis credited sartre with being the first author to present a phenomenological analysis of sex naomi greene , arguing that there is a '' distaste for sexuality '' in sartre 's work , identifies a clear '' anti-sexual bias '' present in being and nothingness

this dizziness occurs '' in the face of one 's freedom and responsibility for giving a meaning to reality '' important ideas in being and nothingness build on edmund husserl 's phenomenology for sartre , intentionality implies that there is no form of self that is hidden inside consciousness ( such as husserl 's transcendental ego ) an ego must be a structure outside consciousness , so that there can be consciousness of the ego in the introduction , sartre sketches his own theory of consciousness , being , and phenomena through criticism of both earlier phenomenologists ( most notably husserl and heidegger ) as well as idealism , rationalism , and empiricism based on an examination of the nature of phenomena , he describes the nature of two types of being , being-in-itself ( the being of things ) and being-for-itself while being-in-itself is something that can only be approximated by human being , being-for-itself is the being of consciousness from sartre 's phenomenological point of view , nothingness is an experienced reality and can not be a merely subjective mistake in the first chapter , sartre develops a theory of nothingness which is central to the whole book , especially to his account for bad faith and freedom though '' it is evident that non-being always appears within the limits of a human expectation '' , l'être et le néant , p not being able to see , is part of a totality : the life of the blind man in this world 58 in the totality of consciousness and phenomenon ( heidegger 's being-in-the-world ) , both can be considered separately , but exist only as a whole ( intentionality of consciousness ) the human attitude of inquiry , of asking questions , puts consciousness at distance from the world '' for sartre , this is how nothingness can exist at all by bringing nothingness into the world , consciousness does not annihilate the being of things , but changes its relation to it it can take two forms , the first one is making oneself falsely believe not to be what one actually is the second one is conceiving oneself as an object ( e.g sartre , l'être et le néant , p , one must believe that their social role is equivalent to their human existence the difference between existence and identity projection remains at the heart of human subjects who are swept up by their own condition , their '' bad faith '' says sartre , '' i am never any one of my attitudes , any one of my actions '' the good speaker is the one who plays at speaking because he can not be speaking yet , existents ( human beings ) must maintain a balance between existence , their roles , and nothingness to become authentic beings additionally , an important tenet of bad faith is that we must enact a bit of '' good faith '' in order to take advantage of our role to reach an authentic existence one of the most important implications of bad faith is the abolition of traditional ethics being a '' moral person '' requires one to deny authentic impulses ( everything that makes us human ) and allow the will of another person to change one 's actions being '' a moral person '' is one of the most severe forms of bad faith sartre essentially characterizes this as '' the faith of bad faith '' which is and should not be , in sartre 's opinion , at the heart of one 's existence by viewing one 's ego as it once was rather than as it currently is , one ends up negating the current self and replacing it with a past self that no longer exists the mere possible presence of another person causes one to gaze and see one 's world as it appears to the other this is not done from a specific location outside oneself , but is non-positional these relationships are a profound manifestation of '' bad faith '' as the for-itself is replaced with the other 's freedom in sartre 's opinion , consciousness does not make sense by itself : it arises only as an awareness of objects instead of alleviating the paradox , freud simply moves it to the censor , establishing '' between the unconscious and consciousness an autonomous consciousness in bad faith '' marcel considered sartre 's analysis of bad faith '' one of the most outstanding and solid '' parts of being and nothingness , writing that it prevented sartre 's arguments from being purely abstract the author susan sontag praised sartre 's discussions of the body and concrete relations with others gonzalez-crussi credited sartre with recognizing that it is incorrect to equate sexual desire with desire for sexual acts naomi greene , arguing that there is a '' distaste for sexuality '' in sartre 's work , identifies a clear '' anti-sexual bias '' present in being and nothingness

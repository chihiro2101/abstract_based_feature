sartre 's existentialism shares its philosophical starting point with rené descartes : the first thing we can be aware of is our existence , even when doubting everything else ( cogito ergo sum ) in nausea , the main character 's feeling of dizziness towards his own existence is induced by things , not thinking this dizziness occurs '' in the face of one 's freedom and responsibility for giving a meaning to reality '' 3-4 as an important break with descartes , sartre rejects the primacy of knowledge ( a rejection summed up in the phrase '' existence precedes essence '' ) and offers a different conception of knowledge and consciousness to both philosophers , consciousness is intentional , meaning that there is only consciousness of something for sartre , intentionality implies that there is no form of self that is hidden inside consciousness ( such as husserl 's transcendental ego ) an ego must be a structure outside consciousness , so that there can be consciousness of the ego in the introduction , sartre sketches his own theory of consciousness , being , and phenomena through criticism of both earlier phenomenologists ( most notably husserl and heidegger ) as well as idealism , rationalism , and empiricism based on an examination of the nature of phenomena , he describes the nature of two types of being , being-in-itself ( the being of things ) and being-for-itself while being-in-itself is something that can only be approximated by human being , being-for-itself is the being of consciousness from sartre 's phenomenological point of view , nothingness is an experienced reality and can not be a merely subjective mistake in the first chapter , sartre develops a theory of nothingness which is central to the whole book , especially to his account for bad faith and freedom 58 in the totality of consciousness and phenomenon ( heidegger 's being-in-the-world ) , both can be considered separately , but exist only as a whole ( intentionality of consciousness ) '' for sartre , this is how nothingness can exist at all the relation between being-for-itself and being-in-itself is one of questioning the latter as bad faith , sartre describes one 's self-deception about the human reality the great human stream arises from a singular realization that nothingness is a state of mind in which we can become anything , in reference to our situation , that we desire nothingness , in terms of bad faith , is characterized by sartre as the internal negation which separates pure existence and identity , and thus we are subject to playing our lives out in a similar manner however , sartre takes a stance against characterizing bad faith in terms of '' mere social positions '' says sartre , '' i am never any one of my attitudes , any one of my actions this literally means that , like the café waiter , the speaker is not his condition or social categorization , but is a speaker consumed by bad faith yet , existents ( human beings ) must maintain a balance between existence , their roles , and nothingness to become authentic beings to live and project into the future as a project of a self , while keeping out of bad faith and living by the will of the self is living life authentically being a '' moral person '' requires one to deny authentic impulses ( everything that makes us human ) and allow the will of another person to change one 's actions sartre essentially characterizes this as '' the faith of bad faith '' which is and should not be , in sartre 's opinion , at the heart of one 's existence during this time one can no longer have a total subjectivity sartre states that many relationships are created by people 's attraction not to another person , but rather how that person makes them feel about themselves by how they look at them at its extreme , the alienation can become so intense that due to the guilt of being so radically enslaved by '' the look '' and therefore radically missing their own freedoms , the participants can experience sadomasochism attitudes sartre contends that human existence is a conundrum whereby each of us exists , for as long as we live , within an overall condition of nothingness ( no thing-ness ) —that ultimately allows for free consciousness it is this dichotomy that causes anguish , because choice ( subjectivity ) represents a limit on freedom within an otherwise unbridled range of thoughts however , sartre contends our conscious choices ( leading to often unconscious actions ) run counter to our intellectual freedom consciousness is therefore always and essentially consciousness of something , whether this '' something '' is a thing , a person , an imaginary object , etc sartre offers a critique of the psychoanalyst sigmund freud 's theory of the unconscious , based on the claim that consciousness is essentially self-conscious sartre states that '' consciousness is a being such that in its being , its being is in question insofar as this being implies a being other than itself being and nothingness is considered sartre 's most important philosophical work , and the most important non-fiction expression of his existentialism he criticized sartre for neglecting heidegger 's '' notion of the truth of being '' , his understanding of what it means for a subject or object to be he wrote that sartre 's argument that freud 's theory of repression is internally flawed is based on a misunderstanding of freud , and that sartre 's attempts to adapt freud 's ideas are of greater interest naomi greene , arguing that there is a '' distaste for sexuality '' in sartre 's work , identifies a clear '' anti-sexual bias '' present in being and nothingness

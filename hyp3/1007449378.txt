sartre 's existentialism shares its philosophical starting point with rené descartes : the first thing we can be aware of is our existence , even when doubting everything else ( cogito ergo sum ) this dizziness occurs '' in the face of one 's freedom and responsibility for giving a meaning to reality '' 3-4 as an important break with descartes , sartre rejects the primacy of knowledge ( a rejection summed up in the phrase '' existence precedes essence '' ) and offers a different conception of knowledge and consciousness important ideas in being and nothingness build on edmund husserl 's phenomenology to both philosophers , consciousness is intentional , meaning that there is only consciousness of something for sartre , intentionality implies that there is no form of self that is hidden inside consciousness ( such as husserl 's transcendental ego ) an ego must be a structure outside consciousness , so that there can be consciousness of the ego in the introduction , sartre sketches his own theory of consciousness , being , and phenomena through criticism of both earlier phenomenologists ( most notably husserl and heidegger ) as well as idealism , rationalism , and empiricism based on an examination of the nature of phenomena , he describes the nature of two types of being , being-in-itself ( the being of things ) and being-for-itself while being-in-itself is something that can only be approximated by human being , being-for-itself is the being of consciousness from sartre 's phenomenological point of view , nothingness is an experienced reality and can not be a merely subjective mistake in the first chapter , sartre develops a theory of nothingness which is central to the whole book , especially to his account for bad faith and freedom 58 in the totality of consciousness and phenomenon ( heidegger 's being-in-the-world ) , both can be considered separately , but exist only as a whole ( intentionality of consciousness ) '' for sartre , this is how nothingness can exist at all the relation between being-for-itself and being-in-itself is one of questioning the latter by bringing nothingness into the world , consciousness does not annihilate the being of things , but changes its relation to it as bad faith , sartre describes one 's self-deception about the human reality the second one is conceiving oneself as an object ( e.g sartre , l'être et le néant , p , one must believe that their social role is equivalent to their human existence it is also essential for an existent to understand that negation allows the self to enter what sartre calls the '' great human stream '' the difference between existence and identity projection remains at the heart of human subjects who are swept up by their own condition , their '' bad faith '' nothingness , in terms of bad faith , is characterized by sartre as the internal negation which separates pure existence and identity , and thus we are subject to playing our lives out in a similar manner however , sartre takes a stance against characterizing bad faith in terms of '' mere social positions '' says sartre , '' i am never any one of my attitudes , any one of my actions this literally means that , like the café waiter , the speaker is not his condition or social categorization , but is a speaker consumed by bad faith yet , existents ( human beings ) must maintain a balance between existence , their roles , and nothingness to become authentic beings being a '' moral person '' requires one to deny authentic impulses ( everything that makes us human ) and allow the will of another person to change one 's actions sartre essentially characterizes this as '' the faith of bad faith '' which is and should not be , in sartre 's opinion , at the heart of one 's existence the mere possible presence of another person causes one to gaze and see one 's world as it appears to the other this transformation is most clear when one sees a mannequin that one confuses for a real person for a moment objects now partly escape them ; they have aspects that belong to the other person , and that are thus unknowable to them the other person is a '' threat to the order and arrangement of your whole world.your world is suddenly haunted by the other 's values , over which you have no control '' this is back to the pre-reflective mode of being , it is '' the eye of the camera that is always present but is never seen '' sartre 's contribution , then , is that in addition to always being consciousness of something , consciousness is always consciousness of itself yet what does the resisting if the patients are unaware of what they are repressing ? sartre finds the answer in what freud calls the '' censor '' he has also credited sartre with providing a '' stunning apology for sado-masochism '' , and characterized being and nothingness as a '' great work of post-christian theology '' being and nothingness : an essay in phenomenological ontology , by jean-paul sartre , citadel press , 2001 class lecture notes on sartre 's being and nothingness by professor spade at indiana university

the development of the chemistry of boranes presented a number of challenges first , new laboratory techniques had to be developed to handle these often pyrophoric compounds the very reactive nature of the lower boranes meant that crystal structure determination was impossible before william lipscomb developed the requisite techniques polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory ( wade 's rules ) can be used to predict the structures of boranes interest in boranes increased during world war ii due to the potential of uranium borohydride for enrichment of the uranium isotopes in the us , a team led by schlesinger developed the basic chemistry of the boron hydrides and the related aluminium hydrides boranes are nonclassically–bonded compounds , that is , there are not enough electrons to form 2-centre , 2-electron bonds between all pairs of adjacent atoms in the molecule the reaction of some lower boranes with air is strongly exothermic ; those of b 2 h 6 and b 5 h 9 , for example , occur explosively except in very low concentration this does not result from any inherent instability in the boranes reaction of a borane with an alkyne can produce a carborane ; the icosahedral closo-carboranes c 2 b 10 h 12 , are particularly stable commercially available adducts such as borane–tetrahydrofuran or borane–dimethylsulfide are often used in this context as they have comparable effectiveness but without the hazard of handling highly reactive bh 3 itself

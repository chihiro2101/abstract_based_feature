the development of the chemistry of boranes presented a number of challenges first , new laboratory techniques had to be developed to handle these often pyrophoric compounds the very reactive nature of the lower boranes meant that crystal structure determination was impossible before william lipscomb developed the requisite techniques polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory ( wade 's rules ) can be used to predict the structures of boranes in the us , a team led by schlesinger developed the basic chemistry of the boron hydrides and the related aluminium hydrides although uranium borohydride was not utilized for isotopic separations , schlesinger 's work laid the foundation for a host of boron hydride reagents for organic synthesis , most of which were developed by his student herbert c boranes are nonclassically–bonded compounds , that is , there are not enough electrons to form 2-centre , 2-electron bonds between all pairs of adjacent atoms in the molecule a description of the bonding in the larger boranes was formulated by william lipscomb for example , in the icosahedral ion b 12 h 12 2- , the totally symmetric ( a g symmetry ) molecular orbital is equally distributed among all 12 boron atoms the molecule itself exists only transiently , dimerizing instantly to form diborane , b 2 h 6 , but its adducts bh 3 ·thf and bh 3 ·dmso are stable enough to be used in hydroboration reactions 177 , '' the concept of boranes as ligands '' , hapticity of η 1 to η 6 have been found , with electron donation involving bridging h atoms or donation from b-b bonds

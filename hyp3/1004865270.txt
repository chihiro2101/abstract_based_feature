the development of the chemistry of boranes presented a number of challenges first , new laboratory techniques had to be developed to handle these often pyrophoric compounds the very reactive nature of the lower boranes meant that crystal structure determination was impossible before william lipscomb developed the requisite techniques polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory ( wade 's rules ) can be used to predict the structures of boranes although uranium borohydride was not utilized for isotopic separations , schlesinger 's work laid the foundation for a host of boron hydride reagents for organic synthesis , most of which were developed by his student herbert c organic syntheses via boranes john wiley & sons , inc boranes are nonclassically–bonded compounds , that is , there are not enough electrons to form 2-centre , 2-electron bonds between all pairs of adjacent atoms in the molecule the reaction of some lower boranes with air is strongly exothermic ; those of b 2 h 6 and b 5 h 9 , for example , occur explosively except in very low concentration for example , : b 5 h 9 + nah → na ( b 5 h 8 ) + h 2 they can also act as weak acids reaction of a borane with an alkyne can produce a carborane ; the icosahedral closo-carboranes c 2 b 10 h 12 , are particularly stable 177 , '' the concept of boranes as ligands '' , hapticity of η 1 to η 6 have been found , with electron donation involving bridging h atoms or donation from b-b bonds

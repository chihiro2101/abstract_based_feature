the development of the chemistry of boranes presented a number of challenges first , new laboratory techniques had to be developed to handle these often pyrophoric compounds polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory ( wade 's rules ) can be used to predict the structures of boranes in the us , a team led by schlesinger developed the basic chemistry of the boron hydrides and the related aluminium hydrides although uranium borohydride was not utilized for isotopic separations , schlesinger 's work laid the foundation for a host of boron hydride reagents for organic synthesis , most of which were developed by his student herbert c organic syntheses via boranes john wiley & sons , inc boranes are nonclassically–bonded compounds , that is , there are not enough electrons to form 2-centre , 2-electron bonds between all pairs of adjacent atoms in the molecule for example , in the icosahedral ion b 12 h 12 2- , the totally symmetric ( a g symmetry ) molecular orbital is equally distributed among all 12 boron atoms the molecule itself exists only transiently , dimerizing instantly to form diborane , b 2 h 6 , but its adducts bh 3 ·thf and bh 3 ·dmso are stable enough to be used in hydroboration reactions the reaction of some lower boranes with air is strongly exothermic ; those of b 2 h 6 and b 5 h 9 , for example , occur explosively except in very low concentration 177 , '' the concept of boranes as ligands '' , hapticity of η 1 to η 6 have been found , with electron donation involving bridging h atoms or donation from b-b bonds

the development of the chemistry of boranes presented a number of challenges first , new laboratory techniques had to be developed to handle these often pyrophoric compounds the very reactive nature of the lower boranes meant that crystal structure determination was impossible before william lipscomb developed the requisite techniques lastly , once the structures were known it became clear that new theories of chemical bonding were needed to explain them polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory ( wade 's rules ) can be used to predict the structures of boranes organic syntheses via boranes john wiley & sons , inc boranes are nonclassically–bonded compounds , that is , there are not enough electrons to form 2-centre , 2-electron bonds between all pairs of adjacent atoms in the molecule a description of the bonding in the larger boranes was formulated by william lipscomb there are continuing efforts by theoretical chemists to improve the treatment of the bonding in boranes—an example is stone 's tensor surface harmonic treatment of cluster bonding other boranes are electrophilic and react vigorously with reagents that can supply electron pairs the main chemical application of boranes is the hydroboration reaction

the development of the chemistry of boranes presented a number of challenges the very reactive nature of the lower boranes meant that crystal structure determination was impossible before william lipscomb developed the requisite techniques polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory ( wade 's rules ) can be used to predict the structures of boranes interest in boranes increased during world war ii due to the potential of uranium borohydride for enrichment of the uranium isotopes although uranium borohydride was not utilized for isotopic separations , schlesinger 's work laid the foundation for a host of boron hydride reagents for organic synthesis , most of which were developed by his student herbert c borane clusters are classified as follows , where n is the number of boron atoms in a single cluster : pp 151-195 the iupac nomenclature of chemistry for systematic naming is based on a prefix denoting a class of compound , followed by the number of boron atoms and finally the number of hydrogen atoms in parentheses boranes are nonclassically–bonded compounds , that is , there are not enough electrons to form 2-centre , 2-electron bonds between all pairs of adjacent atoms in the molecule it involved : 3-center 2-electron b-h-b hydrogen bridges 3-center 2-electron b-b-b bonds 2-center 2-electron bonds ( in b-b , b-h and bh 2 ) lipscomb 's methodology has largely been superseded by a molecular orbital approach there are continuing efforts by theoretical chemists to improve the treatment of the bonding in boranes—an example is stone 's tensor surface harmonic treatment of cluster bonding 177 , '' the concept of boranes as ligands '' , hapticity of η 1 to η 6 have been found , with electron donation involving bridging h atoms or donation from b-b bonds commercially available adducts such as borane–tetrahydrofuran or borane–dimethylsulfide are often used in this context as they have comparable effectiveness but without the hazard of handling highly reactive bh 3 itself

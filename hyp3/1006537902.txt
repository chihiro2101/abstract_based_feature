at the start of the first world war , most combatants had little capability of flying at night , and little need to do so things changed on 22 september and 8 october 1914 , when the royal naval air service bombed the production line and hangars of the zeppelin facilities in cologne and düsseldorf the encyclopedia of world war i : a political , social and military history , volume 1 , spencer c ( santa barbara : abc-clio , 2005 ) , pp as early as 1915 , a number of b.e.2c aircraft ( the infamous '' fokker fodder '' ) were modified into the first night fighters after lack of success while using darts and small incendiary bombs to attack zeppelins from above , ultimately a lewis gun loaded with novel incendiary ammunition , was mounted at an angle of 45° to fire upwards , to attack the enemy from below after over a year of night zeppelin raids , on the night of 2–3 september 1916 , a be2c flown by captain leefe robinson downed the sl 11 , the first german airship to be shot down over britain this action won the pilot a victoria cross and cash prizes totaling £3,500 put up by a number of individuals because of airships ' limitations , the luftstreitkräfte began to introduce long-range heavy bombers , starting with the gotha g.iv aircraft that gradually took over the offensive to counter night attacks , sopwith camel day fighters were deployed in the night fighter role to provide suitable equipment for home defence squadrons in the north of the uk , avro 504k trainers were converted to night fighters by removing the front cockpit and mounting a lewis gun on the top wing in the meantime , aircraft performance had improved tremendously ; compared to their first world war counterparts , modern bombers could fly about twice as fast , at over twice the altitude , with much greater bomb loads at night , or with limited visibility , these problems were compounded the spanish republican air force used some polikarpov i-15s as night fighters pilot josé falcó had equipped his fighter with a radio receiver for land-based guidance for interception 30 rounds , scored a daylight double victory against bf 109s in the closing stages of the war during the 1930s , considerable development of infrared detectors occurred among all of the major forces , but in practice , these proved almost unusable the only such system to see any sort of widespread operational use was the spanner anlage system used on the dornier do 17z night fighters of the luftwaffe these were often also fitted with a large ir searchlight to improve the amount of light being returned the promising implications of the test were not lost on planners , who reorganised radar efforts and gave them increased priority the size of these early ai radars required a large aircraft to lift them , and their complex controls required a multiperson crew to operate them the war opened on 1 september 1939 , and by this time , the raf were well advanced with plans to build a radar – then called 'rdf ' in britain – equipped night-fighter fleet ii ) was being fit experimentally to a small number of bristol blenheim aircraft , having been selected for this role as its fuselage was sufficiently roomy to accommodate the additional crew member and radar apparatus ; moyes 1966 , p the first prototype system went into service in november 1939 , long before the opening of major british operations these early systems had significant practical problems , and while work was underway to correct these flaw , by the time the blitz opened in august 1940 , the night fighter fleet was still in its infancy through this period , the raf experimented with many other aircraft and interception methods in an effort to get a working night fighter force these turbinlite aircraft were intended to find the targets and illuminate them with the searchlight , allowing hurricanes adapted for night flying to shoot them down visually '' an improved method and means for intercepting night flying hostile aircraft '' gb patent 574970 , 29 january 1946 over the next few months , more and more beaufighters arrived and the success of the night fighters roughly doubled every month until may , when the luftwaffe ended their bombing efforts 100 group raf and fit with special systems , such as perfectos and serrate , for homing-in on german night fighters the searchlights were later supplanted with short-range radars that tracked both the fighters and bombers , allowing ground operators to direct the fighters to their targets jones , the raf changed their raid tactics to gather all of their bombers into a single '' stream '' german success against the raf plummeted , reaching a nadir on 30/31 may 1942 , when the first 1,000-bomber raid attacked cologne , losing only four aircraft to german night fighters the early lichtenstein b/c was replaced by the similar uhf-band lichtenstein c-1 , but when the german night fighter defected and landed in scotland in april 1943 , that radar was quickly jammed in this case , the fighters , typically focke-wulf fw 190s , were equipped only with a direction finder and landing lights to allow them to return to base at night both the british and germans spent some effort on the topic , but as the germans were on the defensive , their work was given a much higher priority however , the need for new designs was evident , and some low-level work started in the closing stages of the war , including the us contract for the northrop f-89 scorpion in canada , avro canada developed its own night fighter , the cf-100 canuck , which entered service with the royal canadian air force ( rcaf ) during 1952 the navy instead developed the grumman f-14 tomcat , which on top of the heavy phoenix , retained the phantom 's versatility and improved agility for dogfighting douglas p-70 bristol beaufighter ( british supplied ) grumman f6f hellcat lockheed p-38m '' night lightning '' northrop p-61 black widow vought f4u corsair

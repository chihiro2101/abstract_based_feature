at the start of the first world war , most combatants had little capability of flying at night , and little need to do so the only targets that could be attacked with any possibility of being hit in limited visibility would be cities , an unthinkable target at the time things changed on 22 september and 8 october 1914 , when the royal naval air service bombed the production line and hangars of the zeppelin facilities in cologne and düsseldorf as early as 1915 , a number of b.e.2c aircraft ( the infamous '' fokker fodder '' ) were modified into the first night fighters after over a year of night zeppelin raids , on the night of 2–3 september 1916 , a be2c flown by captain leefe robinson downed the sl 11 , the first german airship to be shot down over britain this downing was not an isolated victory ; five more german airships were similarly destroyed between october and december 1916 , and caused the airship campaign to gradually be diminished over the next year with fewer raids mounted '' the war in the air : bombers : germany , zeppelins because of airships ' limitations , the luftstreitkräfte began to introduce long-range heavy bombers , starting with the gotha g.iv aircraft that gradually took over the offensive while their early daylight raids in may 1917 were able to easily evade the weak defenses of london , the strengthening of the home defence fighter force led to the germans switching to night raids from 3 september 1917 to counter night attacks , sopwith camel day fighters were deployed in the night fighter role the camels ' vickers guns were replaced by lewis guns mounted over the wings , as the flash from the vickers tended to dazzle the pilot when they were fired , and synchronised guns were considered unsafe for firing incendiary ammunition they flew fast enough that the time between detecting them and the bombers reaching their targets left little time to launch interceptors to shoot them down antiaircraft guns were similarly affected by the altitudes at which they flew , which required extremely large and heavy guns to attack them , which limited the number available to the point of being rendered impotent at night , or with limited visibility , these problems were compounded pilot josé falcó had equipped his fighter with a radio receiver for land-based guidance for interception '' los chatos noctumos '' ( in spanish ) adar these were often also fitted with a large ir searchlight to improve the amount of light being returned realizing that radar was a far more practical solution to the problem , robert watson-watt handed the task of developing a radar suitable for aircraft use to 'taffy ' bowen in the mid-1930s in september 1937 , he gave a working demonstration of the concept when a test aircraft was able to detect three home fleet capital ships in the north sea in bad weather the promising implications of the test were not lost on planners , who reorganised radar efforts and gave them increased priority this led to efforts to develop an operational unit for airborne interception ( ai ) the size of these early ai radars required a large aircraft to lift them , and their complex controls required a multiperson crew to operate them the war opened on 1 september 1939 , and by this time , the raf were well advanced with plans to build a radar – then called 'rdf ' in britain – equipped night-fighter fleet the first prototype system went into service in november 1939 , long before the opening of major british operations these early systems had significant practical problems , and while work was underway to correct these flaw , by the time the blitz opened in august 1940 , the night fighter fleet was still in its infancy this coincided with the arrival of the beaufighter , which offered significantly higher performance than the pre-war blenheims ; it was the highest performance aircraft capable of carrying the bulky early airborne interception radars used for night fighter operations , and quickly became invaluable as a night fighter over the next few months , more and more beaufighters arrived and the success of the night fighters roughly doubled every month until may , when the luftwaffe ended their bombing efforts viii radar working in the microwave band , and the de havilland mosquito to mount it the mosquitos had little to do over the uk , so a number of squadrons were formed within no 100 group raf and fit with special systems , such as perfectos and serrate , for homing-in on german night fighters the british also experimented with mounting pilot-operated ai mark 6 radar sets in single-seat fighters , and the hurricane ii c ( nf ) , a dozen of which were produced in 1942 , became the first radar-equipped , single-seat night fighter in the world the searchlights were later supplanted with short-range radars that tracked both the fighters and bombers , allowing ground operators to direct the fighters to their targets by july 1940 , this system was well developed as the kammhuber line , and proved able to deal with the small raids by isolated bombers the raf was carrying out at the time this meant that the ground-based portion of the system was overwhelmed ; with only one or two searchlights or radars available per '' cell '' , the system was able to handle perhaps six interceptions per hour in 1942 , the germans first started deploying the initial b/c low uhf-band version of the lichtenstein radar , and in extremely limited numbers , using a 32-dipole element matratze ( mattress ) antenna array the early lichtenstein b/c was replaced by the similar uhf-band lichtenstein c-1 , but when the german night fighter defected and landed in scotland in april 1943 , that radar was quickly jammed an attack by a schräge musik-equipped fighter was typically a complete surprise to the bomber crew , who would only realise that a fighter was close by when they came under fire other forces did not have the pressing need to move to the jet engine ; britain and the us were facing enemies with aircraft of even lower performance than their existing night fighters in canada , avro canada developed its own night fighter , the cf-100 canuck , which entered service with the royal canadian air force ( rcaf ) during 1952 the similar mcdonnell douglas f/a-18 hornet in its cf-18 variant for the rcaf , was ordered with a 0.6 mcd night-identification light to enhance its night-interception capabilities douglas havoc ( us-built ) turbinlite ( us-built ) boulton paul defiant bristol beaufighter bristol blenheim de havilland mosquito fairey firefly

at the start of the first world war , most combatants had little capability of flying at night , and little need to do so the only targets that could be attacked with any possibility of being hit in limited visibility would be cities , an unthinkable target at the time the general assumption of a quick war meant no need existed for strategic attacks cooper , ralph , jean-claude cailliez and gian picco things changed on 22 september and 8 october 1914 , when the royal naval air service bombed the production line and hangars of the zeppelin facilities in cologne and düsseldorf after over a year of night zeppelin raids , on the night of 2–3 september 1916 , a be2c flown by captain leefe robinson downed the sl 11 , the first german airship to be shot down over britain this action won the pilot a victoria cross and cash prizes totaling £3,500 put up by a number of individuals while their early daylight raids in may 1917 were able to easily evade the weak defenses of london , the strengthening of the home defence fighter force led to the germans switching to night raids from 3 september 1917 the camels ' vickers guns were replaced by lewis guns mounted over the wings , as the flash from the vickers tended to dazzle the pilot when they were fired , and synchronised guns were considered unsafe for firing incendiary ammunition with little money to spend on development , especially during the great depression , night-fighting techniques changed little until just prior to world war ii in the meantime , aircraft performance had improved tremendously ; compared to their first world war counterparts , modern bombers could fly about twice as fast , at over twice the altitude , with much greater bomb loads they flew fast enough that the time between detecting them and the bombers reaching their targets left little time to launch interceptors to shoot them down 30 rounds , scored a daylight double victory against bf 109s in the closing stages of the war nevertheless , some new technologies appeared to offer potential ways to improve night-fighting capability during the 1930s , considerable development of infrared detectors occurred among all of the major forces , but in practice , these proved almost unusable the only such system to see any sort of widespread operational use was the spanner anlage system used on the dornier do 17z night fighters of the luftwaffe realizing that radar was a far more practical solution to the problem , robert watson-watt handed the task of developing a radar suitable for aircraft use to 'taffy ' bowen in the mid-1930s in september 1937 , he gave a working demonstration of the concept when a test aircraft was able to detect three home fleet capital ships in the north sea in bad weather the size of these early ai radars required a large aircraft to lift them , and their complex controls required a multiperson crew to operate them this naturally led to the use of light bombers as the preferred platform for airborne radars , and in may 1939 , the first experimental flight took place , on a fairey battle the war opened on 1 september 1939 , and by this time , the raf were well advanced with plans to build a radar – then called 'rdf ' in britain – equipped night-fighter fleet through this period , the raf experimented with many other aircraft and interception methods in an effort to get a working night fighter force one attempt to make up for the small number of working radars was to fit an ai to a douglas havoc bomber which also carried a searchlight in its nose by early 1941 , the first examples of a production-quality radar , ai mk this coincided with the arrival of the beaufighter , which offered significantly higher performance than the pre-war blenheims ; it was the highest performance aircraft capable of carrying the bulky early airborne interception radars used for night fighter operations , and quickly became invaluable as a night fighter viii radar working in the microwave band , and the de havilland mosquito to mount it the mosquitos had little to do over the uk , so a number of squadrons were formed within no 100 group raf and fit with special systems , such as perfectos and serrate , for homing-in on german night fighters marchant 1996 thomas 1996 a similarly radar-equipped hawker typhoon was also developed , but no production followed german airborne interception radar efforts at this point were about two years behind the british instead of airborne radar , they relied on ground-based systems ; the targets would first be picked up by radar assigned to a '' cell '' , the radar would then direct a searchlight to '' paint '' the target , allowing the fighters to attack them without on-board aids by july 1940 , this system was well developed as the kammhuber line , and proved able to deal with the small raids by isolated bombers the raf was carrying out at the time by flying all of the bombers over a cell in a short period , the vast majority of the bombers flew right over them without ever having been plotted , let alone attacked in 1942 , the germans first started deploying the initial b/c low uhf-band version of the lichtenstein radar , and in extremely limited numbers , using a 32-dipole element matratze ( mattress ) antenna array the luftwaffe also used single-engined aircraft in the night-fighter role , starting in 1939 with the arado ar 68 and early messerschmitt bf 109 models , which they later referred to as wilde sau ( wild boar ) the only purpose-built night fighter design deployed during the war , the american northrop p-61 black widow was introduced first in europe and then saw action in the pacific , but it was given such a low priority that the british had ample supplies of their own designs by the time it was ready for production colonel winston kratz , director of night-fighter training in the usaaf , considered the p-61 as adequate in its role , '' it was a good night fighter these types were also widely exported ; meteor night fighters were acquired by france , syria , egypt and israel amongst others more advanced night fighter models of the venom would follow , birtles 1999 , pp royal aircraft factory b.e.2 night fighter sopwith camel '' comic '' night fighter sopwith 1½ strutter supermarine nighthawk fiat cr.42 '' falco '' mávag héja messerschmitt bf 109f messerschmitt bf 110g-4d messerschmitt me 210ca-1/n

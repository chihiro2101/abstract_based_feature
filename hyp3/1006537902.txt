at the start of the first world war , most combatants had little capability of flying at night , and little need to do so the only targets that could be attacked with any possibility of being hit in limited visibility would be cities , an unthinkable target at the time the general assumption of a quick war meant no need existed for strategic attacks things changed on 22 september and 8 october 1914 , when the royal naval air service bombed the production line and hangars of the zeppelin facilities in cologne and düsseldorf the encyclopedia of world war i : a political , social and military history , volume 1 , spencer c as early as 1915 , a number of b.e.2c aircraft ( the infamous '' fokker fodder '' ) were modified into the first night fighters after over a year of night zeppelin raids , on the night of 2–3 september 1916 , a be2c flown by captain leefe robinson downed the sl 11 , the first german airship to be shot down over britain this action won the pilot a victoria cross and cash prizes totaling £3,500 put up by a number of individuals '' the war in the air : bombers : germany , zeppelins '' firstworldwar.com , 22 august 2009 while their early daylight raids in may 1917 were able to easily evade the weak defenses of london , the strengthening of the home defence fighter force led to the germans switching to night raids from 3 september 1917 to counter night attacks , sopwith camel day fighters were deployed in the night fighter role the camels ' vickers guns were replaced by lewis guns mounted over the wings , as the flash from the vickers tended to dazzle the pilot when they were fired , and synchronised guns were considered unsafe for firing incendiary ammunition the modified aircraft were nicknamed the '' sopwith comic '' to provide suitable equipment for home defence squadrons in the north of the uk , avro 504k trainers were converted to night fighters by removing the front cockpit and mounting a lewis gun on the top wing in the meantime , aircraft performance had improved tremendously ; compared to their first world war counterparts , modern bombers could fly about twice as fast , at over twice the altitude , with much greater bomb loads they flew fast enough that the time between detecting them and the bombers reaching their targets left little time to launch interceptors to shoot them down antiaircraft guns were similarly affected by the altitudes at which they flew , which required extremely large and heavy guns to attack them , which limited the number available to the point of being rendered impotent the spanish republican air force used some polikarpov i-15s as night fighters 30 rounds , scored a daylight double victory against bf 109s in the closing stages of the war the only such system to see any sort of widespread operational use was the spanner anlage system used on the dornier do 17z night fighters of the luftwaffe these were often also fitted with a large ir searchlight to improve the amount of light being returned in september 1937 , he gave a working demonstration of the concept when a test aircraft was able to detect three home fleet capital ships in the north sea in bad weather the size of these early ai radars required a large aircraft to lift them , and their complex controls required a multiperson crew to operate them the war opened on 1 september 1939 , and by this time , the raf were well advanced with plans to build a radar – then called 'rdf ' in britain – equipped night-fighter fleet ii ) was being fit experimentally to a small number of bristol blenheim aircraft , having been selected for this role as its fuselage was sufficiently roomy to accommodate the additional crew member and radar apparatus ; moyes 1966 , p the first prototype system went into service in november 1939 , long before the opening of major british operations these early systems had significant practical problems , and while work was underway to correct these flaw , by the time the blitz opened in august 1940 , the night fighter fleet was still in its infancy these turbinlite aircraft were intended to find the targets and illuminate them with the searchlight , allowing hurricanes adapted for night flying to shoot them down visually '' an improved method and means for intercepting night flying hostile aircraft although night bombing never ended , its intensity was greatly decreased , giving the raf time to introduce the ai mk viii radar working in the microwave band , and the de havilland mosquito to mount it 100 group raf and fit with special systems , such as perfectos and serrate , for homing-in on german night fighters marchant 1996 thomas 1996 a similarly radar-equipped hawker typhoon was also developed , but no production followed instead of airborne radar , they relied on ground-based systems ; the targets would first be picked up by radar assigned to a '' cell '' , the radar would then direct a searchlight to '' paint '' the target , allowing the fighters to attack them without on-board aids the searchlights were later supplanted with short-range radars that tracked both the fighters and bombers , allowing ground operators to direct the fighters to their targets other forces did not have the pressing need to move to the jet engine ; britain and the us were facing enemies with aircraft of even lower performance than their existing night fighters both the meteor and vampire conversions were rapidly followed by a more capable night fighter in the form of the de havilland venom , the first model of which having been introduced during 1953 the phantom was developed as the navy 's first supersonic , all-weather , radar-equipped fighter armed with radar-guided missiles the need for close-in dogfighting spelled the end for the specialised grumman f-111b , which was armed only with long-range aim-54 phoenix missiles for fleet defense against bombers the mcdonnell douglas f-15 eagle was also an interceptor with enhanced agility , but did not carry the phoenix in preference to the role of an air-superiority fighter

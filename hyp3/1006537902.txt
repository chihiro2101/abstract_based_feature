at the start of the first world war , most combatants had little capability of flying at night , and little need to do so the only targets that could be attacked with any possibility of being hit in limited visibility would be cities , an unthinkable target at the time the general assumption of a quick war meant no need existed for strategic attacks things changed on 22 september and 8 october 1914 , when the royal naval air service bombed the production line and hangars of the zeppelin facilities in cologne and düsseldorf the encyclopedia of world war i : a political , social and military history , volume 1 , spencer c after lack of success while using darts and small incendiary bombs to attack zeppelins from above , ultimately a lewis gun loaded with novel incendiary ammunition , was mounted at an angle of 45° to fire upwards , to attack the enemy from below after over a year of night zeppelin raids , on the night of 2–3 september 1916 , a be2c flown by captain leefe robinson downed the sl 11 , the first german airship to be shot down over britain this downing was not an isolated victory ; five more german airships were similarly destroyed between october and december 1916 , and caused the airship campaign to gradually be diminished over the next year with fewer raids mounted because of airships ' limitations , the luftstreitkräfte began to introduce long-range heavy bombers , starting with the gotha g.iv aircraft that gradually took over the offensive while their early daylight raids in may 1917 were able to easily evade the weak defenses of london , the strengthening of the home defence fighter force led to the germans switching to night raids from 3 september 1917 to counter night attacks , sopwith camel day fighters were deployed in the night fighter role the camels ' vickers guns were replaced by lewis guns mounted over the wings , as the flash from the vickers tended to dazzle the pilot when they were fired , and synchronised guns were considered unsafe for firing incendiary ammunition the modified aircraft were nicknamed the '' sopwith comic '' in the meantime , aircraft performance had improved tremendously ; compared to their first world war counterparts , modern bombers could fly about twice as fast , at over twice the altitude , with much greater bomb loads they flew fast enough that the time between detecting them and the bombers reaching their targets left little time to launch interceptors to shoot them down antiaircraft guns were similarly affected by the altitudes at which they flew , which required extremely large and heavy guns to attack them , which limited the number available to the point of being rendered impotent robinson 1988 , p pilot josé falcó had equipped his fighter with a radio receiver for land-based guidance for interception the only such system to see any sort of widespread operational use was the spanner anlage system used on the dornier do 17z night fighters of the luftwaffe in september 1937 , he gave a working demonstration of the concept when a test aircraft was able to detect three home fleet capital ships in the north sea in bad weather the promising implications of the test were not lost on planners , who reorganised radar efforts and gave them increased priority the war opened on 1 september 1939 , and by this time , the raf were well advanced with plans to build a radar – then called 'rdf ' in britain – equipped night-fighter fleet the airborne interception radar radar ( ai mk ii ) was being fit experimentally to a small number of bristol blenheim aircraft , having been selected for this role as its fuselage was sufficiently roomy to accommodate the additional crew member and radar apparatus ; moyes 1966 , p the first prototype system went into service in november 1939 , long before the opening of major british operations through this period , the raf experimented with many other aircraft and interception methods in an effort to get a working night fighter force these turbinlite aircraft were intended to find the targets and illuminate them with the searchlight , allowing hurricanes adapted for night flying to shoot them down visually '' an improved method and means for intercepting night flying hostile aircraft this proved almost impossible to arrange in practice , and the cat eye fighters had little luck during the closing months of 1940 this coincided with the arrival of the beaufighter , which offered significantly higher performance than the pre-war blenheims ; it was the highest performance aircraft capable of carrying the bulky early airborne interception radars used for night fighter operations , and quickly became invaluable as a night fighter over the next few months , more and more beaufighters arrived and the success of the night fighters roughly doubled every month until may , when the luftwaffe ended their bombing efforts this combination remained the premier night fighter until the end of the war german airborne interception radar efforts at this point were about two years behind the british the searchlights were later supplanted with short-range radars that tracked both the fighters and bombers , allowing ground operators to direct the fighters to their targets this meant that the ground-based portion of the system was overwhelmed ; with only one or two searchlights or radars available per '' cell '' , the system was able to handle perhaps six interceptions per hour by flying all of the bombers over a cell in a short period , the vast majority of the bombers flew right over them without ever having been plotted , let alone attacked for the fighter to find their targets , other aircraft , which were guided from the ground , would drop strings of flares in front of the bombers this innovation allowed the night fighters to approach and attack bombers from below , where they were outside the bomber crew 's field of view other forces did not have the pressing need to move to the jet engine ; britain and the us were facing enemies with aircraft of even lower performance than their existing night fighters however , as they continued to grow in capability , radar-equipped interceptors could take on the role of night fighters , thus the class went into decline in the us air force 's lightweight fighter program , the f-16 was originally envisaged as inexpensive day fighter , but quickly converted to an all-weather role

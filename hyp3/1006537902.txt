at the start of the first world war , most combatants had little capability of flying at night , and little need to do so the only targets that could be attacked with any possibility of being hit in limited visibility would be cities , an unthinkable target at the time the general assumption of a quick war meant no need existed for strategic attacks things changed on 22 september and 8 october 1914 , when the royal naval air service bombed the production line and hangars of the zeppelin facilities in cologne and düsseldorf the encyclopedia of world war i : a political , social and military history , volume 1 , spencer c as early as 1915 , a number of b.e.2c aircraft ( the infamous '' fokker fodder '' ) were modified into the first night fighters after lack of success while using darts and small incendiary bombs to attack zeppelins from above , ultimately a lewis gun loaded with novel incendiary ammunition , was mounted at an angle of 45° to fire upwards , to attack the enemy from below after over a year of night zeppelin raids , on the night of 2–3 september 1916 , a be2c flown by captain leefe robinson downed the sl 11 , the first german airship to be shot down over britain this action won the pilot a victoria cross and cash prizes totaling £3,500 put up by a number of individuals '' the war in the air : bombers : germany , zeppelins because of airships ' limitations , the luftstreitkräfte began to introduce long-range heavy bombers , starting with the gotha g.iv aircraft that gradually took over the offensive while their early daylight raids in may 1917 were able to easily evade the weak defenses of london , the strengthening of the home defence fighter force led to the germans switching to night raids from 3 september 1917 gray and thetford 1962 , p the camels ' vickers guns were replaced by lewis guns mounted over the wings , as the flash from the vickers tended to dazzle the pilot when they were fired , and synchronised guns were considered unsafe for firing incendiary ammunition to provide suitable equipment for home defence squadrons in the north of the uk , avro 504k trainers were converted to night fighters by removing the front cockpit and mounting a lewis gun on the top wing with little money to spend on development , especially during the great depression , night-fighting techniques changed little until just prior to world war ii at night , or with limited visibility , these problems were compounded the spanish republican air force used some polikarpov i-15s as night fighters one of the i-15s configured for night operations , fitted with tracer and explosive during the 1930s , considerable development of infrared detectors occurred among all of the major forces , but in practice , these proved almost unusable the only such system to see any sort of widespread operational use was the spanner anlage system used on the dornier do 17z night fighters of the luftwaffe initially , these systems were unwieldy , and development of ir systems continued realizing that radar was a far more practical solution to the problem , robert watson-watt handed the task of developing a radar suitable for aircraft use to 'taffy ' bowen in the mid-1930s in september 1937 , he gave a working demonstration of the concept when a test aircraft was able to detect three home fleet capital ships in the north sea in bad weather the promising implications of the test were not lost on planners , who reorganised radar efforts and gave them increased priority this naturally led to the use of light bombers as the preferred platform for airborne radars , and in may 1939 , the first experimental flight took place , on a fairey battle the war opened on 1 september 1939 , and by this time , the raf were well advanced with plans to build a radar – then called 'rdf ' in britain – equipped night-fighter fleet one attempt to make up for the small number of working radars was to fit an ai to a douglas havoc bomber which also carried a searchlight in its nose these turbinlite aircraft were intended to find the targets and illuminate them with the searchlight , allowing hurricanes adapted for night flying to shoot them down visually by early 1941 , the first examples of a production-quality radar , ai mk viii radar working in the microwave band , and the de havilland mosquito to mount it this combination remained the premier night fighter until the end of the war as the german effort wound down , the raf 's own bombing campaign was growing 100 group raf and fit with special systems , such as perfectos and serrate , for homing-in on german night fighters the british also experimented with mounting pilot-operated ai mark 6 radar sets in single-seat fighters , and the hurricane ii c ( nf ) , a dozen of which were produced in 1942 , became the first radar-equipped , single-seat night fighter in the world marchant 1996 thomas 1996 a similarly radar-equipped hawker typhoon was also developed , but no production followed german airborne interception radar efforts at this point were about two years behind the british this innovation allowed the night fighters to approach and attack bombers from below , where they were outside the bomber crew 's field of view even while the war raged , the jet engine so seriously upset aircraft design that the need for dedicated jet-powered night fighters became clear both the meteor and vampire conversions were rapidly followed by a more capable night fighter in the form of the de havilland venom , the first model of which having been introduced during 1953 in the us air force 's lightweight fighter program , the f-16 was originally envisaged as inexpensive day fighter , but quickly converted to an all-weather role

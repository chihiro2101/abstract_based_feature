dennett puts forward a multiple drafts model of consciousness , suggesting that there is no single central place ( a '' cartesian theater '' ) where conscious experience occurs ; instead there are '' various events of content-fixation occurring in various places at various times in the brain '' 260 when '' content-fixation '' takes place in one of these , its effects may propagate so that it leads to the utterance of one of the sentences that make up the story in which the central character is one 's '' self '' dennett 's view of consciousness is that it is the apparently serial account for the brain 's underlying parallelism the non-existence of qualia would mean that there is no hard problem of consciousness , and '' philosophical zombies '' , which are supposed to act like a human in every way while somehow lacking qualia , can not exist '' in a footnote dennett states : '' it would be an act of desperate intellectual dishonesty to quote this assertion out of context ! '' dennett claims that our brains hold only a few salient details about the world , and that this is the only reason we are able to function at all , p.30 a key philosophical method is heterophenomenology , in which the verbal or written reports of subjects are treated as akin to a theorist 's fictionâ€”the subject 's report is not questioned , but it is not assumed to be an incorrigible report about that subject 's inner state in his 1996 book the conscious mind , philosopher david chalmers argues that dennett 's position is '' a denial '' of consciousness , and jokingly wonders if dennett is a philosophical zombie searle writes that , in dennett 's view , there is no consciousness in addition to the computational features , because that is all that consciousness amounts to for him : mere effects of a von neumann ( esque ) virtual machine implemented in a parallel architecture and therefore implies that conscious states are illusory how then can i take seriously his claim that consciousness does not really exist ? dennett and his eliminative materialism supporters , however , respond that the aforementioned '' subjective aspect '' of conscious minds is nonexistent , an unscientific remnant of commonsense '' folk psychology '' , and that his alleged redefinition is the only coherent description of consciousness

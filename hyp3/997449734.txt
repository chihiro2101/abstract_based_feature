these ordered fibres can then be passed on to other processes that are specific to the desired end use of the fibre : cotton , batting , felt , woollen or worsted yarn , etc carding can also be used to create blends of different fibres or different colours when blending , the carding process combines the different fibres into a homogeneous mix commercial cards also have rollers and systems designed to remove some vegetable matter contaminants from the wool card clothing is made from a sturdy flexible backing in which closely spaced wire pins are embedded the shape , length , diameter , and spacing of these wire pins are dictated by the card designer and the particular requirements of the application where the card cloth will be used these carding devices , called kaman ( bow ) and dhunaki , would loosen the texture of the fibre by the means of a vibrating string at the turn of the eighteenth century , wool in england was being carded using pairs of hand cards , in a two-stage process : 'working ' with the cards opposed and 'stripping ' where they are in parallel in 1748 lewis paul of birmingham , england , invented two hand driven carding machines on the second , a coat of wire slips was placed around a card which was then wrapped around a cylinder from the 1780s , the carding machines were set up in mills in the north of england and mid-wales with woollen , two carding machines were used : the first or the scribbler opened and mixed the fibres , the second or the condenser mixed and formed the web in 1834 james walton invented the first practical machines to use a wire card the large drum carders do not tend to get along well with lanolin , so most commercial worsted and woollen mills wash the wool before carding a gap in the card cloth facilitates removal of the batt when the card cloth is full some drum carders have a soft-bristled brush attachment that presses the fibre into the storage drum the stripper 's relative surface speed is slower than the swift 's so the swift pulls the fibres from the stripper for additional straightening the fancy 's card cloth is designed to engage with the swift 's card cloth so that the fibres are lifted to the tips of the swift 's card cloth and carried by the swift to the doffer the fancy and the swift are the only rollers in the carding process that actually touch

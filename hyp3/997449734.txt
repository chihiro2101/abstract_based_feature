these ordered fibres can then be passed on to other processes that are specific to the desired end use of the fibre : cotton , batting , felt , woollen or worsted yarn , etc carding can also be used to create blends of different fibres or different colours when blending , the carding process combines the different fibres into a homogeneous mix commercial cards also have rollers and systems designed to remove some vegetable matter contaminants from the wool card clothing is made from a sturdy flexible backing in which closely spaced wire pins are embedded the shape , length , diameter , and spacing of these wire pins are dictated by the card designer and the particular requirements of the application where the card cloth will be used these carding devices , called kaman ( bow ) and dhunaki , would loosen the texture of the fibre by the means of a vibrating string at the turn of the eighteenth century , wool in england was being carded using pairs of hand cards , in a two-stage process : 'working ' with the cards opposed and 'stripping ' where they are in parallel the first used a coat of wires on a flat table moved by foot pedals with woollen , two carding machines were used : the first or the scribbler opened and mixed the fibres , the second or the condenser mixed and formed the web he patented this machine and also a new form of card with layers of cloth and rubber the combination of these two inventions became the standard for the carding industry , using machines first built by parr , curtis and walton in ancoats , and from 1857 by jams walton & sons at haughton dale carding : the fibres are separated and then assembled into a loose strand ( sliver or tow ) at the conclusion of this stage a pair of cards is used to brush the wool between them until the fibres are more or less aligned in the same direction carding is an activity normally done outside or over a drop cloth , depending on the wool 's cleanliness a gap in the card cloth facilitates removal of the batt when the card cloth is full as they are transferred to the swift , many of the fibres are straightened and laid into the swift 's card cloth these fibres will be carried past the worker / stripper rollers to the fancy the fancy 's card cloth is designed to engage with the swift 's card cloth so that the fibres are lifted to the tips of the swift 's card cloth and carried by the swift to the doffer

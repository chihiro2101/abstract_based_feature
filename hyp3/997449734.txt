these ordered fibres can then be passed on to other processes that are specific to the desired end use of the fibre : cotton , batting , felt , woollen or worsted yarn , etc carding can also be used to create blends of different fibres or different colours when blending , the carding process combines the different fibres into a homogeneous mix commercial cards also have rollers and systems designed to remove some vegetable matter contaminants from the wool card clothing is made from a sturdy flexible backing in which closely spaced wire pins are embedded the shape , length , diameter , and spacing of these wire pins are dictated by the card designer and the particular requirements of the application where the card cloth will be used in 1748 lewis paul of birmingham , england , invented two hand driven carding machines from the 1780s , the carding machines were set up in mills in the north of england and mid-wales with woollen , two carding machines were used : the first or the scribbler opened and mixed the fibres , the second or the condenser mixed and formed the web he patented this machine and also a new form of card with layers of cloth and rubber : :the cotton comes off of the picking machine in laps , and is then taken to carding machines the carders line up the fibres nicely to make them easier to spin the cotton leaves the carding machine in the form of a sliver ; a large rope of fibres carding of wool can either be done '' in the grease '' or not , depending on the type of machine and on the spinner 's preference this pulling straightens the fibres and lays them between the wire pins of the storage drum 's card cloth cottage carding machines differ significantly from the simple drum card as the swift carries the fibres forward , from the nippers , those fibres that are not yet straightened are picked up by a worker and carried over the top to its paired stripper straightened fibres are carried by the swift to the fancy the fancy 's card cloth is designed to engage with the swift 's card cloth so that the fibres are lifted to the tips of the swift 's card cloth and carried by the swift to the doffer

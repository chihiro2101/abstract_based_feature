carding can also be used to create blends of different fibres or different colours when blending , the carding process combines the different fibres into a homogeneous mix commercial cards also have rollers and systems designed to remove some vegetable matter contaminants from the wool carding machines are known as cards fibre may be carded by hand for hand spinning the earliest evidence for using bow-instruments for carding comes from india ( 2nd century ce ) in 1748 lewis paul of birmingham , england , invented two hand driven carding machines with woollen , two carding machines were used : the first or the scribbler opened and mixed the fibres , the second or the condenser mixed and formed the web in 1834 james walton invented the first practical machines to use a wire card carding : the fibres are separated and then assembled into a loose strand ( sliver or tow ) at the conclusion of this stage the cotton leaves the carding machine in the form of a sliver ; a large rope of fibres in a wider sense carding can refer to the four processes of willowing , lapping , carding and drawing since combining several slivers produces a very thick rope of cotton fibres , directly after being combined the slivers are separated into rovings this pulling straightens the fibres and lays them between the wire pins of the storage drum 's card cloth cottage carding machines differ significantly from the simple drum card these fibres will be carried past the worker / stripper rollers to the fancy as the swift carries the fibres forward , from the nippers , those fibres that are not yet straightened are picked up by a worker and carried over the top to its paired stripper the fancy 's card cloth is designed to engage with the swift 's card cloth so that the fibres are lifted to the tips of the swift 's card cloth and carried by the swift to the doffer a fine web of more or less parallel fibre , a few fibres thick and as wide as the carder 's rollers , exits the carder at the fly comb by gravity or other mechanical means for storage or further processing .

carding can also be used to create blends of different fibres or different colours when blending , the carding process combines the different fibres into a homogeneous mix commercial cards also have rollers and systems designed to remove some vegetable matter contaminants from the wool the shape , length , diameter , and spacing of these wire pins are dictated by the card designer and the particular requirements of the application where the card cloth will be used carding machines are known as cards fibre may be carded by hand for hand spinning these carding devices , called kaman ( bow ) and dhunaki , would loosen the texture of the fibre by the means of a vibrating string in 1748 lewis paul of birmingham , england , invented two hand driven carding machines the first used a coat of wires on a flat table moved by foot pedals with woollen , two carding machines were used : the first or the scribbler opened and mixed the fibres , the second or the condenser mixed and formed the web these carding mills produced yarn particularly for the wales flannel industry in 1834 james walton invented the first practical machines to use a wire card carding : the fibres are separated and then assembled into a loose strand ( sliver or tow ) at the conclusion of this stage : :the cotton comes off of the picking machine in laps , and is then taken to carding machines the cotton leaves the carding machine in the form of a sliver ; a large rope of fibres these machines generally have two rollers , or drums , covered with card clothing cottage carding machines differ significantly from the simple drum card as they are transferred to the swift , many of the fibres are straightened and laid into the swift 's card cloth the fancy 's card cloth is designed to engage with the swift 's card cloth so that the fibres are lifted to the tips of the swift 's card cloth and carried by the swift to the doffer

these ordered fibres can then be passed on to other processes that are specific to the desired end use of the fibre : cotton , batting , felt , woollen or worsted yarn , etc carding can also be used to create blends of different fibres or different colours when blending , the carding process combines the different fibres into a homogeneous mix commercial cards also have rollers and systems designed to remove some vegetable matter contaminants from the wool card clothing is made from a sturdy flexible backing in which closely spaced wire pins are embedded fibre may be carded by hand for hand spinning the earliest evidence for using bow-instruments for carding comes from india ( 2nd century ce ) these carding devices , called kaman ( bow ) and dhunaki , would loosen the texture of the fibre by the means of a vibrating string the first used a coat of wires on a flat table moved by foot pedals daniel bourn obtained a similar patent in the same year , and probably used it in his spinning mill at leominster , but this burnt down in 1754 priority was given to cotton but woollen fibres were being carded in yorkshire in 1780 with woollen , two carding machines were used : the first or the scribbler opened and mixed the fibres , the second or the condenser mixed and formed the web these carding mills produced yarn particularly for the wales flannel industry the cotton leaves the carding machine in the form of a sliver ; a large rope of fibres a pair of cards is used to brush the wool between them until the fibres are more or less aligned in the same direction carding of wool can either be done '' in the grease '' or not , depending on the type of machine and on the spinner 's preference fibre is added until the storage drum 's card cloth is full raw fibre , placed on the in-feed table or conveyor is moved to the nippers which restrain and meter the fiber onto the swift a fine web of more or less parallel fibre , a few fibres thick and as wide as the carder 's rollers , exits the carder at the fly comb by gravity or other mechanical means for storage or further processing .

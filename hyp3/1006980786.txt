hamilton was born in 1936 in cairo , egypt , the second of seven children during the second world war , the young hamilton was evacuated to edinburgh he had an interest in natural history from an early age and spent his spare time collecting butterflies and other insects ford 's new naturalist book butterflies , which introduced him to the principles of evolution by natural selection , genetics , and population genetics he was intrigued by ronald fisher 's book the genetical theory of natural selection , but fisher lacked standing at cambridge , being viewed as only a statistician in earlier chapters , fisher provided a mathematical basis for the genetics of evolution and hamilton later blamed fisher 's book for his getting only a 2:1 degree hamilton enrolled in an msc course in demography at the london school of economics ( lse ) , under norman carrier , who helped secure various grants for his studies hamilton worked through several examples , and eventually realised that the number that kept falling out of his calculations was sewall wright 's coefficient of relationship algebraically , the rule posits that a costly action should be performed if : c where c is the cost in fitness to the actor , r the genetic relatedness between the actor and the recipient , and b is the fitness benefit to the recipient his two 1964 papers entitled the genetical evolution of social behavior are now widely referenced the proof and discussion of its consequences , however , involved detailed mathematics , and two reviewers passed over the paper the hamilton paper was printed in the journal of theoretical biology and , when first published , was largely ignored this system means that females are more closely related to their sisters than to their own ( potential ) offspring whilst there he published a paper in science on '' extraordinary sex ratios '' hamilton had been introduced to the idea and formulated its solution in 1960 when he had been assigned to help fisher 's pupil a.w.f hamilton combined his extensive knowledge of natural history with deep insight into the problem , opening up a whole new area of research the paper was also notable for introducing the concept of the '' unbeatable strategy '' , which john maynard smith and george r price were to develop into the evolutionarily stable strategy ( ess ) , a concept in game theory not limited to evolutionary biology price had originally come to hamilton after deriving the price equation , and thus rederiving hamilton 's rule the paper was not published but maynard smith offered to make price a co-author of his ess paper , which helped to improve relations between the men price committed suicide in 1975 , and hamilton and maynard smith were among the few present at the funeral hamilton and john jaenike were among the earliest pioneers of the idea despite this rejection , he gave supportive declarations on the hypothesis to the bbc and wrote the foreword of a 1999 book , the river , by journalist edward hooper , who investigated the hypothesis however , none of the over 60 urine and faecal samples collected by hamilton contained detectable siv virus he , however , had written an essay on my intended burial and why in which he wrote : the second volume of his collected papers , evolution of sex , was published in 2002 , and the third and final volume , last words , in 2005 hamilton 's work in game theory

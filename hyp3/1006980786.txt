during the second world war , the young hamilton was evacuated to edinburgh ford 's new naturalist book butterflies , which introduced him to the principles of evolution by natural selection , genetics , and population genetics in earlier chapters , fisher provided a mathematical basis for the genetics of evolution and hamilton later blamed fisher 's book for his getting only a 2:1 degree hamilton enrolled in an msc course in demography at the london school of economics ( lse ) , under norman carrier , who helped secure various grants for his studies later , when his work became more mathematical and genetical , he had his supervision transferred to john hajnal of the lse and cedric smith of university college london ( ucl ) hamilton worked through several examples , and eventually realised that the number that kept falling out of his calculations was sewall wright 's coefficient of relationship this became hamilton 's rule : in each behaviour-evoking situation , the individual assesses his neighbour 's fitness against his own according to the coefficients of relationship appropriate to the situation algebraically , the rule posits that a costly action should be performed if : c where c is the cost in fitness to the actor , r the genetic relatedness between the actor and the recipient , and b is the fitness benefit to the recipient the proof and discussion of its consequences , however , involved detailed mathematics , and two reviewers passed over the paper having his work passed over later led to friction between hamilton and maynard smith , as hamilton thought smith had held his work back to claim credit for the idea ( during the review period maynard smith published a paper that referred briefly to similar ideas ) the hamilton paper was printed in the journal of theoretical biology and , when first published , was largely ignored much of the discussion relates to the evolution of eusociality in insects of the order hymenoptera ( ants , bees and wasps ) based on their unusual haplodiploid sex-determination system thus , hamilton reasoned , a '' costly action '' would be better spent in helping to raise their sisters , rather than reproducing themselves in his 1970 paper selfish and spiteful behaviour in an evolutionary model hamilton considers the question of whether harm inflicted upon an organism must inevitably be a byproduct of adaptations for survival whilst there he published a paper in science on '' extraordinary sex ratios '' fisher ( 1930 ) had proposed a model as to why '' ordinary '' sex ratios were nearly always 1:1 ( but see edwards 1998 ) , and likewise extraordinary sex ratios , particularly in wasps , needed explanations hamilton combined his extensive knowledge of natural history with deep insight into the problem , opening up a whole new area of research price had originally come to hamilton after deriving the price equation , and thus rederiving hamilton 's rule hamilton was a visiting professor at harvard university and later spent nine months with the royal society 's and the royal geographical society 's xavantina-cachimbo expedition as a visiting professor at the university of s√£o paulo from 1978 hamilton was professor of evolutionary biology at the university of michigan simultaneously , he was elected a foreign honorary member of american academy of arts and sciences hamilton was an early proponent of the red queen theory of the evolution of sex the red queen hypothesis at indiana university his collected papers , entitled narrow roads of gene land , began to be published in 1996 hamilton also proposed the coevolution theory of autumn leaf color as an example of evolutionary signalling theory a secular memorial service ( he was an agnostic ) was held at the chapel of new college , oxford on 1 july 2000 , organised by richard dawkins hamilton 's work in game theory

hamilton was born in 1936 in cairo , egypt , the second of seven children the hamilton family settled in kent ford 's new naturalist book butterflies , which introduced him to the principles of evolution by natural selection , genetics , and population genetics john 's college , he was uninspired by the '' many biologists who hardly seemed to believe in evolution '' he was intrigued by ronald fisher 's book the genetical theory of natural selection , but fisher lacked standing at cambridge , being viewed as only a statistician in earlier chapters , fisher provided a mathematical basis for the genetics of evolution and hamilton later blamed fisher 's book for his getting only a 2:1 degree later , when his work became more mathematical and genetical , he had his supervision transferred to john hajnal of the lse and cedric smith of university college london ( ucl ) haldane had seen a problem in how organisms could increase the fitness of their own genes by aiding their close relatives , but not recognised its significance or properly formulated it hamilton worked through several examples , and eventually realised that the number that kept falling out of his calculations was sewall wright 's coefficient of relationship this became hamilton 's rule : in each behaviour-evoking situation , the individual assesses his neighbour 's fitness against his own according to the coefficients of relationship appropriate to the situation the third , john maynard smith , did not completely understand it either , but recognised its significance having his work passed over later led to friction between hamilton and maynard smith , as hamilton thought smith had held his work back to claim credit for the idea ( during the review period maynard smith published a paper that referred briefly to similar ideas ) the hamilton paper was printed in the journal of theoretical biology and , when first published , was largely ignored much of the discussion relates to the evolution of eusociality in insects of the order hymenoptera ( ants , bees and wasps ) based on their unusual haplodiploid sex-determination system what of possible cases where an organism is deliberately harming others without apparent benefit to the self ? such behaviour hamilton calls spiteful between 1964 and 1977 hamilton was a lecturer at imperial college london fisher ( 1930 ) had proposed a model as to why '' ordinary '' sex ratios were nearly always 1:1 ( but see edwards 1998 ) , and likewise extraordinary sex ratios , particularly in wasps , needed explanations hamilton had been introduced to the idea and formulated its solution in 1960 when he had been assigned to help fisher 's pupil a.w.f hamilton combined his extensive knowledge of natural history with deep insight into the problem , opening up a whole new area of research price had originally come to hamilton after deriving the price equation , and thus rederiving hamilton 's rule maynard smith later peer reviewed one of price 's papers , and drew inspiration from it hamilton was a visiting professor at harvard university and later spent nine months with the royal society 's and the royal geographical society 's xavantina-cachimbo expedition as a visiting professor at the university of s√£o paulo from 1978 hamilton was professor of evolutionary biology at the university of michigan the field of social evolution , of which hamilton 's rule has central importance , is broadly defined as being the study of the evolution of social behaviours , i.e hamilton started to publish his collected papers starting in 1996 , along the lines of fisher 's collected papers , with short essays giving each paper context 1 : evolution of social behaviour oxford university press , oxford

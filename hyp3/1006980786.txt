hamilton was born in 1936 in cairo , egypt , the second of seven children during the second world war , the young hamilton was evacuated to edinburgh he had an interest in natural history from an early age and spent his spare time collecting butterflies and other insects ford 's new naturalist book butterflies , which introduced him to the principles of evolution by natural selection , genetics , and population genetics before going up to the university of cambridge , he travelled in france and completed two years of national service john 's college , he was uninspired by the '' many biologists who hardly seemed to believe in evolution '' he was intrigued by ronald fisher 's book the genetical theory of natural selection , but fisher lacked standing at cambridge , being viewed as only a statistician hamilton was excited by fisher 's chapters on eugenics in earlier chapters , fisher provided a mathematical basis for the genetics of evolution and hamilton later blamed fisher 's book for his getting only a 2:1 degree hamilton enrolled in an msc course in demography at the london school of economics ( lse ) , under norman carrier , who helped secure various grants for his studies later , when his work became more mathematical and genetical , he had his supervision transferred to john hajnal of the lse and cedric smith of university college london ( ucl ) his two 1964 papers entitled the genetical evolution of social behavior are now widely referenced the hamilton paper was printed in the journal of theoretical biology and , when first published , was largely ignored recognition of its significance gradually increased to the point that it is now routinely cited in biology books thus , hamilton reasoned , a '' costly action '' would be better spent in helping to raise their sisters , rather than reproducing themselves whilst there he published a paper in science on '' extraordinary sex ratios '' fisher ( 1930 ) had proposed a model as to why '' ordinary '' sex ratios were nearly always 1:1 ( but see edwards 1998 ) , and likewise extraordinary sex ratios , particularly in wasps , needed explanations hamilton had been introduced to the idea and formulated its solution in 1960 when he had been assigned to help fisher 's pupil a.w.f hamilton combined his extensive knowledge of natural history with deep insight into the problem , opening up a whole new area of research price were to develop into the evolutionarily stable strategy ( ess ) , a concept in game theory not limited to evolutionary biology price committed suicide in 1975 , and hamilton and maynard smith were among the few present at the funeral this shortcoming would not affect the popularity of his work , however , as it was popularised by richard dawkins in dawkins ' 1976 book the selfish gene in 1966 he married christine friess and they were to have three daughters , helen , ruth and rowena from 1978 hamilton was professor of evolutionary biology at the university of michigan a secular memorial service ( he was an agnostic ) was held at the chapel of new college , oxford on 1 july 2000 , organised by richard dawkins 2 : evolution of sex oxford university press , oxford

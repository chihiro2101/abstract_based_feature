this mode of propagation , called ground wave , is the main mode in the longwave band the attenuation of signal strength with distance by absorption in the ground is lower than at higher frequencies , and falls with frequency very low frequency waves below 30 & nbsp ; khz can be used to communicate at transcontinental distances , and can penetrate saltwater to depths of hundreds of feet , and is used by the military to communication with submarines they can occupy any frequency in the range 190–1750 & nbsp ; khz in itu region 1 the lower limit is 280 & nbsp ; khz tdf from allouis , france , on 162 & nbsp ; khz radio clock receive their time calibration signals with built-in long-wave receivers in north america during the 1970s , the frequencies 167 , 179 , and 191 & nbsp ; khz were assigned to the short-lived public emergency radio of the united states the 190–435 & nbsp ; khz band is used for navigational beacons long-wave carrier frequencies are exact multiples of 9 & nbsp ; khz ; ranging from 153 to 279 & nbsp ; khz , except for a french-language station , europe no

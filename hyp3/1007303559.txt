low frequency waves can also occasionally travel long distances by reflecting from the ionosphere ( the actual mechanism is one of refraction ) , although this method , called skywave or '' skip '' propagation , is not as common as at higher frequencies they can occupy any frequency in the range 190–1750 & nbsp ; khz in north america , they occupy 190–535 & nbsp ; khz for example : wwvb in colorado , united states , on 60 & nbsp ; khz dcf77 in frankfurt , germany , on 77.5 & nbsp ; khz jjy in japan , on 40 & 60 & nbsp ; khz 66.66 & nbsp ; khz in taldom transmitter , russia bpc in lintong , china , 68.5 & nbsp ; khz msf time and 60 & nbsp ; khz frequency standard transmitted from anthorn in the uk they use long-wave , rather than shortwave or mediumwave , because long-wave signals from the transmitter to the receiver always travel along the same direct path across the surface of the earth , so the time delay correction for the signal travel time from the transmitting station to the receiver is always the same for any one receiving location the delay between when the long-wave signal was sent from the transmitter ( when the coded time was correct ) and when the signal is received by the clock ( when the coded time is slightly late ) depends on the overland distance between the clock and the transmitter and the speed of light in a medium , which is also very nearly constant may transmit on the newly-allocated 2200-meter band from 136–139 & nbsp ; khz at maximum equivalent power radiated from the antenna of 1 & nbsp ; watt ( eirp ) ; most nations in europe already have adopted the new band , along with many others worldwide nowadays , in the united states , part 15 of fcc regulations allow unlicensed use of the 160–190 & nbsp ; khz band a transmitter / amplifier output power to the antenna of at most 1 & nbsp ; watt , with an antenna at most 15 & nbsp ; meters ( 49 & nbsp ; feet ) high ; this is called lowfer ( lowfer ) because long-wave signals can travel very long distances , some radio amateurs and shortwave listening engage in an activity called dxing

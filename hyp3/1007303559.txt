because of their long wavelength , radio waves in this frequency range can diffract over obstacles like mountain ranges and travel beyond the horizon , following the contour of the earth very low frequency waves below 30 & nbsp ; khz can be used to communicate at transcontinental distances , and can penetrate saltwater to depths of hundreds of feet , and is used by the military to communication with submarines they can occupy any frequency in the range 190–1750 & nbsp ; khz in itu region 1 the lower limit is 280 & nbsp ; khz tdf from allouis , france , on 162 & nbsp ; khz radio clock receive their time calibration signals with built-in long-wave receivers in north america during the 1970s , the frequencies 167 , 179 , and 191 & nbsp ; khz were assigned to the short-lived public emergency radio of the united states frequencies from 472–479 & nbsp ; khz are available to licensed amateurs as the new 630-meter band , part of the now-defunct 500 khz , but this is often considered a medium wave sub-band until the 1970s , some long-wave stations in northern and eastern europe and the soviet union operated on frequencies as high as 433 & nbsp ; khz because long-wave signals can travel very long distances , some radio amateurs and shortwave listening engage in an activity called dxing

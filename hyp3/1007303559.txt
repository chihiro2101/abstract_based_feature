this mode of propagation , called ground wave , is the main mode in the longwave band they can occupy any frequency in the range 190–1750 & nbsp ; khz in itu region 1 the lower limit is 280 & nbsp ; khz there are institutional broadcast stations in the range that transmit coded time signals to radio clocks tdf from allouis , france , on 162 & nbsp ; khz radio clock receive their time calibration signals with built-in long-wave receivers since the time lag is essentially the same , a single constant shift forward from the time coded in the signal can compensate for all long-wave signals received at any one location from the same time signal station frequencies from 472–479 & nbsp ; khz are available to licensed amateurs as the new 630-meter band , part of the now-defunct 500 khz , but this is often considered a medium wave sub-band long-wave carrier frequencies are exact multiples of 9 & nbsp ; khz ; ranging from 153 to 279 & nbsp ; khz , except for a french-language station , europe no because long-wave signals can travel very long distances , some radio amateurs and shortwave listening engage in an activity called dxing

because of their long wavelength , radio waves in this frequency range can diffract over obstacles like mountain ranges and travel beyond the horizon , following the contour of the earth very low frequency waves below 30 & nbsp ; khz can be used to communicate at transcontinental distances , and can penetrate saltwater to depths of hundreds of feet , and is used by the military to communication with submarines they can occupy any frequency in the range 190–1750 & nbsp ; khz in itu region 1 the lower limit is 280 & nbsp ; khz for example : wwvb in colorado , united states , on 60 & nbsp ; khz dcf77 in frankfurt , germany , on 77.5 & nbsp ; khz jjy in japan , on 40 & 60 & nbsp ; khz 66.66 & nbsp ; khz in taldom transmitter , russia bpc in lintong , china , 68.5 & nbsp ; khz msf time and 60 & nbsp ; khz frequency standard transmitted from anthorn in the uk since the time lag is essentially the same , a single constant shift forward from the time coded in the signal can compensate for all long-wave signals received at any one location from the same time signal station may transmit on the newly-allocated 2200-meter band from 136–139 & nbsp ; khz at maximum equivalent power radiated from the antenna of 1 & nbsp ; watt ( eirp ) ; most nations in europe already have adopted the new band , along with many others worldwide frequencies from 472–479 & nbsp ; khz are available to licensed amateurs as the new 630-meter band , part of the now-defunct 500 khz , but this is often considered a medium wave sub-band long-wave carrier frequencies are exact multiples of 9 & nbsp ; khz ; ranging from 153 to 279 & nbsp ; khz , except for a french-language station , europe no

because of their long wavelength , radio waves in this frequency range can diffract over obstacles like mountain ranges and travel beyond the horizon , following the contour of the earth for example : wwvb in colorado , united states , on 60 & nbsp ; khz dcf77 in frankfurt , germany , on 77.5 & nbsp ; khz jjy in japan , on 40 & 60 & nbsp ; khz 66.66 & nbsp ; khz in taldom transmitter , russia bpc in lintong , china , 68.5 & nbsp ; khz msf time and 60 & nbsp ; khz frequency standard transmitted from anthorn in the uk tdf from allouis , france , on 162 & nbsp ; khz radio clock receive their time calibration signals with built-in long-wave receivers those higher-frequency signals do not follow the surface of the earth beyond a few kilometers , but can travel as skywaves , ‘ bouncing ’ off different layers of the ionosphere at different times of day these different propagation paths can make the time lag different for every signal received the delay between when the long-wave signal was sent from the transmitter ( when the coded time was correct ) and when the signal is received by the clock ( when the coded time is slightly late ) depends on the overland distance between the clock and the transmitter and the speed of light in a medium , which is also very nearly constant nowadays , in the united states , part 15 of fcc regulations allow unlicensed use of the 160–190 & nbsp ; khz band a transmitter / amplifier output power to the antenna of at most 1 & nbsp ; watt , with an antenna at most 15 & nbsp ; meters ( 49 & nbsp ; feet ) high ; this is called lowfer ( lowfer ) long-wave carrier frequencies are exact multiples of 9 & nbsp ; khz ; ranging from 153 to 279 & nbsp ; khz , except for a french-language station , europe no until the 1970s , some long-wave stations in northern and eastern europe and the soviet union operated on frequencies as high as 433 & nbsp ; khz

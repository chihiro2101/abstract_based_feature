the first plans for a canal between hereford and gloucester were made by robert whitworth , one of james brindley 's pupils , in 1777 it appears that he re-surveyed the route , and recommended a change , so that it passed through ledbury a branch would be built to newent where there were minor coalfields , and the canal would be suitable for boats , capable of carrying 35 tons some of the promoters began to think that improving the river wye might be a better option , but the announcement of new seams of coal at newent resulted in a decision to obtain an act of parliament , which was granted in april 1791 this route required a tunnel at oxenhall , and another act of parliament was obtained in 1793 to sanction the new route the price of coal in the region dropped from 24 shillings ( £1.20 ) per ton to 13/6 ( 68p ) but the coal was a good quality product which travelled up the canal from the river severn ledbury remained the terminus for another forty years , although a short extension to enable coal to be delivered to the ledbury gas works was completed in 1832 a feeder from the river frome to the summit level was completed in august 1842 , and the canal opened in stages as it was completed , with extensions to canon frome wharf in january 1843 , whithington wharf in february 1844 , and finally to hereford basin on 22 may 1845 the whole canal had been estimated at £69,997 by josiah clowes in 1790 , but the section to ledbury had cost in excess of £104,000 this did not take place immediately , but on 30 june 1881 , half of the canal was closed , and sections of it were used for the course of the ledbury and gloucester railway the canal ran for from hereford basin through ledbury , dymock and newent to over , on the west channel of the river severn west of gloucester , with a short branch to the coal fields at gorsley a series of articles about the canal were published in the local press in early 1983 , and this led to calls for a society to be formed which would raise public awareness of the canal in 2000 , the over canal basin ( adjacent to the river severn at over on the outskirts of gloucester , where the canal links with the inland waterways network ) was reconstructed entirely by volunteers from the canal trust and the national volunteer body the waterway recovery group the canal trust used a legacy to purchase the site , which includes two cottages , some land , and a small section of the river severn as well as llanthony lock herefordshire & gloucestershire canal trust herefordshire & gloucestershire canal on soglos.com

the first plans for a canal between hereford and gloucester were made by robert whitworth , one of james brindley 's pupils , in 1777 josiah clowes , an engineer who had previous experience of working on the chester canal and who had worked with whitworth on the thames and severn canal , was to be the engineer a branch would be built to newent where there were minor coalfields , and the canal would be suitable for boats , capable of carrying 35 tons horse-powered pumps proved inadequate , and eventually steam-powered pumps were employed , but this added to the cost , and the tunnel was a large factor in the failure to complete the canal in 1838 , he proposed a new route for the final section , but the engineer james walker advised against it , and so in may 1839 , a new act of parliament was obtained , allowing the company to raise the money to complete the canal a feeder from the river frome to the summit level was completed in august 1842 , and the canal opened in stages as it was completed , with extensions to canon frome wharf in january 1843 , whithington wharf in february 1844 , and finally to hereford basin on 22 may 1845 the whole canal had been estimated at £69,997 by josiah clowes in 1790 , but the section to ledbury had cost in excess of £104,000 with little increase in trade from the longer canal , the company tried to sell it to a railway company almost immediately , but were unsuccessful , and so tried to boost trade this did not take place immediately , but on 30 june 1881 , half of the canal was closed , and sections of it were used for the course of the ledbury and gloucester railway the canal ran for from hereford basin through ledbury , dymock and newent to over , on the west channel of the river severn west of gloucester , with a short branch to the coal fields at gorsley the first from hereford to withington , which includes the aylestone tunnel , was level , after which the canal rose by through three locks over the three miles to monkhide in 2000 , the over canal basin ( adjacent to the river severn at over on the outskirts of gloucester , where the canal links with the inland waterways network ) was reconstructed entirely by volunteers from the canal trust and the national volunteer body the waterway recovery group major re-development in hereford city centre has resulted in the construction of a new canal bed which will eventually link to a new basin , to form the centrepiece of the edgar street grid development the canal trust used a legacy to purchase the site , which includes two cottages , some land , and a small section of the river severn as well as llanthony lock herefordshire & gloucestershire canal trust herefordshire & gloucestershire canal on soglos.com

the parasympathetic nerves are autonomic or visceral branches of the peripheral nervous system ( pns ) from these four ganglia the parasympathetic nerves complete their journey to target tissues via trigeminal branches ( ophthalmic nerve , maxillary nerve , mandibular nerve ) the parasympathetic ganglion where these preganglionic neurons synapse will be close to the organ of innervation this differs from the sympathetic nervous system , where synapses between pre- and post-ganglionic efferent nerves in general occur at ganglia that are farther away from the target organ as in the sympathetic nervous system , efferent parasympathetic nerve signals are carried from the central nervous system to their targets by a system of two neurons its cell body sits in the central nervous system and its axon usually extends to synapse with the dendrites of a postganglionic neuron somewhere else in the body the axons of presynaptic parasympathetic neurons are usually long , extending from the cns into a ganglion that is either very close to or embedded in their target organ the oculomotor pns fibers originate in the edinger-westphal nucleus in the central nervous system and travel through the superior orbital fissure to synapse in the ciliary ganglion located just behind the orbit ( eye ) from the ciliary ganglion the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave via short ciliary nerve fibers , a continuation of the nasociliary nerve ( a branch of ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve ( cn v 1 ) ) the short ciliary nerves innervate the orbit to control the ciliary muscle ( responsible for accommodation ) and the iris sphincter muscle , which is responsible for miosis or constriction of the pupil ( in response to light or accommodation ) there are two motors that are part of the oculomotor nerve known as the somatic motor and visceral motor the preganglionic fibers originate within the cns in the superior salivatory nucleus and leave as the intermediate nerve ( which some consider a separate cranial nerve altogether ) to connect with the facial nerve just distal ( further out ) to it surfacing the central nervous system just after the facial nerve geniculate ganglion ( general sensory ganglion ) in the temporal bone , the facial nerve gives off two separate parasympathetic nerves the parasympathetic fibers of the nerve of the pterygoid canal synapse at the pterygopalatine ganglion , which is closely associated with the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve ( cn v 2 ) the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave the pterygopalatine ganglion in several directions one division leaves on the zygomatic division of cn v 2 and travels on a communicating branch to unite with the lacrimal nerve ( branch of the ophthalmic nerve of cn v 1 ) before synapsing at the lacrimal gland yet another set of divisions from the pterygopalatine ganglion are the posterior , superior , and inferior lateral nasal nerves ; and the nasopalatine nerves ( all branches of cn v 2 , maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve ) that bring parasympathetic innervation to glands of the nasal mucosa the preganglionic fibers depart cn ix as the tympanic nerve and continue to the middle ear where they make up a tympanic plexus on the cochlear promontory of the mesotympanum the tympanic plexus of nerves rejoin and form the lesser petrosal nerve and exit through the foramen ovale to synapse at the otic ganglion from the otic ganglion postganglionic parasympathetic fibers travel with the auriculotemporal nerve ( mandibular branch of trigeminal , cn v 3 ) to the parotid salivary gland each recurrent laryngeal nerve supplies the trachea and the esophagus with parasympathetic secretomotor innervation for glands associated with them ( and other fibers that are not pn ) another nerve that comes off the vagus nerves approximately at the level of entering the thorax are the cardiac nerves this is very efficient as the major function of the vagus nerve from there on will be control of the gut smooth muscles and glands the afferent fibers of the autonomic nervous system , which transmit sensory information from the internal organs of the body back to the central nervous system , are not divided into parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers as the efferent fibers are another role that the parasympathetic nervous system plays is in sexual activity they have a minimal effect on the contractile forces of the ventricular muscle due to sparse innervation of the ventricles from the parasympathetic nervous system

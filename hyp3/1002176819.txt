the parasympathetic nerves are autonomic or visceral branches of the peripheral nervous system ( pns ) from these four ganglia the parasympathetic nerves complete their journey to target tissues via trigeminal branches ( ophthalmic nerve , maxillary nerve , mandibular nerve ) the pelvic splanchnic nerves reside in the lateral gray horn of the spinal cord at the t12-l1 vertebral levels ( the spinal cord terminates at the l1-l2 vertebrae with the conus medullaris ) , and their axons exit the vertebral column as s2-s4 spinal nerves through the sacral foramina this differs from the sympathetic nervous system , where synapses between pre- and post-ganglionic efferent nerves in general occur at ganglia that are farther away from the target organ as in the sympathetic nervous system , efferent parasympathetic nerve signals are carried from the central nervous system to their targets by a system of two neurons the first neuron in this pathway is referred to as the preganglionic or presynaptic neuron its cell body sits in the central nervous system and its axon usually extends to synapse with the dendrites of a postganglionic neuron somewhere else in the body the oculomotor nerve is responsible for a number of parasympathetic functions related to the eye the oculomotor pns fibers originate in the edinger-westphal nucleus in the central nervous system and travel through the superior orbital fissure to synapse in the ciliary ganglion located just behind the orbit ( eye ) from the ciliary ganglion the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave via short ciliary nerve fibers , a continuation of the nasociliary nerve ( a branch of ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve ( cn v 1 ) ) the short ciliary nerves innervate the orbit to control the ciliary muscle ( responsible for accommodation ) and the iris sphincter muscle , which is responsible for miosis or constriction of the pupil ( in response to light or accommodation ) the parasympathetic aspect of the facial nerve controls secretion of the sublingual and submandibular salivary glands , the lacrimal gland , and the glands associated with the nasal cavity the preganglionic fibers originate within the cns in the superior salivatory nucleus and leave as the intermediate nerve ( which some consider a separate cranial nerve altogether ) to connect with the facial nerve just distal ( further out ) to it surfacing the central nervous system just after the facial nerve geniculate ganglion ( general sensory ganglion ) in the temporal bone , the facial nerve gives off two separate parasympathetic nerves a separate group of parasympathetic leaving from the pterygopalatine ganglion are the descending palatine nerves ( cn v 2 branch ) , which include the greater and lesser palatine nerves after joining the lingual nerve , the preganglionic fibers synapse at the submandibular ganglion and send postganglionic fibers to the sublingual and submandibular salivary glands another peculiarity is that the vagus has an autonomic ganglion associated with it at approximately the level of c1 vertebra one nerve is the recurrent laryngeal nerve , which becomes the inferior laryngeal nerve another nerve that comes off the vagus nerves approximately at the level of entering the thorax are the cardiac nerves the vagus trunks then join with preaortic sympathetic ganglion around the aorta to disperse with the blood vessels and sympathetic nerves throughout the abdomen the extent of the parasympathetic in the abdomen include the pancreas , kidneys , liver , gall bladder , stomach and gut tube assuming that the reported findings most likely applies to other mammals as well , this perspective suggests a simplified , bipartite architecture of the autonomic nervous system , in which the parasympathetic nervous system receives input from cranial nerves exclusively and the sympathetic nervous system from thoracic to sacral spinal nerves another role that the parasympathetic nervous system plays is in sexual activity the m3 receptors are also located in many glands that help to stimulate secretion in salivary glands and other glands of the body a useful mnemonic to summarize the functions of the parasympathetic nervous system is ssludd ( sexual arousal , salivation , tears , urination , digestion and defecation ) the functions promoted by activity in the parasympathetic nervous system are associated with our day-to-day living

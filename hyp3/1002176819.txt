the parasympathetic nerves are autonomic or visceral branches of the peripheral nervous system ( pns ) from these four ganglia the parasympathetic nerves complete their journey to target tissues via trigeminal branches ( ophthalmic nerve , maxillary nerve , mandibular nerve ) the vagus innervation ends at the junction between the midgut and hindgut , just before the splenic flexure of the transverse colon this differs from the sympathetic nervous system , where synapses between pre- and post-ganglionic efferent nerves in general occur at ganglia that are farther away from the target organ as in the sympathetic nervous system , efferent parasympathetic nerve signals are carried from the central nervous system to their targets by a system of two neurons its cell body sits in the central nervous system and its axon usually extends to synapse with the dendrites of a postganglionic neuron somewhere else in the body the oculomotor pns fibers originate in the edinger-westphal nucleus in the central nervous system and travel through the superior orbital fissure to synapse in the ciliary ganglion located just behind the orbit ( eye ) from the ciliary ganglion the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave via short ciliary nerve fibers , a continuation of the nasociliary nerve ( a branch of ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve ( cn v 1 ) ) the short ciliary nerves innervate the orbit to control the ciliary muscle ( responsible for accommodation ) and the iris sphincter muscle , which is responsible for miosis or constriction of the pupil ( in response to light or accommodation ) the parasympathetic aspect of the facial nerve controls secretion of the sublingual and submandibular salivary glands , the lacrimal gland , and the glands associated with the nasal cavity just after the facial nerve geniculate ganglion ( general sensory ganglion ) in the temporal bone , the facial nerve gives off two separate parasympathetic nerves the parasympathetic fibers of the nerve of the pterygoid canal synapse at the pterygopalatine ganglion , which is closely associated with the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve ( cn v 2 ) a separate group of parasympathetic leaving from the pterygopalatine ganglion are the descending palatine nerves ( cn v 2 branch ) , which include the greater and lesser palatine nerves yet another set of divisions from the pterygopalatine ganglion are the posterior , superior , and inferior lateral nasal nerves ; and the nasopalatine nerves ( all branches of cn v 2 , maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve ) that bring parasympathetic innervation to glands of the nasal mucosa the chorda tympani travels through the middle ear and attaches to the lingual nerve ( mandibular division of trigeminal , cn v 3 ) the tympanic plexus of nerves rejoin and form the lesser petrosal nerve and exit through the foramen ovale to synapse at the otic ganglion from the otic ganglion postganglionic parasympathetic fibers travel with the auriculotemporal nerve ( mandibular branch of trigeminal , cn v 3 ) to the parotid salivary gland another peculiarity is that the vagus has an autonomic ganglion associated with it at approximately the level of c1 vertebra the vagus nerve is hard to track definitively due to its ubiquitous nature in the thorax and abdomen so the major contributions will be discussed one nerve is the recurrent laryngeal nerve , which becomes the inferior laryngeal nerve from the left vagus nerve the recurrent laryngeal nerve hooks around the aorta to travel back up to the larynx and proximal esophagus while , from the right vagus nerve , the recurrent laryngeal nerve hooks around the right subclavian artery to travel back up to the same location as its counterpart another nerve that comes off the vagus nerves approximately at the level of entering the thorax are the cardiac nerves a study published in 2016 , suggests that all sacral autonomic output may be sympathetic ; indicating that the rectum , bladder and reproductive organs may only be innervated by the sympathetic nervous system another role that the parasympathetic nervous system plays is in sexual activity a useful mnemonic to summarize the functions of the parasympathetic nervous system is ssludd ( sexual arousal , salivation , tears , urination , digestion and defecation ) the terminology ‘ parasympathetic nervous system ’ was introduced by langley in 1921

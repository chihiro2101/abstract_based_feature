the parasympathetic nerves are autonomic or visceral branches of the peripheral nervous system ( pns ) from these four ganglia the parasympathetic nerves complete their journey to target tissues via trigeminal branches ( ophthalmic nerve , maxillary nerve , mandibular nerve ) this differs from the sympathetic nervous system , where synapses between pre- and post-ganglionic efferent nerves in general occur at ganglia that are farther away from the target organ as in the sympathetic nervous system , efferent parasympathetic nerve signals are carried from the central nervous system to their targets by a system of two neurons its cell body sits in the central nervous system and its axon usually extends to synapse with the dendrites of a postganglionic neuron somewhere else in the body the axons of presynaptic parasympathetic neurons are usually long , extending from the cns into a ganglion that is either very close to or embedded in their target organ from the ciliary ganglion the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave via short ciliary nerve fibers , a continuation of the nasociliary nerve ( a branch of ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve ( cn v 1 ) ) the short ciliary nerves innervate the orbit to control the ciliary muscle ( responsible for accommodation ) and the iris sphincter muscle , which is responsible for miosis or constriction of the pupil ( in response to light or accommodation ) the parasympathetic aspect of the facial nerve controls secretion of the sublingual and submandibular salivary glands , the lacrimal gland , and the glands associated with the nasal cavity the preganglionic fibers originate within the cns in the superior salivatory nucleus and leave as the intermediate nerve ( which some consider a separate cranial nerve altogether ) to connect with the facial nerve just distal ( further out ) to it surfacing the central nervous system just after the facial nerve geniculate ganglion ( general sensory ganglion ) in the temporal bone , the facial nerve gives off two separate parasympathetic nerves the greater petrosal nerve travels through the middle ear and eventually combines with the deep petrosal nerve ( sympathetic fibers ) to form the nerve of the pterygoid canal the parasympathetic fibers of the nerve of the pterygoid canal synapse at the pterygopalatine ganglion , which is closely associated with the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve ( cn v 2 ) one division leaves on the zygomatic division of cn v 2 and travels on a communicating branch to unite with the lacrimal nerve ( branch of the ophthalmic nerve of cn v 1 ) before synapsing at the lacrimal gland these parasympathetic to the lacrimal gland control tear production the chorda tympani travels through the middle ear and attaches to the lingual nerve ( mandibular division of trigeminal , cn v 3 ) after joining the lingual nerve , the preganglionic fibers synapse at the submandibular ganglion and send postganglionic fibers to the sublingual and submandibular salivary glands from the otic ganglion postganglionic parasympathetic fibers travel with the auriculotemporal nerve ( mandibular branch of trigeminal , cn v 3 ) to the parotid salivary gland the vagus nerve is hard to track definitively due to its ubiquitous nature in the thorax and abdomen so the major contributions will be discussed one nerve is the recurrent laryngeal nerve , which becomes the inferior laryngeal nerve the vagus trunks then join with preaortic sympathetic ganglion around the aorta to disperse with the blood vessels and sympathetic nerves throughout the abdomen the afferent fibers of the autonomic nervous system , which transmit sensory information from the internal organs of the body back to the central nervous system , are not divided into parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers as the efferent fibers are the pain is also usually referred to dermatomes that are at the same spinal nerve level as the visceral afferent synapse another role that the parasympathetic nervous system plays is in sexual activity . relationship to sympathetic nervous system the terminology ‘ parasympathetic nervous system ’ was introduced by langley in 1921

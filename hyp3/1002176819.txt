the parasympathetic nerves are autonomic or visceral branches of the peripheral nervous system ( pns ) from these four ganglia the parasympathetic nerves complete their journey to target tissues via trigeminal branches ( ophthalmic nerve , maxillary nerve , mandibular nerve ) this differs from the sympathetic nervous system , where synapses between pre- and post-ganglionic efferent nerves in general occur at ganglia that are farther away from the target organ as in the sympathetic nervous system , efferent parasympathetic nerve signals are carried from the central nervous system to their targets by a system of two neurons from the ciliary ganglion the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave via short ciliary nerve fibers , a continuation of the nasociliary nerve ( a branch of ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve ( cn v 1 ) ) the short ciliary nerves innervate the orbit to control the ciliary muscle ( responsible for accommodation ) and the iris sphincter muscle , which is responsible for miosis or constriction of the pupil ( in response to light or accommodation ) there are two motors that are part of the oculomotor nerve known as the somatic motor and visceral motor the parasympathetic aspect of the facial nerve controls secretion of the sublingual and submandibular salivary glands , the lacrimal gland , and the glands associated with the nasal cavity the preganglionic fibers originate within the cns in the superior salivatory nucleus and leave as the intermediate nerve ( which some consider a separate cranial nerve altogether ) to connect with the facial nerve just distal ( further out ) to it surfacing the central nervous system just after the facial nerve geniculate ganglion ( general sensory ganglion ) in the temporal bone , the facial nerve gives off two separate parasympathetic nerves the first is the greater petrosal nerve and the second is the chorda tympani the greater petrosal nerve travels through the middle ear and eventually combines with the deep petrosal nerve ( sympathetic fibers ) to form the nerve of the pterygoid canal the parasympathetic fibers of the nerve of the pterygoid canal synapse at the pterygopalatine ganglion , which is closely associated with the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve ( cn v 2 ) after joining the lingual nerve , the preganglionic fibers synapse at the submandibular ganglion and send postganglionic fibers to the sublingual and submandibular salivary glands the preganglionic fibers depart cn ix as the tympanic nerve and continue to the middle ear where they make up a tympanic plexus on the cochlear promontory of the mesotympanum the vagus nerve , named after the latin word vagus ( because the nerve controls such a broad range of target tissues â€“ vagus in latin literally means '' wandering '' ) , has parasympathetic functions that originate in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve and the nucleus ambiguus in the cns the vagus nerve is an unusual cranial parasympathetic in that it does n't join the trigeminal nerve in order to get to its target tissues one nerve is the recurrent laryngeal nerve , which becomes the inferior laryngeal nerve each recurrent laryngeal nerve supplies the trachea and the esophagus with parasympathetic secretomotor innervation for glands associated with them ( and other fibers that are not pn ) these cardiac nerves go on to form cardiac and pulmonary plexuses around the heart and lungs as the main vagus nerves continue into the thorax they become intimately linked with the esophagus and sympathetic nerves from the sympathetic trunks to form the esophageal plexus these plexuses are composed of mixed autonomic nerve fibers ( parasympathetic and sympathetic ) and include the vesical , prostatic , rectal , uterovaginal , and inferior hypogastric plexuses the fiber paths are variable and each individual 's autonomic nervous system in the pelvis is unique the afferent fibers of the autonomic nervous system , which transmit sensory information from the internal organs of the body back to the central nervous system , are not divided into parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers as the efferent fibers are they have a minimal effect on the contractile forces of the ventricular muscle due to sparse innervation of the ventricles from the parasympathetic nervous system a useful mnemonic to summarize the functions of the parasympathetic nervous system is ssludd ( sexual arousal , salivation , tears , urination , digestion and defecation )

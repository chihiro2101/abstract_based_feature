the parasympathetic nerves are autonomic or visceral branches of the peripheral nervous system ( pns ) from these four ganglia the parasympathetic nerves complete their journey to target tissues via trigeminal branches ( ophthalmic nerve , maxillary nerve , mandibular nerve ) this differs from the sympathetic nervous system , where synapses between pre- and post-ganglionic efferent nerves in general occur at ganglia that are farther away from the target organ as in the sympathetic nervous system , efferent parasympathetic nerve signals are carried from the central nervous system to their targets by a system of two neurons the axons of presynaptic parasympathetic neurons are usually long , extending from the cns into a ganglion that is either very close to or embedded in their target organ the oculomotor pns fibers originate in the edinger-westphal nucleus in the central nervous system and travel through the superior orbital fissure to synapse in the ciliary ganglion located just behind the orbit ( eye ) there are two motors that are part of the oculomotor nerve known as the somatic motor and visceral motor the somatic motor is responsible for moving the eye in precise motions and for keeping the eye fixated on an object the preganglionic fibers originate within the cns in the superior salivatory nucleus and leave as the intermediate nerve ( which some consider a separate cranial nerve altogether ) to connect with the facial nerve just distal ( further out ) to it surfacing the central nervous system the greater petrosal nerve travels through the middle ear and eventually combines with the deep petrosal nerve ( sympathetic fibers ) to form the nerve of the pterygoid canal the parasympathetic fibers of the nerve of the pterygoid canal synapse at the pterygopalatine ganglion , which is closely associated with the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve ( cn v 2 ) the lesser palatine nerve synapses at the soft palate and controls sparse taste receptors and mucus glands the second parasympathetic branch that leaves the facial nerve is the chorda tympani after joining the lingual nerve , the preganglionic fibers synapse at the submandibular ganglion and send postganglionic fibers to the sublingual and submandibular salivary glands the preganglionic fibers depart cn ix as the tympanic nerve and continue to the middle ear where they make up a tympanic plexus on the cochlear promontory of the mesotympanum from the otic ganglion postganglionic parasympathetic fibers travel with the auriculotemporal nerve ( mandibular branch of trigeminal , cn v 3 ) to the parotid salivary gland another peculiarity is that the vagus has an autonomic ganglion associated with it at approximately the level of c1 vertebra one nerve is the recurrent laryngeal nerve , which becomes the inferior laryngeal nerve each recurrent laryngeal nerve supplies the trachea and the esophagus with parasympathetic secretomotor innervation for glands associated with them ( and other fibers that are not pn ) another nerve that comes off the vagus nerves approximately at the level of entering the thorax are the cardiac nerves these cardiac nerves go on to form cardiac and pulmonary plexuses around the heart and lungs this is very efficient as the major function of the vagus nerve from there on will be control of the gut smooth muscles and glands a study published in 2016 , suggests that all sacral autonomic output may be sympathetic ; indicating that the rectum , bladder and reproductive organs may only be innervated by the sympathetic nervous system at the same time , the two branches of the autonomic nervous system act in a complementary way increasing or slowing the heart rate a useful mnemonic to summarize the functions of the parasympathetic nervous system is ssludd ( sexual arousal , salivation , tears , urination , digestion and defecation ) the functions promoted by activity in the parasympathetic nervous system are associated with our day-to-day living

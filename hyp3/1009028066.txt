radiography ( originally called roentgenographs , named after the discoverer of x-rays , wilhelm r√∂ntgen ) are produced by transmitting x-rays through a patient the x-rays are projected through the body onto a detector ; an image is formed based on which rays pass through ( and are detected ) versus those that are absorbed or scattered in the patient ( and thus are not detected ) in film-screen radiography , an x-ray tube generates a beam of x-rays , which is aimed at the patient the x-rays that pass through the patient are filtered through a device called a grid or x-ray filter , to reduce scatter , and strike an undeveloped film , which is held tightly to a screen of light-emitting phosphors in a light-tight cassette film-screen radiography is being replaced by phosphor plate radiography but more recently by digital radiography ( dr ) and the eos imaging in the two latest systems , the x-rays strike sensors that converts the signals generated into digital information , which is transmitted and converted into an image displayed on a computer screen in digital radiography the sensors shape a plate , but in the eos system , which is a slot-scanning system , a linear sensor vertically scans the patient plain radiography was the only imaging modality available during the first 50 years of radiology due to its availability , speed , and lower costs compared to other modalities , radiography is often the first-line test of choice in radiologic diagnosis examples include various types of arthritis and pneumonia , bone tumors ( especially benign bone tumors ) , fractures , congenital skeletal anomalies , and certain kidney stones mammography and dxa are two applications of low energy projectional radiography , used for the evaluation for breast cancer and osteoporosis , respectively fluoroscopy and angiography are special applications of x-ray imaging , in which a fluorescent screen and image intensifier tube is connected to a closed-circuit television system radiocontrast agents are usually administered by swallowing or injecting into the body of the patient to delineate anatomy and functioning of the blood vessels , the genitourinary system , or the gastrointestinal tract ( gi tract ) iodine contrast may also be concentrated in abnormal areas more or less than in normal tissues and make abnormalities ( tumors , cysts , inflammation ) more conspicuous ct imaging uses x-rays in conjunction with computing algorithms to image the body in ct , an x-ray tube opposite an x-ray detector ( or detectors ) in a ring-shaped apparatus rotate around a patient , producing a computer-generated cross-sectional image ( tomogram ) ct is acquired in the axial plane , with coronal and sagittal images produced by computer reconstruction radiocontrast agents are often used with ct for enhanced delineation of anatomy although radiographs provide higher spatial resolution , ct can detect more subtle variations in attenuation of x-rays ( higher contrast resolution ) spiral multidetector ct uses 16 , 64 , 254 or more detectors during continuous motion of the patient through the radiation beam to obtain fine detail images in a short exam time the introduction of computed tomography in the early 1970s revolutionized diagnostic radiology by providing clinicians with images of real three-dimensional anatomic structures no ionizing radiation is involved , but the quality of the images obtained using ultrasound is highly dependent on the skill of the person ( ultrasonographer ) performing the exam and the patient 's body size because ultrasound imaging techniques do not employ ionizing radiation to generate images ( unlike radiography , and ct scans ) , they are generally considered safer and are therefore more common in obstetrical imaging an advantage of mri is its ability to produce images in axial , coronal , sagittal and multiple oblique planes with equal ease with advances in scanning speed and spatial resolution , and improvements in computer 3d algorithms and hardware , mri has become an important tool in musculoskeletal radiology and neuroradiology one disadvantage is the patient has to hold still for long periods of time in a noisy , cramped space while the imaging is performed however , for magnets with equivalent field strengths , there is often a trade-off between image quality and open design areas of potential advancement include functional imaging , cardiovascular mri , and mri-guided therapy nuclear medicine imaging involves the administration into the patient of radiopharmaceuticals consisting of substances with affinity for certain body tissues labeled with radioactive tracer the heart , lungs , thyroid , liver , brain , gallbladder , and bones are commonly evaluated for particular conditions using these techniques the excretory function of the kidneys , iodine-concentrating ability of the thyroid , blood flow to heart muscle , etc the principal imaging devices are the gamma camera and the pet scanner , which detect the radiation emitted by the tracer in the body and display it as an image following completion of residency training , radiologists may either begin practicing as a general diagnostic radiologist or enter into subspecialty training programs known as fellowships they are certified in either diagnostic radiology or radiation oncology by the american college of veterinary radiology during the first year of training , radiology trainees are expected to pass the first part of the fellowship of the royal college of radiologists ( frcr ) exam after achieving a certificate of completion of training ( cct ) , many fellowship posts exist in specialities such as neurointervention and vascular intervention , which would allow the ioctor to work as an interventional radiologist some radiologists may elect to complete a one or two-year fellowship for further sub-specialization in fields such as interventional radiology in the uk , interventional radiology was approved as a sub-specialty of clinical radiology in 2010

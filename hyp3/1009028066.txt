radiography ( originally called roentgenographs , named after the discoverer of x-rays , wilhelm r√∂ntgen ) are produced by transmitting x-rays through a patient in film-screen radiography , an x-ray tube generates a beam of x-rays , which is aimed at the patient film-screen radiography is being replaced by phosphor plate radiography but more recently by digital radiography ( dr ) and the eos imaging plain radiography was the only imaging modality available during the first 50 years of radiology due to its availability , speed , and lower costs compared to other modalities , radiography is often the first-line test of choice in radiologic diagnosis also despite the large amount of data in ct scans , mr scans and other digital-based imaging , there are many disease entities in which the classic diagnosis is obtained by plain radiographs mammography and dxa are two applications of low energy projectional radiography , used for the evaluation for breast cancer and osteoporosis , respectively fluoroscopy and angiography are special applications of x-ray imaging , in which a fluorescent screen and image intensifier tube is connected to a closed-circuit television system this allows real-time imaging of structures in motion or augmented with a radiocontrast agent these radiocontrast agents strongly absorb or scatter x-rays , and in conjunction with the real-time imaging , allow demonstration of dynamic processes , such as peristalsis in the digestive tract or blood flow in arteries and veins ct imaging uses x-rays in conjunction with computing algorithms to image the body ct is acquired in the axial plane , with coronal and sagittal images produced by computer reconstruction radiocontrast agents are often used with ct for enhanced delineation of anatomy the introduction of computed tomography in the early 1970s revolutionized diagnostic radiology by providing clinicians with images of real three-dimensional anatomic structures medical ultrasonography uses ultrasound ( high-frequency sound waves ) to visualize soft tissue structures in the body in real time examinations of larger , overweight patients may have a decrease in image quality as their subcutaneous fat absorbs more of the sound waves its use in medical imaging has developed mostly within the last 30 years the progression of pregnancies can be thoroughly evaluated with less concern about damage from the techniques employed , allowing early detection and diagnosis of many fetal anomalies color-flow doppler ultrasound measures the severity of peripheral vascular disease and is used by cardiologists for dynamic evaluation of the heart , heart valves and major vessels the radio signals are collected by small antennae , called coils , placed near the area of interest an advantage of mri is its ability to produce images in axial , coronal , sagittal and multiple oblique planes with equal ease mri scans give the best soft tissue contrast of all the imaging modalities with advances in scanning speed and spatial resolution , and improvements in computer 3d algorithms and hardware , mri has become an important tool in musculoskeletal radiology and neuroradiology areas of potential advancement include functional imaging , cardiovascular mri , and mri-guided therapy the principal imaging devices are the gamma camera and the pet scanner , which detect the radiation emitted by the tracer in the body and display it as an image in the most modern devices , nuclear medicine images can be fused with a ct scan taken quasisimultaneously , so the physiology information can be overlaid or coregistered with the anatomical structures to improve diagnostic accuracy the positrons annihilate to produce two opposite traveling gamma rays to be detected coincidentally , thus improving resolution pet/mri fusion , largely practiced in academic and research settings , could potentially play a crucial role in fine detail of brain imaging , breast cancer screening , and small joint imaging of the foot interventional radiology ( ir or sometimes vir for vascular and interventional radiology ) is a subspecialty of radiology in which minimally invasive procedures are performed using image guidance some of these procedures are done for purely diagnostic purposes ( e.g the basic concept behind interventional radiology is to diagnose or treat pathology , with the most minimally invasive technique possible these procedures are often performed with the patient fully awake , with little or no sedation required applicants are often near the top of their medical school classes , with high usmle ( board ) examination scores veterinary radiologists are veterinarians who specialize in the use of x-rays , ultrasound , mri and nuclear medicine for diagnostic imaging or treatment of disease in animals the society is a nonprofit organisation , run by radiology registrars specifically to promote radiology training and education in the uk some radiologists may elect to complete a one or two-year fellowship for further sub-specialization in fields such as interventional radiology specialty training for interventional radiology furthermore , the society provides an examination , the european board of interventional radiology ( ebir ) , which is a highly valuable qualification in interventional radiology based on the european curriculum and syllabus for ir .

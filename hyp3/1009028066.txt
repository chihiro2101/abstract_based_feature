radiography ( originally called roentgenographs , named after the discoverer of x-rays , wilhelm r√∂ntgen ) are produced by transmitting x-rays through a patient film-screen radiography is being replaced by phosphor plate radiography but more recently by digital radiography ( dr ) and the eos imaging in the two latest systems , the x-rays strike sensors that converts the signals generated into digital information , which is transmitted and converted into an image displayed on a computer screen plain radiography was the only imaging modality available during the first 50 years of radiology due to its availability , speed , and lower costs compared to other modalities , radiography is often the first-line test of choice in radiologic diagnosis also despite the large amount of data in ct scans , mr scans and other digital-based imaging , there are many disease entities in which the classic diagnosis is obtained by plain radiographs fluoroscopy and angiography are special applications of x-ray imaging , in which a fluorescent screen and image intensifier tube is connected to a closed-circuit television system these radiocontrast agents strongly absorb or scatter x-rays , and in conjunction with the real-time imaging , allow demonstration of dynamic processes , such as peristalsis in the digestive tract or blood flow in arteries and veins iodine contrast may also be concentrated in abnormal areas more or less than in normal tissues and make abnormalities ( tumors , cysts , inflammation ) more conspicuous ct imaging uses x-rays in conjunction with computing algorithms to image the body in ct , an x-ray tube opposite an x-ray detector ( or detectors ) in a ring-shaped apparatus rotate around a patient , producing a computer-generated cross-sectional image ( tomogram ) radiocontrast agents are often used with ct for enhanced delineation of anatomy although radiographs provide higher spatial resolution , ct can detect more subtle variations in attenuation of x-rays ( higher contrast resolution ) spiral multidetector ct uses 16 , 64 , 254 or more detectors during continuous motion of the patient through the radiation beam to obtain fine detail images in a short exam time continuing improvements in ct technology , including faster scanning times and improved resolution , have dramatically increased the accuracy and usefulness of ct scanning , which may partially account for increased use in medical diagnosis no ionizing radiation is involved , but the quality of the images obtained using ultrasound is highly dependent on the skill of the person ( ultrasonographer ) performing the exam and the patient 's body size ultrasound is also limited by its inability to image through air pockets ( lungs , bowel loops ) or bone its use in medical imaging has developed mostly within the last 30 years the first ultrasound images were static and two-dimensional ( 2d ) , but with modern ultrasonography , 3d reconstructions can be observed in real time , effectively becoming '' 4d '' because ultrasound imaging techniques do not employ ionizing radiation to generate images ( unlike radiography , and ct scans ) , they are generally considered safer and are therefore more common in obstetrical imaging a clot , embedded deep in one of the inner veins of the legs , can be found via ultrasound before it dislodges and travels to the lungs , resulting in a potentially fatal pulmonary embolism small , portable ultrasound devices now replace peritoneal lavage in trauma wards by non-invasively assessing for the presence of internal bleeding and any internal organ damage mri scans give the best soft tissue contrast of all the imaging modalities one disadvantage is the patient has to hold still for long periods of time in a noisy , cramped space while the imaging is performed claustrophobia ( fear of closed spaces ) severe enough to terminate the mri exam is reported in up to 5 % of patients nuclear medicine imaging involves the administration into the patient of radiopharmaceuticals consisting of substances with affinity for certain body tissues labeled with radioactive tracer in pet scanning , a radioactive , biologically active substance , most often 18f-fdg , is injected into a patient and the radiation emitted by the patient is detected to produce multiplanar images of the body pet images can be combined ( or '' fused '' ) with anatomic ( ct ) imaging , to more accurately localize pet findings and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy the technology recently blossomed after passing the technical hurdle of altered positron movement in strong magnetic field thus affecting the resolution of pet images and attenuation correction interventional radiology ( ir or sometimes vir for vascular and interventional radiology ) is a subspecialty of radiology in which minimally invasive procedures are performed using image guidance to be a trained interventionalist in the united states , an individual completes a five-year residency in radiology and a one- or two-year fellowship in ir however , beforehand the geometrical adjustment and general alignment of optical density should be done another possibility of radiographic image analysis is to study second order features , e.g radiology is a field in medicine that has expanded rapidly after 2000 due to advances in computer technology , which is closely linked to modern imaging techniques examples of subspeciality training in radiology include abdominal imaging , thoracic imaging , cross-sectional/ultrasound , mri , musculoskeletal imaging , interventional radiology , neuroradiology , interventional neuroradiology , paediatric radiology , nuclear medicine , emergency radiology , breast imaging and women 's imaging recruitment and selection into training post in clinical radiology posts in england , scotland and wales is done by an annual nationally coordinated process lasting from november to march the society is a nonprofit organisation , run by radiology registrars specifically to promote radiology training and education in the uk training for interventional radiology occurs in the residency portion of medical education , and has gone through developments in 2006 sir proposed a pathway resulting in certification in ir as a speciality ; this was eventually accepted by the abr in 2007 and was presented to the american board of medical specialities ( abms ) in 2009 , which rejected it because it did not include enough diagnostic radiology ( dr ) training

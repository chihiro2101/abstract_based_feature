r√∂ntgen discovered x-rays on november 8 , 1895 and received the first nobel prize in physics for their discovery in 1901 film-screen radiography is being replaced by phosphor plate radiography but more recently by digital radiography ( dr ) and the eos imaging in the two latest systems , the x-rays strike sensors that converts the signals generated into digital information , which is transmitted and converted into an image displayed on a computer screen in digital radiography the sensors shape a plate , but in the eos system , which is a slot-scanning system , a linear sensor vertically scans the patient plain radiography was the only imaging modality available during the first 50 years of radiology due to its availability , speed , and lower costs compared to other modalities , radiography is often the first-line test of choice in radiologic diagnosis also despite the large amount of data in ct scans , mr scans and other digital-based imaging , there are many disease entities in which the classic diagnosis is obtained by plain radiographs mammography and dxa are two applications of low energy projectional radiography , used for the evaluation for breast cancer and osteoporosis , respectively fluoroscopy and angiography are special applications of x-ray imaging , in which a fluorescent screen and image intensifier tube is connected to a closed-circuit television system radiocontrast agents are usually administered by swallowing or injecting into the body of the patient to delineate anatomy and functioning of the blood vessels , the genitourinary system , or the gastrointestinal tract ( gi tract ) ct imaging uses x-rays in conjunction with computing algorithms to image the body ct is acquired in the axial plane , with coronal and sagittal images produced by computer reconstruction with rapid administration of intravenous contrast during the ct scan , these fine detail images can be reconstructed into three-dimensional ( 3d ) images of carotid , cerebral , coronary or other arteries the introduction of computed tomography in the early 1970s revolutionized diagnostic radiology by providing clinicians with images of real three-dimensional anatomic structures continuing improvements in ct technology , including faster scanning times and improved resolution , have dramatically increased the accuracy and usefulness of ct scanning , which may partially account for increased use in medical diagnosis medical ultrasonography uses ultrasound ( high-frequency sound waves ) to visualize soft tissue structures in the body in real time examinations of larger , overweight patients may have a decrease in image quality as their subcutaneous fat absorbs more of the sound waves ultrasound is also limited by its inability to image through air pockets ( lungs , bowel loops ) or bone its use in medical imaging has developed mostly within the last 30 years the first ultrasound images were static and two-dimensional ( 2d ) , but with modern ultrasonography , 3d reconstructions can be observed in real time , effectively becoming '' 4d '' an advantage of mri is its ability to produce images in axial , coronal , sagittal and multiple oblique planes with equal ease mri scans give the best soft tissue contrast of all the imaging modalities one disadvantage is the patient has to hold still for long periods of time in a noisy , cramped space while the imaging is performed recent improvements in magnet design including stronger magnetic fields ( 3 teslas ) , shortening exam times , wider , shorter magnet bores and more open magnet designs , have brought some relief for claustrophobic patients mri has great benefit in imaging the brain , spine , and musculoskeletal system areas of potential advancement include functional imaging , cardiovascular mri , and mri-guided therapy nuclear medicine imaging involves the administration into the patient of radiopharmaceuticals consisting of substances with affinity for certain body tissues labeled with radioactive tracer the most commonly used tracers are technetium-99m , iodine-123 , iodine-131 , gallium-67 , indium-111 , thallium-201 and fludeoxyglucose ( 18f ) ( 18f-fdg ) with computer processing , the information can be displayed as axial , coronal and sagittal images ( single-photon emission computed tomography - spect or positron-emission tomography - pet ) pet images can be combined ( or '' fused '' ) with anatomic ( ct ) imaging , to more accurately localize pet findings and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy pet/mri fusion , largely practiced in academic and research settings , could potentially play a crucial role in fine detail of brain imaging , breast cancer screening , and small joint imaging of the foot interventional radiology ( ir or sometimes vir for vascular and interventional radiology ) is a subspecialty of radiology in which minimally invasive procedures are performed using image guidance radiographic images , fluoroscopy , and ultrasound modalities are used for guidance , and the primary instruments used during the procedure are specialized needles and catheters radiology is a field in medicine that has expanded rapidly after 2000 due to advances in computer technology , which is closely linked to modern imaging techniques certification may also be obtained from the american osteopathic board of radiology ( aobr ) and the american board of physician specialties during this time , doctors rotate into different subspecialities , such as paediatrics , musculoskeletal or neuroradiology , and breast imaging training for interventional radiology occurs in the residency portion of medical education , and has gone through developments in the uk , interventional radiology was approved as a sub-specialty of clinical radiology in 2010

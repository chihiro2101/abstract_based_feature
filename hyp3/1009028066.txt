radiography ( originally called roentgenographs , named after the discoverer of x-rays , wilhelm r√∂ntgen ) are produced by transmitting x-rays through a patient the x-rays are projected through the body onto a detector ; an image is formed based on which rays pass through ( and are detected ) versus those that are absorbed or scattered in the patient ( and thus are not detected ) in film-screen radiography , an x-ray tube generates a beam of x-rays , which is aimed at the patient film-screen radiography is being replaced by phosphor plate radiography but more recently by digital radiography ( dr ) and the eos imaging in digital radiography the sensors shape a plate , but in the eos system , which is a slot-scanning system , a linear sensor vertically scans the patient plain radiography was the only imaging modality available during the first 50 years of radiology due to its availability , speed , and lower costs compared to other modalities , radiography is often the first-line test of choice in radiologic diagnosis fluoroscopy and angiography are special applications of x-ray imaging , in which a fluorescent screen and image intensifier tube is connected to a closed-circuit television system iodine contrast may also be concentrated in abnormal areas more or less than in normal tissues and make abnormalities ( tumors , cysts , inflammation ) more conspicuous ct imaging uses x-rays in conjunction with computing algorithms to image the body ct is acquired in the axial plane , with coronal and sagittal images produced by computer reconstruction spiral multidetector ct uses 16 , 64 , 254 or more detectors during continuous motion of the patient through the radiation beam to obtain fine detail images in a short exam time with rapid administration of intravenous contrast during the ct scan , these fine detail images can be reconstructed into three-dimensional ( 3d ) images of carotid , cerebral , coronary or other arteries the introduction of computed tomography in the early 1970s revolutionized diagnostic radiology by providing clinicians with images of real three-dimensional anatomic structures continuing improvements in ct technology , including faster scanning times and improved resolution , have dramatically increased the accuracy and usefulness of ct scanning , which may partially account for increased use in medical diagnosis medical ultrasonography uses ultrasound ( high-frequency sound waves ) to visualize soft tissue structures in the body in real time ultrasound is also limited by its inability to image through air pockets ( lungs , bowel loops ) or bone its use in medical imaging has developed mostly within the last 30 years the first ultrasound images were static and two-dimensional ( 2d ) , but with modern ultrasonography , 3d reconstructions can be observed in real time , effectively becoming '' 4d '' color-flow doppler ultrasound measures the severity of peripheral vascular disease and is used by cardiologists for dynamic evaluation of the heart , heart valves and major vessels ultrasounds is useful as a guide to performing biopsy to minimise damage to surrounding tissues and in drainages such as thoracentesis an advantage of mri is its ability to produce images in axial , coronal , sagittal and multiple oblique planes with equal ease mri scans give the best soft tissue contrast of all the imaging modalities one disadvantage is the patient has to hold still for long periods of time in a noisy , cramped space while the imaging is performed nuclear medicine imaging involves the administration into the patient of radiopharmaceuticals consisting of substances with affinity for certain body tissues labeled with radioactive tracer the most commonly used tracers are technetium-99m , iodine-123 , iodine-131 , gallium-67 , indium-111 , thallium-201 and fludeoxyglucose ( 18f ) ( 18f-fdg ) while anatomy detail is limited in these studies , nuclear medicine is useful in displaying physiology function the principal imaging devices are the gamma camera and the pet scanner , which detect the radiation emitted by the tracer in the body and display it as an image the fusion technology has gone further to combine pet and mri similar to pet and ct pet/mri fusion , largely practiced in academic and research settings , could potentially play a crucial role in fine detail of brain imaging , breast cancer screening , and small joint imaging of the foot the basic concept behind interventional radiology is to diagnose or treat pathology , with the most minimally invasive technique possible minimally invasive procedures are currently performed more than ever before to be a trained interventionalist in the united states , an individual completes a five-year residency in radiology and a one- or two-year fellowship in ir following completion of residency training , radiologists may either begin practicing as a general diagnostic radiologist or enter into subspecialty training programs known as fellowships fellowship training programs in radiology are usually one or two years in length they are certified in either diagnostic radiology or radiation oncology by the american college of veterinary radiology some radiologists may elect to complete a one or two-year fellowship for further sub-specialization in fields such as interventional radiology in the uk , interventional radiology was approved as a sub-specialty of clinical radiology in 2010

radiography ( originally called roentgenographs , named after the discoverer of x-rays , wilhelm r√∂ntgen ) are produced by transmitting x-rays through a patient the x-rays are projected through the body onto a detector ; an image is formed based on which rays pass through ( and are detected ) versus those that are absorbed or scattered in the patient ( and thus are not detected ) in film-screen radiography , an x-ray tube generates a beam of x-rays , which is aimed at the patient film-screen radiography is being replaced by phosphor plate radiography but more recently by digital radiography ( dr ) and the eos imaging plain radiography was the only imaging modality available during the first 50 years of radiology also despite the large amount of data in ct scans , mr scans and other digital-based imaging , there are many disease entities in which the classic diagnosis is obtained by plain radiographs fluoroscopy and angiography are special applications of x-ray imaging , in which a fluorescent screen and image intensifier tube is connected to a closed-circuit television system ct imaging uses x-rays in conjunction with computing algorithms to image the body in ct , an x-ray tube opposite an x-ray detector ( or detectors ) in a ring-shaped apparatus rotate around a patient , producing a computer-generated cross-sectional image ( tomogram ) ct is acquired in the axial plane , with coronal and sagittal images produced by computer reconstruction radiocontrast agents are often used with ct for enhanced delineation of anatomy although radiographs provide higher spatial resolution , ct can detect more subtle variations in attenuation of x-rays ( higher contrast resolution ) with rapid administration of intravenous contrast during the ct scan , these fine detail images can be reconstructed into three-dimensional ( 3d ) images of carotid , cerebral , coronary or other arteries the introduction of computed tomography in the early 1970s revolutionized diagnostic radiology by providing clinicians with images of real three-dimensional anatomic structures no ionizing radiation is involved , but the quality of the images obtained using ultrasound is highly dependent on the skill of the person ( ultrasonographer ) performing the exam and the patient 's body size examinations of larger , overweight patients may have a decrease in image quality as their subcutaneous fat absorbs more of the sound waves this results in fewer sound waves penetrating to organs and reflecting back to the transducer , resulting in loss of information and a poorer quality image the first ultrasound images were static and two-dimensional ( 2d ) , but with modern ultrasonography , 3d reconstructions can be observed in real time , effectively becoming '' 4d '' because ultrasound imaging techniques do not employ ionizing radiation to generate images ( unlike radiography , and ct scans ) , they are generally considered safer and are therefore more common in obstetrical imaging color-flow doppler ultrasound measures the severity of peripheral vascular disease and is used by cardiologists for dynamic evaluation of the heart , heart valves and major vessels a clot , embedded deep in one of the inner veins of the legs , can be found via ultrasound before it dislodges and travels to the lungs , resulting in a potentially fatal pulmonary embolism mri scans give the best soft tissue contrast of all the imaging modalities one disadvantage is the patient has to hold still for long periods of time in a noisy , cramped space while the imaging is performed the principal imaging devices are the gamma camera and the pet scanner , which detect the radiation emitted by the tracer in the body and display it as an image with computer processing , the information can be displayed as axial , coronal and sagittal images ( single-photon emission computed tomography - spect or positron-emission tomography - pet ) in pet scanning , a radioactive , biologically active substance , most often 18f-fdg , is injected into a patient and the radiation emitted by the patient is detected to produce multiplanar images of the body pet images can be combined ( or '' fused '' ) with anatomic ( ct ) imaging , to more accurately localize pet findings and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy interventional radiology ( ir or sometimes vir for vascular and interventional radiology ) is a subspecialty of radiology in which minimally invasive procedures are performed using image guidance these procedures are often performed with the patient fully awake , with little or no sedation required by minimizing the physical trauma to the patient , peripheral interventions can reduce infection rates and recovery times , as well as hospital stays the american board of radiology ( abr ) administers professional certification in diagnostic radiology , radiation oncology and medical physics as well as subspecialty certification in neuroradiology , nuclear radiology , pediatric radiology and vascular and interventional radiology following completion of residency training , radiologists may either begin practicing as a general diagnostic radiologist or enter into subspecialty training programs known as fellowships during the first year of training , radiology trainees are expected to pass the first part of the fellowship of the royal college of radiologists ( frcr ) exam the radiology training course is a post graduate 3-year program ( md/dnb radiology ) or a 2-year diploma ( dmrd ) in 2000 , the society of interventional radiology ( sir ) created a program named '' clinical pathway in ir '' , which modified the '' holman pathway '' that was already accepted by the american board of radiology to including training in ir ; this was accepted by abr but was not widely adopted in 2006 sir proposed a pathway resulting in certification in ir as a speciality ; this was eventually accepted by the abr in 2007 and was presented to the american board of medical specialities ( abms ) in 2009 , which rejected it because it did not include enough diagnostic radiology ( dr ) training in europe the field followed its own pathway ; for example in germany the parallel interventional society began to break free of the dr society in 2008 in the uk , interventional radiology was approved as a sub-specialty of clinical radiology in 2010

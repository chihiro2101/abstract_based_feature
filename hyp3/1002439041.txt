during the late 1960s , engineers geoff larkby and barry pyatt , at the designs department ( television group ) of the bbc , worked on an experimental analogue text transmission system the idea was later taken up again , this time in digital and on-screen form , under the new name of ceefax , and the new system was announced in october 1972 , and following test transmissions in 1972â€“74 , the ceefax system went live on 23 september 1974 with thirty pages of information after technical negotiations , the two broadcasters settled in 1974 on a single standard , different from both ceefax and oracle , which ultimately developed into world system teletext ( 1976 ) , and which remained in use for analogue broadcasts until 2012 the technology became the standard european teletext system and replaced other standards , including the antiope system formerly used in france the basic technology of ceefax remained compatible with the 1976 unified rollout ; system elaborations in later years were made such that earlier receivers were still able to do a basic decode of pages , but would simply ignore enhanced information rather than showing corrupted data in 2002 , the bbc stopped broadcasting ceefax on the digital satellite sky digital service , but later brought back a limited service including a tv schedule for bbc one and bbc two ; and subtitles the bbc has tried to reuse the old ceefax page numbers where possible on the freeview and digital satellite bbc red button ceefax-replacement services how we assign our page numbers bbc blogs it was announced that ceefax would not be replaced when the analogue signal was switched off in october 2012 the bbc red button service was seen as an alternative to ceefax and since 2007 the number of regions with a ceefax supported analogue signal had declined as digital switchover progressed across the uk ceefax was the last remaining text service available via analogue tv transmissions in the uk , as itv and channel 4 's teletext service closed in december 2009 in september 2019 , the bbc announced that the red button service would be discontinued in 2020 , ending 45 years of text content delivery via tv broadcast pages from ceefax was a selection of content from the ceefax service and normally only shown in the absence of any other programming the limited set of rolling pages shown on pages from ceefax had been accessible at any time of day on teletext-equipped televisions on page 198 ( bbc1 ) and 298 ( bbc2 ) , moving to page 196 in 1992 and to page 152 in november 1996 this situation continued until monday 27 october 1986 , when bbc1 launched a full daytime schedule , resulting in the only ceefax transmission on bbc1 being the weekday 6.00am ceefax am broadcast the last pages from ceefax broadcast on bbc1 was on 9 november 1997 but they continued to be broadcast on bbc2 until the ceefax service was closed down bbc ceefax at bbc online last day of ceefax bbc news article celebrating 30th anniversary of ceefax online representation of ceefax as it looked in november 2009

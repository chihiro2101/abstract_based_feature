the allies first expressed their principles and vision for the world after world war ii in the declaration of st james 's palace in june 1941 us president franklin roosevelt and british prime minister winston churchill discussed what would become the atlantic charter in 1941 during the atlantic conference in placentia bay , newfoundland since the policy was issued as a statement , there was no formal , legal document called '' atlantic charter '' it detailed goals and aims for the war and for the postwar world 4 , 6 roosevelt 's attempts to tie britain to concrete war aims and churchill 's desperation to bind the us to the war effort helped to provide motivations for the meeting that produced the atlantic charter it was assumed at the time that the british and the americans would have an equal role to play in any postwar international organization that would be based on the charter 's principles the atlantic charter made it clear that the united states supported britain in the war both wanted to present their unity regarding their mutual principles and hopes for a peaceful postwar world and the policies that they agreed to follow once germany had been defeated 5 a fundamental aim was to focus on the peace that would follow , not specific american involvement and war strategy , although american involvement appeared increasingly likely o'sullivan and welles there were eight principal clauses of the charter : no territorial gains were to be sought by the united states or the united kingdom '' that was a repudiation of the punitive trade relations that had been established within europe after world war i , as exemplified by the paris economy pact only two clauses expressly discussed the national , social , and economic conditions that would be necessary after the war , despite their significance '' the labour party newspaper daily herald coined the name atlantic charter , but churchill used it in the british parliament on 24 august 1941 , which has since been generally adopted the document was threshed out through several drafts , and the final agreed text was telegraphed to london and washington , dc on 1 january 1942 , a larger group of nations , which adhered to the charter 's principles , issued a joint declaration by united nations , which stressed their solidarity in the defence against hitlerism the text cited the charter as the authoritative statement of the joint commitment of britain and the united states '' not to admit any economical discrimination of those defeated '' and promised that '' germany and the other states can again achieve enduring peace and prosperity '' with a war that could be won only with the help of those allies , roosevelt 's solution was to put some pressure on britain but to postpone the issue of self-determination of the colonies until after the war during the war , churchill argued for an interpretation of the charter that would allow the soviet union to continue to control the baltic states , an interpretation that was rejected by the united states until march 1944 allies of world war ii diplomatic history of world war ii fourteen points list of allied world war ii conferences history of the united nations united kingdomâ€“united states relations

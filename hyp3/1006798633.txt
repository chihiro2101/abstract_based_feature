the allies first expressed their principles and vision for the world after world war ii in the declaration of st james 's palace in june 1941 us president franklin roosevelt and british prime minister winston churchill discussed what would become the atlantic charter in 1941 during the atlantic conference in placentia bay , newfoundland since the policy was issued as a statement , there was no formal , legal document called '' atlantic charter '' it detailed goals and aims for the war and for the postwar world many of the charter 's ideas came from an ideology of anglo-american internationalism , which sought british-american co-operation for international security 4 , 6 roosevelt 's attempts to tie britain to concrete war aims and churchill 's desperation to bind the us to the war effort helped to provide motivations for the meeting that produced the atlantic charter the atlantic charter made it clear that the united states supported britain in the war o'sullivan and welles there were eight principal clauses of the charter : no territorial gains were to be sought by the united states or the united kingdom there was to be disarmament of aggressor nations and a common disarmament after the war the third clause clearly stated that all peoples have the right to decide their form of government but failed to say what changes are necessary in both social and economic terms to achieve freedom and peace 21 the fourth clause , with respect to international trade , consciously emphasized that both '' victor and vanquished '' would be given market access '' on equal terms '' the labour party newspaper daily herald coined the name atlantic charter , but churchill used it in the british parliament on 24 august 1941 , which has since been generally adopted on 1 january 1942 , a larger group of nations , which adhered to the charter 's principles , issued a joint declaration by united nations , which stressed their solidarity in the defence against hitlerism in tokyo , the atlantic charter rallied support for the militarists in the japanese government , which pushed for a more aggressive approach against the united states and britain 395–420 the british were forced to agree to those aims , but in a september 1941 speech , churchill stated that the charter was meant to apply only to states under german occupation , certainly not to those that were part of the british empire gandhi refused to help the british or the american war effort against germany and japan in any way , and roosevelt chose to back churchill '' the united states refused to recognize the soviet takeover of the baltic states but did not press the issue against stalin while he was fighting the germans roosevelt admiral ernest king , us navy admiral harold r allies of world war ii diplomatic history of world war ii fourteen points list of allied world war ii conferences history of the united nations united kingdom–united states relations

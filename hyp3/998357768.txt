when the erm was set up in 1979 , the united kingdom declined to join matters came to a head in a clash between lawson and prime minister margaret thatcher 's economic adviser alan walters , when walters claimed that the exchange rate mechanism was '' half baked '' this led to lawson 's resignation as chancellor ; he was replaced by former treasury chief secretary john major who , with douglas hurd , the then foreign secretary , convinced the cabinet to sign britain up to the erm in october 1990 , effectively guaranteeing that the british government would follow an economic and monetary policy preventing the exchange rate between the pound and other member currencies from fluctuating by more than 6 % in 1989 , the uk had inflation three times the rate of germany , higher interest rates at 15 % , and much lower labour productivity than france and germany , which indicated the uk 's different economic state in comparison to other erm countries from the beginning of the 1990s , high german interest rates , set by the bundesbank to counteract inflationary effects related to excess expenditure on german reunification , caused significant stress across the whole of the erm the uk and italy had additional difficulties with their double deficits , while the uk was also hurt by the rapid depreciation of the united states dollar – a currency in which many british exports were priced – that summer issues of national prestige and the commitment to a doctrine that the fixing of exchange rates within the erm was a pathway to a single european currency inhibited the adjustment of exchange rates soros believed the rate at which the united kingdom was brought into the exchange rate mechanism was too high , inflation was too high ( triple the german rate ) , and british interest rates were hurting their asset prices john major raised interest rates to 10 % and authorised the spending of billions of pounds of foreign currency reserves to buy up sterling being sold on the currency markets at 10:30 am on 16 september , the british government announced an increase in the base interest rate , from an already high 10 % , to 12 % to tempt speculators to buy pounds by 7:00 that evening , lamont announced britain would leave the erm and rates would remain at the new level of 12 % ; however , on the next day the interest rate was back to 10 % some commentators , following norman tebbit , took to referring to erm as an '' eternal recession mechanism '' after the uk fell into recession during the early 1990s black wednesday was a major factor in the conservatives finally losing the 1997 general election to labour , who won by a landslide under the leadership of tony blair

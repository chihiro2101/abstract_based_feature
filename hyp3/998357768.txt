when the erm was set up in 1979 , the united kingdom declined to join thus , although the uk had not joined the erm , from early 1987 to march 1988 the treasury followed a semi-official policy of 'shadowing ' the deutsche mark this led to lawson 's resignation as chancellor ; he was replaced by former treasury chief secretary john major who , with douglas hurd , the then foreign secretary , convinced the cabinet to sign britain up to the erm in october 1990 , effectively guaranteeing that the british government would follow an economic and monetary policy preventing the exchange rate between the pound and other member currencies from fluctuating by more than 6 % on 8 october 1990 , thatcher entered the pound into the erm at dm 2.95 to the pound hence , if the exchange rate ever neared the bottom of its permitted range , dm 2.773 ( €1.4178 at the dm/euro conversion rate ) , the government would be obliged to intervene in 1989 , the uk had inflation three times the rate of germany , higher interest rates at 15 % , and much lower labour productivity than france and germany , which indicated the uk 's different economic state in comparison to other erm countries issues of national prestige and the commitment to a doctrine that the fixing of exchange rates within the erm was a pathway to a single european currency inhibited the adjustment of exchange rates in the wake of the rejection of the maastricht treaty by the danish electorate in a referendum in the spring of 1992 , and an announcement that there would be a referendum in france as well , those erm currencies that were trading close to the bottom of their erm bands came under pressure from foreign exchange traders soros believed the rate at which the united kingdom was brought into the exchange rate mechanism was too high , inflation was too high ( triple the german rate ) , and british interest rates were hurting their asset prices when the markets opened in london the next morning , the bank of england began their attempt to prop up their currency , as decided by norman lamont ( chancellor of the exchequer ) and robin leigh-pemberton ( governor of the bank of england ) the bank of england continued to buy , and traders continued to sell , until lamont told prime minister john major that their pound purchasing was failing to produce results the effect of the low german interest rates , and high british interest rates , had arguably put britain into recession as large numbers of businesses failed and the housing market crashed george soros made over £1 & nbsp ; billion in profit by short selling sterling

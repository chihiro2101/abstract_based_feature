matters came to a head in a clash between lawson and prime minister margaret thatcher 's economic adviser alan walters , when walters claimed that the exchange rate mechanism was '' half baked '' this led to lawson 's resignation as chancellor ; he was replaced by former treasury chief secretary john major who , with douglas hurd , the then foreign secretary , convinced the cabinet to sign britain up to the erm in october 1990 , effectively guaranteeing that the british government would follow an economic and monetary policy preventing the exchange rate between the pound and other member currencies from fluctuating by more than 6 % on 8 october 1990 , thatcher entered the pound into the erm at dm 2.95 to the pound in 1989 , the uk had inflation three times the rate of germany , higher interest rates at 15 % , and much lower labour productivity than france and germany , which indicated the uk 's different economic state in comparison to other erm countries the uk and italy had additional difficulties with their double deficits , while the uk was also hurt by the rapid depreciation of the united states dollar – a currency in which many british exports were priced – that summer issues of national prestige and the commitment to a doctrine that the fixing of exchange rates within the erm was a pathway to a single european currency inhibited the adjustment of exchange rates in the wake of the rejection of the maastricht treaty by the danish electorate in a referendum in the spring of 1992 , and an announcement that there would be a referendum in france as well , those erm currencies that were trading close to the bottom of their erm bands came under pressure from foreign exchange traders soros believed the rate at which the united kingdom was brought into the exchange rate mechanism was too high , inflation was too high ( triple the german rate ) , and british interest rates were hurting their asset prices the uk government attempted to prop up the depreciating pound to avoid withdrawal from the monetary system the country had joined only two years earlier john major raised interest rates to 10 % and authorised the spending of billions of pounds of foreign currency reserves to buy up sterling being sold on the currency markets by 7:00 that evening , lamont announced britain would leave the erm and rates would remain at the new level of 12 % ; however , on the next day the interest rate was back to 10 % the effect of the low german interest rates , and high british interest rates , had arguably put britain into recession as large numbers of businesses failed and the housing market crashed black wednesday was a major factor in the conservatives finally losing the 1997 general election to labour , who won by a landslide under the leadership of tony blair

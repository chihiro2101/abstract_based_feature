reflecting the original purpose of transporting people and luggage between estate ( land ) and railway stations , the body style is called an '' estate car '' or '' estate '' in the united kingdom , or a '' station wagon '' in north america , new zealand , australian and africa in the united states , early models with exposed wooden bodies became known as woodies station wagons have been marketed using the french term '' break de chasse '' ( sometimes abbreviated to '' break '' ) , which translates as '' hunting break '' , due to shared ancestry with the shooting-brake body style examples include '' avant '' , '' caravan '' , '' kombi '' , '' sports tourer '' , '' sports wagon , '' tourer '' , '' touring '' and '' variant '' station wagons and hatchbacks have in common a two-box design configuration , a shared interior volume for passengers and cargo and a rear door ( often called a tailgate in the case of a wagon ) that is hinged at roof level folding rear seats ( in order to create a larger space for cargo ) are also common on both station wagons and hatchbacks distinguishing features between hatchbacks and station wagons are : d-pillar : station wagons are more likely to have a d-pillar ( hatchbacks and station wagons both have a- , b- and c-pillars ) cargo volume : station wagons prioritize passenger and cargo volume — with windows beside the cargo volume other differences are more variable and can potentially include : cargo floor contour : a station wagon often has a fold-flat floor ( for increased cargo capacity ) , whereas a hatchback is more likely to have a cargo floor with a pronounced contour seating : some station wagons have three rows of seats , whereas a hatchback will have two at most the rearmost row of seating in a station wagon is often located in the cargo area and can be front-facing , rear-facing , or side-facing rear door : hatchbacks usually feature a top-hinged liftgate for cargo access , with variations ranging from a two-part lift-gate to a complex tailgate that can function either as a full tailgate or as a trunk/boot lid station wagons have also been equipped with numerous tailgate designs the split gate features an upward-swinging window combined with a downward swinging tailgate , both manually operated later in the decade , electric power was applied to the tailgate window—it could be operated from the driver 's seat , as well as by the keyhole in the rear door side hinge : a side-hinged tailgate that opened like a door was offered on some three-seat station wagons to make it easier for the back row passengers to enter and exit their rear-facing seats the configuration appeared on the studebaker wagonaire station wagon and 2003 gmc envoy similar configurations became the standard on full-size and intermediate station wagons from gm , ford , chrysler , and amc the subsequent generation of gm 's full-size station wagons returned to the upward-lifting rear window as had been used in the 1940s

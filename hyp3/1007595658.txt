in the united states , early models with exposed wooden bodies became known as woodies station wagons have been marketed using the french term '' break de chasse '' ( sometimes abbreviated to '' break '' ) , which translates as '' hunting break '' , due to shared ancestry with the shooting-brake body style manufacturers may designate station wagons across various model lines with a proprietary nameplate station wagons and hatchbacks have in common a two-box design configuration , a shared interior volume for passengers and cargo and a rear door ( often called a tailgate in the case of a wagon ) that is hinged at roof level folding rear seats ( in order to create a larger space for cargo ) are also common on both station wagons and hatchbacks distinguishing features between hatchbacks and station wagons are : d-pillar : station wagons are more likely to have a d-pillar ( hatchbacks and station wagons both have a- , b- and c-pillars ) cargo volume : station wagons prioritize passenger and cargo volume — with windows beside the cargo volume seating : some station wagons have three rows of seats , whereas a hatchback will have two at most rear suspension : a station wagon may include reconfigured rear suspension for additional load capacity and to minimize intrusion in the cargo volume '' you could have a 90-degree break in the back and have a station wagon later in the decade , electric power was applied to the tailgate window—it could be operated from the driver 's seat , as well as by the keyhole in the rear door these have a retractable rear roof section as well as a conventional rear tailgate that folded down to carry tall objects that would not fit otherwise on the clam shell design , the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof and the lower tailgate ( with either manual or optional power operation ) , lowered completely below the load floor the power operation of both upper glass and lower tailgate became standard equipment in later model years station wagons with the design featured an optional third row of forward-facing seats accessed by the rear side doors and a folding second-row seat — and could accommodate a 4 x 8 ' sheet of plywood with rear seats folded the subsequent generation of gm 's full-size station wagons returned to the upward-lifting rear window as had been used in the 1940s swing-up window : an upward-lifting , full-height , full-width rear door , where the window on the rear door can be opened independently from the rear door itself the 1994 audi rs2 , developed in conjunction with porsche , is considered the world 's first performance station wagon the first station wagons were built in around 1910 , by independent manufacturers producing wooden custom bodies for the ford model t chassis the framing of the wooden bodies was sheathed in steel and coated with tinted lacquer for protection in 1922 , the essex ( automobile ) became the first mass-produced car to use a steel body ( in this case , a fully enclosed sedan body style ) the first all-steel station wagon body was the 1935 chevrolet suburban by 1951 , most station wagons were being produced with all-steel bodies the commercial vehicle status was also reflected on those vehicles ' registrations for example , there were special '' suburban '' license plates in pennsylvania used well into the 1960s , long after station wagons became car-based one of the first builders of wagon bodies was the stoughton wagon company from wisconsin , who begun putting custom wagon bodies on the ford model t chassis in 1919 and by 1929 the ford motor company was the biggest producer of chassis ' for station wagons since ford owned its own hardwood forest and mills ( at the ford iron mountain plant in what is today kingsford , michigan in michigan 's upper peninsula ) it began supplying the wood components for the model a station wagon the first mass-produced steel-bodied station wagon was the 1946 willys station wagon , based on the chassis of the jeep cj-2a the first postwar station wagon to be based on a passenger car chassis was the 1949 plymouth suburban , which used a two-door body style several manufacturers produced steel and wooden-bodied station wagons concurrently for several years the final wooden bodied station produced in the united states was the 1953 buick super estate gm eliminated the pillarless wagon from its lineup in 1959 , while amc and ford exited the field beginning with their 1960 and 1961 vehicles , leaving chrysler and dodge with the body style through the 1964 model year station wagons remained popular in europe and in locations where emissions and efficiency regulations did not distinguish between cars and light trucks the emergence and popularity of suvs which closely approximate the traditional station wagon body style was a further blow the ford taurus wagon was discontinued in 2005 and the ford focus station wagon was discontinued in 2008 imported station wagons , despite remaining popular in other countries , struggled in the united states european luxury car manufacturers such as audi , volvo , bmw , and mercedes-benz continued to offer station wagons in their north american product ranges ( marketed using the labels '' avant '' , '' touring '' , and '' estate '' respectively ) in 2012 , the volvo v50 compact station wagon was withdrawn from the u.s from the 1950s to 1990s , many full-size american station wagons could be optioned with a third row of seating in the cargo area ( over the rear axle ) for a total of nine seats some larger station wagon models are available with a third row of seats , such as the rear-facing jump seat for two passengers in the cargo area of the mercedes-benz e-class wagon the successors to the id , the citroën cx and citroën xm continued to be amongst the largest station wagon cars produced in europe , but the model was discontinued in 2000 and a station wagon version was not available for its citroën c6 successor following a hiatus in station wagon production since the saab 95 ended production in 1978 , the comany introduced the four-door saab 9-5 station wagon in 1997 , which was produced until 2010 models marketed as passenger station wagons in export markets were often sold as utilitarian '' van '' models in the home market station wagons remain popular in japan , although they are in slow decline as the suvs and minivans have taken over a large portion of this market the holden 's main competitor , the ford falcon ( xk ) introduced wagon models in 1960 ford and holden produced wagon models based on each generation of their large sedan platforms until 2010

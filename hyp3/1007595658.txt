reflecting the original purpose of transporting people and luggage between estate ( land ) and railway stations , the body style is called an '' estate car '' or '' estate '' in the united kingdom , or a '' station wagon '' in north america , new zealand , australian and africa in the united states , early models with exposed wooden bodies became known as woodies in germany , the term '' kombi '' is used , short for kombinationskraftwagen ( '' combination motor vehicle '' ) station wagons and hatchbacks have in common a two-box design configuration , a shared interior volume for passengers and cargo and a rear door ( often called a tailgate in the case of a wagon ) that is hinged at roof level folding rear seats ( in order to create a larger space for cargo ) are also common on both station wagons and hatchbacks distinguishing features between hatchbacks and station wagons are : d-pillar : station wagons are more likely to have a d-pillar ( hatchbacks and station wagons both have a- , b- and c-pillars ) cargo volume : station wagons prioritize passenger and cargo volume — with windows beside the cargo volume seating : some station wagons have three rows of seats , whereas a hatchback will have two at most the rearmost row of seating in a station wagon is often located in the cargo area and can be front-facing , rear-facing , or side-facing rear suspension : a station wagon may include reconfigured rear suspension for additional load capacity and to minimize intrusion in the cargo volume station wagons have also been equipped with numerous tailgate designs hatchbacks may be called liftbacks when the opening area is very sloped and the door is lifted up to open '' you could have a 90-degree break in the back and have a station wagon many modern station wagons have an upward-swinging , full-width , full-height rear door supported on gas springs — often where the rear window can swing up independently side hinge : a side-hinged tailgate that opened like a door was offered on some three-seat station wagons to make it easier for the back row passengers to enter and exit their rear-facing seats these have a retractable rear roof section as well as a conventional rear tailgate that folded down to carry tall objects that would not fit otherwise frey as the '' three-way magic doorgate '' similar configurations became the standard on full-size and intermediate station wagons from gm , ford , chrysler , and amc on the clam shell design , the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof and the lower tailgate ( with either manual or optional power operation ) , lowered completely below the load floor where manually operated , the lower tailgate was counterbalanced by a torque rod similar to the torque rods used in holding a trunk lid open , requiring a 35 lb push to fully lower the gate swing-up window : an upward-lifting , full-height , full-width rear door , where the window on the rear door can be opened independently from the rear door itself the renault laguna ii station wagon and ford taurus wagon featured this arrangement prior to this , performance models of station wagons included the 1970 ford falcon ( xy ) 'grand sport ' pack , the 1973 chevrolet chevelle malibu ss-454 and the 1992 bmw m5 e34 the first station wagons were built in around 1910 , by independent manufacturers producing wooden custom bodies for the ford model t chassis eventually , car manufacturers began producing their own station wagon designs these wooden bodies required constant maintenance : varnishes required re-coating and expansion/contraction of the wood meant that bolts and screws required periodic re-tightening manufacture of the wooden bodies was initially outsourced to custom coachbuilders , because the production of the all-wood bodies was very time-consuming one of the first builders of wagon bodies was the stoughton wagon company from wisconsin , who begun putting custom wagon bodies on the ford model t chassis in 1919 and by 1929 the ford motor company was the biggest producer of chassis ' for station wagons by the 1930s , station wagons had become expensive and well-equipped vehicles however , most station wagons were produced with wooden bodies until after world war ii the first postwar station wagon to be based on a passenger car chassis was the 1949 plymouth suburban , which used a two-door body style for example , plymouth continued production of wooden bodied station wagons until 1950 the final wooden bodied station produced in the united states was the 1953 buick super estate the popularity of the station wagon - particularly full-size station wagons - in the united states was blunted by increased fuel prices caused by the 1973 oil crisis then in 1983 , the market for station wagons was further eroded by the chrysler minivans , based on the k platform while the k platform was also used for station wagon models ( such as the plymouth reliant and dodge aries ) , the minivan would soon eclipse them in popularity the ford taurus wagon was discontinued in 2005 and the ford focus station wagon was discontinued in 2008 an exception to this trend was the subaru legacy and subaru outback station wagon models , which continue to be produced at the subaru of indiana plant however , these vehicles had fewer trim and power train levels than their sedan counterparts the station wagon variants of the smaller mercedes-benz c-class line-up were dropped in 2007 and the bmw 5 series touring models were discontinued in 2010 , due to slow sales in the united states with only 400 wagons sold in 2009 chrysler 's 1957 models had a roof too low to permit a forward-facing seat in the cargo area , so a rear-facing seat was used for the third row rover and austin produced 4×4 canvas-topped utility vehicles in the 1950s that were available in station wagon body styles that were sold as '' station wagons '' other station wagons sold in the united kingdom included the morris 1100 ( introduced in 1966 ) , vauxhall viva ( introduced 1967 ) , ford escort ( introduced in 1968 ) and vauxhall chevette ( introduced 1976 ) following a hiatus in station wagon production since the saab 95 ended production in 1978 , the comany introduced the four-door saab 9-5 station wagon in 1997 , which was produced until 2010 models marketed as passenger station wagons in export markets were often sold as utilitarian '' van '' models in the home market

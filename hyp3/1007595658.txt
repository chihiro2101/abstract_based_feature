reflecting the original purpose of transporting people and luggage between estate ( land ) and railway stations , the body style is called an '' estate car '' or '' estate '' in the united kingdom , or a '' station wagon '' in north america , new zealand , australian and africa in the united states , early models with exposed wooden bodies became known as woodies station wagons have been marketed using the french term '' break de chasse '' ( sometimes abbreviated to '' break '' ) , which translates as '' hunting break '' , due to shared ancestry with the shooting-brake body style manufacturers may designate station wagons across various model lines with a proprietary nameplate station wagons and hatchbacks have in common a two-box design configuration , a shared interior volume for passengers and cargo and a rear door ( often called a tailgate in the case of a wagon ) that is hinged at roof level folding rear seats ( in order to create a larger space for cargo ) are also common on both station wagons and hatchbacks distinguishing features between hatchbacks and station wagons are : d-pillar : station wagons are more likely to have a d-pillar ( hatchbacks and station wagons both have a- , b- and c-pillars ) cargo volume : station wagons prioritize passenger and cargo volume â€” with windows beside the cargo volume other differences are more variable and can potentially include : cargo floor contour : a station wagon often has a fold-flat floor ( for increased cargo capacity ) , whereas a hatchback is more likely to have a cargo floor with a pronounced contour seating : some station wagons have three rows of seats , whereas a hatchback will have two at most the rearmost row of seating in a station wagon is often located in the cargo area and can be front-facing , rear-facing , or side-facing rear door : hatchbacks usually feature a top-hinged liftgate for cargo access , with variations ranging from a two-part lift-gate to a complex tailgate that can function either as a full tailgate or as a trunk/boot lid station wagons have also been equipped with numerous tailgate designs a design director from general motors has described the difference as '' where you break the roofline , at what angle , defines the spirit of the vehicle '' , he said '' it has become common for station wagons to use a platform shared with other body styles , resulting in many shared components ( such as chassis , engine , transmission , bodywork forward of the a-pillar , interior features , and optional features ) being used for the wagon , sedan and hatchback variants of the car model side hinge : a side-hinged tailgate that opened like a door was offered on some three-seat station wagons to make it easier for the back row passengers to enter and exit their rear-facing seats the configuration appeared on the studebaker wagonaire station wagon and 2003 gmc envoy for 1969 , ford incorporated a design that allowed the rear glass to remain up or down when the door pivoted open on its side hinge , marketing the system , which had been engineered by donald n similar configurations became the standard on full-size and intermediate station wagons from gm , ford , chrysler , and amc on the clam shell design , the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof and the lower tailgate ( with either manual or optional power operation ) , lowered completely below the load floor the power operation of both upper glass and lower tailgate became standard equipment in later model years fold-up license plate : wagons ( including the volvo amazon wagon , early models of the range-rover , and the subaru baja ) had an upward folding hinged license plate attached to the lower tailgate of the split rear door the wagon versions of the citroen ds , variously called the break , familiale or safari , had a different solution : two number plates were fitted to the tailgate at right angles to each other so one would be visible in either position the 1994 audi rs2 , developed in conjunction with porsche , is considered the world 's first performance station wagon in 1923 star ( a division of durant motors ) became the first car company to offer a station wagon assembled on its production line ( using a wooden wagon body shipped in from an outside supplier ) station wagons were initially considered commercial vehicles ( rather than consumer automobiles ) and the framing of the early station wagons was left unsheathed , due to the commercial nature of the vehicles the roofs of '' woodie '' wagons were usually made of stretched canvas that was treated with a waterproofing dressing one of the first builders of wagon bodies was the stoughton wagon company from wisconsin , who begun putting custom wagon bodies on the ford model t chassis in 1919 and by 1929 the ford motor company was the biggest producer of chassis ' for station wagons when it was introduced in 1941 the chrysler town & country was the most expensive car in the company 's model range 1945 to 1970 : steel-bodied station wagons the first all-steel station wagon was the 1935 chevrolet suburban , which was built on the chassis of a panel truck several manufacturers produced steel and wooden-bodied station wagons concurrently for several years station wagons experienced the highest production levels in the united states from the 1950s through the 1970s the popularity of the station wagon - particularly full-size station wagons - in the united states was blunted by increased fuel prices caused by the 1973 oil crisis then in 1983 , the market for station wagons was further eroded by the chrysler minivans , based on the k platform the ford taurus wagon was discontinued in 2005 and the ford focus station wagon was discontinued in 2008 an exception to this trend was the subaru legacy and subaru outback station wagon models , which continue to be produced at the subaru of indiana plant imported station wagons , despite remaining popular in other countries , struggled in the united states the mercedes-benz e63 amg in estate trim is a performance station wagon offered in the u.s the station wagon variants of the smaller mercedes-benz c-class line-up were dropped in 2007 and the bmw 5 series touring models were discontinued in 2010 , due to slow sales in the united states with only 400 wagons sold in 2009 in 2012 , the volvo v50 compact station wagon was withdrawn from the u.s from the 1950s to 1990s , many full-size american station wagons could be optioned with a third row of seating in the cargo area ( over the rear axle ) for a total of nine seats ford began production of steel-bodied two-door station wagons in 1952 with the ford ranch wagon the first station wagon produced in sweden was the volvo duett , introduced in 1953

station wagons have been marketed using the french term '' break de chasse '' ( sometimes abbreviated to '' break '' ) , which translates as '' hunting break '' , due to shared ancestry with the shooting-brake body style station wagons and hatchbacks have in common a two-box design configuration , a shared interior volume for passengers and cargo and a rear door ( often called a tailgate in the case of a wagon ) that is hinged at roof level folding rear seats ( in order to create a larger space for cargo ) are also common on both station wagons and hatchbacks distinguishing features between hatchbacks and station wagons are : d-pillar : station wagons are more likely to have a d-pillar ( hatchbacks and station wagons both have a- , b- and c-pillars ) cargo volume : station wagons prioritize passenger and cargo volume — with windows beside the cargo volume other differences are more variable and can potentially include : cargo floor contour : a station wagon often has a fold-flat floor ( for increased cargo capacity ) , whereas a hatchback is more likely to have a cargo floor with a pronounced contour seating : some station wagons have three rows of seats , whereas a hatchback will have two at most the rearmost row of seating in a station wagon is often located in the cargo area and can be front-facing , rear-facing , or side-facing rear suspension : a station wagon may include reconfigured rear suspension for additional load capacity and to minimize intrusion in the cargo volume rear door : hatchbacks usually feature a top-hinged liftgate for cargo access , with variations ranging from a two-part lift-gate to a complex tailgate that can function either as a full tailgate or as a trunk/boot lid '' you could have a 90-degree break in the back and have a station wagon many modern station wagons have an upward-swinging , full-width , full-height rear door supported on gas springs — often where the rear window can swing up independently side hinge : a side-hinged tailgate that opened like a door was offered on some three-seat station wagons to make it easier for the back row passengers to enter and exit their rear-facing seats these have a retractable rear roof section as well as a conventional rear tailgate that folded down to carry tall objects that would not fit otherwise in the united states , ford 's full-size station wagons for 1966 introduced a system marketed as '' magic doorgate '' — a conventional tailgate with retracting rear glass , where the tailgate could either fold down or pivot open on a side hinge — with the rear window retracted in either case where manually operated , the lower tailgate was counterbalanced by a torque rod similar to the torque rods used in holding a trunk lid open , requiring a 35 lb push to fully lower the gate raising the manual gate required a 5 lb pull via a handhold integral to the top edge of the retractable gate station wagons with the design featured an optional third row of forward-facing seats accessed by the rear side doors and a folding second-row seat — and could accommodate a 4 x 8 ' sheet of plywood with rear seats folded a simplified , one-piece lift-gate on smaller wagons the subsequent generation of gm 's full-size station wagons returned to the upward-lifting rear window as had been used in the 1940s the renault laguna ii station wagon and ford taurus wagon featured this arrangement cargo barriers may be used to prevent unsecured cargo from causing injuries in the event of sudden deceleration , collision , or a rollover the 1994 audi rs2 , developed in conjunction with porsche , is considered the world 's first performance station wagon prior to this , performance models of station wagons included the 1970 ford falcon ( xy ) 'grand sport ' pack , the 1973 chevrolet chevelle malibu ss-454 and the 1992 bmw m5 e34 several german manufacturers have produced station wagon versions of high-performance models , such as the audi rs4 , audi rs6 , mercedes-amg c63 , mercedes-amg e63 , bmw m5 e60 , volkswagen golf r and volkswagen passat r36 wagons in 1923 star ( a division of durant motors ) became the first car company to offer a station wagon assembled on its production line ( using a wooden wagon body shipped in from an outside supplier ) as part of the overall trend in the automotive industry , wooden bodies were superseded by all-steel bodies due to their strength , cost , and durability station wagons were initially considered commercial vehicles ( rather than consumer automobiles ) and the framing of the early station wagons was left unsheathed , due to the commercial nature of the vehicles early station wagons were fixed-roof vehicles , but lacked the glass that would normally enclose the passenger compartment , and had only bench seats one of the first builders of wagon bodies was the stoughton wagon company from wisconsin , who begun putting custom wagon bodies on the ford model t chassis in 1919 and by 1929 the ford motor company was the biggest producer of chassis ' for station wagons since ford owned its own hardwood forest and mills ( at the ford iron mountain plant in what is today kingsford , michigan in michigan 's upper peninsula ) it began supplying the wood components for the model a station wagon the first all-steel station wagon was the 1935 chevrolet suburban , which was built on the chassis of a panel truck when automobile production resumed after world war ii , advances in production techniques made all-steel station wagon bodies more practical , eliminating the cost , noise , and maintenance associated with wood bodies the first postwar station wagon to be based on a passenger car chassis was the 1949 plymouth suburban , which used a two-door body style several manufacturers produced steel and wooden-bodied station wagons concurrently for several years the final wooden bodied station produced in the united states was the 1953 buick super estate the popularity of the station wagon - particularly full-size station wagons - in the united states was blunted by increased fuel prices caused by the 1973 oil crisis with other brands , the niche previously occupied by station wagons is now primarily filled with a similar style of crossover suv , which generally has a car underpinning and a wagon body the station wagon variants of the smaller mercedes-benz c-class line-up were dropped in 2007 and the bmw 5 series touring models were discontinued in 2010 , due to slow sales in the united states with only 400 wagons sold in 2009 the cadillac cts gave rise to a station wagon counterpart , the 2010 cts sportwagon , which defied the trend by offering almost as many trim levels as its sedan counterpart early advertising for the land rover version took the name literally , showing the vehicle collecting people and goods from a railway station other station wagons sold in the united kingdom included the morris 1100 ( introduced in 1966 ) , vauxhall viva ( introduced 1967 ) , ford escort ( introduced in 1968 ) and vauxhall chevette ( introduced 1976 ) in 1958 , the citroën id break ( known as the safari in english-speaking countries ) was introduced , being larger than other french station wagon models and of similar size to the contemporary full-size station wagons from the united states following a hiatus in station wagon production since the saab 95 ended production in 1978 , the comany introduced the four-door saab 9-5 station wagon in 1997 , which was produced until 2010 the first station wagon by the south korean manufacturer was being released way back in 1995 as the hyundai elantra , followed in early 1996 as the kia pride station wagon

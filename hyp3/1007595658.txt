reflecting the original purpose of transporting people and luggage between estate ( land ) and railway stations , the body style is called an '' estate car '' or '' estate '' in the united kingdom , or a '' station wagon '' in north america , new zealand , australian and africa station wagons have been marketed using the french term '' break de chasse '' ( sometimes abbreviated to '' break '' ) , which translates as '' hunting break '' , due to shared ancestry with the shooting-brake body style manufacturers may designate station wagons across various model lines with a proprietary nameplate examples include '' avant '' , '' caravan '' , '' kombi '' , '' sports tourer '' , '' sports wagon , '' tourer '' , '' touring '' and '' variant '' station wagons and hatchbacks have in common a two-box design configuration , a shared interior volume for passengers and cargo and a rear door ( often called a tailgate in the case of a wagon ) that is hinged at roof level folding rear seats ( in order to create a larger space for cargo ) are also common on both station wagons and hatchbacks distinguishing features between hatchbacks and station wagons are : d-pillar : station wagons are more likely to have a d-pillar ( hatchbacks and station wagons both have a- , b- and c-pillars ) cargo volume : station wagons prioritize passenger and cargo volume — with windows beside the cargo volume other differences are more variable and can potentially include : cargo floor contour : a station wagon often has a fold-flat floor ( for increased cargo capacity ) , whereas a hatchback is more likely to have a cargo floor with a pronounced contour the rearmost row of seating in a station wagon is often located in the cargo area and can be front-facing , rear-facing , or side-facing rear suspension : a station wagon may include reconfigured rear suspension for additional load capacity and to minimize intrusion in the cargo volume rear door : hatchbacks usually feature a top-hinged liftgate for cargo access , with variations ranging from a two-part lift-gate to a complex tailgate that can function either as a full tailgate or as a trunk/boot lid a design director from general motors has described the difference as '' where you break the roofline , at what angle , defines the spirit of the vehicle '' , he said this configuration was common in the 1920s through the 1940s , and remained common on many models into the 1960s by the early 1960s , this arrangement was common on both full-size and compact wagons side hinge : a side-hinged tailgate that opened like a door was offered on some three-seat station wagons to make it easier for the back row passengers to enter and exit their rear-facing seats these have a retractable rear roof section as well as a conventional rear tailgate that folded down to carry tall objects that would not fit otherwise similar configurations became the standard on full-size and intermediate station wagons from gm , ford , chrysler , and amc where manually operated , the lower tailgate was counterbalanced by a torque rod similar to the torque rods used in holding a trunk lid open , requiring a 35 lb push to fully lower the gate raising the manual gate required a 5 lb pull via a handhold integral to the top edge of the retractable gate the power operation of both upper glass and lower tailgate became standard equipment in later model years station wagons with the design featured an optional third row of forward-facing seats accessed by the rear side doors and a folding second-row seat — and could accommodate a 4 x 8 ' sheet of plywood with rear seats folded the clam shell design required no increased footprint or operational area to open , allowing a user to stand at the cargo opening without the impediment of a door — for example , in a closed garage a simplified , one-piece lift-gate on smaller wagons the subsequent generation of gm 's full-size station wagons returned to the upward-lifting rear window as had been used in the 1940s swing-up window : an upward-lifting , full-height , full-width rear door , where the window on the rear door can be opened independently from the rear door itself the wagon versions of the citroen ds , variously called the break , familiale or safari , had a different solution : two number plates were fitted to the tailgate at right angles to each other so one would be visible in either position the 1994 audi rs2 , developed in conjunction with porsche , is considered the world 's first performance station wagon prior to this , performance models of station wagons included the 1970 ford falcon ( xy ) 'grand sport ' pack , the 1973 chevrolet chevelle malibu ss-454 and the 1992 bmw m5 e34 several german manufacturers have produced station wagon versions of high-performance models , such as the audi rs4 , audi rs6 , mercedes-amg c63 , mercedes-amg e63 , bmw m5 e60 , volkswagen golf r and volkswagen passat r36 wagons in 1923 star ( a division of durant motors ) became the first car company to offer a station wagon assembled on its production line ( using a wooden wagon body shipped in from an outside supplier ) the commercial vehicle status was also reflected on those vehicles ' registrations for example , there were special '' suburban '' license plates in pennsylvania used well into the 1960s , long after station wagons became car-based when it was introduced in 1941 the chrysler town & country was the most expensive car in the company 's model range when automobile production resumed after world war ii , advances in production techniques made all-steel station wagon bodies more practical , eliminating the cost , noise , and maintenance associated with wood bodies the first mass-produced steel-bodied station wagon was the 1946 willys station wagon , based on the chassis of the jeep cj-2a in 1947 , crosley introduced a steel-bodied station wagon version of the crosley cc four station wagons experienced the highest production levels in the united states from the 1950s through the 1970s the late 1950s through the mid-1960s was also the period of greatest variation in body styles , with models available without a b-pillar ( called hardtop or pillarless models ) or with a b-pillar , both in 2-door and 4-door variants gm eliminated the pillarless wagon from its lineup in 1959 , while amc and ford exited the field beginning with their 1960 and 1961 vehicles , leaving chrysler and dodge with the body style through the 1964 model year smaller station wagons were marketed as lower-priced alternatives to suvs and minivans european luxury car manufacturers such as audi , volvo , bmw , and mercedes-benz continued to offer station wagons in their north american product ranges ( marketed using the labels '' avant '' , '' touring '' , and '' estate '' respectively ) rover and austin produced 4×4 canvas-topped utility vehicles in the 1950s that were available in station wagon body styles that were sold as '' station wagons '' it had a seating capacity of eight people , consisting of two front-facing bench seats and two folding inward-facing seats in the cargo area in 1983 , station wagons represented 15 % of the passenger car market , reflecting a trend throughout europe of increasing popularity through the 1980s , with the vehicles becoming less cargo-oriented the first japanese station wagon was the 1969 isuzu bellel four-door wagon , based on a compact sedan chassis

also , the brain is highly dependent on perfusion to provide oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products , with damage setting in quickly at normal temperatures when ischemia finally , managing the nervous systems in both the body and the head is essential , in several ways the autonomic nervous system controls essential functions like breathing and the heart beating and is governed largely by the brain stem ; if the recipient body 's head is removed this can no longer function additionally each nerve coming out of the head via the spinal cord needs to be connected to the putatively corresponding nerve in the recipient body 's spinal cord in order for the brain to control movement and receive sensory information alexis carrel was a french surgeon who had developed improved surgical methods to connect blood vessels in the context of organ transplantation in 1908 he collaborated with the american charles claude guthrie to attempt to graft the head of one dog on an intact second dog ; the grafted head showed some reflexes early on but deteriorated quickly and the animal was killed after a few hours carrel 's work on organ transplantation later earned a nobel prize ; guthrie was probably excluded because of this controversial work on head transplantation in 1954 , vladimir demikhov , a soviet surgeon who had done important work to improve coronary bypass surgery , performed an experiment in which he grafted a dog 's head and upper body including the front legs , onto another dog ; the effort was focused on how to provide blood supply to the donor head and upper body and not on grafting the nervous systems in 1970 , he did four experiments in which he cut the head off of a monkey and connected the blood vessels of another monkey head to it ; he did not attempt to connect the nervous systems there were problems with the grafting of blood vessels that led to blood clots forming , and white used high doses of immunosuppressive drugs that had severe side effects ; the animals died between 6 hours and 3 days after the heads were engrafted in 2012 , xiaoping ren published work in which he grafted the head of a mouse onto another mouse 's body ; again the focus was on how to avoid harm from the loss of blood supply ; with his protocol the grafted heads survived up to six months all prior experimental work that involved removing the recipient body 's head had cut the head off lower down , just below axis ( anatomy ) basic legal issues were also unclear with regard to whether only one or both of the people involved in a head transplantation would have any legal rights in the post-procedure person

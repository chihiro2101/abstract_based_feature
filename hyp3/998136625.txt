the autonomic nervous system controls essential functions like breathing and the heart beating and is governed largely by the brain stem ; if the recipient body 's head is removed this can no longer function in 1908 he collaborated with the american charles claude guthrie to attempt to graft the head of one dog on an intact second dog ; the grafted head showed some reflexes early on but deteriorated quickly and the animal was killed after a few hours carrel 's work on organ transplantation later earned a nobel prize ; guthrie was probably excluded because of this controversial work on head transplantation the animals died due to transplant rejection in the 1950s and '60s , immunosuppressive drugs and organ transplantation techniques were developed that eventually made transplantation of kidneys , livers , and other organs standard medical procedures white did a series of experiments in which he attempted to graft only the vascular system of isolated dog brains onto existing dogs , to learn how to manage this challenge in 1970 , he did four experiments in which he cut the head off of a monkey and connected the blood vessels of another monkey head to it ; he did not attempt to connect the nervous systems the grafted heads were able to function - the eye movement moving objects and it could chew and swallow there were few animal experiments on head transplantation for many years after this all prior experimental work that involved removing the recipient body 's head had cut the head off lower down , just below axis ( anatomy ) those who promote such claims and who would subject any human being to unproven cruel surgery merit not headlines but only contempt and condemnation the people for the ethical treatment of animals described white 's experiments as '' epitomizing the crude , cruel vivisection industry '' , '' would you want a head transplant ?

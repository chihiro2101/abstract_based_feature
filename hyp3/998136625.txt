finally , managing the nervous systems in both the body and the head is essential , in several ways the autonomic nervous system controls essential functions like breathing and the heart beating and is governed largely by the brain stem ; if the recipient body 's head is removed this can no longer function in 1908 he collaborated with the american charles claude guthrie to attempt to graft the head of one dog on an intact second dog ; the grafted head showed some reflexes early on but deteriorated quickly and the animal was killed after a few hours in 1954 , vladimir demikhov , a soviet surgeon who had done important work to improve coronary bypass surgery , performed an experiment in which he grafted a dog 's head and upper body including the front legs , onto another dog ; the effort was focused on how to provide blood supply to the donor head and upper body and not on grafting the nervous systems in the 1950s and '60s , immunosuppressive drugs and organ transplantation techniques were developed that eventually made transplantation of kidneys , livers , and other organs standard medical procedures white did a series of experiments in which he attempted to graft only the vascular system of isolated dog brains onto existing dogs , to learn how to manage this challenge in 1970 , he did four experiments in which he cut the head off of a monkey and connected the blood vessels of another monkey head to it ; he did not attempt to connect the nervous systems there were few animal experiments on head transplantation for many years after this in 2012 , xiaoping ren published work in which he grafted the head of a mouse onto another mouse 's body ; again the focus was on how to avoid harm from the loss of blood supply ; with his protocol the grafted heads survived up to six months in 2015 , ren published work in which he cut off the heads of mice but left the brain stem in place , and then connected the vasculature of the donor head to the recipient body ; this work was an effort to address whether it was possible to keep the body of the recipient animal alive without life support there was no accepted protocol for conducting the procedure to justify the risk to the people involved , methods of obtaining informed consent were unclear , especially for the person whose body would be used ; issues of desperation render the truly informed consent of a head donor questionable because grafting the head onto the spinal cord was not possible at that time , the only feasible procedure would be one where the head was only connected to the blood supply of the donor body , leaving the person completely paralyzed , with the accompanying limited quality of life and high societal cost to maintain but no transplant had ever been performed where the entire body of an individual is unfamiliar at the conclusion of the procedure , and one of the few documents discussing the ethics in the biomedical literature , a letter to the editor of a journal published in 2015 , foresaw a high risk of insanity as a result of the procedure

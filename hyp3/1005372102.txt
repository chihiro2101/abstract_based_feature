during the modern era , the word '' regiment '' – much like '' corps '' – may have two somewhat divergent meanings , which refer to two distinct roles : a front-line military formation ; or an administrative or ceremonial unit in many armies , the first role has been assumed by independent battalions , battlegroups , task forces , brigades and other , similarly sized operational units 8th marine regiment ( united states ) ; several battalions , e.g the royal australian regiment includes all of the australian army 's regular infantry ( other than reserve and special forces units ) , and the artillery units of the british army are known collectively as the royal regiment of artillery , which is sub-divided for operation purposes into field regiments the french term régiment is considered to have entered military usage in europe at the end of the 16th century , when armies evolved from collections of retinues who followed knights , to formally organised , permanent military forces at that time , regiments were usually named after their commanding colonels , and disbanded at the end of the campaign or war ; the colonel and his regiment might recruit from and serve several monarchs or countries organisation and numbers did not follow any standardised pattern between or within armies during this period , with the only common factor being that each regiment had a single commander encyclopaedia britannica , 11th edition , page 39 vol 23 by the beginning of the 18th century , regiments in most european continental armies had evolved into permanent units with distinctive titles and uniforms , each under the command of a colonel when at full strength , an infantry regiment normally comprised two field battalions of about 800 men each or 8–10 companies as far as possible , the separate battalions would be garrisoned in the same military district , so that the regiment could be mobilized and campaign as a 4,000 strong linked group of sub-units a notable exception to this practice was the british line infantry system where the two regular battalions constituting a regiment alternated between '' home '' and '' foreign '' service and seldom came together as a single unit depending upon the country , regiments can be either combat units or administrative units or both in the continental system , the division is the functional army unit , and its commander is the administrator of every aspect of the formation : his staff train and administer the soldiers , officers , and commanders of the division 's subordinate units generally , divisions are garrisoned together and share the same installations : thus , in divisional administration , a battalion commanding officer is just another officer in a chain of command soldiers and officers are transferred in and out of divisions as required some regiments recruited from specific geographical areas , and usually incorporated the place name into the regimental name the fusiliers , the parachute regiment ( british army ) , 75th ranger regiment , and the light reaction regiment ( philippine army ) a key aspect of the regimental system is that the regiment or battalion is the fundamental tactical building block the regiment usually has a traditional '' home station '' or regimental depot , which is often a historic garrison that houses the regimental museum and regimental headquarters the regimental community of serving and retired members often makes it very difficult for planners to restructure forces by moving , merging or re-purposing units in those armies where the continental system exists , the regimental system is criticised as parochial and as creating unnecessary rivalry between different regiments regiments recruited from areas of political ferment ( such as scotland , wales , ireland , quebec , india , etc a regimental system , since it is decentralized and the regiments are independent from each other , prevents the army from staging a coup d'état a regimental system can also foster close links between the regiment and the community from which it is recruited in the british army and armies modeled on it ( such as the australian , the new zealand , the canadian , the pakistani and the indian ) , the term regiment is used confusingly in two different ways : it can mean an administrative identity and grouping , or a tactical unit in the case of india , '' large regiments '' of four to five battalions date from 1923 and , since the 1950s , many of these have expanded even further canadian battalions are employed tactically and administratively within brigade groups in australia , there is but one administrative infantry regiment in the regular army : the royal australian regiment , consisting of all seven regular infantry battalions in the army the australian army reserve also has state-based infantry regiments which administer the reserve infantry battalions while individual battalions may have different roles ( for example different battalions of the frontier force regiment may be mechanized infantry , paratroop infantry , or mountain troops ) , the regiment is considered to encompass all of them the modern british regimental system came about as a result of the 19th century cardwell reforms the reduction and consolidation of british infantry regiments that began in the late 1950s and concluded in 2006 has resulted in a system of administrative regiments each with several battalions , a band , a common badge and uniform etc in the british regimental system , the tactical regiment or battalion is the basic functional unit and its commanding officer more autonomous than in continental systems divisional and brigade commanders generally do not immerse themselves in the day-to-day functioning of a battalion – they can replace the commanding officer but will not micro-manage the unit all of a nation 's artillery units are considered part of a single administrative regiment , but there are typically several tactical artillery regiments in britain , every infantry battalion bears a number , even if it is the only remaining battalion in the regiment ( in that case it is the 1st battalion , with the exception of the irish regiment of canada , which has a 2nd battalion only ) traditionally , the regular battalions were the 1st and 2nd battalions , the militia ( later special reserve ) battalion was the 3rd battalion , and the army reserve battalions were the 4th battalion , the 5th battalion and up a few regiments had up to four regular battalions and more than one militia battalion , which disrupted the numbering , but this was rare the british army also has battalion-sized tactical regiments of the royal engineers , royal corps of signals , army air corps , royal logistic corps , and royal military police during this period the army , or '' legion '' , was organized into four '' sub-legions '' , 18th century forerunners of the modern brigade combat team that combined infantry , rifleman , artillery , and cavalry from 1776 through 1783 american infantry regiments contained from as few as seven companies ( e.g south carolina rifles ) to as many as twelve ( pennsylvania rifles and maryland state troops ) with continental army infantry regiments having eight companies ( increased to nine in 1781 ) during the civil war , there were nine new united states regular army infantry regiments ( 11th though the 19th ) added to the ten already existing ( an historic example of this arrangement is the 7th cavalry regiment during the battle of the little big horn in 1876 ) many more additional volunteer regiments were recruited from each state during the american civil war according to general orders no this expanded regimental structure produced units , proportionally roughly the same approximate size as the single battalion , ten-company regiments of the civil war 112 officers and enlisted men per company , and the same 36-member regimental headquarters , with 1,380 per regiment in a typical u.s until 1917 , under its traditional triangular organizational plan , infantry regiments were organized into brigades of three regiments , with three infantry brigades ( for a total of nine infantry regiments ) , along with one brigade each of cavalry and field artillery constituting a division under this plan , divisional brigades were eliminated and the division consisted of three infantry regiments and one artillery regiment , styled as '' division artillery '' ( divarty ) , but usually consisting of battalions with the same regimental affiliation the regiment 's machine gun company was now an anti-tank company , the supply company became the service company , and a cannon company and a medical detachment were added to the regiment however , armored regiment designations were retained for lineage and heraldic purposes marine infantry and field artillery regiments are sequentially numbered and are referred to generically as '' marines '' or '' marine regiment , '' as in 1st marines ( an infantry regiment ) or 12th marine regiment ( a field artillery regiment ) the artillery regiment was used to provide fire support , but differed depending on whether it was part of a motorised rifle division or tank division this was the standard model by the late 1980s , however not all artillery regiments had yet to conformed to it and one or more of the battalions might have used older weapon systems like the d-30 howitzer each infantry regiment may have one or more battalions , while cavalry , armour and artillery regiments are single battalion formations

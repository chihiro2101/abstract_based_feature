during the modern era , the word '' regiment '' – much like '' corps '' – may have two somewhat divergent meanings , which refer to two distinct roles : a front-line military formation ; or an administrative or ceremonial unit in many armies , the first role has been assumed by independent battalions , battlegroups , task forces , brigades and other , similarly sized operational units household cavalry mounted regiment ; a battalion equivalent , e.g 8th marine regiment ( united states ) ; several battalions , e.g infantry regiment ( the old guard ) and royal regiment of scotland ; or an entire arm of service , e.g the royal australian regiment includes all of the australian army 's regular infantry ( other than reserve and special forces units ) , and the artillery units of the british army are known collectively as the royal regiment of artillery , which is sub-divided for operation purposes into field regiments the french term régiment is considered to have entered military usage in europe at the end of the 16th century , when armies evolved from collections of retinues who followed knights , to formally organised , permanent military forces at that time , regiments were usually named after their commanding colonels , and disbanded at the end of the campaign or war ; the colonel and his regiment might recruit from and serve several monarchs or countries later , it was customary to name the regiment by its precedence in the line of battle , and to recruit from specific places , called cantons 23 by the beginning of the 18th century , regiments in most european continental armies had evolved into permanent units with distinctive titles and uniforms , each under the command of a colonel when at full strength , an infantry regiment normally comprised two field battalions of about 800 men each or 8–10 companies roberts , 1845 – devon ( england ) – a cavalry regiment numbered 600 to 900 troopers , making up a single entity prior to world war i , an infantry regiment in the french , german , russian , and other smaller armies would comprise four battalions , each with a full strength on mobilization of about 1,000 men as far as possible , the separate battalions would be garrisoned in the same military district , so that the regiment could be mobilized and campaign as a 4,000 strong linked group of sub-units in the regimental system , each regiment is responsible for recruiting , training , and administration ; each regiment is permanently maintained and therefore the regiment will develop its unique esprit de corps because of its unitary history , traditions , recruitment , and function depending upon the country , regiments can be either combat units or administrative units or both generally , divisions are garrisoned together and share the same installations : thus , in divisional administration , a battalion commanding officer is just another officer in a chain of command disadvantages of the regimental system are hazardous regimental competition , a lack of interchangeability between units of different regiments , and more pronounced '' old boy networks '' within the military that may hamper efficiency and fairness a key aspect of the regimental system is that the regiment or battalion is the fundamental tactical building block within the regimental system , soldiers , and usually officers , are always posted to a tactical unit of their own regiment whenever posted to field duty the regiment usually has a traditional '' home station '' or regimental depot , which is often a historic garrison that houses the regimental museum and regimental headquarters the regimental system is generally admired for the esprit de corps it engenders in its units ' members , but efforts to implement it in countries with a previously-existing continental system usually do not succeed the question is also raised as to whether it is healthy to develop soldiers more loyal to their regiment than to the military in general the regimental system works particularly well in an environment in which the prime role of the army consists of small-scale police actions and counterinsurgency operations , requiring prolonged deployment away from home a regimental system , since it is decentralized and the regiments are independent from each other , prevents the army from staging a coup d'état a regimental system can also foster close links between the regiment and the community from which it is recruited further , the regimental system offers the advantage of grouping like units together for centralized administrative , training , and logistical purposes , thereby creating an '' economies of scale '' effect and its ensuing increased efficiency in the commonwealth countries listed above , the large administrative regiment has been the normal practice for many years in australia , there is but one administrative infantry regiment in the regular army : the royal australian regiment , consisting of all seven regular infantry battalions in the army while individual battalions may have different roles ( for example different battalions of the frontier force regiment may be mechanized infantry , paratroop infantry , or mountain troops ) , the regiment is considered to encompass all of them armoured regiments in canada since the end of the world war ii have usually consisted of a single tactical regiment they were all amalgamated into a single regiment for example , the tactical regiments 1st regiment , royal canadian horse artillery , 7th toronto regiment , rca and many others are part of the single administrative regiment the royal regiment of canadian artillery when a regiment has only one battalion , the battalion may have exactly the same name as the regiment for example , the north saskatchewan regiment is the only battalion in the administrative regiment of the same name in britain , every infantry battalion bears a number , even if it is the only remaining battalion in the regiment ( in that case it is the 1st battalion , with the exception of the irish regiment of canada , which has a 2nd battalion only ) until after the world war ii , every regiment had at least two battalions traditionally , the regular battalions were the 1st and 2nd battalions , the militia ( later special reserve ) battalion was the 3rd battalion , and the army reserve battalions were the 4th battalion , the 5th battalion and up a few regiments had up to four regular battalions and more than one militia battalion , which disrupted the numbering , but this was rare soldiers , and particularly officers , can not spend a full career in one battalion during this period the army , or '' legion '' , was organized into four '' sub-legions '' , 18th century forerunners of the modern brigade combat team that combined infantry , rifleman , artillery , and cavalry ( briefly , from 1790 to 1792 , regiments were organized into three battalions of four companies each ) traditionally , the regiment and battalion were one and the same , with the '' battalion '' simply being the regiment organized for battle during the civil war , there were nine new united states regular army infantry regiments ( 11th though the 19th ) added to the ten already existing however , only three of these nine regiments ever reached full strength of three battalions , with four others only achieving a manning level of two full battalions ) many more additional volunteer regiments were recruited from each state during the american civil war according to general orders no this expanded regimental structure produced units , proportionally roughly the same approximate size as the single battalion , ten-company regiments of the civil war ) after the short war the army reduced the size of companies , battalions , and regiments by about 30 % under demobilization in 1917 the army adopted the square division organizational plan , which massively increased the size of units from the company through corps , more than tripling , or nearly quadrupling , the number of troops per unit ) the '' square division '' consisted of two infantry brigades of two infantry regiments each , with each regiment containing a regimental headquarters company , a machinegun company , a supply company , and 12 rifle companies organized into three battalions of four rifle companies each the battalions still contained four '' line '' companies , but instead of four rifle companies , now had three rifle companies and a heavy weapons company ( containing machine guns and mortars ) the regiment 's machine gun company was now an anti-tank company , the supply company became the service company , and a cannon company and a medical detachment were added to the regiment however , armored regiment designations were retained for lineage and heraldic purposes the united states marine corps deploys battalions from its infantry regiments to form the nucleus of a battalion landing team ( blt ) as the ground combat element ( gce ) of a marine expeditionary unit ( meu ) tank regiments operating as part of a tank division included a fifth combat battalion of motorised infantry , identical to those in bmp-equipped motorised rifle regiments each infantry regiment may have one or more battalions , while cavalry , armour and artillery regiments are single battalion formations

in many armies , the first role has been assumed by independent battalions , battlegroups , task forces , brigades and other , similarly sized operational units 3rd foreign infantry regiment ; a brigade equivalent , e.g 8th marine regiment ( united states ) ; several battalions , e.g infantry regiment ( the old guard ) and royal regiment of scotland ; or an entire arm of service , e.g the royal australian regiment includes all of the australian army 's regular infantry ( other than reserve and special forces units ) , and the artillery units of the british army are known collectively as the royal regiment of artillery , which is sub-divided for operation purposes into field regiments the french term régiment is considered to have entered military usage in europe at the end of the 16th century , when armies evolved from collections of retinues who followed knights , to formally organised , permanent military forces at that time , regiments were usually named after their commanding colonels , and disbanded at the end of the campaign or war ; the colonel and his regiment might recruit from and serve several monarchs or countries later , it was customary to name the regiment by its precedence in the line of battle , and to recruit from specific places , called cantons organisation and numbers did not follow any standardised pattern between or within armies during this period , with the only common factor being that each regiment had a single commander encyclopaedia britannica , 11th edition , page 39 vol 23 by the beginning of the 18th century , regiments in most european continental armies had evolved into permanent units with distinctive titles and uniforms , each under the command of a colonel when at full strength , an infantry regiment normally comprised two field battalions of about 800 men each or 8–10 companies roberts , 1845 – devon ( england ) – a cavalry regiment numbered 600 to 900 troopers , making up a single entity christopher duffy , pages 110 & 121 the military experience in the age of reason , on campaign , these numbers were soon reduced by casualties and detachments and it was sometimes necessary to amalgamate regiments or to withdraw them to a depot while recruits were obtained and trained with the widespread adoption of conscription in european armies during the nineteenth century , the regimental system underwent modification prior to world war i , an infantry regiment in the french , german , russian , and other smaller armies would comprise four battalions , each with a full strength on mobilization of about 1,000 men as far as possible , the separate battalions would be garrisoned in the same military district , so that the regiment could be mobilized and campaign as a 4,000 strong linked group of sub-units a notable exception to this practice was the british line infantry system where the two regular battalions constituting a regiment alternated between '' home '' and '' foreign '' service and seldom came together as a single unit in the regimental system , each regiment is responsible for recruiting , training , and administration ; each regiment is permanently maintained and therefore the regiment will develop its unique esprit de corps because of its unitary history , traditions , recruitment , and function usually , the regiment is responsible for recruiting and administering all of a soldier 's military career in the continental system , the division is the functional army unit , and its commander is the administrator of every aspect of the formation : his staff train and administer the soldiers , officers , and commanders of the division 's subordinate units some regiments recruited from specific geographical areas , and usually incorporated the place name into the regimental name in other cases , regiments would recruit from a given age group within a nation ( e.g the fusiliers , the parachute regiment ( british army ) , 75th ranger regiment , and the light reaction regiment ( philippine army ) disadvantages of the regimental system are hazardous regimental competition , a lack of interchangeability between units of different regiments , and more pronounced '' old boy networks '' within the military that may hamper efficiency and fairness a key aspect of the regimental system is that the regiment or battalion is the fundamental tactical building block for example , a regiment might include different types of battalions ( e.g the regiment usually has a traditional '' home station '' or regimental depot , which is often a historic garrison that houses the regimental museum and regimental headquarters the latter has a modest staff to support regimental committees and administer both the regular members and the association ( s ) of retired members in those armies where the continental system exists , the regimental system is criticised as parochial and as creating unnecessary rivalry between different regiments the question is also raised as to whether it is healthy to develop soldiers more loyal to their regiment than to the military in general a regimental system can also foster close links between the regiment and the community from which it is recruited this sense of community 'ownership ' over local regiments can be seen in the public outcry over recent regimental amalgamations in the united kingdom in the british army and armies modeled on it ( such as the australian , the new zealand , the canadian , the pakistani and the indian ) , the term regiment is used confusingly in two different ways : it can mean an administrative identity and grouping , or a tactical unit in the former dominion of newfoundland , '' regiment '' was used to describe the entirety of the fighting armed forces , the royal newfoundland regiment in the commonwealth countries listed above , the large administrative regiment has been the normal practice for many years as an example , the punjab regiment of the indian army has expanded from four battalions in 1956 to its present strength of 20 , while , in pakistan , several regiments have over 50 battalions the three regular force infantry regiments each consist of three regular force battalions of approximately 600 soldiers , in addition to one or more reserve battalions in australia , there is but one administrative infantry regiment in the regular army : the royal australian regiment , consisting of all seven regular infantry battalions in the army the modern british regimental system came about as a result of the 19th century cardwell reforms in the british army , for most purposes , the regiment is the largest '' permanent '' organisational unit in the british regimental system , the tactical regiment or battalion is the basic functional unit and its commanding officer more autonomous than in continental systems as of 2014 , only thirteen line infantry regiments survive , each comprising up to six of the former battalions that previously had separate regimental status armoured regiments in canada since the end of the world war ii have usually consisted of a single tactical regiment during the 1960s , three canadian regiments had both regular and militia components , which were disbanded shortly after unification in 1968 in britain , every infantry battalion bears a number , even if it is the only remaining battalion in the regiment ( in that case it is the 1st battalion , with the exception of the irish regiment of canada , which has a 2nd battalion only ) a few regiments had up to four regular battalions and more than one militia battalion , which disrupted the numbering , but this was rare for this reason , although the regular battalion today ( if there is only one ) will always be the 1st battalion , the ta battalions may have non-consecutive numbers in practice , it is impossible to exercise all the administrative functions of a true regiment when the regiment consists of a single unit during this period the army , or '' legion '' , was organized into four '' sub-legions '' , 18th century forerunners of the modern brigade combat team that combined infantry , rifleman , artillery , and cavalry ) traditionally , the regiment and battalion were one and the same , with the '' battalion '' simply being the regiment organized for battle under this plan , divisional brigades were eliminated and the division consisted of three infantry regiments and one artillery regiment , styled as '' division artillery '' ( divarty ) , but usually consisting of battalions with the same regimental affiliation so , for example , the 1st cavalry officially became titled the 1st cavalry regiment marine infantry regiments consist of a regimental headquarters and service company ( h & s co ) and three identical infantry battalions the sam regiment was an important part of a motorised rifle division or tank division 's effort to envelop the battlefield in an extensive air defence network each infantry regiment may have one or more battalions , while cavalry , armour and artillery regiments are single battalion formations

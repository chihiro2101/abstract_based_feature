during the modern era , the word '' regiment '' – much like '' corps '' – may have two somewhat divergent meanings , which refer to two distinct roles : a front-line military formation ; or an administrative or ceremonial unit in many armies , the first role has been assumed by independent battalions , battlegroups , task forces , brigades and other , similarly sized operational units 3rd foreign infantry regiment ; a brigade equivalent , e.g 8th marine regiment ( united states ) ; several battalions , e.g infantry regiment ( the old guard ) and royal regiment of scotland ; or an entire arm of service , e.g at that time , regiments were usually named after their commanding colonels , and disbanded at the end of the campaign or war ; the colonel and his regiment might recruit from and serve several monarchs or countries organisation and numbers did not follow any standardised pattern between or within armies during this period , with the only common factor being that each regiment had a single commander 23 by the beginning of the 18th century , regiments in most european continental armies had evolved into permanent units with distinctive titles and uniforms , each under the command of a colonel when at full strength , an infantry regiment normally comprised two field battalions of about 800 men each or 8–10 companies christopher duffy , pages 110 & 121 the military experience in the age of reason , on campaign , these numbers were soon reduced by casualties and detachments and it was sometimes necessary to amalgamate regiments or to withdraw them to a depot while recruits were obtained and trained a notable exception to this practice was the british line infantry system where the two regular battalions constituting a regiment alternated between '' home '' and '' foreign '' service and seldom came together as a single unit depending upon the country , regiments can be either combat units or administrative units or both in the continental system , the division is the functional army unit , and its commander is the administrator of every aspect of the formation : his staff train and administer the soldiers , officers , and commanders of the division 's subordinate units zulu impis ) , an ethnic group ( e.g the fusiliers , the parachute regiment ( british army ) , 75th ranger regiment , and the light reaction regiment ( philippine army ) a key aspect of the regimental system is that the regiment or battalion is the fundamental tactical building block within the regimental system , soldiers , and usually officers , are always posted to a tactical unit of their own regiment whenever posted to field duty the regimental system is generally admired for the esprit de corps it engenders in its units ' members , but efforts to implement it in countries with a previously-existing continental system usually do not succeed the question is also raised as to whether it is healthy to develop soldiers more loyal to their regiment than to the military in general regiments recruited from areas of political ferment ( such as scotland , wales , ireland , quebec , india , etc generally , the regimental system is found to function best in countries with small-to medium-sized military forces where the problems of administering vast numbers of personnel are not as prevalent the regimental system works particularly well in an environment in which the prime role of the army consists of small-scale police actions and counterinsurgency operations , requiring prolonged deployment away from home a regimental system , since it is decentralized and the regiments are independent from each other , prevents the army from staging a coup d'état this is best exemplified by the british army : since the formation of the united kingdom , there have been no military takeovers this sense of community 'ownership ' over local regiments can be seen in the public outcry over recent regimental amalgamations in the united kingdom this is achievable partially because of the marines mission adaptability , flexibility , philosophy , shared culture , history and overall esprit de corps , which allows for near seamless interoperability in the british army and armies modeled on it ( such as the australian , the new zealand , the canadian , the pakistani and the indian ) , the term regiment is used confusingly in two different ways : it can mean an administrative identity and grouping , or a tactical unit in the former dominion of newfoundland , '' regiment '' was used to describe the entirety of the fighting armed forces , the royal newfoundland regiment as an example , the punjab regiment of the indian army has expanded from four battalions in 1956 to its present strength of 20 , while , in pakistan , several regiments have over 50 battalions the three regular force infantry regiments each consist of three regular force battalions of approximately 600 soldiers , in addition to one or more reserve battalions in australia , there is but one administrative infantry regiment in the regular army : the royal australian regiment , consisting of all seven regular infantry battalions in the army the modern british regimental system came about as a result of the 19th century cardwell reforms in the british army , for most purposes , the regiment is the largest '' permanent '' organisational unit above regimental level , the organisation is changed to meet the tasks at hand the reduction and consolidation of british infantry regiments that began in the late 1950s and concluded in 2006 has resulted in a system of administrative regiments each with several battalions , a band , a common badge and uniform etc in the british regimental system , the tactical regiment or battalion is the basic functional unit and its commanding officer more autonomous than in continental systems as of 2014 , only thirteen line infantry regiments survive , each comprising up to six of the former battalions that previously had separate regimental status during the 1960s , three canadian regiments had both regular and militia components , which were disbanded shortly after unification in 1968 currently , one regiment is organised with two tactical regiments , 12 e régiment blindé du canada and 12 e régiment blindé du canada ( milice ) are both part of the administrative regiment 12e régiment blindé du canada all of a nation 's artillery units are considered part of a single administrative regiment , but there are typically several tactical artillery regiments in britain , every infantry battalion bears a number , even if it is the only remaining battalion in the regiment ( in that case it is the 1st battalion , with the exception of the irish regiment of canada , which has a 2nd battalion only ) traditionally , the regular battalions were the 1st and 2nd battalions , the militia ( later special reserve ) battalion was the 3rd battalion , and the army reserve battalions were the 4th battalion , the 5th battalion and up for this reason , although the regular battalion today ( if there is only one ) will always be the 1st battalion , the ta battalions may have non-consecutive numbers historically , the united states army was organized into regiments , except from 1792 to 1796 during the existence of the legion of the united states during this period the army , or '' legion '' , was organized into four '' sub-legions '' , 18th century forerunners of the modern brigade combat team that combined infantry , rifleman , artillery , and cavalry when combined with other regiments during wartime , for active field operations , regiments were further formed into brigades and divisions , battalion headquarters organic to the regiment south carolina rifles ) to as many as twelve ( pennsylvania rifles and maryland state troops ) with continental army infantry regiments having eight companies ( increased to nine in 1781 ) ( briefly , from 1790 to 1792 , regiments were organized into three battalions of four companies each ) traditionally , the regiment and battalion were one and the same , with the '' battalion '' simply being the regiment organized for battle during the civil war , there were nine new united states regular army infantry regiments ( 11th though the 19th ) added to the ten already existing however , only three of these nine regiments ever reached full strength of three battalions , with four others only achieving a manning level of two full battalions regiments were usually commanded by a colonel , assisted by a lieutenant colonel and a major , as well as additional staff officers and enlisted men in the regimental headquarters marine logistics groups ( mlg ) contain two types of regiments ; one headquarters ( hq ) regiment ( except 4th mlg ) and two combat logistics regiments ( clr ) by the late 1980s , tank regiments operating as part of motorised rifle divisions contained slightly over 1,100 officers and other ranks while those operating within tank divisions contained over 1,600 each infantry regiment may have one or more battalions , while cavalry , armour and artillery regiments are single battalion formations

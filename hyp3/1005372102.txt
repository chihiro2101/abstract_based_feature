in many armies , the first role has been assumed by independent battalions , battlegroups , task forces , brigades and other , similarly sized operational units 8th marine regiment ( united states ) ; several battalions , e.g infantry regiment ( the old guard ) and royal regiment of scotland ; or an entire arm of service , e.g the royal australian regiment includes all of the australian army 's regular infantry ( other than reserve and special forces units ) , and the artillery units of the british army are known collectively as the royal regiment of artillery , which is sub-divided for operation purposes into field regiments the french term régiment is considered to have entered military usage in europe at the end of the 16th century , when armies evolved from collections of retinues who followed knights , to formally organised , permanent military forces at that time , regiments were usually named after their commanding colonels , and disbanded at the end of the campaign or war ; the colonel and his regiment might recruit from and serve several monarchs or countries later , it was customary to name the regiment by its precedence in the line of battle , and to recruit from specific places , called cantons organisation and numbers did not follow any standardised pattern between or within armies during this period , with the only common factor being that each regiment had a single commander 23 by the beginning of the 18th century , regiments in most european continental armies had evolved into permanent units with distinctive titles and uniforms , each under the command of a colonel when at full strength , an infantry regiment normally comprised two field battalions of about 800 men each or 8–10 companies in some armies , an independent regiment with fewer companies was labelled a demi-regiment roberts , 1845 – devon ( england ) – a cavalry regiment numbered 600 to 900 troopers , making up a single entity a notable exception to this practice was the british line infantry system where the two regular battalions constituting a regiment alternated between '' home '' and '' foreign '' service and seldom came together as a single unit in the regimental system , each regiment is responsible for recruiting , training , and administration ; each regiment is permanently maintained and therefore the regiment will develop its unique esprit de corps because of its unitary history , traditions , recruitment , and function this is often contrasted to the '' continental system '' adopted by many armies in the continental system , the division is the functional army unit , and its commander is the administrator of every aspect of the formation : his staff train and administer the soldiers , officers , and commanders of the division 's subordinate units generally , divisions are garrisoned together and share the same installations : thus , in divisional administration , a battalion commanding officer is just another officer in a chain of command the fusiliers , the parachute regiment ( british army ) , 75th ranger regiment , and the light reaction regiment ( philippine army ) disadvantages of the regimental system are hazardous regimental competition , a lack of interchangeability between units of different regiments , and more pronounced '' old boy networks '' within the military that may hamper efficiency and fairness a key aspect of the regimental system is that the regiment or battalion is the fundamental tactical building block for example , a regiment might include different types of battalions ( e.g within the regimental system , soldiers , and usually officers , are always posted to a tactical unit of their own regiment whenever posted to field duty the latter has a modest staff to support regimental committees and administer both the regular members and the association ( s ) of retired members in those armies where the continental system exists , the regimental system is criticised as parochial and as creating unnecessary rivalry between different regiments the question is also raised as to whether it is healthy to develop soldiers more loyal to their regiment than to the military in general the regimental system works particularly well in an environment in which the prime role of the army consists of small-scale police actions and counterinsurgency operations , requiring prolonged deployment away from home in such a situation , co-ordination between regiments is rarely necessary , and the esprit de corps of the regiment provides an emotional substitute for the sense of public approval that an army receives at home this is particularly relevant to british experience during the days of the empire , where the army was virtually continuously engaged in low-intensity conflict with insurgents , and full-scale warfare was the exception rather than the rule a regimental system , since it is decentralized and the regiments are independent from each other , prevents the army from staging a coup d'état a regimental system can also foster close links between the regiment and the community from which it is recruited on the other hand , recruitment from a single community can lead to a concentrated and potentially devastating local impact if the regiment takes heavy casualties this is achievable partially because of the marines mission adaptability , flexibility , philosophy , shared culture , history and overall esprit de corps , which allows for near seamless interoperability canadian battalions are employed tactically and administratively within brigade groups in australia , there is but one administrative infantry regiment in the regular army : the royal australian regiment , consisting of all seven regular infantry battalions in the army the australian army reserve also has state-based infantry regiments which administer the reserve infantry battalions while individual battalions may have different roles ( for example different battalions of the frontier force regiment may be mechanized infantry , paratroop infantry , or mountain troops ) , the regiment is considered to encompass all of them in the british army , for most purposes , the regiment is the largest '' permanent '' organisational unit the reduction and consolidation of british infantry regiments that began in the late 1950s and concluded in 2006 has resulted in a system of administrative regiments each with several battalions , a band , a common badge and uniform etc in the british regimental system , the tactical regiment or battalion is the basic functional unit and its commanding officer more autonomous than in continental systems similarly , as of 2015 , only eight of the regiments of the royal armoured corps ( cavalry plus royal tank regiments ) survive armoured regiments in canada since the end of the world war ii have usually consisted of a single tactical regiment until after the world war ii , every regiment had at least two battalions in practice , it is impossible to exercise all the administrative functions of a true regiment when the regiment consists of a single unit from colonial times , the regiment consisted of a small regimental headquarters ( regimental headquarters company not existing before 1915 ) and in 1775 ten '' line '' companies , based on the british army model , without any permanent intermediate level of organization , viz , battalion headquarters organic to the regiment ) traditionally , the regiment and battalion were one and the same , with the '' battalion '' simply being the regiment organized for battle regiments were usually commanded by a colonel , assisted by a lieutenant colonel and a major , as well as additional staff officers and enlisted men in the regimental headquarters this expanded regimental structure produced units , proportionally roughly the same approximate size as the single battalion , ten-company regiments of the civil war ( for example : 101 officers and enlisted men per company , and a 36-member regimental headquarters , with 1,046 per typical union army infantry regiment in 1861 , vs 112 officers and enlisted men per company , and the same 36-member regimental headquarters , with 1,380 per regiment in a typical u.s ) after the short war the army reduced the size of companies , battalions , and regiments by about 30 % under demobilization ) the '' square division '' consisted of two infantry brigades of two infantry regiments each , with each regiment containing a regimental headquarters company , a machinegun company , a supply company , and 12 rifle companies organized into three battalions of four rifle companies each under this plan , divisional brigades were eliminated and the division consisted of three infantry regiments and one artillery regiment , styled as '' division artillery '' ( divarty ) , but usually consisting of battalions with the same regimental affiliation the infantry regiments still contained three battalions ; there were now '' headquarters and headquarters '' companies ( hhcs ) not only at the regimental-level but in each battalion as well army in the american expeditionary force , in which the 5th and 6th marines ( along with the 6th machine gun battalion ) formed the 4th marine brigade of the u.s the indian army has many regiments , majority of them infantry , with single battalion cavalry and artillery regiments

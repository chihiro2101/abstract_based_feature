in many armies , the first role has been assumed by independent battalions , battlegroups , task forces , brigades and other , similarly sized operational units a regiment may consequently be a variety of sizes : smaller than a standard battalion , e.g 8th marine regiment ( united states ) ; several battalions , e.g infantry regiment ( the old guard ) and royal regiment of scotland ; or an entire arm of service , e.g the royal australian regiment includes all of the australian army 's regular infantry ( other than reserve and special forces units ) , and the artillery units of the british army are known collectively as the royal regiment of artillery , which is sub-divided for operation purposes into field regiments the french term régiment is considered to have entered military usage in europe at the end of the 16th century , when armies evolved from collections of retinues who followed knights , to formally organised , permanent military forces at that time , regiments were usually named after their commanding colonels , and disbanded at the end of the campaign or war ; the colonel and his regiment might recruit from and serve several monarchs or countries organisation and numbers did not follow any standardised pattern between or within armies during this period , with the only common factor being that each regiment had a single commander 23 by the beginning of the 18th century , regiments in most european continental armies had evolved into permanent units with distinctive titles and uniforms , each under the command of a colonel when at full strength , an infantry regiment normally comprised two field battalions of about 800 men each or 8–10 companies in some armies , an independent regiment with fewer companies was labelled a demi-regiment with the widespread adoption of conscription in european armies during the nineteenth century , the regimental system underwent modification prior to world war i , an infantry regiment in the french , german , russian , and other smaller armies would comprise four battalions , each with a full strength on mobilization of about 1,000 men as far as possible , the separate battalions would be garrisoned in the same military district , so that the regiment could be mobilized and campaign as a 4,000 strong linked group of sub-units a cavalry regiment by contrast made up a single entity of up to 1,000 troopers in the regimental system , each regiment is responsible for recruiting , training , and administration ; each regiment is permanently maintained and therefore the regiment will develop its unique esprit de corps because of its unitary history , traditions , recruitment , and function in the continental system , the division is the functional army unit , and its commander is the administrator of every aspect of the formation : his staff train and administer the soldiers , officers , and commanders of the division 's subordinate units generally , divisions are garrisoned together and share the same installations : thus , in divisional administration , a battalion commanding officer is just another officer in a chain of command disadvantages of the regimental system are hazardous regimental competition , a lack of interchangeability between units of different regiments , and more pronounced '' old boy networks '' within the military that may hamper efficiency and fairness a key aspect of the regimental system is that the regiment or battalion is the fundamental tactical building block within the regimental system , soldiers , and usually officers , are always posted to a tactical unit of their own regiment whenever posted to field duty in those armies where the continental system exists , the regimental system is criticised as parochial and as creating unnecessary rivalry between different regiments ) , tend to perform particularly well because of the loyalty their members exhibit to the regiments generally , the regimental system is found to function best in countries with small-to medium-sized military forces where the problems of administering vast numbers of personnel are not as prevalent this is best exemplified by the british army : since the formation of the united kingdom , there have been no military takeovers this sense of community 'ownership ' over local regiments can be seen in the public outcry over recent regimental amalgamations in the united kingdom on the other hand , recruitment from a single community can lead to a concentrated and potentially devastating local impact if the regiment takes heavy casualties further , the regimental system offers the advantage of grouping like units together for centralized administrative , training , and logistical purposes , thereby creating an '' economies of scale '' effect and its ensuing increased efficiency in the british army and armies modeled on it ( such as the australian , the new zealand , the canadian , the pakistani and the indian ) , the term regiment is used confusingly in two different ways : it can mean an administrative identity and grouping , or a tactical unit in the commonwealth countries listed above , the large administrative regiment has been the normal practice for many years the modern british regimental system came about as a result of the 19th century cardwell reforms in the british army , for most purposes , the regiment is the largest '' permanent '' organisational unit the regimental sergeant major is another key figure , responsible to the co for unit discipline and the behaviour of the ncos as of 2014 , only thirteen line infantry regiments survive , each comprising up to six of the former battalions that previously had separate regimental status armoured regiments in canada since the end of the world war ii have usually consisted of a single tactical regiment during the 1960s , three canadian regiments had both regular and militia components , which were disbanded shortly after unification in 1968 one administrative armoured regiment of the british army consisted of more than one tactical regiment the royal tank regiment until 2014 had two ( 1 and 2 rtr ) , and once had many more all of a nation 's artillery units are considered part of a single administrative regiment , but there are typically several tactical artillery regiments for example , the tactical regiments 1st regiment , royal canadian horse artillery , 7th toronto regiment , rca and many others are part of the single administrative regiment the royal regiment of canadian artillery administrative infantry regiments are composed of one or more battalions when a regiment has only one battalion , the battalion may have exactly the same name as the regiment in britain , every infantry battalion bears a number , even if it is the only remaining battalion in the regiment ( in that case it is the 1st battalion , with the exception of the irish regiment of canada , which has a 2nd battalion only ) traditionally , the regular battalions were the 1st and 2nd battalions , the militia ( later special reserve ) battalion was the 3rd battalion , and the army reserve battalions were the 4th battalion , the 5th battalion and up a few regiments had up to four regular battalions and more than one militia battalion , which disrupted the numbering , but this was rare thus in the armoured corps , the traditional administrative '' regiment '' tends to play more of a ceremonial role , while in practice , its members are administered by their corps or '' branch '' as in the artillery historically , the united states army was organized into regiments , except from 1792 to 1796 during the existence of the legion of the united states during this period the army , or '' legion '' , was organized into four '' sub-legions '' , 18th century forerunners of the modern brigade combat team that combined infantry , rifleman , artillery , and cavalry ) traditionally , the regiment and battalion were one and the same , with the '' battalion '' simply being the regiment organized for battle during the civil war , there were nine new united states regular army infantry regiments ( 11th though the 19th ) added to the ten already existing under this plan , divisional brigades were eliminated and the division consisted of three infantry regiments and one artillery regiment , styled as '' division artillery '' ( divarty ) , but usually consisting of battalions with the same regimental affiliation the regiment 's machine gun company was now an anti-tank company , the supply company became the service company , and a cannon company and a medical detachment were added to the regiment in world war ii , the marine corps organized its regiments and divisions under the '' triangular division '' model developed by the army in 1939 combat support and combat service support subunits were the same as in motorised rifle regiments with the exception of the antitank missile battery the artillery regiment was used to provide fire support , but differed depending on whether it was part of a motorised rifle division or tank division demi-brigade military organization regimental combat team

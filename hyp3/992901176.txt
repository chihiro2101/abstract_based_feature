prominent among these are optical or magnetic tweezers , atomic-force-microscope ( afm ) cantilevers and acoustic force spectroscopy the force sensor is usually a micrometre-sized bead or a cantilever , whose displacement can be measured to determine the force if some force is acting on the elastic cantilever ( for example because some molecule is being stretched between the surface and the tip ) , this will deflect upward ( repulsive force ) or downward ( attractive force ) the so-called force curve is the graph of force ( or more precisely , of cantilever deflection ) versus the piezoelectric position on the z axis typically , the force curves observed in the force spectroscopy experiments consist of a contact ( diagonal ) region where the probe contacts the sample surface , and a non-contact region where the probe is off the sample surface when the restoring force of the cantilever exceeds tip-sample adhesion force the probe jumps out of contact , and the magnitude of this jump is often used as a measure of adhesion force or rupture force in general the rupture of a tip-surface bond is a stochastic process ; therefore reliable quantification of the adhesion force requires taking multiple individual force curves the histogram of the adhesion forces obtained in these multiple measurements provides the main data output for force spectroscopy measurement in biophysics , single-molecule force spectroscopy can be used to study the energy landscape underlying the interaction between two bio-molecules , like proteins the resulting graph of the average rupture force as a function of the loading rate is called the force spectrum and forms the basic dataset for dynamic force spectroscopy a recently developed technique , acoustic force spectroscopy ( afs ) , allows the force manipulation of hundreds of single-molecules and single-cells in parallel , providing high experimental throughput the other main application of force spectroscopy is the study of mechanical resistance of chemical bonds by careful analysis of the breaking force at various pulling speeds , it is possible to map the energy landscape of the chemical bond under mechanical force

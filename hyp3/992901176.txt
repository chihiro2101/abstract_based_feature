prominent among these are optical or magnetic tweezers , atomic-force-microscope ( afm ) cantilevers and acoustic force spectroscopy in all of these techniques , a biomolecule , such as protein or dna , or some other biopolymer has one end bound to a surface and the other to a force sensor the force sensor is usually a micrometre-sized bead or a cantilever , whose displacement can be measured to determine the force if some force is acting on the elastic cantilever ( for example because some molecule is being stretched between the surface and the tip ) , this will deflect upward ( repulsive force ) or downward ( attractive force ) typically , the force curves observed in the force spectroscopy experiments consist of a contact ( diagonal ) region where the probe contacts the sample surface , and a non-contact region where the probe is off the sample surface when the restoring force of the cantilever exceeds tip-sample adhesion force the probe jumps out of contact , and the magnitude of this jump is often used as a measure of adhesion force or rupture force in biophysics , single-molecule force spectroscopy can be used to study the energy landscape underlying the interaction between two bio-molecules , like proteins the resulting graph of the average rupture force as a function of the loading rate is called the force spectrum and forms the basic dataset for dynamic force spectroscopy another technique that has been gaining ground for single molecule experiments is the use of optical tweezers for applying mechanical forces on molecules common applications of force spectroscopy are measurements of polymer elasticity , especially biopolymers such as rna and dna moreover , force spectroscopy can be used to investigate the enzymatic activity of proteins involved in dna replication , transcription , organization and repair the other main application of force spectroscopy is the study of mechanical resistance of chemical bonds by careful analysis of the breaking force at various pulling speeds , it is possible to map the energy landscape of the chemical bond under mechanical force

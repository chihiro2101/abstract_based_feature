prominent among these are optical or magnetic tweezers , atomic-force-microscope ( afm ) cantilevers and acoustic force spectroscopy the force sensor is usually a micrometre-sized bead or a cantilever , whose displacement can be measured to determine the force atomic force microscope cantilevers the so-called force curve is the graph of force ( or more precisely , of cantilever deflection ) versus the piezoelectric position on the z axis an ideal hookean spring , for example , would display a straight diagonal force curve typically , the force curves observed in the force spectroscopy experiments consist of a contact ( diagonal ) region where the probe contacts the sample surface , and a non-contact region where the probe is off the sample surface when the restoring force of the cantilever exceeds tip-sample adhesion force the probe jumps out of contact , and the magnitude of this jump is often used as a measure of adhesion force or rupture force the histogram of the adhesion forces obtained in these multiple measurements provides the main data output for force spectroscopy measurement in biophysics , single-molecule force spectroscopy can be used to study the energy landscape underlying the interaction between two bio-molecules , like proteins the resulting graph of the average rupture force as a function of the loading rate is called the force spectrum and forms the basic dataset for dynamic force spectroscopy , utilized dynamic force spectroscopy along with molecular dynamics simulations to find out the binding force between thrombin , a blood coagulation protein , and its dna aptamer moreover , force spectroscopy can be used to investigate the enzymatic activity of proteins involved in dna replication , transcription , organization and repair by careful analysis of the breaking force at various pulling speeds , it is possible to map the energy landscape of the chemical bond under mechanical force

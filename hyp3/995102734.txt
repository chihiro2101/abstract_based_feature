during world war ii and the early years of the cold war , the venona project was a source of information on soviet intelligence-gathering directed at the western military powers truman , these programs were of importance concerning crucial events of the early cold war these included the julius and ethel rosenberg spying case ( which was based on events during world war ii ) and the defections of donald maclean and guy burgess to the soviet union most decipherable messages were transmitted and intercepted between 1942 and 1945 , during world war ii , when the soviet union was an ally of the us sometime in 1945 , the existence of the venona program was revealed to the soviet union by cryptology-analyst bill weisband , an nkvd agent in the u.s to what extent the various individuals referred to in the messages were involved with soviet intelligence is a topic of historical dispute while a number of academics and historians assert that most of the individuals mentioned in the venona decrypts were most likely either clandestine assets and/or contacts of soviet intelligence agents , how venona was declassified , robert louis benson , symposium of cryptologic history ; october 27 , 2005 the venona project was initiated on february 1 , 1943 , by gene grabeel , an american mathematician and cryptanalyst , under orders from colonel carter w clarke , chief of special branch of the military intelligence service at that time clarke distrusted joseph stalin , and feared that the soviet union would sign a separate peace with nazi germany , allowing germany to focus its military forces against the united kingdom and the united states army 's signal intelligence service at arlington hall analyzed encrypted high-level soviet diplomatic intelligence messages intercepted in large volumes during and immediately after world war ii by american , british , and australian listening posts this message traffic , which was encrypted with a one-time pad system , was stored and analyzed in relative secrecy by hundreds of cryptanalysts over a 40-year period starting in the early 1940s however , due to a serious blunder on the part of the soviets , some of this traffic was vulnerable to cryptanalysis the soviet company that manufactured the one-time pads produced around 35,000 pages of duplicate key numbers , as a result of pressures brought about by the german advance on moscow during world war ii cryptologic almanac 50th anniversary series -- venona : an overview ( docid : 3575728 ) generating the one-time pads was a slow and labor-intensive process , and the outbreak of war with germany in june 1941 caused a sudden increase in the need for coded messages it was arlington hall 's lieutenant richard hallock , working on soviet '' trade '' traffic ( so called because these messages dealt with soviet trade issues ) , who first discovered that the soviets were reusing pages gardner credits marie meyer , a linguist with the signal intelligence service with making some of the initial recoveries of the venona codebook on 20 december 1946 , gardner made the first break into the code , revealing the existence of soviet espionage in the manhattan project claims have been made that information from the physical recovery of code books ( a partially burned one was obtained by the finns ) to bugging embassy rooms in which text was entered into encrypting devices ( analyzing the keystrokes by listening to them being punched in ) contributed to recovering much of the plaintext one significant aid ( mentioned by the nsa ) in the early stages may have been work done in cooperation between the japanese and finland cryptanalysis organizations ; when the americans broke into japanese codes during world war ii , they gained access to this information the decryption rate of the nkvd cables was as follows : 1942 1.8 % 1943 15.0 % 1944 49.0 % 1945 1.5 % out of some hundreds of thousands of intercepted encrypted texts , it is claimed under 3,000 have been partially or wholly decrypted the existence of venona decryption became known to the soviets within a few years of the first breaks it is not clear whether the soviets knew how much of the message traffic or which messages had been successfully decrypted at least one soviet penetration agent , british secret intelligence service representative to the u.s since all of the duplicate one-time pad pages had been used by this time , the soviets apparently did not make any changes to their cryptographic procedures after they learned of venona the decrypted messages gave important insights into soviet behavior in the period during which duplicate one-time pads were used descriptions of the activities of precisely the same soviet spies who were named by defecting soviet agents alexander orlov , walter krivitsky , whittaker chambers , and elizabeth bentley '' thanks to successful espionage , the russians tested their first atom bomb in august 1949 , just four years after the first american test the us army security agency , in the person of meredith knox gardner , a genius in his own right , had broken one of what it termed the venona messages—the transmissions that soviet agents in the united states sent to and received from moscow and other nations were targeted in major espionage campaigns by the soviet union as early as 1942 among those identified are julius and ethel rosenberg ; alger hiss ; harry dexter white , the second-highest official in the treasury department ; lauchlin currie , '' currie , known as pazh ( page ) and white , whose cover names were yurist ( jurist ) and changed later to lajer ( lawyer ) , had been soviet agents since the 1930s they had been identified as soviet agents in venona translations and by other agents turned witnesses or informants for the fbi and justice department the identification of individuals mentioned in venona transcripts is sometimes problematic , since people with a '' covert relationship '' with soviet intelligence are referenced by cryptonyms according to authors john earl haynes and harvey klehr , the venona transcripts identify approximately 349 americans who they claim had a covert relationship with soviet intelligence , though fewer than half of these have been matched to real-name identities some of the earliest messages decrypted concerned information from a scientist at the manhattan project , who was referred to by the code names of charles and rest army chief of staff omar bradley , concerned about the white house 's history of leaking sensitive information , decided to deny president truman direct knowledge of the project some of the earliest detailed public knowledge that soviet code messages from world war ii had been broken came with the release of chapman pincher 's book , too secret too long , in 1984 the dearth of reliable information available to the public—or even to the president and congress—may have helped to polarize debates of the 1950s over the extent and danger of soviet espionage in the united states the memo is now available on line at in the memo , belmont discusses the possibility of using the venona translations in court to prosecute soviet agents , and comes out strongly opposed to their use elizabeth bentley history of soviet and russian espionage in the united states list of americans in the venona papers list of soviet agents in the united states

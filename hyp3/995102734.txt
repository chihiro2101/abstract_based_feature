during world war ii and the early years of the cold war , the venona project was a source of information on soviet intelligence-gathering directed at the western military powers these included the julius and ethel rosenberg spying case ( which was based on events during world war ii ) and the defections of donald maclean and guy burgess to the soviet union sometime in 1945 , the existence of the venona program was revealed to the soviet union by cryptology-analyst bill weisband , an nkvd agent in the u.s this effort continued ( many times at a low level of effort in the latter years ) through 1980 , when the venona program was terminated to what extent the various individuals referred to in the messages were involved with soviet intelligence is a topic of historical dispute while a number of academics and historians assert that most of the individuals mentioned in the venona decrypts were most likely either clandestine assets and/or contacts of soviet intelligence agents , how venona was declassified , robert louis benson , symposium of cryptologic history ; october 27 , 2005 the venona project was initiated on february 1 , 1943 , by gene grabeel , an american mathematician and cryptanalyst , under orders from colonel carter w clarke distrusted joseph stalin , and feared that the soviet union would sign a separate peace with nazi germany , allowing germany to focus its military forces against the united kingdom and the united states yuri modin , my five cambridge friends , 1994 , ballantine books , , p however , due to a serious blunder on the part of the soviets , some of this traffic was vulnerable to cryptanalysis the duplication—which undermines the security of a one-time system—was discovered and attempts to lessen its impact were made by sending the duplicates to widely separated users the soviet systems in general used a code to convert words and letters into numbers , to which additive keys ( from one-time pads ) were added , encrypting the content when used correctly so that the plaintext is of a length equal to or less than that of a random key , one-time pad encryption is unbreakable it is probable that the soviet code generators started duplicating cipher pages in order to keep up with demand on 20 december 1946 , gardner made the first break into the code , revealing the existence of soviet espionage in the manhattan project there are also reports that copies of signals purloined from soviet offices by the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) were helpful in the cryptanalysis the finnish radio intelligence sold much of its material concerning soviet codes to oss in 1944 during operation stella polaris , including the partially burned code book nsa reported that ( according to the serial numbers of the venona cables ) thousands of cables were sent , but only a fraction were available to the cryptanalysts the decryption rate of the nkvd cables was as follows : 1942 1.8 % 1943 15.0 % 1944 49.0 % 1945 1.5 % out of some hundreds of thousands of intercepted encrypted texts , it is claimed under 3,000 have been partially or wholly decrypted all the duplicate one-time pad pages were produced in 1942 , and almost all of them had been used by the end of 1945 , with a few being used as late as 1948 after this , soviet message traffic reverted to being completely unreadable at least one soviet penetration agent , british secret intelligence service representative to the u.s however , this information allowed them to alert those of their agents who might be at risk of exposure due to the decryption with the first break into the code , venona revealed the existence of soviet espionage '' these intercepts provided '' thanks to successful espionage , the russians tested their first atom bomb in august 1949 , just four years after the first american test '' identities soon emerged of american , canadian , australian , and british spies in service to the soviet government , including klaus fuchs , alan nunn may , and donald maclean they had been identified as soviet agents in venona translations and by other agents turned witnesses or informants for the fbi and justice department '' a personal aide to franklin roosevelt ; and maurice halperin , a section head in the office of strategic services the identification of individuals mentioned in venona transcripts is sometimes problematic , since people with a '' covert relationship '' with soviet intelligence are referenced by cryptonyms further complicating matters is the fact the same person sometimes had different cryptonyms at different times , and the same cryptonym was sometimes reused for different individuals according to authors john earl haynes and harvey klehr , the venona transcripts identify approximately 349 americans who they claim had a covert relationship with soviet intelligence , though fewer than half of these have been matched to real-name identities however , not every agent may have been communicating directly with soviet intelligence the office of strategic services , the predecessor to the cia , housed at one time or another between fifteen and twenty soviet spies nigel west , venona , największa tajemnica zimnej wojny , warszawa 2006 , p.138 1–31 and american authors herbert romerstein and eric breindel concluded it was roosevelt 's aide harry hopkins according to american authors john earl haynes and harvey klehr , '' 19 '' could be someone from the british delegation to the washington conference in may 1943 however , vasili mitrokhin was a kgb archivist who defected to the united kingdom in 1992 with copies of large numbers of kgb files he claimed harry hopkins was a secret russian agent kim philby had access to cia and fbi files , and more damaging , access to venona project briefings until then , the left-leaning australian labor party had been hostile to domestic intelligence agencies on civil liberties grounds and a labor government founding one seemed a surprising about-face lowenthal 's critique focused on one message ( venona 1822 kgb washington-moscow 30 march 1945 ) , available at the nsa 's venona website

during world war ii and the early years of the cold war , the venona project was a source of information on soviet intelligence-gathering directed at the western military powers although unknown to the public , and even to presidents franklin d these included the julius and ethel rosenberg spying case ( which was based on events during world war ii ) and the defections of donald maclean and guy burgess to the soviet union most decipherable messages were transmitted and intercepted between 1942 and 1945 , during world war ii , when the soviet union was an ally of the us sometime in 1945 , the existence of the venona program was revealed to the soviet union by cryptology-analyst bill weisband , an nkvd agent in the u.s this effort continued ( many times at a low level of effort in the latter years ) through 1980 , when the venona program was terminated to what extent the various individuals referred to in the messages were involved with soviet intelligence is a topic of historical dispute while a number of academics and historians assert that most of the individuals mentioned in the venona decrypts were most likely either clandestine assets and/or contacts of soviet intelligence agents , how venona was declassified , robert louis benson , symposium of cryptologic history ; october 27 , 2005 the venona project was initiated on february 1 , 1943 , by gene grabeel , an american mathematician and cryptanalyst , under orders from colonel carter w clarke , chief of special branch of the military intelligence service at that time clarke distrusted joseph stalin , and feared that the soviet union would sign a separate peace with nazi germany , allowing germany to focus its military forces against the united kingdom and the united states army 's signal intelligence service at arlington hall analyzed encrypted high-level soviet diplomatic intelligence messages intercepted in large volumes during and immediately after world war ii by american , british , and australian listening posts yuri modin , my five cambridge friends , 1994 , ballantine books , , p the soviet systems in general used a code to convert words and letters into numbers , to which additive keys ( from one-time pads ) were added , encrypting the content when used correctly so that the plaintext is of a length equal to or less than that of a random key , one-time pad encryption is unbreakable it was arlington hall 's lieutenant richard hallock , working on soviet '' trade '' traffic ( so called because these messages dealt with soviet trade issues ) , who first discovered that the soviets were reusing pages a young meredith gardner then used this material to break into what turned out to be nkvd ( and later gru ) traffic by reconstructing the code used to convert text to numbers gardner credits marie meyer , a linguist with the signal intelligence service with making some of the initial recoveries of the venona codebook venona messages also indicated that soviet spies worked in washington in the state department , treasury , office of strategic services , and even the white house very slowly , using assorted techniques ranging from traffic analysis to defector information , more of the messages were decrypted claims have been made that information from the physical recovery of code books ( a partially burned one was obtained by the finns ) to bugging embassy rooms in which text was entered into encrypting devices ( analyzing the keystrokes by listening to them being punched in ) contributed to recovering much of the plaintext there are also reports that copies of signals purloined from soviet offices by the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) were helpful in the cryptanalysis nsa reported that ( according to the serial numbers of the venona cables ) thousands of cables were sent , but only a fraction were available to the cryptanalysts approximately 2,200 messages were decrypted and translated ; about half of the 1943 gru-naval washington to moscow messages were broken , but none for any other year , although several thousand were sent between 1941 and 1945 the existence of venona decryption became known to the soviets within a few years of the first breaks at least one soviet penetration agent , british secret intelligence service representative to the u.s since all of the duplicate one-time pad pages had been used by this time , the soviets apparently did not make any changes to their cryptographic procedures after they learned of venona the decrypted messages gave important insights into soviet behavior in the period during which duplicate one-time pads were used with the first break into the code , venona revealed the existence of soviet espionage '' these intercepts provided '' thanks to successful espionage , the russians tested their first atom bomb in august 1949 , just four years after the first american test the us army security agency , in the person of meredith knox gardner , a genius in his own right , had broken one of what it termed the venona messagesâ€”the transmissions that soviet agents in the united states sent to and received from moscow they had been identified as soviet agents in venona translations and by other agents turned witnesses or informants for the fbi and justice department the identification of individuals mentioned in venona transcripts is sometimes problematic , since people with a '' covert relationship '' with soviet intelligence are referenced by cryptonyms in some cases , notably hiss , the matching of a venona cryptonym to an individual is disputed venona and other recent information has shown , while the content of julius ' atomic espionage was not as vital to the soviets as alleged at the time of his espionage activities , in other fields it was extensive '' in his 1998 book , united states senator daniel patrick moynihan expressed certainty about hiss 's identification by venona as a soviet spy , writing '' hiss was indeed a soviet agent and appears to have been regarded by moscow as its most important '' one of the considerations in releasing venona translations was the privacy interests of the individuals mentioned , referenced , or identified in the translations intelligence historian nigel west believes that '' venona remains an irrefutable resource , far more reliable than the mercurial recollections of kgb defectors and the dubious conclusions drawn by paranoid analysts mesmerized by machiavellian plots the schneirs ' critique of the venona documents was based on their decades of work on the case of ethel and julius rosenberg victor navasky , editor and publisher of the nation , has also written several editorials highly critical of john earl haynes ' and harvey klehr 's interpretation of recent work on the subject of soviet espionage venona pdfs , arranged by date ( nsa ) '' secrets , lies , and atomic spies '' , pbs transcript , airdate : february 5 , 2002

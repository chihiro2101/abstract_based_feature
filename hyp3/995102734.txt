during world war ii and the early years of the cold war , the venona project was a source of information on soviet intelligence-gathering directed at the western military powers these included the julius and ethel rosenberg spying case ( which was based on events during world war ii ) and the defections of donald maclean and guy burgess to the soviet union most decipherable messages were transmitted and intercepted between 1942 and 1945 , during world war ii , when the soviet union was an ally of the us sometime in 1945 , the existence of the venona program was revealed to the soviet union by cryptology-analyst bill weisband , an nkvd agent in the u.s this effort continued ( many times at a low level of effort in the latter years ) through 1980 , when the venona program was terminated while a number of academics and historians assert that most of the individuals mentioned in the venona decrypts were most likely either clandestine assets and/or contacts of soviet intelligence agents , how venona was declassified , robert louis benson , symposium of cryptologic history ; october 27 , 2005 the venona project was initiated on february 1 , 1943 , by gene grabeel , an american mathematician and cryptanalyst , under orders from colonel carter w clarke distrusted joseph stalin , and feared that the soviet union would sign a separate peace with nazi germany , allowing germany to focus its military forces against the united kingdom and the united states army 's signal intelligence service at arlington hall analyzed encrypted high-level soviet diplomatic intelligence messages intercepted in large volumes during and immediately after world war ii by american , british , and australian listening posts when used correctly , the one-time pad encryption system , which has been used for all the most-secret military and diplomatic communication since the 1930s , is unbreakable the soviet systems in general used a code to convert words and letters into numbers , to which additive keys ( from one-time pads ) were added , encrypting the content when used correctly so that the plaintext is of a length equal to or less than that of a random key , one-time pad encryption is unbreakable it was arlington hall 's lieutenant richard hallock , working on soviet '' trade '' traffic ( so called because these messages dealt with soviet trade issues ) , who first discovered that the soviets were reusing pages a young meredith gardner then used this material to break into what turned out to be nkvd ( and later gru ) traffic by reconstructing the code used to convert text to numbers gardner credits marie meyer , a linguist with the signal intelligence service with making some of the initial recoveries of the venona codebook on 20 december 1946 , gardner made the first break into the code , revealing the existence of soviet espionage in the manhattan project nsa reported that ( according to the serial numbers of the venona cables ) thousands of cables were sent , but only a fraction were available to the cryptanalysts approximately 2,200 messages were decrypted and translated ; about half of the 1943 gru-naval washington to moscow messages were broken , but none for any other year , although several thousand were sent between 1941 and 1945 the decryption rate of the nkvd cables was as follows : 1942 1.8 % 1943 15.0 % 1944 49.0 % 1945 1.5 % out of some hundreds of thousands of intercepted encrypted texts , it is claimed under 3,000 have been partially or wholly decrypted the existence of venona decryption became known to the soviets within a few years of the first breaks at least one soviet penetration agent , british secret intelligence service representative to the u.s since all of the duplicate one-time pad pages had been used by this time , the soviets apparently did not make any changes to their cryptographic procedures after they learned of venona descriptions of the activities of precisely the same soviet spies who were named by defecting soviet agents alexander orlov , walter krivitsky , whittaker chambers , and elizabeth bentley '' thanks to successful espionage , the russians tested their first atom bomb in august 1949 , just four years after the first american test as will be discussed , we had learned of the los alamos spies in december 1946—december 20 , to be precise the us army security agency , in the person of meredith knox gardner , a genius in his own right , had broken one of what it termed the venona messages—the transmissions that soviet agents in the united states sent to and received from moscow '' identities soon emerged of american , canadian , australian , and british spies in service to the soviet government , including klaus fuchs , alan nunn may , and donald maclean the messages show that the u.s and other nations were targeted in major espionage campaigns by the soviet union as early as 1942 they had been identified as soviet agents in venona translations and by other agents turned witnesses or informants for the fbi and justice department from the venona translations , both were known to pass intelligence to their handlers , notably the silvermaster network the identification of individuals mentioned in venona transcripts is sometimes problematic , since people with a '' covert relationship '' with soviet intelligence are referenced by cryptonyms however , not every agent may have been communicating directly with soviet intelligence the office of strategic services , the predecessor to the cia , housed at one time or another between fifteen and twenty soviet spies some known spies , including theodore hall , were neither prosecuted nor publicly implicated , because the venona evidence against them was withheld '' venona 's source 19 and the trident conference of may 1943 : diplomacy or espionage ?

during world war ii and the early years of the cold war , the venona project was a source of information on soviet intelligence-gathering directed at the western military powers truman , these programs were of importance concerning crucial events of the early cold war these included the julius and ethel rosenberg spying case ( which was based on events during world war ii ) and the defections of donald maclean and guy burgess to the soviet union most decipherable messages were transmitted and intercepted between 1942 and 1945 , during world war ii , when the soviet union was an ally of the us sometime in 1945 , the existence of the venona program was revealed to the soviet union by cryptology-analyst bill weisband , an nkvd agent in the u.s this effort continued ( many times at a low level of effort in the latter years ) through 1980 , when the venona program was terminated to what extent the various individuals referred to in the messages were involved with soviet intelligence is a topic of historical dispute others argue that many of those people probably had no malicious intentions and committed no crimes the venona project was initiated on february 1 , 1943 , by gene grabeel , an american mathematician and cryptanalyst , under orders from colonel carter w clarke , chief of special branch of the military intelligence service at that time when used correctly , the one-time pad encryption system , which has been used for all the most-secret military and diplomatic communication since the 1930s , is unbreakable despite this , the reuse was detected by cryptanalysts in the us generating the one-time pads was a slow and labor-intensive process , and the outbreak of war with germany in june 1941 caused a sudden increase in the need for coded messages it is probable that the soviet code generators started duplicating cipher pages in order to keep up with demand samuel chew and cecil phillips also made valuable contributions on 20 december 1946 , gardner made the first break into the code , revealing the existence of soviet espionage in the manhattan project venona messages also indicated that soviet spies worked in washington in the state department , treasury , office of strategic services , and even the white house very slowly , using assorted techniques ranging from traffic analysis to defector information , more of the messages were decrypted there are also reports that copies of signals purloined from soviet offices by the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) were helpful in the cryptanalysis the finnish radio intelligence sold much of its material concerning soviet codes to oss in 1944 during operation stella polaris , including the partially burned code book approximately 2,200 messages were decrypted and translated ; about half of the 1943 gru-naval washington to moscow messages were broken , but none for any other year , although several thousand were sent between 1941 and 1945 all the duplicate one-time pad pages were produced in 1942 , and almost all of them had been used by the end of 1945 , with a few being used as late as 1948 after this , soviet message traffic reverted to being completely unreadable it is not clear whether the soviets knew how much of the message traffic or which messages had been successfully decrypted kim philby , was told about the project in 1949 , as part of his job as liaison between british and u.s however , this information allowed them to alert those of their agents who might be at risk of exposure due to the decryption with the first break into the code , venona revealed the existence of soviet espionage '' these intercepts provided descriptions of the activities of precisely the same soviet spies who were named by defecting soviet agents alexander orlov , walter krivitsky , whittaker chambers , and elizabeth bentley the identification of individuals mentioned in venona transcripts is sometimes problematic , since people with a '' covert relationship '' with soviet intelligence are referenced by cryptonyms in many other cases , a venona cryptonym has not yet been linked to any person the war production board , the board of economic warfare , the office of the coordinator of inter-american affairs and the office of war information , included at least half a dozen soviet sources each among their employees venona has added information—some unequivocal , some ambiguous—to several espionage cases '' venona 's source 19 and the trident conference of may 1943 : diplomacy or espionage ? '' according to american authors john earl haynes and harvey klehr , '' 19 '' could be someone from the british delegation to the washington conference in may 1943 moreover , they argue no evidence of hopkins as an agent has been found in other archives , and the partial message relating to '' 19 '' does not indicate if this source was a spy however , vasili mitrokhin was a kgb archivist who defected to the united kingdom in 1992 with copies of large numbers of kgb files the sword and the shield : the mitrokhin archive and the secret history of the kgb , by vasily mitrokhin and christopher andrew kim philby had access to cia and fbi files , and more damaging , access to venona project briefings many inside the nsa had argued internally that the time had come to publicly release the details of the venona project , but it was not until 1995 that the bipartisan commission on government secrecy , with senator moynihan as chairman , released venona project materials public access—or broader governmental access—to the venona evidence would certainly have affected this debate , as it is affecting the retrospective debate among historians and others now elizabeth bentley history of soviet and russian espionage in the united states list of americans in the venona papers list of soviet agents in the united states

during world war ii and the early years of the cold war , the venona project was a source of information on soviet intelligence-gathering directed at the western military powers these included the julius and ethel rosenberg spying case ( which was based on events during world war ii ) and the defections of donald maclean and guy burgess to the soviet union most decipherable messages were transmitted and intercepted between 1942 and 1945 , during world war ii , when the soviet union was an ally of the us sometime in 1945 , the existence of the venona program was revealed to the soviet union by cryptology-analyst bill weisband , an nkvd agent in the u.s this effort continued ( many times at a low level of effort in the latter years ) through 1980 , when the venona program was terminated the venona project was initiated on february 1 , 1943 , by gene grabeel , an american mathematician and cryptanalyst , under orders from colonel carter w clarke distrusted joseph stalin , and feared that the soviet union would sign a separate peace with nazi germany , allowing germany to focus its military forces against the united kingdom and the united states army 's signal intelligence service at arlington hall analyzed encrypted high-level soviet diplomatic intelligence messages intercepted in large volumes during and immediately after world war ii by american , british , and australian listening posts the soviet company that manufactured the one-time pads produced around 35,000 pages of duplicate key numbers , as a result of pressures brought about by the german advance on moscow during world war ii the soviet systems in general used a code to convert words and letters into numbers , to which additive keys ( from one-time pads ) were added , encrypting the content when used correctly so that the plaintext is of a length equal to or less than that of a random key , one-time pad encryption is unbreakable it is probable that the soviet code generators started duplicating cipher pages in order to keep up with demand gardner credits marie meyer , a linguist with the signal intelligence service with making some of the initial recoveries of the venona codebook very slowly , using assorted techniques ranging from traffic analysis to defector information , more of the messages were decrypted there are also reports that copies of signals purloined from soviet offices by the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) were helpful in the cryptanalysis the finnish radio intelligence sold much of its material concerning soviet codes to oss in 1944 during operation stella polaris , including the partially burned code book approximately 2,200 messages were decrypted and translated ; about half of the 1943 gru-naval washington to moscow messages were broken , but none for any other year , although several thousand were sent between 1941 and 1945 the decryption rate of the nkvd cables was as follows : 1942 1.8 % 1943 15.0 % 1944 49.0 % 1945 1.5 % out of some hundreds of thousands of intercepted encrypted texts , it is claimed under 3,000 have been partially or wholly decrypted all the duplicate one-time pad pages were produced in 1942 , and almost all of them had been used by the end of 1945 , with a few being used as late as 1948 after this , soviet message traffic reverted to being completely unreadable at least one soviet penetration agent , british secret intelligence service representative to the u.s since all of the duplicate one-time pad pages had been used by this time , the soviets apparently did not make any changes to their cryptographic procedures after they learned of venona however , this information allowed them to alert those of their agents who might be at risk of exposure due to the decryption the decrypted messages gave important insights into soviet behavior in the period during which duplicate one-time pads were used descriptions of the activities of precisely the same soviet spies who were named by defecting soviet agents alexander orlov , walter krivitsky , whittaker chambers , and elizabeth bentley others worked in washington in the state department , the treasury , office of strategic services , '' kgb cables indicated that the office of strategic services ( oss ) in world war ii had been thoroughly infiltrated with soviet agents and other nations were targeted in major espionage campaigns by the soviet union as early as 1942 they had been identified as soviet agents in venona translations and by other agents turned witnesses or informants for the fbi and justice department from the venona translations , both were known to pass intelligence to their handlers , notably the silvermaster network the identification of individuals mentioned in venona transcripts is sometimes problematic , since people with a '' covert relationship '' with soviet intelligence are referenced by cryptonyms further complicating matters is the fact the same person sometimes had different cryptonyms at different times , and the same cryptonym was sometimes reused for different individuals '' venona 's source 19 and the trident conference of may 1943 : diplomacy or espionage ?

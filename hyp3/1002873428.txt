history of poison gas in world war i the most frequently used chemicals during world war i were tear gas rather than fatal or disabling poisons during world war i , the french army was the first to employ tear gas , using 26 & nbsp ; mm grenades filled with ethyl bromoacetate in august 1914 the small quantities of gas delivered , roughly 19 & nbsp ; cmÂ³ per cartridge , were not even detected by the germans in october 1914 , german troops fired fragmentation shells filled with a chemical irritant against british positions at neuve chapelle ; the concentration achieved was so small that it too was barely noticed none of the combatants considered the use of tear gas to be in conflict with the hague treaty of 1899 , which specifically prohibited the launching of projectiles containing asphyxiating or poisonous gas it may appear from a feldpost letter of major karl von zingler that the first chlorine gas attack by german forces took place before 2 january 1915 : '' in other war theatres it does not go better and it has been said that our chlorine is very effective this letter must be discounted as evidence for early german use of chlorine , however , because the date '' 2 january 1915 '' may have been hastily scribbled instead of the intended '' 2 january 1916 , '' the sort of common typographical error that is often made at the beginning of a new year the deaths of so many english officers from gas at this time would certainly have been met with outrage , but a recent , extensive study of british reactions to chemical warfare says nothing of this supposed attack at 17:30 , in a slight easterly breeze , the liquid chlorine was siphoned from the tanks , producing gas which formed a grey-green cloud that drifted across positions held by french colonial troops from martinique , as well as the 1st tirailleurs and the 2nd zouaves from algeria the german infantry were also wary of the gas and , lacking reinforcements , failed to exploit the break before the 1st canadian division and assorted french troops reformed the line in scattered , hastily prepared positions apart the entente governments claimed the attack was a flagrant violation of international law but germany argued that the hague treaty had only banned chemical shells , rather than the use of gas projectors in what became the second battle of ypres , the germans used gas on three more occasions ; on 24 april against the 1st canadian division , on 2 may near mouse trap farm and on 5 may against the british at hill 60 the british official history stated that at hill 60 , '' 90 men died from gas poisoning in the trenches or before they could be got to a dressing station ; of the 207 brought to the nearest dressing stations , 46 died almost immediately and 12 after long suffering chemicals used in the production of chemical weapons have also left residues in the soil where the weapons were used chemical weapons in world war i gas warfare gas-poisoning , by arthur hurst , m.a , md ( oxon ) , frcp 1917 effects of chlorine gas poisoning understanding chemical weapons in the first world war

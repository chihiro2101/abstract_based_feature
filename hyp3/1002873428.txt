history of poison gas in world war i the most frequently used chemicals during world war i were tear gas rather than fatal or disabling poisons during world war i , the french army was the first to employ tear gas , using 26 & nbsp ; mm grenades filled with ethyl bromoacetate in august 1914 the small quantities of gas delivered , roughly 19 & nbsp ; cm³ per cartridge , were not even detected by the germans none of the combatants considered the use of tear gas to be in conflict with the hague treaty of 1899 , which specifically prohibited the launching of projectiles containing asphyxiating or poisonous gas german chemical companies basf , hoechst and bayer ( which formed the ig farben conglomerate in 1925 ) had been making chlorine as a by-product of their dye manufacturing it may appear from a feldpost letter of major karl von zingler that the first chlorine gas attack by german forces took place before 2 january 1915 : '' in other war theatres it does not go better and it has been said that our chlorine is very effective the deaths of so many english officers from gas at this time would certainly have been met with outrage , but a recent , extensive study of british reactions to chemical warfare says nothing of this supposed attack perhaps this letter was referring to the chlorine-phosgene attack on british troops at wieltje near ypres , on 19 december 1915 ( see below ) at 17:30 , in a slight easterly breeze , the liquid chlorine was siphoned from the tanks , producing gas which formed a grey-green cloud that drifted across positions held by french colonial troops from martinique , as well as the 1st tirailleurs and the 2nd zouaves from algeria the german infantry were also wary of the gas and , lacking reinforcements , failed to exploit the break before the 1st canadian division and assorted french troops reformed the line in scattered , hastily prepared positions apart on 6 august , german troops used chlorine gas against russian troops defending osowiec fortress germany used chemical weapons on the eastern front in an attack at rawka , south of warsaw immediately following the use of chlorine gas by the germans , instructions were sent to british and french troops to hold wet handkerchiefs or cloths over their mouths the british expressed outrage at germany 's use of poison gas at ypres and responded by developing their own gas warfare capability in the years following world war one , there were many conferences held in attempts to abolish the use of chemical weapons all together , such as the washington naval conference ( 1921–22 ) , geneva conference ( 1923–25 ) and the world disarmament conference ( 1933 ) , md ( oxon ) , frcp 1917 effects of chlorine gas poisoning understanding chemical weapons in the first world war

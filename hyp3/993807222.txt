some classic riddims , such as '' nanny goat '' and '' real rock '' both produced by coxsone dodd , are essentially the accompaniment tracks of the original 1960s reggae songs with those names since the 1980s , however , riddims started to be originally composed by producers/beatmakers , who give the riddims original names and , typically , contract artists to voice over them in dancehall performing , those whose timing is right on top of the rhythm are said to be riding di riddim in most cases , the term riddim is used in reference to the entire background track or rhythm section , but in older roots riddims , riddim is used to reference a certain bass line and drum pattern often a melody is associated with the riddim , and occasionally an artist will produce two different songs with the same riddim ( e.g the work of djs became less of shouting throughout points during a song , but more focused on an aesthetic with the voicings over these instrumental riddims the instrumental of ne-yo 's '' miss independent '' became a popular riddim ; many dancehall artists have recorded songs using the track other songs have inspired riddims as well , such as george michael ’ s song “ faith '' , which became a riddim of the same name , the cure 's song '' close to me '' , which became the cure riddim , and r the second type is the ragga riddim backing raggamuffin and dancehall songs , such as the juice riddim , produced by richard '' shams '' browne there 's fluidity in the fact that a riddim could have so many different voicings attached and on the flip side , a certain voicing could have so many different riddims which again reflects the diasporic transference many riddims are named after the song that was recorded on that instrumental track for the first time ( or , in some cases , the song that becomes the most popular on a given riddim )

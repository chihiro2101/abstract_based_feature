some classic riddims , such as '' nanny goat '' and '' real rock '' both produced by coxsone dodd , are essentially the accompaniment tracks of the original 1960s reggae songs with those names since the 1980s , however , riddims started to be originally composed by producers/beatmakers , who give the riddims original names and , typically , contract artists to voice over them '' riddims are the primary musical building blocks of jamaican popular songs at any given time , ten to fifteen riddims are widely used in dancehall recordings , but only two or three of these are the now ting ( i.e , the latest riddims that everyone must record over if they want to get them played in the dance or on radio ) in most cases , the term riddim is used in reference to the entire background track or rhythm section , but in older roots riddims , riddim is used to reference a certain bass line and drum pattern riddims , therefore , became the standard practice for dancehall as it has progressed the instrumental of ne-yo 's '' miss independent '' became a popular riddim ; many dancehall artists have recorded songs using the track other songs have inspired riddims as well , such as george michael ’ s song “ faith '' , which became a riddim of the same name , the cure 's song '' close to me '' , which became the cure riddim , and r there 's fluidity in the fact that a riddim could have so many different voicings attached and on the flip side , a certain voicing could have so many different riddims which again reflects the diasporic transference many riddims are named after the song that was recorded on that instrumental track for the first time ( or , in some cases , the song that becomes the most popular on a given riddim )

suppose that a piece of information about the value of a stock ( say , about a future merger ) is widely available to investors if the price of the stock does not already reflect that information , then investors can trade on it , thereby moving the price until the information is no longer useful for trading investors typically do not like to hold stocks during a financial crisis , and thus investors may sell stocks until the price drops enough so that the expected return compensates for this risk how efficient markets are ( and are not ) linked to the random walk theory can be described through the fundamental theorem of asset pricing this theorem states that , in the absence of arbitrage , the price of any stock is given by : p_t e_tm_ and researchers have disputed the efficient-market hypothesis both empirically and theoretically behavioral finance attribute the imperfections in financial markets to a combination of cognitive biases such as overconfidence , overreaction , representative bias , information bias , and various other predictable human errors in reasoning and information processing in an earlier paper , dreman also refuted the assertion by ray ball that these higher returns could be attributed to higher beta , ; ball r journal of financial economics 6:103â€“126 dreman 's research had been accepted by efficient market theorists as explaining the anomaly dreman d behavioral psychology approaches to stock market trading are among some of the more promising alternatives to emh ( investment strategies such as momentum trading seek to exploit exactly such inefficiencies ) it is demonstrably true that bonds , mortgages , annuities and other similar financial instruments subject to competitive market forces do not any manifestation of hyperbolic discounting in the pricing of these obligations would invite arbitrage thereby quickly eliminating any vestige of individual biases by contrast , the price signals in markets are far less subject to individual biases highlighted by the behavioral finance programme in a 2008 report he identified complexity and herd behavior as central to the global financial crisis of 2008 consequently , a situation arises where either the asset pricing model is incorrect or the market is inefficient , but one has no way of knowing which is the case . emh anomalies and rejection of the capital asset pricing model ( capm ) these risk factor models are not properly founded on economic theory ( whereas capm is founded on modern portfolio theory ) , but rather , constructed with long-short portfolios in response to the observed empirical emh anomalies these risk factors are said to represent some aspect or dimension of undiversifiable systematic risk which should be compensated with higher expected returns he says preponderance of value investing among the world 's money managers with the highest rates of performance rebuts the claim of emh proponents that luck is the reason some investors appear more successful than others when pressed on this point , pinkington argues that emh proponents will usually say that any actual investor will converge with the average investor given enough time and so no investor will beat the market average nobel prize-winning economist paul samuelson argued that the stock market is '' micro efficient '' but not '' macro efficient '' : the emh is much better suited for individual stocks than it is for the aggregate stock market if asset prices are rational and based on all available data as the efficient market hypothesis proposes , then fluctuations in asset price are not random adaptive market hypothesis financial market efficiency dumb agent theory index fund insider trading investment theory noisy market hypothesis perfect market transparency ( market ) random walk hypothesis '' efficient market hypothesis , '' the new palgrave : a dictionary of economics , v

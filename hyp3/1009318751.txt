suppose that a piece of information about the value of a stock ( say , about a future merger ) is widely available to investors if the price of the stock does not already reflect that information , then investors can trade on it , thereby moving the price until the information is no longer useful for trading note that this thought experiment does not necessarily imply that stock prices are unpredictable for example , suppose that the piece of information in question says that a financial crisis is likely to come soon investors typically do not like to hold stocks during a financial crisis , and thus investors may sell stocks until the price drops enough so that the expected return compensates for this risk how efficient markets are ( and are not ) linked to the random walk theory can be described through the fundamental theorem of asset pricing this theorem states that , in the absence of arbitrage , the price of any stock is given by : p_t e_tm_ and researchers have disputed the efficient-market hypothesis both empirically and theoretically behavioral finance attribute the imperfections in financial markets to a combination of cognitive biases such as overconfidence , overreaction , representative bias , information bias , and various other predictable human errors in reasoning and information processing journal of financial economics 6:103â€“126 dreman 's research had been accepted by efficient market theorists as explaining the anomaly dreman d behavioral psychology approaches to stock market trading are among some of the more promising alternatives to emh ( investment strategies such as momentum trading seek to exploit exactly such inefficiencies ) it is demonstrably true that bonds , mortgages , annuities and other similar financial instruments subject to competitive market forces do not . emh anomalies and rejection of the capital asset pricing model ( capm ) while event studies of stock splits are consistent with the emh ( fama , fisher , jensen , and roll , 1969 ) , other empirical analyses have found problems with the efficient-market hypothesis following gjr 's results and mounting empirical evidence of emh anomalies , academics began to move away from the capm towards risk factor models such as the fama-french 3 factor model these risk factor models are not properly founded on economic theory ( whereas capm is founded on modern portfolio theory ) , but rather , constructed with long-short portfolios in response to the observed empirical emh anomalies additional popular risk factors include the '' hml '' value factor ( fama and french , 1993 ) ; '' mom '' momentum factor ( carhart , 1997 ) ; '' illiq '' liquidity factors ( amihud et al economists matthew bishop and michael green claim that full acceptance of the hypothesis goes against the thinking of adam smith and john maynard keynes , who both believed irrational behavior had a real impact on the markets economist john quiggin has claimed that '' bitcoin is perhaps the finest example of a pure bubble '' , and that it provides a conclusive refutation of emh if asset prices are rational and based on all available data as the efficient market hypothesis proposes , then fluctuations in asset price are not random tillinghast also asserts that even staunch emh proponents will admit weaknesses to the theory when assets are significantly over- or under-priced , such as double or half their value according to fundamental analysis the financial crisis led richard posner , a prominent judge , university of chicago law professor , and innovator in the field of law and economics , to back away from the hypothesis adaptive market hypothesis financial market efficiency dumb agent theory index fund insider trading investment theory noisy market hypothesis perfect market transparency ( market ) random walk hypothesis e-m-h.org '' earnings quality and the equity risk premium : a benchmark model '' abstract from contemporary accounting research '' as the index fund moves from heresy to dogma

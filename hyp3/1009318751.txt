suppose that a piece of information about the value of a stock ( say , about a future merger ) is widely available to investors if the price of the stock does not already reflect that information , then investors can trade on it , thereby moving the price until the information is no longer useful for trading for example , suppose that the piece of information in question says that a financial crisis is likely to come soon investors typically do not like to hold stocks during a financial crisis , and thus investors may sell stocks until the price drops enough so that the expected return compensates for this risk how efficient markets are ( and are not ) linked to the random walk theory can be described through the fundamental theorem of asset pricing this theorem states that , in the absence of arbitrage , the price of any stock is given by : p_t e_tm_ and researchers have disputed the efficient-market hypothesis both empirically and theoretically behavioral finance attribute the imperfections in financial markets to a combination of cognitive biases such as overconfidence , overreaction , representative bias , information bias , and various other predictable human errors in reasoning and information processing journal of financial economics 6:103–126 dreman 's research had been accepted by efficient market theorists as explaining the anomaly dreman d behavioral psychology approaches to stock market trading are among some of the more promising alternatives to emh ( investment strategies such as momentum trading seek to exploit exactly such inefficiencies ) '' indeed , defenders of emh maintain that behavioral finance strengthens the case for emh in that it highlights biases in individuals and committees and not competitive markets any manifestation of hyperbolic discounting in the pricing of these obligations would invite arbitrage thereby quickly eliminating any vestige of individual biases on the other hand , economists , behavioral psychologists and mutual fund managers are drawn from the human population and are therefore subject to the biases that behavioralists showcase by contrast , the price signals in markets are far less subject to individual biases highlighted by the behavioral finance programme consequently , a situation arises where either the asset pricing model is incorrect or the market is inefficient , but one has no way of knowing which is the case early examples include the observation that small neglected stocks and stocks with high book-to-market ( low price-to-book ) ratios ( value stocks ) tended to achieve abnormally high returns relative to what could be explained by the capm these risk factor models are not properly founded on economic theory ( whereas capm is founded on modern portfolio theory ) , but rather , constructed with long-short portfolios in response to the observed empirical emh anomalies he says preponderance of value investing among the world 's money managers with the highest rates of performance rebuts the claim of emh proponents that luck is the reason some investors appear more successful than others burton malkiel in his a random walk down wall street ( 1973 ) malkiel , a random walk down wall street , 1996 , p he argues that , taken at face value , the theory makes the banal claim that the average investor will not beat the market average—which is a tautology if asset prices are rational and based on all available data as the efficient market hypothesis proposes , then fluctuations in asset price are not random columbia business school publishing but he also contends the emh is not completely accurate or accurate in all cases , given the recurrent existence of economic bubbles ( when some assets are dramatically overpriced ) and the fact that value investing ( who focus on underpriced assets ) have tended to outperform the broader market over long periods martin wolf , the chief economics commentator for the financial times , dismissed the hypothesis as being a useless way to examine how markets function in reality adaptive market hypothesis financial market efficiency dumb agent theory index fund insider trading investment theory noisy market hypothesis perfect market transparency ( market ) random walk hypothesis

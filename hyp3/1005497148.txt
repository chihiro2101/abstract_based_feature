merry , bruce ( 2002 ) '' george gemistos plethon ( c plethon admired plato ( greek : plátōn ) so much that late in life he took the similar-meaning name plethon plethon is also an archaic translation of the greek γεμιστός gemistós ( '' full , stuffed '' ) some time before 1410 , emperor manuel ii paleologus sent him to mistra in the despotate of morea in the southern peloponnese , which remained his home for the rest of his life his pupils included bessarion and george scholarius ( later to become patriarch of constantinople and plethon 's enemy ) in 1428 pletho was consulted by emperor john viii on the issue of unifying the greek and latin churches , and advised that both delegations should have equal voting power byzantine scholars had been in contact with their counterparts in western europe since the time of the latin empire , and especially since the byzantine empire had begun to ask for western european help against the ottomans in the 14th century despite not being a theologian , pletho was chosen to accompany john viii on the basis of his renowned wisdom and morality ( debolt ) and he essentially reintroduced much of plato to the western world , shaking the domination which aristotle had come to exercise over western european thought in the high and later middle ages marsilio ficino 's introduction to the translation of plotinus has traditionally been interpreted to the effect that cosimo de ' medici attended pletho 's lectures and was inspired to found the accademia platonica in florence , where italian students of pletho continued to teach after the conclusion of the council in fact , communication between pletho and cosimo de ' medici - for whose meeting there is no independent evidence - would have been severely constrained by the language barrier marsilio ficino , the florentine humanism and the first director of the accademia platonica , paid plethon the ultimate honour , calling him 'the second plato ' , while cardinal bessarion speculated as to whether plato 's soul occupied his body hanegraaff p.32 george scholarius responded with a defence of aristotle , which elicited plethon 's subsequent reply believing that the peloponnese were direct descendants of the ancient hellenes , plethon rejected justinian 's idea of a universal empire in favour of recreating the hellenistic civilization , the zenith of greek influence land was to be publicly owned , and a third of all produce given to the state fund ; incentives would be given for cultivating virgin land trade would be regulated and the use of coinage limited , barter instead being encouraged ; locally available products would be supported over imports morea was under invasion from sultan mehmet ii , and theodora escaped with demetrios to constantinople where she gave the manuscript back to gennadius , reluctant to destroy the only copy of such a distinguished scholar 's work herself he rejected the concept of a brief reign of evil followed by perpetual happiness , and held that the human soul is reincarnated , directed by the gods into successive bodies to fulfill divine order plethon describes the creation of the universe as being perfect and outside of time , so that the universe remains eternal , without beginning or end the soul of man , like the gods is immortal and essentially good , and is reincarnated in successive mortal bodies for eternity at the direction of the gods pound was fascinated by the role that plethon 's conversation must have had on cosimo de medici and his decision to acquire greek manuscripts of plato and neoplatonic philosophers

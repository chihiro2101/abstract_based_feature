the three most popular ways of analysing a street network are integration , choice and depth distance integration measures the amount of street-to-street transitions needed from a street segment , to reach all other street segments in the network , using shortest paths the graph analysis could also limit measure integration at radius ' n ' , for segments further than this radius not to be taken into account theoretically , the integration measure shows the cognitive complexity of reaching a street , and is often argued to 'predict ' the pedestrian use of a street : the easier it is to reach a street , the more popular it should be each time an intersection appears , the remaining value of flow is divided equally amongst the splitting streets , until all the other street segments in the graph are reached for instance , at the first intersection with a single other street , the initial value of one is split into two remaining values of one half , and allocated to the two intersecting street segments space syntax argues that these values often predict the car traffic flow of streets , but , strictly speaking , choice analysis can also be thought to represent the number of intersections that need to be crossed to reach a street many prominent design applications have been made by the architectural and urban planning practice space syntax limited , which was founded at the bartlett , university college london in 1989 space syntax 's mathematical reliability has come under scrutiny because of a seeming paradox that arises under certain geometric configurations with 'axial maps ' , one of the method 's primary representations of spatial configuration recently there has also been research development that combines space syntax with geographic accessibility analysis in gis , such as the place syntax-models developed by the research group spatial analysis and design at the royal institute of technology in stockholm , sweden

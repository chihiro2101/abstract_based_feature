the general idea is that spaces can be broken down into components , analyzed as networks of choices , then represented as maps and graphs that describe the relative connectivity and integration of those spaces the three most popular ways of analysing a street network are integration , choice and depth distance the graph analysis could also limit measure integration at radius ' n ' , for segments further than this radius not to be taken into account the result of the analysis finds street segments that require fewest turns to reach all other streets , which are called 'most integrated ' and are usually represented with hotter colors , such as red or yellow such streets , as oxford street in london , come out as especially strongly integrated space syntax argues that these values often predict the car traffic flow of streets , but , strictly speaking , choice analysis can also be thought to represent the number of intersections that need to be crossed to reach a street space syntax originated as a programme research in the early 1970s when bill hillier , adrian leaman and alan beattie came together at the school of environmental studies at university college london ( now part of the bartlett school of architecture ) many prominent design applications have been made by the architectural and urban planning practice space syntax limited , which was founded at the bartlett , university college london in 1989 space syntax 's mathematical reliability has come under scrutiny because of a seeming paradox that arises under certain geometric configurations with 'axial maps ' , one of the method 's primary representations of spatial configuration this paradox was proposed by carlo ratti at the massachusetts institute of technology , but comprehensively refuted in a passionate academic exchange with bill hillier and alan penn 2004

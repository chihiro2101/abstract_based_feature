the three most popular ways of analysing a street network are integration , choice and depth distance integration measures the amount of street-to-street transitions needed from a street segment , to reach all other street segments in the network , using shortest paths the result of the analysis finds street segments that require fewest turns to reach all other streets , which are called 'most integrated ' and are usually represented with hotter colors , such as red or yellow however , a slightly curvy street of the same length would typically be segmented into individual straight segments , not counted as a single line , which makes curvy streets appear less integrated in the analysis space syntax argues that these values often predict the car traffic flow of streets , but , strictly speaking , choice analysis can also be thought to represent the number of intersections that need to be crossed to reach a street space syntax originated as a programme research in the early 1970s when bill hillier , adrian leaman and alan beattie came together at the school of environmental studies at university college london ( now part of the bartlett school of architecture ) many prominent design applications have been made by the architectural and urban planning practice space syntax limited , which was founded at the bartlett , university college london in 1989 over the past decade , space syntax techniques have been used for research in archaeology , information technology , urban and human geography , and anthropology recently there has also been research development that combines space syntax with geographic accessibility analysis in gis , such as the place syntax-models developed by the research group spatial analysis and design at the royal institute of technology in stockholm , sweden a series of interdisciplinary works published from 2006 by vito latora , sergio porta and colleagues , proposing a network approach to street centrality analysis and design , have highlighted space syntax ' contribution to decades of previous studies in the physics of spatial complex networks .

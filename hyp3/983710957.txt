the graph analysis could also limit measure integration at radius ' n ' , for segments further than this radius not to be taken into account the first intersecting segment requires only one transition , the second two transitions and so on imagine that each street segment is given an initial load of one unit of water , which then starts pouring from the starting street segment to all segments that successively connect to it space syntax argues that these values often predict the car traffic flow of streets , but , strictly speaking , choice analysis can also be thought to represent the number of intersections that need to be crossed to reach a street from these components it is thought to be possible to quantify and describe how easily navigable any space is , useful for the design of museums , airports , hospitals , and other settings where wayfinding is a significant issue one of the first cohort of students on the mscaas was julienne hanson who went on to co-author the social logic of space ( sls ) with bill hillier ( cup , 1984 ) this brought together in one place a comprehensive review of the programme of research up to that point , but also developed a full theoretical account for how the buildings and settlements we construct an not merely the product of social processes , but also play a role in producing social forms many prominent design applications have been made by the architectural and urban planning practice space syntax limited , which was founded at the bartlett , university college london in 1989 recently there has also been research development that combines space syntax with geographic accessibility analysis in gis , such as the place syntax-models developed by the research group spatial analysis and design at the royal institute of technology in stockholm , sweden a series of interdisciplinary works published from 2006 by vito latora , sergio porta and colleagues , proposing a network approach to street centrality analysis and design , have highlighted space syntax ' contribution to decades of previous studies in the physics of spatial complex networks .

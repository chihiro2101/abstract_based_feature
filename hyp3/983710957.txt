integration measures the amount of street-to-street transitions needed from a street segment , to reach all other street segments in the network , using shortest paths in the case of radius 4 , for instance , only four turns are counted departing from each street segment theoretically , the integration measure shows the cognitive complexity of reaching a street , and is often argued to 'predict ' the pedestrian use of a street : the easier it is to reach a street , the more popular it should be imagine that each street segment is given an initial load of one unit of water , which then starts pouring from the starting street segment to all segments that successively connect to it each time an intersection appears , the remaining value of flow is divided equally amongst the splitting streets , until all the other street segments in the graph are reached for instance , at the first intersection with a single other street , the initial value of one is split into two remaining values of one half , and allocated to the two intersecting street segments when the same procedure has been conducted using each segment as a starting point for the initial value of one , a graph of final values appears space syntax argues that these values often predict the car traffic flow of streets , but , strictly speaking , choice analysis can also be thought to represent the number of intersections that need to be crossed to reach a street recently there has also been research development that combines space syntax with geographic accessibility analysis in gis , such as the place syntax-models developed by the research group spatial analysis and design at the royal institute of technology in stockholm , sweden a series of interdisciplinary works published from 2006 by vito latora , sergio porta and colleagues , proposing a network approach to street centrality analysis and design , have highlighted space syntax ' contribution to decades of previous studies in the physics of spatial complex networks .

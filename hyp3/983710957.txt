the graph analysis could also limit measure integration at radius ' n ' , for segments further than this radius not to be taken into account integration can also be analyzed in local scale instead of the scale of the whole network theoretically , the integration measure shows the cognitive complexity of reaching a street , and is often argued to 'predict ' the pedestrian use of a street : the easier it is to reach a street , the more popular it should be however , a slightly curvy street of the same length would typically be segmented into individual straight segments , not counted as a single line , which makes curvy streets appear less integrated in the analysis for instance , at the first intersection with a single other street , the initial value of one is split into two remaining values of one half , and allocated to the two intersecting street segments space syntax argues that these values often predict the car traffic flow of streets , but , strictly speaking , choice analysis can also be thought to represent the number of intersections that need to be crossed to reach a street space syntax originated as a programme research in the early 1970s when bill hillier , adrian leaman and alan beattie came together at the school of environmental studies at university college london ( now part of the bartlett school of architecture ) space syntax has grown to become a tool used around the world in a variety of research areas and design applications in architecture , urban design , urban planning , transport and interior design space syntax 's mathematical reliability has come under scrutiny because of a seeming paradox that arises under certain geometric configurations with 'axial maps ' , one of the method 's primary representations of spatial configuration recently there has also been research development that combines space syntax with geographic accessibility analysis in gis , such as the place syntax-models developed by the research group spatial analysis and design at the royal institute of technology in stockholm , sweden

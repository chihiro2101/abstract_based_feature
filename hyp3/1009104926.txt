the first law of thermodynamics was developed empirically over about half a century in 1840 , germain hess stated a hess 's law for the so-called 'heat of reaction ' for chemical reactions his law was later recognized as a consequence of the first law of thermodynamics , but hess 's statement was not explicitly concerned with the relation between energy exchanges by heat and work bioenergetics – the molecular basis of biological energy transformations , 2nd some scholars consider rankine 's statement less distinct than that of clausius this framework also took as primitive the notion of transfer of energy as work the first explicit statement of the first law of thermodynamics , by rudolf clausius in 1850 , referred to cyclic thermodynamic processes : :in all cases in which work is produced by the agency of heat , a quantity of heat is consumed which is proportional to the work done ; and conversely , by the expenditure of an equal quantity of work an equal quantity of heat is produced clausius also stated the law in another form , referring to the existence of a function of state of the system , the internal energy , and expressed it in terms of a differential equation for the increments of a thermodynamic process this equation may be described as follows : : :in a thermodynamic process involving a closed system , the increment in the internal energy is equal to the difference between the heat accumulated by the system and the work done by it it is defined only up to an arbitrary additive constant of integration , which can be adjusted to give arbitrary reference zero levels the internal energy is customarily stated relative to a conventionally chosen standard reference state of the system the concept of internal energy is considered by bailyn to be of '' enormous interest '' bailyn likens it to the energy states of an atom , that were revealed by bohr 's energy relation hν e n − e n in each case , an unmeasurable quantity ( the internal energy , the atomic energy level ) is revealed by considering the difference of measured quantities ( increments of internal energy , quantities of emitted or absorbed radiative energy ) when energy flows from one system or part of a system to another otherwise than by the performance of mechanical work , the energy so transferred is called heat de la société français de philosophie , volume 6 , p energy can also be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another in association with transfer of matter the '' mechanical '' approach postulates the law of conservation of energy it also postulates that energy can be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another adiabatically as work , and that energy can be held as the internal energy of a thermodynamic system it also postulates that energy can be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another by a path that is non-adiabatic , and is unaccompanied by matter transfer temporarily , only for purpose of this definition , one can prohibit transfer of energy as work across a wall of interest this approach derives the notions of transfer of energy as heat , and of temperature , as theoretical developments , not taking them as primitives the revised statement is then : :for a closed system , in any arbitrary process of interest that takes it from an initial to a final state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium , the change of internal energy is the same as that for a reference adiabatic work process that links those two states the reference adiabatic work process may be chosen arbitrarily from amongst the class of all such processes born 's definition was specifically for transfers of energy without transfer of matter , and it has been widely followed in textbooks ( examples : ) born observes that a transfer of matter between two systems is accompanied by a transfer of internal energy that can not be resolved into heat and work components there can be pathways to other systems , spatially separate from that of the matter transfer , that allow heat and work transfer independent of and simultaneous with the matter transfer the first law of thermodynamics for a closed system was expressed in two ways by clausius the other way referred to an incremental change in the internal state of the system , and did not expect the process to be cyclic the constant of proportionality is universal and independent of the system and in 1845 and 1847 was measured by james joule , who described it as the mechanical equivalent of heat in a non-cyclic process , the change in the internal energy of a system is equal to net energy added as heat to the system minus the thermodynamic work done by the system , both being measured in mechanical units taking \delta u as a change in internal energy , one writes : \delta u q~ - ~ w~~~~\text where denotes the internal energy per unit mass these authors actually use the symbols and to denote internal energy but their notation has been changed here to accord with the notation of the present article in this case of a virtually closed system , because of the zero matter transfer , as noted above , one can safely distinguish between transfer of energy as work , and transfer of internal energy as heat

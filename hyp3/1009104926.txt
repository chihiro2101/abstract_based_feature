the first law of thermodynamics was developed empirically over about half a century in 1840 , germain hess stated a hess 's law for the so-called 'heat of reaction ' for chemical reactions his law was later recognized as a consequence of the first law of thermodynamics , but hess 's statement was not explicitly concerned with the relation between energy exchanges by heat and work the original 19th-century statements of the first law of thermodynamics appeared in a conceptual framework in which transfer of energy as heat was taken as a primitive notion , not defined or constructed by the theoretical development of the framework , but rather presupposed as prior to it and already accepted the primitive notion of heat was taken as empirically established , especially through calorimetry regarded as a subject in its own right , prior to thermodynamics this framework also took as primitive the notion of transfer of energy as work this framework did not presume a concept of energy in general , but regarded it as derived or synthesized from the prior notions of heat and work the first explicit statement of the first law of thermodynamics , by rudolf clausius in 1850 , referred to cyclic thermodynamic processes : :in all cases in which work is produced by the agency of heat , a quantity of heat is consumed which is proportional to the work done ; and conversely , by the expenditure of an equal quantity of work an equal quantity of heat is produced clausius also stated the law in another form , referring to the existence of a function of state of the system , the internal energy , and expressed it in terms of a differential equation for the increments of a thermodynamic process this equation may be described as follows : : :in a thermodynamic process involving a closed system , the increment in the internal energy is equal to the difference between the heat accumulated by the system and the work done by it because of its definition in terms of increments , the value of the internal energy of a system is not uniquely defined the internal energy is customarily stated relative to a conventionally chosen standard reference state of the system the concept of internal energy is considered by bailyn to be of '' enormous interest '' in each case , an unmeasurable quantity ( the internal energy , the atomic energy level ) is revealed by considering the difference of measured quantities ( increments of internal energy , quantities of emitted or absorbed radiative energy ) when energy flows from one system or part of a system to another otherwise than by the performance of mechanical work , the energy so transferred is called heat this definition may be regarded as expressing a conceptual revision , as follows largely through born 's influence , this revised conceptual approach to the definition of heat came to be preferred by many twentieth-century writers energy can also be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another in association with transfer of matter born points out that in general such energy transfer is not resolvable uniquely into work and heat moieties in general , when there is transfer of energy associated with matter transfer , work and heat transfers can be distinguished only when they pass through walls physically separate from those for matter transfer the '' mechanical '' approach postulates the law of conservation of energy initially , it '' cleverly '' ( according to bailyn ) refrains from labelling as 'heat ' such non-adiabatic , unaccompanied transfer of energy this approach derives the notions of transfer of energy as heat , and of temperature , as theoretical developments , not taking them as primitives the reference adiabatic work process may be chosen arbitrarily from amongst the class of all such processes born observes that a transfer of matter between two systems is accompanied by a transfer of internal energy that can not be resolved into heat and work components there can be pathways to other systems , spatially separate from that of the matter transfer , that allow heat and work transfer independent of and simultaneous with the matter transfer the first law of thermodynamics for a closed system was expressed in two ways by clausius a cyclic process is one that can be repeated indefinitely often , returning the system to its initial state of particular interest for single cycle of a cyclic process are the net work done , and the net heat taken in ( or 'consumed ' , in clausius ' statement ) , by the system in a non-cyclic process , the change in the internal energy of a system is equal to net energy added as heat to the system minus the thermodynamic work done by the system , both being measured in mechanical units these authors actually use the symbol to refer to total energy , including kinetic energy of bulk flow in effect , in this description , one is dealing with a system effectively closed to the transfer of matter in this case of a virtually closed system , because of the zero matter transfer , as noted above , one can safely distinguish between transfer of energy as work , and transfer of internal energy as heat first law of thermodynamics in the mit course unified thermodynamics and propulsion from prof

the first law of thermodynamics was developed empirically over about half a century his law was later recognized as a consequence of the first law of thermodynamics , but hess 's statement was not explicitly concerned with the relation between energy exchanges by heat and work bioenergetics – the molecular basis of biological energy transformations , 2nd the first full statements of the law came in 1850 from rudolf clausius and from william rankine the primitive notion of heat was taken as empirically established , especially through calorimetry regarded as a subject in its own right , prior to thermodynamics this framework also took as primitive the notion of transfer of energy as work this framework did not presume a concept of energy in general , but regarded it as derived or synthesized from the prior notions of heat and work the first explicit statement of the first law of thermodynamics , by rudolf clausius in 1850 , referred to cyclic thermodynamic processes clausius also stated the law in another form , referring to the existence of a function of state of the system , the internal energy , and expressed it in terms of a differential equation for the increments of a thermodynamic process this equation may be described as follows : : :in a thermodynamic process involving a closed system , the increment in the internal energy is equal to the difference between the heat accumulated by the system and the work done by it because of its definition in terms of increments , the value of the internal energy of a system is not uniquely defined it is defined only up to an arbitrary additive constant of integration , which can be adjusted to give arbitrary reference zero levels this non-uniqueness is in keeping with the abstract mathematical nature of the internal energy the internal energy is customarily stated relative to a conventionally chosen standard reference state of the system the concept of internal energy is considered by bailyn to be of '' enormous interest '' bailyn likens it to the energy states of an atom , that were revealed by bohr 's energy relation hν e n − e n in each case , an unmeasurable quantity ( the internal energy , the atomic energy level ) is revealed by considering the difference of measured quantities ( increments of internal energy , quantities of emitted or absorbed radiative energy ) bryan wrote about systems between which there is no transfer of matter ( closed systems ) : '' definition when energy flows from one system or part of a system to another otherwise than by the performance of mechanical work , the energy so transferred is called heat this definition may be regarded as expressing a conceptual revision , as follows this was systematically expounded in 1909 by constantin carathéodory , whose attention had been drawn to it by max born born points out that in general such energy transfer is not resolvable uniquely into work and heat moieties it also postulates that energy can be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another adiabatically as work , and that energy can be held as the internal energy of a thermodynamic system it also postulates that energy can be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another by a path that is non-adiabatic , and is unaccompanied by matter transfer initially , it '' cleverly '' ( according to bailyn ) refrains from labelling as 'heat ' such non-adiabatic , unaccompanied transfer of energy the revised statement is then : :for a closed system , in any arbitrary process of interest that takes it from an initial to a final state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium , the change of internal energy is the same as that for a reference adiabatic work process that links those two states born 's definition was specifically for transfers of energy without transfer of matter , and it has been widely followed in textbooks ( examples : ) born observes that a transfer of matter between two systems is accompanied by a transfer of internal energy that can not be resolved into heat and work components the first law of thermodynamics for a closed system was expressed in two ways by clausius the other way referred to an incremental change in the internal state of the system , and did not expect the process to be cyclic a cyclic process is one that can be repeated indefinitely often , returning the system to its initial state of particular interest for single cycle of a cyclic process are the net work done , and the net heat taken in ( or 'consumed ' , in clausius ' statement ) , by the system in a cyclic process in which the system does net work on its surroundings , it is observed to be physically necessary not only that heat be taken into the system , but also , importantly , that some heat leave the system in a non-cyclic process , the change in the internal energy of a system is equal to net energy added as heat to the system minus the thermodynamic work done by the system , both being measured in mechanical units in this case of a virtually closed system , because of the zero matter transfer , as noted above , one can safely distinguish between transfer of energy as work , and transfer of internal energy as heat

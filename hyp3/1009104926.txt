the first law of thermodynamics was developed empirically over about half a century in 1840 , germain hess stated a hess 's law for the so-called 'heat of reaction ' for chemical reactions his law was later recognized as a consequence of the first law of thermodynamics , but hess 's statement was not explicitly concerned with the relation between energy exchanges by heat and work the first full statements of the law came in 1850 from rudolf clausius and from william rankine jointly primitive with this notion of heat were the notions of empirical temperature and thermal equilibrium this framework also took as primitive the notion of transfer of energy as work this framework did not presume a concept of energy in general , but regarded it as derived or synthesized from the prior notions of heat and work the first explicit statement of the first law of thermodynamics , by rudolf clausius in 1850 , referred to cyclic thermodynamic processes the concept of internal energy is considered by bailyn to be of '' enormous interest '' bailyn likens it to the energy states of an atom , that were revealed by bohr 's energy relation hν e n − e n in each case , an unmeasurable quantity ( the internal energy , the atomic energy level ) is revealed by considering the difference of measured quantities ( increments of internal energy , quantities of emitted or absorbed radiative energy ) when energy flows from one system or part of a system to another otherwise than by the performance of mechanical work , the energy so transferred is called heat also bryan had written about this in the enzyklopädie der mathematischen wissenschaften , volume 3 , p largely through born 's influence , this revised conceptual approach to the definition of heat came to be preferred by many twentieth-century writers energy can also be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another in association with transfer of matter it also postulates that energy can be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another adiabatically as work , and that energy can be held as the internal energy of a thermodynamic system it also postulates that energy can be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another by a path that is non-adiabatic , and is unaccompanied by matter transfer initially , it '' cleverly '' ( according to bailyn ) refrains from labelling as 'heat ' such non-adiabatic , unaccompanied transfer of energy this approach derives the notions of transfer of energy as heat , and of temperature , as theoretical developments , not taking them as primitives the revised statement is then : :for a closed system , in any arbitrary process of interest that takes it from an initial to a final state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium , the change of internal energy is the same as that for a reference adiabatic work process that links those two states this is so regardless of the path of the process of interest , and regardless of whether it is an adiabatic or a non-adiabatic process largely through the influence of max born , it is often regarded as theoretically preferable because of this conceptual parsimony born particularly observes that the revised approach avoids thinking in terms of what he calls the '' imported engineering '' concept of heat engines basing his thinking on the mechanical approach , born in 1921 , and again in 1949 , proposed to revise the definition of heat born 's definition was specifically for transfers of energy without transfer of matter , and it has been widely followed in textbooks ( examples : ) born observes that a transfer of matter between two systems is accompanied by a transfer of internal energy that can not be resolved into heat and work components there can be pathways to other systems , spatially separate from that of the matter transfer , that allow heat and work transfer independent of and simultaneous with the matter transfer one way referred to cyclic processes and the inputs and outputs of the system , but did not refer to increments in the internal state of the system in each repetition of a cyclic process , the net work done by the system , measured in mechanical units , is proportional to the heat consumed , measured in calorimetric units in a non-cyclic process , the change in the internal energy of a system is equal to net energy added as heat to the system minus the thermodynamic work done by the system , both being measured in mechanical units taking \delta u as a change in internal energy , one writes : \delta u q~ - ~ w~~~~\text where denotes the internal energy per unit mass these authors actually use the symbol to refer to total energy , including kinetic energy of bulk flow with applications in chemistry and chemical engineering , fourth edition , cambridge university press , cambridge uk , chemical thermodynamics , mcgraw-hill book company , new york introduction to thermodynamics of irreversible processes , third edition , interscience publishers , new york

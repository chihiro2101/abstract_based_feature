his law was later recognized as a consequence of the first law of thermodynamics , but hess 's statement was not explicitly concerned with the relation between energy exchanges by heat and work . original statements : the '' thermodynamic approach '' the original 19th-century statements of the first law of thermodynamics appeared in a conceptual framework in which transfer of energy as heat was taken as a primitive notion , not defined or constructed by the theoretical development of the framework , but rather presupposed as prior to it and already accepted jointly primitive with this notion of heat were the notions of empirical temperature and thermal equilibrium this framework also took as primitive the notion of transfer of energy as work this framework did not presume a concept of energy in general , but regarded it as derived or synthesized from the prior notions of heat and work the first explicit statement of the first law of thermodynamics , by rudolf clausius in 1850 , referred to cyclic thermodynamic processes clausius also stated the law in another form , referring to the existence of a function of state of the system , the internal energy , and expressed it in terms of a differential equation for the increments of a thermodynamic process this equation may be described as follows : : :in a thermodynamic process involving a closed system , the increment in the internal energy is equal to the difference between the heat accumulated by the system and the work done by it the internal energy is customarily stated relative to a conventionally chosen standard reference state of the system the concept of internal energy is considered by bailyn to be of '' enormous interest '' bryan wrote about systems between which there is no transfer of matter ( closed systems ) : '' definition when energy flows from one system or part of a system to another otherwise than by the performance of mechanical work , the energy so transferred is called heat energy can also be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another in association with transfer of matter the '' mechanical '' approach postulates the law of conservation of energy it also postulates that energy can be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another adiabatically as work , and that energy can be held as the internal energy of a thermodynamic system it also postulates that energy can be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another by a path that is non-adiabatic , and is unaccompanied by matter transfer initially , it '' cleverly '' ( according to bailyn ) refrains from labelling as 'heat ' such non-adiabatic , unaccompanied transfer of energy temporarily , only for purpose of this definition , one can prohibit transfer of energy as work across a wall of interest this approach derives the notions of transfer of energy as heat , and of temperature , as theoretical developments , not taking them as primitives the revised statement is then : :for a closed system , in any arbitrary process of interest that takes it from an initial to a final state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium , the change of internal energy is the same as that for a reference adiabatic work process that links those two states this is so regardless of the path of the process of interest , and regardless of whether it is an adiabatic or a non-adiabatic process the reference adiabatic work process may be chosen arbitrarily from amongst the class of all such processes born particularly observes that the revised approach avoids thinking in terms of what he calls the '' imported engineering '' concept of heat engines in particular , he referred to the work of constantin carathéodory , who had in 1909 stated the first law without defining quantity of heat born observes that a transfer of matter between two systems is accompanied by a transfer of internal energy that can not be resolved into heat and work components one way referred to cyclic processes and the inputs and outputs of the system , but did not refer to increments in the internal state of the system the other way referred to an incremental change in the internal state of the system , and did not expect the process to be cyclic a cyclic process is one that can be repeated indefinitely often , returning the system to its initial state in a cyclic process in which the system does net work on its surroundings , it is observed to be physically necessary not only that heat be taken into the system , but also , importantly , that some heat leave the system in a non-cyclic process , the change in the internal energy of a system is equal to net energy added as heat to the system minus the thermodynamic work done by the system , both being measured in mechanical units these authors actually use the symbol to refer to total energy , including kinetic energy of bulk flow this usage is followed also by other writers on non-equilibrium thermodynamics such as lebon , jou , and casas-vásquez , lebon , g and de groot and mazur in this case of a virtually closed system , because of the zero matter transfer , as noted above , one can safely distinguish between transfer of energy as work , and transfer of internal energy as heat

the component states are in some sense sovereign , insofar as certain powers are reserved to them that may not be exercised by the central government the component states of a federation usually possess no powers in relation to foreign policy and so enjoy no independent status under international law an example of such a federation is malaysia , in which sarawak and sabah agreed to form the federation on different terms and conditions from the states of peninsular malaysia however , as the histories of countries and nations vary , the federalist system of a state can be quite different from these models however , unitary states often also include one or more self-governing regions the difference between a federation and this kind of unitary state is that in a unitary state the autonomous status of self-governing regions exists by the sufferance of the central government , and may be unilaterally revoked while it is common for a federation to be brought into being by agreement between a number of formally independent states , in a unitary state self-governing regions are often created through a process of devolution , where a formerly centralized state agrees to grant autonomy to a region that was previously entirely subordinate it is often part of the philosophy of a unitary state that , regardless of the actual status of any of its parts , its entire territory constitutes a single sovereign entity or nation state , and that by virtue of this the central government exercises sovereignty over the whole territory as of right in a federation , on the other hand , sovereignty is often regarded as residing notionally in the component states , or as being shared between these states and the central government a confederation , in modern political terms , is usually limited to a permanent union of sovereign states for common action in relation to other states while the word confederation was officially used when the canadian federal system was established in 1867 , the term refers only to the process and not the resulting state since canadian provinces are not sovereign and do not claim to be 603 belgium was founded as a centralized state , after the french model , but has gradually been reformed into a federal state by consecutive constitutional reforms since the 1970s at present , there is a growing movement to transform the existing federal state into a looser confederation with two or three constitutive states and/or two special regions the articles established a national government under what today would be defined as a federal system ( albeit with a comparatively weaker federal government ) an empire is a multi-ethnic state , multinational state , or a group of nations with a central government established usually through coercion ( on the model of the roman empire ) an empire often includes self-governing regions , but these will possess autonomy only at the sufferance of the central government is where a unitary state incorporates one or more self-governing autonomous areas a federation also differs from an associated state , such as the federated states of micronesia ( in free association with the united states ) and cook islands and niue ( which form part of the realm of new zealand ) there are two kinds of associated states : in case of micronesia , the association is concluded by a treaty between two sovereign states ; in the case of the cook islands and niue , the association is concluded by domestic legal arrangements however , the islands are neither an incorporated part of the united kingdom nor are they considered to be independent or associated states the islands do not have a monarch , per se ; rather in the isle of man the british monarch is , ex officio , lord of mann , and in the bailiwicks of guernsey and jersey , the british monarch rules as the duke of normandy the european union ( eu ) is a type of political union or confederation ( the assemblage of societies or an association of two or more states into one state ) however , its central government is far weaker than that of most federations and the individual members are sovereign states under international law , so it is usually characterized as an unprecedented form of supra-national union the federal government is the common or national government of a federation as originally written , the united states constitution was created to limit the federal government from exerting power over the states by enumerating only specific powers prior to this , the communist yugoslav state was named democratic federal yugoslavia in 1943 and then federal people 's republic of yugoslavia in 1946

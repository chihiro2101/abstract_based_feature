the component states are in some sense sovereign , insofar as certain powers are reserved to them that may not be exercised by the central government the component states of a federation usually possess no powers in relation to foreign policy and so enjoy no independent status under international law some federations are called asymmetric because some states have more autonomy than others an example of such a federation is malaysia , in which sarawak and sabah agreed to form the federation on different terms and conditions from the states of peninsular malaysia a federation often emerges from an initial agreement between several separate states the purpose can be the will to solve mutual problems and to provide for mutual defense or to create a nation state for an ethnicity spread over several states however , as the histories of countries and nations vary , the federalist system of a state can be quite different from these models brazil , on the other hand , has experienced both the federal and the unitary state during its history however , unitary states often also include one or more self-governing regions the difference between a federation and this kind of unitary state is that in a unitary state the autonomous status of self-governing regions exists by the sufferance of the central government , and may be unilaterally revoked in a federation , on the other hand , sovereignty is often regarded as residing notionally in the component states , or as being shared between these states and the central government a confederation , in modern political terms , is usually limited to a permanent union of sovereign states for common action in relation to other states the closest entity in the world to a confederation at this time is the european union 603 belgium was founded as a centralized state , after the french model , but has gradually been reformed into a federal state by consecutive constitutional reforms since the 1970s moreover , although nominally called a federal state , the country 's structure already has a number of confederation belgium at present , there is a growing movement to transform the existing federal state into a looser confederation with two or three constitutive states and/or two special regions the articles established a national government under what today would be defined as a federal system ( albeit with a comparatively weaker federal government ) however , canadians , designed with a stronger central government than the u.s however , they are neither considered to be part of it nor recognized as sovereign or associated states a unitary state may closely resemble a federation in structure and , while a central government may possess the theoretical right to revoke the autonomy of a self-governing region , it may be politically difficult for it to do so in practice the self-governing regions of some unitary states also often enjoy greater autonomy than those of some federations for these reasons , it is sometimes argued that some modern unitary states are de facto federations spain is suggested as one possible de facto federation as it grants more self-government to its autonomous communities than are retained by the constituent entities of most federations however , its central government is far weaker than that of most federations and the individual members are sovereign states under international law , so it is usually characterized as an unprecedented form of supra-national union the federal government is the government at the level of the sovereign state federal government within this structure are the government ministries and departments and agencies to which the ministers of government are assigned

the component states are in some sense sovereign , insofar as certain powers are reserved to them that may not be exercised by the central government however , a federation is more than a mere loose alliance of independent states the component states of a federation usually possess no powers in relation to foreign policy and so enjoy no independent status under international law some federations are called asymmetric because some states have more autonomy than others an example of such a federation is malaysia , in which sarawak and sabah agreed to form the federation on different terms and conditions from the states of peninsular malaysia a federation often emerges from an initial agreement between several separate states the former was the case with the united states and switzerland however , as the histories of countries and nations vary , the federalist system of a state can be quite different from these models a unitary state is sometimes one with only a single , centralized , national tier of government however , unitary states often also include one or more self-governing regions the difference between a federation and this kind of unitary state is that in a unitary state the autonomous status of self-governing regions exists by the sufferance of the central government , and may be unilaterally revoked in a federation , on the other hand , sovereignty is often regarded as residing notionally in the component states , or as being shared between these states and the central government a confederation , in modern political terms , is usually limited to a permanent union of sovereign states for common action in relation to other states 603 belgium was founded as a centralized state , after the french model , but has gradually been reformed into a federal state by consecutive constitutional reforms since the 1970s moreover , although nominally called a federal state , the country 's structure already has a number of confederation belgium at present , there is a growing movement to transform the existing federal state into a looser confederation with two or three constitutive states and/or two special regions an example of this is the united states under the articles of confederation the articles established a national government under what today would be defined as a federal system ( albeit with a comparatively weaker federal government ) an empire is a multi-ethnic state , multinational state , or a group of nations with a central government established usually through coercion ( on the model of the roman empire ) an empire often includes self-governing regions , but these will possess autonomy only at the sufferance of the central government spain is suggested as one possible de facto federation as it grants more self-government to its autonomous communities than are retained by the constituent entities of most federations the european union ( eu ) is a type of political union or confederation ( the assemblage of societies or an association of two or more states into one state ) however , its central government is far weaker than that of most federations and the individual members are sovereign states under international law , so it is usually characterized as an unprecedented form of supra-national union the federal government is the government at the level of the sovereign state as originally written , the united states constitution was created to limit the federal government from exerting power over the states by enumerating only specific powers federal republic : germany , somalia , nigeria

federations and other forms of state the component states are in some sense sovereign , insofar as certain powers are reserved to them that may not be exercised by the central government however , a federation is more than a mere loose alliance of independent states the component states of a federation usually possess no powers in relation to foreign policy and so enjoy no independent status under international law an example of such a federation is malaysia , in which sarawak and sabah agreed to form the federation on different terms and conditions from the states of peninsular malaysia a federation often emerges from an initial agreement between several separate states the purpose can be the will to solve mutual problems and to provide for mutual defense or to create a nation state for an ethnicity spread over several states brazil , on the other hand , has experienced both the federal and the unitary state during its history a unitary state is sometimes one with only a single , centralized , national tier of government however , unitary states often also include one or more self-governing regions the difference between a federation and this kind of unitary state is that in a unitary state the autonomous status of self-governing regions exists by the sufferance of the central government , and may be unilaterally revoked in a federation , on the other hand , sovereignty is often regarded as residing notionally in the component states , or as being shared between these states and the central government a confederation , in modern political terms , is usually limited to a permanent union of sovereign states for common action in relation to other states moreover , although nominally called a federal state , the country 's structure already has a number of confederation belgium in wallonia , there is wider support for three states : flanders , wallonia and brussels an example of this is the united states under the articles of confederation the articles established a national government under what today would be defined as a federal system ( albeit with a comparatively weaker federal government ) however , canadians , designed with a stronger central government than the u.s an empire often includes self-governing regions , but these will possess autonomy only at the sufferance of the central government it is distinguished from a federation in that the constitutional structure of the state is still unitary , but incorporates federalist principles however , they are neither considered to be part of it nor recognized as sovereign or associated states the self-governing regions of some unitary states also often enjoy greater autonomy than those of some federations the european union ( eu ) is a type of political union or confederation ( the assemblage of societies or an association of two or more states into one state ) the original german uses the word staatenverbund , which they translate as '' association of sovereign states '' , rather than the word staatenbund ( confederation of states ) or bundesstaat ( federal state ) as originally written , the united states constitution was created to limit the federal government from exerting power over the states by enumerating only specific powers however , later amendments , particularly the fourteenth amendment , gave the federal government considerable authority over states

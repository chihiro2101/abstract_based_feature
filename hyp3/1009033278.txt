the component states are in some sense sovereign , insofar as certain powers are reserved to them that may not be exercised by the central government however , a federation is more than a mere loose alliance of independent states the component states of a federation usually possess no powers in relation to foreign policy and so enjoy no independent status under international law however , german länder have that power , which is beginning to be exercised on a european level some federations are called asymmetric because some states have more autonomy than others an example of such a federation is malaysia , in which sarawak and sabah agreed to form the federation on different terms and conditions from the states of peninsular malaysia a federation often emerges from an initial agreement between several separate states the purpose can be the will to solve mutual problems and to provide for mutual defense or to create a nation state for an ethnicity spread over several states the former was the case with the united states and switzerland however , as the histories of countries and nations vary , the federalist system of a state can be quite different from these models brazil , on the other hand , has experienced both the federal and the unitary state during its history a unitary state is sometimes one with only a single , centralized , national tier of government however , unitary states often also include one or more self-governing regions the difference between a federation and this kind of unitary state is that in a unitary state the autonomous status of self-governing regions exists by the sufferance of the central government , and may be unilaterally revoked in a federation , on the other hand , sovereignty is often regarded as residing notionally in the component states , or as being shared between these states and the central government a confederation , in modern political terms , is usually limited to a permanent union of sovereign states for common action in relation to other states see : charles-etienne lagasse , les nouvelles institutions politiques de la belgique et de l'europe , erasme , namur 2003 , p 603 belgium was founded as a centralized state , after the french model , but has gradually been reformed into a federal state by consecutive constitutional reforms since the 1970s an example of this is the united states under the articles of confederation the articles established a national government under what today would be defined as a federal system ( albeit with a comparatively weaker federal government ) one example of this was the german empire ( 1871–1918 ) it is distinguished from a federation in that the constitutional structure of the state is still unitary , but incorporates federalist principles the self-governing regions of some unitary states also often enjoy greater autonomy than those of some federations the federal government is the common or national government of a federation the federal government is the government at the level of the sovereign state however , later amendments , particularly the fourteenth amendment , gave the federal government considerable authority over states

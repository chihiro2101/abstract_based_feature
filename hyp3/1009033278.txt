the component states are in some sense sovereign , insofar as certain powers are reserved to them that may not be exercised by the central government however , a federation is more than a mere loose alliance of independent states the component states of a federation usually possess no powers in relation to foreign policy and so enjoy no independent status under international law however , german l√§nder have that power , which is beginning to be exercised on a european level some federations are called asymmetric because some states have more autonomy than others an example of such a federation is malaysia , in which sarawak and sabah agreed to form the federation on different terms and conditions from the states of peninsular malaysia a federation often emerges from an initial agreement between several separate states however , as the histories of countries and nations vary , the federalist system of a state can be quite different from these models brazil , on the other hand , has experienced both the federal and the unitary state during its history a unitary state is sometimes one with only a single , centralized , national tier of government however , unitary states often also include one or more self-governing regions the difference between a federation and this kind of unitary state is that in a unitary state the autonomous status of self-governing regions exists by the sufferance of the central government , and may be unilaterally revoked a confederation , in modern political terms , is usually limited to a permanent union of sovereign states for common action in relation to other states moreover , although nominally called a federal state , the country 's structure already has a number of confederation belgium many flemings would prefer two states , flanders and wallonia , and two special regions , brussels and the german-speaking region an example of this is the united states under the articles of confederation an empire often includes self-governing regions , but these will possess autonomy only at the sufferance of the central government it is distinguished from a federation in that the constitutional structure of the state is still unitary , but incorporates federalist principles there are two kinds of associated states : in case of micronesia , the association is concluded by a treaty between two sovereign states ; in the case of the cook islands and niue , the association is concluded by domestic legal arrangements however , the islands are neither an incorporated part of the united kingdom nor are they considered to be independent or associated states the european union ( eu ) is a type of political union or confederation ( the assemblage of societies or an association of two or more states into one state ) constitutionally a unitary state , the political system in myanmar bears many elements of federalism the ability of a federal government to create national institutions that can mediate differences that arise because of linguistic , ethnic , religious , or other regional differences is an important challenge a federal government may have distinct powers at various levels authorized or delegated to it by its member states the federal government is the government at the level of the sovereign state federal government within this structure are the government ministries and departments and agencies to which the ministers of government are assigned

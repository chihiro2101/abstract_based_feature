the first parliaments date back to europe in the middle ages : specifically in 1188 alfonso ix , king of leon ( spain ) convened the three states in the cortes of le√≥n an early example of parliamentary government developed in today 's netherlands and belgium during the dutch revolt ( 1581 ) , when the sovereign , legislative and executive powers were taken over by the states general of the netherlands from the monarch , king philip ii of spain the modern concept of parliamentary government emerged in the kingdom of great britain and its contemporary , the age of liberty ; the first , in 1258 , stripped the king of unlimited authority and the second , in 1265 , included simon de montfort 's parliament the gradual democratisation of parliament with the broadening of the voting franchise increased parliament 's role in controlling government , and in deciding whom the king could ask to form a government other countries gradually adopted what came to be called the westminster model of government , with an executive answerable to parliament , and exercising , in the name of the head of state , powers nominally vested in the head of state such a system became particularly prevalent in older british dominions , many of which had their constitutions enacted by the british parliament ; such as australia , new zealand , canada , the irish free state and the union of south africa scholars of democracy such as arend lijphart distinguish two types of parliamentary democracies : the westminster and consensus systems the westminster system is usually found in the commonwealth of nations and countries which were influenced by the british political tradition in countries using this system , members of parliament have to resign their place in parliament upon being appointed ( or elected ) minister implementations of the parliamentary system can also differ as to how the prime minister and government are appointed and whether the government needs the explicit approval of the parliament , rather than just the absence of its disapproval some countries such as india also require the prime minister to be a member of the legislature , though in other countries this only exists as a convention the head of state appoints a prime minister who must gain a vote of confidence within a set time the head of state appoints the leader of the political party holding a plurality of seats in parliament as prime minister the head of state nominates a candidate for prime minister who is then submitted to parliament for approval before appointment in these cases , parliament can choose another candidate who then would be appointed by the head of state parliament nominates a candidate whom the head of state is constitutionally obliged to appoint as prime minister a public officeholder ( other than the head of state or their representative ) nominates a candidate , who , if approved by parliament , is appointed as prime minister furthermore , there are variations as to what conditions exist ( if any ) for the government to have the right to dissolve the parliament : in some countries , such as denmark , malaysia , australia and new zealand , the prime minister has the de facto power to call an election , at will other countries only permit an election to be called in the event of a vote of no confidence against the government , a supermajority vote in favour of an early election or prolonged deadlock in parliament in the 1989 lebanese taif agreement , in order to give muslims greater political power , lebanon moved from a semi-presidential system with a powerful president to a system more structurally similar to classical parliamentary government it can be argued that power is more evenly spread out in parliamentary government , as the government and prime minister do not have the power to make unilateral decisions , as the entire government cabinet is answerable and accountable to parliament ) thus , by a shrewd timing of elections , in a parliamentary system , a party can extend its rule for longer than is feasible in a functioning presidential system

the modern concept of parliamentary government emerged in the kingdom of great britain and its contemporary , the age of liberty later , in the 17th century , the parliament of england pioneered some of the ideas and systems of liberal democracy culminating in the glorious revolution and passage of the bill of rights 1689 the gradual democratisation of parliament with the broadening of the voting franchise increased parliament 's role in controlling government , and in deciding whom the king could ask to form a government by the 19th century , the great reform act of 1832 led to parliamentary dominance , with its choice invariably deciding who was prime minister and the complexion of the government other countries gradually adopted what came to be called the westminster model of government , with an executive answerable to parliament , and exercising , in the name of the head of state , powers nominally vested in the head of state such a system became particularly prevalent in older british dominions , many of which had their constitutions enacted by the british parliament ; such as australia , new zealand , canada , the irish free state and the union of south africa democracy and parliamentarism became increasingly prevalent in europe in the years after world war i , partially imposed by the democratic victors , the united states , great britain and france , on the defeated countries and their successors , notably weimar germany and the new austrian republic a parliamentary system may be either bicameral , with two chambers of parliament ( or houses ) or unicameral , with just one parliamentary chamber a bicameral parliament usually consists of a directly elected lower house with the power to determine the executive government , and an upper house which may be appointed or elected through a different mechanism from the lower house regardless of which system is used , the voting systems tend to allow the voter to vote for a named candidate rather than a closed list in countries using this system , members of parliament have to resign their place in parliament upon being appointed ( or elected ) minister ministers in those countries usually actively participate in parliamentary debates , but are not entitled to vote the head of state appoints a prime minister who will likely have majority support in parliament while in practice most prime ministers under the westminster system ( including australia , canada , india , new zealand and the united kingdom ) are the leaders of the largest party in parliament , technically the appointment of the prime minister is a prerogative exercised by the monarch , the governor-general , or the president the head of state appoints the leader of the political party holding a plurality of seats in parliament as prime minister the head of state nominates a candidate for prime minister who is then submitted to parliament for approval before appointment in these cases , parliament can choose another candidate who then would be appointed by the head of state example : under the swedish instrument of government ( 1974 ) , the power to appoint someone to form a government has been moved from the monarch to the speaker of parliament and the parliament itself example : israel , 1996â€“2001 , where the prime minister was elected in a general election , with no regard to political affiliation , and whose procedure can also be described as of a semi-parliamentary system there also exists the semi-presidential system that draws on both presidential systems and parliamentary systems by combining a powerful president with an executive responsible to parliament : for example , the french fifth republic in the 1989 lebanese taif agreement , in order to give muslims greater political power , lebanon moved from a semi-presidential system with a powerful president to a system more structurally similar to classical parliamentary government it can be argued that power is more evenly spread out in parliamentary government , as the government and prime minister do not have the power to make unilateral decisions , as the entire government cabinet is answerable and accountable to parliament under a parliamentary system , a prime minister that has lost support in the middle of his term can be easily replaced by his own peers

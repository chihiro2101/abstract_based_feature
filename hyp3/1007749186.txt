the first parliaments date back to europe in the middle ages : specifically in 1188 alfonso ix , king of leon ( spain ) convened the three states in the cortes of le√≥n the modern concept of parliamentary government emerged in the kingdom of great britain and its contemporary , the age of liberty later , in the 17th century , the parliament of england pioneered some of the ideas and systems of liberal democracy culminating in the glorious revolution and passage of the bill of rights 1689 the gradual democratisation of parliament with the broadening of the voting franchise increased parliament 's role in controlling government , and in deciding whom the king could ask to form a government by the 19th century , the great reform act of 1832 led to parliamentary dominance , with its choice invariably deciding who was prime minister and the complexion of the government other countries gradually adopted what came to be called the westminster model of government , with an executive answerable to parliament , and exercising , in the name of the head of state , powers nominally vested in the head of state such a system became particularly prevalent in older british dominions , many of which had their constitutions enacted by the british parliament ; such as australia , new zealand , canada , the irish free state and the union of south africa a parliamentary system may be either bicameral , with two chambers of parliament ( or houses ) or unicameral , with just one parliamentary chamber a bicameral parliament usually consists of a directly elected lower house with the power to determine the executive government , and an upper house which may be appointed or elected through a different mechanism from the lower house in countries using this system , members of parliament have to resign their place in parliament upon being appointed ( or elected ) minister implementations of the parliamentary system can also differ as to how the prime minister and government are appointed and whether the government needs the explicit approval of the parliament , rather than just the absence of its disapproval the head of state appoints a prime minister who will likely have majority support in parliament no parliamentary vote takes place on who is forming a government , but since parliament can immediately defeat the government with a motion of no confidence , the head of state is limited by convention to choosing a candidate who can command the confidence of parliament , and thus has little or no influence in the decision the head of state appoints a prime minister who must gain a vote of confidence within a set time the head of state nominates a candidate for prime minister who is then submitted to parliament for approval before appointment in these cases , parliament can choose another candidate who then would be appointed by the head of state parliament nominates a candidate whom the head of state is constitutionally obliged to appoint as prime minister the speaker nominates a candidate , who is then elected to prime minister ( statsminister ) by the parliament if an absolute majority of the members of parliament does not vote no ( i.e in israel , parliament may vote in order to call an election or pass a vote of no confidence against the government other countries only permit an election to be called in the event of a vote of no confidence against the government , a supermajority vote in favour of an early election or prolonged deadlock in parliament in the 1989 lebanese taif agreement , in order to give muslims greater political power , lebanon moved from a semi-presidential system with a powerful president to a system more structurally similar to classical parliamentary government it can be argued that power is more evenly spread out in parliamentary government , as the government and prime minister do not have the power to make unilateral decisions , as the entire government cabinet is answerable and accountable to parliament ) thus , by a shrewd timing of elections , in a parliamentary system , a party can extend its rule for longer than is feasible in a functioning presidential system

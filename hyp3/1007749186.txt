an early example of parliamentary government developed in today 's netherlands and belgium during the dutch revolt ( 1581 ) , when the sovereign , legislative and executive powers were taken over by the states general of the netherlands from the monarch , king philip ii of spain in practice , king george i 's inability to speak english led the responsibility for chairing cabinet to go to the leading minister , literally the prime or first minister , robert walpole the gradual democratisation of parliament with the broadening of the voting franchise increased parliament 's role in controlling government , and in deciding whom the king could ask to form a government by the 19th century , the great reform act of 1832 led to parliamentary dominance , with its choice invariably deciding who was prime minister and the complexion of the government other countries gradually adopted what came to be called the westminster model of government , with an executive answerable to parliament , and exercising , in the name of the head of state , powers nominally vested in the head of state such a system became particularly prevalent in older british dominions , many of which had their constitutions enacted by the british parliament ; such as australia , new zealand , canada , the irish free state and the union of south africa some of these parliaments were reformed from , or were initially developed as distinct from their original british model : the australian senate , for instance , has since its inception more closely reflected the us senate than the british house of lords ; whereas since 1950 there is no upper house in new zealand a parliamentary system may be either bicameral , with two chambers of parliament ( or houses ) or unicameral , with just one parliamentary chamber a bicameral parliament usually consists of a directly elected lower house with the power to determine the executive government , and an upper house which may be appointed or elected through a different mechanism from the lower house some parliaments in this model are elected using a plurality voting system ( first past the post ) , such as the united kingdom , canada , and india , while others use some form of proportional representation , such as ireland and new zealand implementations of the parliamentary system can also differ as to how the prime minister and government are appointed and whether the government needs the explicit approval of the parliament , rather than just the absence of its disapproval some countries such as india also require the prime minister to be a member of the legislature , though in other countries this only exists as a convention the head of state appoints a prime minister who will likely have majority support in parliament no parliamentary vote takes place on who is forming a government , but since parliament can immediately defeat the government with a motion of no confidence , the head of state is limited by convention to choosing a candidate who can command the confidence of parliament , and thus has little or no influence in the decision the head of state appoints a prime minister who must gain a vote of confidence within a set time the head of state appoints the leader of the political party holding a plurality of seats in parliament as prime minister a public officeholder ( other than the head of state or their representative ) nominates a candidate , who , if approved by parliament , is appointed as prime minister example : under the swedish instrument of government ( 1974 ) , the power to appoint someone to form a government has been moved from the monarch to the speaker of parliament and the parliament itself the speaker nominates a candidate , who is then elected to prime minister ( statsminister ) by the parliament if an absolute majority of the members of parliament does not vote no ( i.e in israel , parliament may vote in order to call an election or pass a vote of no confidence against the government other countries only permit an election to be called in the event of a vote of no confidence against the government , a supermajority vote in favour of an early election or prolonged deadlock in parliament it can be argued that power is more evenly spread out in parliamentary government , as the government and prime minister do not have the power to make unilateral decisions , as the entire government cabinet is answerable and accountable to parliament ) thus , by a shrewd timing of elections , in a parliamentary system , a party can extend its rule for longer than is feasible in a functioning presidential system

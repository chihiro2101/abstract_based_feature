eventually , these councils have slowly evolved into the modern parliamentary system an early example of parliamentary government developed in today 's netherlands and belgium during the dutch revolt ( 1581 ) , when the sovereign , legislative and executive powers were taken over by the states general of the netherlands from the monarch , king philip ii of spain the modern concept of parliamentary government emerged in the kingdom of great britain and its contemporary , the age of liberty in england , simon de montfort is remembered as one of the fathers of representative government for convening two famous parliaments the gradual democratisation of parliament with the broadening of the voting franchise increased parliament 's role in controlling government , and in deciding whom the king could ask to form a government other countries gradually adopted what came to be called the westminster model of government , with an executive answerable to parliament , and exercising , in the name of the head of state , powers nominally vested in the head of state hence the use of phrases like her majesty 's government or his excellency 's government a parliamentary system may be either bicameral , with two chambers of parliament ( or houses ) or unicameral , with just one parliamentary chamber scholars of democracy such as arend lijphart distinguish two types of parliamentary democracies : the westminster and consensus systems some parliaments in this model are elected using a plurality voting system ( first past the post ) , such as the united kingdom , canada , and india , while others use some form of proportional representation , such as ireland and new zealand ministers in those countries usually actively participate in parliamentary debates , but are not entitled to vote implementations of the parliamentary system can also differ as to how the prime minister and government are appointed and whether the government needs the explicit approval of the parliament , rather than just the absence of its disapproval some countries such as india also require the prime minister to be a member of the legislature , though in other countries this only exists as a convention no parliamentary vote takes place on who is forming a government , but since parliament can immediately defeat the government with a motion of no confidence , the head of state is limited by convention to choosing a candidate who can command the confidence of parliament , and thus has little or no influence in the decision the head of state appoints the leader of the political party holding a plurality of seats in parliament as prime minister for example , in greece , if no party has a majority , the leader of the party with a plurality of seats is given an exploratory mandate to receive the confidence of the parliament within three days the head of state nominates a candidate for prime minister who is then submitted to parliament for approval before appointment parliament nominates a candidate whom the head of state is constitutionally obliged to appoint as prime minister a public officeholder ( other than the head of state or their representative ) nominates a candidate , who , if approved by parliament , is appointed as prime minister there also exists the semi-presidential system that draws on both presidential systems and parliamentary systems by combining a powerful president with an executive responsible to parliament : for example , the french fifth republic this electoral system providing a strong majority in the house of commons , paired with the fused power system results in a particularly powerful government able to provide change and 'innovate' it can be argued that power is more evenly spread out in parliamentary government , as the government and prime minister do not have the power to make unilateral decisions , as the entire government cabinet is answerable and accountable to parliament ) thus , by a shrewd timing of elections , in a parliamentary system , a party can extend its rule for longer than is feasible in a functioning presidential system

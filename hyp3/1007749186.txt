eventually , these councils have slowly evolved into the modern parliamentary system an early example of parliamentary government developed in today 's netherlands and belgium during the dutch revolt ( 1581 ) , when the sovereign , legislative and executive powers were taken over by the states general of the netherlands from the monarch , king philip ii of spain the modern concept of parliamentary government emerged in the kingdom of great britain and its contemporary , the age of liberty the gradual democratisation of parliament with the broadening of the voting franchise increased parliament 's role in controlling government , and in deciding whom the king could ask to form a government by the 19th century , the great reform act of 1832 led to parliamentary dominance , with its choice invariably deciding who was prime minister and the complexion of the government other countries gradually adopted what came to be called the westminster model of government , with an executive answerable to parliament , and exercising , in the name of the head of state , powers nominally vested in the head of state a parliamentary system may be either bicameral , with two chambers of parliament ( or houses ) or unicameral , with just one parliamentary chamber in countries using this system , members of parliament have to resign their place in parliament upon being appointed ( or elected ) minister the head of state appoints a prime minister who will likely have majority support in parliament while in practice most prime ministers under the westminster system ( including australia , canada , india , new zealand and the united kingdom ) are the leaders of the largest party in parliament , technically the appointment of the prime minister is a prerogative exercised by the monarch , the governor-general , or the president no parliamentary vote takes place on who is forming a government , but since parliament can immediately defeat the government with a motion of no confidence , the head of state is limited by convention to choosing a candidate who can command the confidence of parliament , and thus has little or no influence in the decision the head of state appoints the leader of the political party holding a plurality of seats in parliament as prime minister for example , in greece , if no party has a majority , the leader of the party with a plurality of seats is given an exploratory mandate to receive the confidence of the parliament within three days in these cases , parliament can choose another candidate who then would be appointed by the head of state parliament nominates a candidate whom the head of state is constitutionally obliged to appoint as prime minister example : under the swedish instrument of government ( 1974 ) , the power to appoint someone to form a government has been moved from the monarch to the speaker of parliament and the parliament itself the speaker nominates a candidate , who is then elected to prime minister ( statsminister ) by the parliament if an absolute majority of the members of parliament does not vote no ( i.e example : israel , 1996â€“2001 , where the prime minister was elected in a general election , with no regard to political affiliation , and whose procedure can also be described as of a semi-parliamentary system in israel , parliament may vote in order to call an election or pass a vote of no confidence against the government in a presidential system , all executive power is vested in one person , the president , whereas power is more divided in a parliamentary system with its collegial executive iraq similarly disdained a presidential system out of fears that such a system would be tantamount to shiite domination of the large sunni minority it can be argued that power is more evenly spread out in parliamentary government , as the government and prime minister do not have the power to make unilateral decisions , as the entire government cabinet is answerable and accountable to parliament under a parliamentary system , a prime minister that has lost support in the middle of his term can be easily replaced by his own peers

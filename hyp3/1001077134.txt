general classical views on other religions traditionally , jews believe that god chose the jewish people to be in a jews as a chosen people , described by the torah itself , with particular obligations and responsibilities elucidated in the oral torah sometimes this choice is seen as charging the jewish people with a specific mission to be a light unto the nations , practice tikkun olam and to exemplify the covenant with god as described in the torah this view , however , did not preclude a belief that god has a relationship with other peoples rather , judaism held that god had entered into a covenant with all humankind , and that jews and non-jews alike have a relationship with god , each nation with its own unique relationship with god biblical references as well as rabbinic literature support this view : moses refers to the '' god of the spirits of all flesh '' , and the tanakh ( hebrew bible ) also identifies prophets outside the community of israel '' ( levine , 1907/1966 ) the mishnah states that '' humanity was produced from one man , adam , to show god 's greatness but when the king of kings , the holy one , blessed be he , creates people in the form of adam not one is similar to any other '' ( mishnah sanhedrin 4:5 ) the mishnah continues , and states that anyone who kills or saves a single human life , jewish or not-jewish , has killed or saved an entire world the tosefta , a supplement to the mishnah , states : '' righteous among the nations have a share in the olam haba '' ( tosefta sanhedrin 13:1 ; sanhedrin 105a ; also maimonides , mishneh torah , hilchot teshuvah 3:4 ) the midrash adds : '' -why does the holy one , blessed be he , love the righteous ? because righteousness is not due to inheritance or family connections maimonides states that this refers to those who have acquired knowledge of god and act in accordance with the noahide laws in the 2nd century a sage in the tosefta declared '' the righteous of all nations have a share in the world to come the jerusalem talmud , tractate peah , states : '' '' '' it is written , '' justice and abundant righteousness he does not withhold '' from here we see god does not hold back from a non-jew who does mitzvot some rabbis in the talmud view christianity as a form of idolatry , and therefore prohibited not only to jews , but to gentiles as well rabbis with these views did not claim that it was idolatry in the same sense as pagan idolatry in biblical times , but that it relied on idolatrous forms of worship ( i.e : jesus was instrumental or , '' was an instrument '' in changing the torah and causing the world to err and serve another beside god thus the jewish hope , and the torah , and the mitzvot have become familiar topics of conversation among those even on far isles , and among many people , uncircumcised of flesh and heart conservative , reform , reconstructionist , and a few modern orthodox rabbis engage in interfaith religious dialogue , while most orthodox rabbis do not in his view '' the language of faith of a particular community is totally incomprehensible to the man of a different faith community soloveitchik understood his ruling as advising against purely theological interfaith dialogue , but as allowing theological dialogue as part of a greater context his response was written in the light of past jewish-christian religious disputations , which traditionally had been forced upon the jewish community as recently as the 1960s many traditional jews still looked upon all interfaith dialogue with suspicion , fearing that conversion may be an ulterior motive rabbi eliezer berkovits writes that '' judaism is judaism because it rejects christianity , and christianity is christianity because it rejects judaism in contrast , some modern orthodox rabbis such as eugene korn and david hartman hold that in some cases , the primary issue in confrontation is no longer valid ; some christian groups no longer attempt to use interfaith dialogue to convert jews to christianity they believe that the relationship between judaism and christianity has reached a point where jews can trust christian groups to respect them as equals in non-orthodox denominations of judaism most rabbis hold that jews have nothing to fear from engaging in theological dialogue , and may have much to gain thus , since informal implicit theological dialogue will occur , one might as well admit it and publicly work on formal theological dialogue the document pays particular tribute to the second vatican council 's declaration nostra aetate , whose fourth chapter represents the magna charta of the holy see 's dialogue with the jewish world '' gordis gives quotations from the tanakh ( hebrew bible ) which in his view prove that this view is a misleading caricature of both religions that was created by selective quotation '' gordis again brings forth quotations from the tanakh which in his view prove that this is a misleading caricature of both religions , created by selective quotation either outlook , when relating to others , is perfectly compatible with a commitment to one 's own faith and pattern of religious life the article on relationships between jewish religious movements describes how the different jewish denominations view each other and interact with each other

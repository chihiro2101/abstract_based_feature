traditionally , jews believe that god chose the jewish people to be in a jews as a chosen people , described by the torah itself , with particular obligations and responsibilities elucidated in the oral torah sometimes this choice is seen as charging the jewish people with a specific mission to be a light unto the nations , practice tikkun olam and to exemplify the covenant with god as described in the torah this view , however , did not preclude a belief that god has a relationship with other peoples rather , judaism held that god had entered into a covenant with all humankind , and that jews and non-jews alike have a relationship with god , each nation with its own unique relationship with god biblical references as well as rabbinic literature support this view : moses refers to the '' god of the spirits of all flesh '' , and the tanakh ( hebrew bible ) also identifies prophets outside the community of israel based on these statements , some rabbis theorized that , in the words of natan'el al-fayyumi , a yemenite jewish theologian of the 12th century , '' god permitted to every people something he forbade to others '' ( levine , 1907/1966 ) the mishnah states that '' humanity was produced from one man , adam , to show god 's greatness but when the king of kings , the holy one , blessed be he , creates people in the form of adam not one is similar to any other '' ( mishnah sanhedrin 4:5 ) the mishnah continues , and states that anyone who kills or saves a single human life , jewish or not-jewish , has killed or saved an entire world all humanity , ten generations prior to the birth of abraham , the original father of judaism ) '' ( tosefta , sanhedrin 13 ) prophets of the bible , while they repeatedly denounced the evils of the idolatrous nations ( in addition to their denouncing the jews ' sins ) , they never call the nations to account for their idolatrous beliefs ( i.e worshiping multiple deities ) , but only for their evil actions ( such as human sacrifice , murder , and miscarriages of justice ) some rabbis in the talmud view christianity as a form of idolatry , and therefore prohibited not only to jews , but to gentiles as well rabbis with these views did not claim that it was idolatry in the same sense as pagan idolatry in biblical times , but that it relied on idolatrous forms of worship ( i.e ) the above paragraph was often censored from many printed versions where christian censorship was felt modern ( post-enlightenment era ) jewish views views on dialogue with non-jews in general conservative , reform , reconstructionist , and a few modern orthodox rabbis engage in interfaith religious dialogue , while most orthodox rabbis do not in fact , i believe that every people - and indeed , in a more limited way , every individual - is '' chosen '' or destined for some distinct purpose in advancing the designs of providence the jews were chosen by god to be 'peculiar unto me ' as the pioneers of religion and morality ; that was and is their national purpose '' according to the jewish encyclopedia article on gentile : gentiles may not be taught the torah , rabbi jacob emden ( 1697â€“1776 ) claimed : in practice , the predominant position of modern orthodoxy on this issue is based on the position of rabbi joseph soloveitchik in an essay entitled confrontation in his view '' the language of faith of a particular community is totally incomprehensible to the man of a different faith community '' as such , he ruled that theological dialogue between judaism and christianity was not possible as a result of his ruling , orthodox jewish groups did not operate in interfaith discussions between the roman catholic church and jews about vatican ii , a strictly theological endeavour soloveitchik understood his ruling as advising against purely theological interfaith dialogue , but as allowing theological dialogue as part of a greater context many traditional rabbis agree ; they hold that while cooperation with the christian community is of importance , theological dialogue is unnecessary , or even misguided 6 , 1964 ) today many orthodox rabbis use soloveitchik 's letter to justify having no discussion or joint efforts with christians thus , since informal implicit theological dialogue will occur , one might as well admit it and publicly work on formal theological dialogue the unprecedented orthodox rabbinic statement on christianity , entitled '' to do the will of our father in heaven : toward a partnership between jews and christians '' , was initially signed by over 25 prominent orthodox rabbis in israel , united states and europe and now has over 60 signatories of chicago press , 1962 ) recently , over 120 rabbis have signed the dabru emet ( '' speak the truth '' ) , a document concerning the relationship between judaism and christianity this official statement holds that : '' as conservative jews , we acknowledge without apology the many debts which jewish religion and civilization owe to the nations of the world many modern thinkers , both jewish and gentile , have noted that god may well have seen fit to enter covenants with many nations & nbsp ;

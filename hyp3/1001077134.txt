general classical views on other religions traditionally , jews believe that god chose the jewish people to be in a jews as a chosen people , described by the torah itself , with particular obligations and responsibilities elucidated in the oral torah sometimes this choice is seen as charging the jewish people with a specific mission to be a light unto the nations , practice tikkun olam and to exemplify the covenant with god as described in the torah this view , however , did not preclude a belief that god has a relationship with other peoples rather , judaism held that god had entered into a covenant with all humankind , and that jews and non-jews alike have a relationship with god , each nation with its own unique relationship with god biblical references as well as rabbinic literature support this view : moses refers to the '' god of the spirits of all flesh '' , and the tanakh ( hebrew bible ) also identifies prophets outside the community of israel based on these statements , some rabbis theorized that , in the words of natan'el al-fayyumi , a yemenite jewish theologian of the 12th century , '' god permitted to every people something he forbade to others '' ( levine , 1907/1966 ) the mishnah states that '' humanity was produced from one man , adam , to show god 's greatness '' ( mishnah sanhedrin 4:5 ) the mishnah continues , and states that anyone who kills or saves a single human life , jewish or not-jewish , has killed or saved an entire world the tosefta , a supplement to the mishnah , states : '' righteous among the nations have a share in the olam haba '' ( tosefta sanhedrin 13:1 ; sanhedrin 105a ; also maimonides , mishneh torah , hilchot teshuvah 3:4 ) the midrash adds : '' -why does the holy one , blessed be he , love the righteous ? because righteousness is not due to inheritance or family connections '' ( tosefta , sanhedrin 13 ) prophets of the bible , while they repeatedly denounced the evils of the idolatrous nations ( in addition to their denouncing the jews ' sins ) , they never call the nations to account for their idolatrous beliefs ( i.e some rabbis in the talmud view christianity as a form of idolatry , and therefore prohibited not only to jews , but to gentiles as well rabbis with these views did not claim that it was idolatry in the same sense as pagan idolatry in biblical times , but that it relied on idolatrous forms of worship ( i.e however , maimonides then goes on to say that both faiths can be considered a positive part of god 's plan to redeem the world ) the above paragraph was often censored from many printed versions where christian censorship was felt modern ( post-enlightenment era ) jewish views conservative , reform , reconstructionist , and a few modern orthodox rabbis engage in interfaith religious dialogue , while most orthodox rabbis do not '' according to the jewish encyclopedia article on gentile : gentiles may not be taught the torah , rabbi jacob emden ( 1697–1776 ) claimed : in his view '' the language of faith of a particular community is totally incomprehensible to the man of a different faith community the great encounter between man and god is a holy , personal and private affair , incomprehensible to the outsider however , the rabbinical council of america ( rca ) , with soloveitchik 's approval , then engaged in a number of interfaith dialogues with both catholic and protestant christian groups '' : an rca committee was once reviewing possible topics for an inter-faith dialogue he described the traditional jewish–christian relationship as one of '' the few and weak vis-à-vis the many and the strong '' , one in which the christian community historically denied the right of the jewish community to believe and live in their own way his response was written in the light of past jewish-christian religious disputations , which traditionally had been forced upon the jewish community many traditional rabbis agree ; they hold that while cooperation with the christian community is of importance , theological dialogue is unnecessary , or even misguided in non-orthodox denominations of judaism most rabbis hold that jews have nothing to fear from engaging in theological dialogue , and may have much to gain some hold that in practice soloveitchik 's distinctions are not viable , for any group that has sustained discussion and participation on moral issues will implicitly involve theological discourse thus , since informal implicit theological dialogue will occur , one might as well admit it and publicly work on formal theological dialogue the unprecedented orthodox rabbinic statement on christianity , entitled '' to do the will of our father in heaven : toward a partnership between jews and christians '' , was initially signed by over 25 prominent orthodox rabbis in israel , united states and europe and now has over 60 signatories of chicago press , 1962 ) recently , over 120 rabbis have signed the dabru emet ( '' speak the truth '' ) , a document concerning the relationship between judaism and christianity many muslim and jewish groups and individuals have together created projects working for peace among israelis and arabs , most of which have as one of their goals overcoming religious prejudice but all of these relationships , properly pursued , can bring great blessing to the jewish community and to the world the article on relationships between jewish religious movements describes how the different jewish denominations view each other and interact with each other

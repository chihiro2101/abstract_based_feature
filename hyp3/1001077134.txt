general classical views on other religions traditionally , jews believe that god chose the jewish people to be in a jews as a chosen people , described by the torah itself , with particular obligations and responsibilities elucidated in the oral torah sometimes this choice is seen as charging the jewish people with a specific mission to be a light unto the nations , practice tikkun olam and to exemplify the covenant with god as described in the torah this view , however , did not preclude a belief that god has a relationship with other peoples rather , judaism held that god had entered into a covenant with all humankind , and that jews and non-jews alike have a relationship with god , each nation with its own unique relationship with god biblical references as well as rabbinic literature support this view : moses refers to the '' god of the spirits of all flesh '' , and the tanakh ( hebrew bible ) also identifies prophets outside the community of israel based on these statements , some rabbis theorized that , in the words of natan'el al-fayyumi , a yemenite jewish theologian of the 12th century , '' god permitted to every people something he forbade to others and god sends a prophet to every people according to their own language '' ( levine , 1907/1966 ) the mishnah states that '' humanity was produced from one man , adam , to show god 's greatness '' ( mishnah sanhedrin 4:5 ) the mishnah continues , and states that anyone who kills or saves a single human life , jewish or not-jewish , has killed or saved an entire world the tosefta , a supplement to the mishnah , states : '' righteous among the nations have a share in the olam haba '' ( tosefta sanhedrin 13:1 ; sanhedrin 105a ; also maimonides , mishneh torah , hilchot teshuvah 3:4 ) all humanity , ten generations prior to the birth of abraham , the original father of judaism ) maimonides states that this refers to those who have acquired knowledge of god and act in accordance with the noahide laws in the 2nd century a sage in the tosefta declared '' the righteous of all nations have a share in the world to come '' ( tosefta , sanhedrin 13 ) prophets of the bible , while they repeatedly denounced the evils of the idolatrous nations ( in addition to their denouncing the jews ' sins ) , they never call the nations to account for their idolatrous beliefs ( i.e some rabbis in the talmud view christianity as a form of idolatry , and therefore prohibited not only to jews , but to gentiles as well rabbis with these views did not claim that it was idolatry in the same sense as pagan idolatry in biblical times , but that it relied on idolatrous forms of worship ( i.e : jesus was instrumental or , '' was an instrument '' in changing the torah and causing the world to err and serve another beside god conservative , reform , reconstructionist , and a few modern orthodox rabbis engage in interfaith religious dialogue , while most orthodox rabbis do not in fact , i believe that every people - and indeed , in a more limited way , every individual - is '' chosen '' or destined for some distinct purpose in advancing the designs of providence '' according to the jewish encyclopedia article on gentile : gentiles may not be taught the torah , rabbi jacob emden ( 1697â€“1776 ) claimed : in practice , the predominant position of modern orthodoxy on this issue is based on the position of rabbi joseph soloveitchik in an essay entitled confrontation however , soloveitchik advocated closer ties between the jewish and christian communities as a result of his ruling , orthodox jewish groups did not operate in interfaith discussions between the roman catholic church and jews about vatican ii , a strictly theological endeavour every topic which had possible theological nuances or implications was vetoed , and only when the rav pronounced it to be satisfactory did we proceed to the dialogue one of the suggested topics was '' man in the image of god his response was written in the light of past jewish-christian religious disputations , which traditionally had been forced upon the jewish community reflecting this stance , rabbi soloveitchik asked the christian community to respect '' the right of the community of the few to live , create and worship in its own way , in freedom and with dignity many traditional rabbis agree ; they hold that while cooperation with the christian community is of importance , theological dialogue is unnecessary , or even misguided '' ( disputation and dialogue : readings in the jewish christian encounter , ed it is not an official document of any of the jewish denominations per se , but it is representative of what many jews feel but all of these relationships , properly pursued , can bring great blessing to the jewish community and to the world the article on relationships between jewish religious movements describes how the different jewish denominations view each other and interact with each other & nbsp ;

general classical views on other religions traditionally , jews believe that god chose the jewish people to be in a jews as a chosen people , described by the torah itself , with particular obligations and responsibilities elucidated in the oral torah sometimes this choice is seen as charging the jewish people with a specific mission to be a light unto the nations , practice tikkun olam and to exemplify the covenant with god as described in the torah this view , however , did not preclude a belief that god has a relationship with other peoples rather , judaism held that god had entered into a covenant with all humankind , and that jews and non-jews alike have a relationship with god , each nation with its own unique relationship with god biblical references as well as rabbinic literature support this view : moses refers to the '' god of the spirits of all flesh '' , and the tanakh ( hebrew bible ) also identifies prophets outside the community of israel based on these statements , some rabbis theorized that , in the words of natan'el al-fayyumi , a yemenite jewish theologian of the 12th century , '' god permitted to every people something he forbade to others but when the king of kings , the holy one , blessed be he , creates people in the form of adam not one is similar to any other '' ( mishnah sanhedrin 4:5 ) the mishnah continues , and states that anyone who kills or saves a single human life , jewish or not-jewish , has killed or saved an entire world the tosefta , a supplement to the mishnah , states : '' righteous among the nations have a share in the olam haba '' ( tosefta sanhedrin 13:1 ; sanhedrin 105a ; also maimonides , mishneh torah , hilchot teshuvah 3:4 ) the midrash adds : '' -why does the holy one , blessed be he , love the righteous ? because righteousness is not due to inheritance or family connections maimonides states that this refers to those who have acquired knowledge of god and act in accordance with the noahide laws in the 2nd century a sage in the tosefta declared '' the righteous of all nations have a share in the world to come '' ( tosefta , sanhedrin 13 ) prophets of the bible , while they repeatedly denounced the evils of the idolatrous nations ( in addition to their denouncing the jews ' sins ) , they never call the nations to account for their idolatrous beliefs ( i.e some rabbis in the talmud view christianity as a form of idolatry , and therefore prohibited not only to jews , but to gentiles as well rabbis with these views did not claim that it was idolatry in the same sense as pagan idolatry in biblical times , but that it relied on idolatrous forms of worship ( i.e however , maimonides then goes on to say that both faiths can be considered a positive part of god 's plan to redeem the world but it is beyond the human mind to fathom the designs of our creator , for our ways are not god 's ways , neither are our thoughts his conservative , reform , reconstructionist , and a few modern orthodox rabbis engage in interfaith religious dialogue , while most orthodox rabbis do not '' according to the jewish encyclopedia article on gentile : gentiles may not be taught the torah , rabbi jacob emden ( 1697–1776 ) claimed : in his view '' the language of faith of a particular community is totally incomprehensible to the man of a different faith community the great encounter between man and god is a holy , personal and private affair , incomprehensible to the outsider '' as such , he ruled that theological dialogue between judaism and christianity was not possible soloveitchik understood his ruling as advising against purely theological interfaith dialogue , but as allowing theological dialogue as part of a greater context he described the traditional jewish–christian relationship as one of '' the few and weak vis-à-vis the many and the strong '' , one in which the christian community historically denied the right of the jewish community to believe and live in their own way his response was written in the light of past jewish-christian religious disputations , which traditionally had been forced upon the jewish community many traditional rabbis agree ; they hold that while cooperation with the christian community is of importance , theological dialogue is unnecessary , or even misguided 6 , 1964 ) today many orthodox rabbis use soloveitchik 's letter to justify having no discussion or joint efforts with christians they believe that the relationship between judaism and christianity has reached a point where jews can trust christian groups to respect them as equals '' his proposed ground rules for fair discussion are : : ( 1 ) people should not label jews as worshiping an inferior '' old testament god of justice '' while saying that christians worship a superior '' god of love of the new testament '' gordis gives quotations from the tanakh ( hebrew bible ) which in his view prove that this view is a misleading caricature of both religions that was created by selective quotation the article on relationships between jewish religious movements describes how the different jewish denominations view each other and interact with each other alan brill , judaism and other religions : models of understanding palgrave 2010 & nbsp ; 214-215 , 1996 joseph soloveitchik confrontation tradition : a journal of orthodox thought , 1964 volume 6 , 2 disputation and dialogue : readings in the jewish christian encounter , ed

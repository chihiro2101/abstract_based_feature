the å in scandinavian alphabets represents two sounds , one short and one long in danish and norwegian , the long version is pronounced ipa historically , the å derives from the old norse long vowel ( spelled with the letter á ) , but over time , it developed to an sound in most scandinavian language varieties ( in swedish and norwegian , it has eventually reached the pronunciation medieval writing often used doubled letters for long vowels , and the vowel continued to be written aa in old swedish the use of the ligature æ and of ø ( originally also a variant of the ligature œ ) that represented the sounds and respectively were gradually replaced by new letters 139 in an attempt to modernize the orthography , linguists tried to introduce the å to danish and norwegian writing in the 19th century most people felt no need for the new letter , although the letter group aa had already been pronounced like å for centuries in denmark and norway aa was usually treated as a single letter , spoken like the present å when spelling out names or words it has been argued that the å only made its way to official danish spelling due to anti-german and pro-scandinavian sentiment after world war ii danish had been the only language apart from german and luxembourgish to use capitalized nouns in the last decades , but abolished them at the same occasion the old norse letter á is retained , but the sound it now expresses is a diphthong , pronounced in icelandic and in faroese in some place names , the old aa spelling dominates , more often in denmark than in norway ( where it has been abolished in official use since 1917 ) å as a word means '' small river '' in danish , swedish , and norwegian and can be found in place names before 1917 , when spelling with the double a was common , some norwegian place names contained three or four consecutive a letters : for instance ( now , a river ) and ( blååsen , 'the blue ( '' blå '' ) ridge ( '' ås '' ) ' ) in the swedish and finnish alphabets , å is sorted after z , as the third letter from the end , the sequence being å , ä , ö image : pois pakkoruotsi.svg thumb the fact that å is a common letter in swedish while having no native use in finnish has led to it being used as a concise symbol for the swedish language in finland , as in this campaign to rid finnish schools of mandatory swedish its use quickly spread to all eastern dialects , but the cultural influence liège and covered three sounds , a long open o , a long close o or a long a , depending on the local varieties the use of a single å letter to cover such pronunciations has been embraced by the new pan-walloon orthography , with one orthography for words regardless of the local phonetic variations

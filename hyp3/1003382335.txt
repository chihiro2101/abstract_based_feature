historically , the å derives from the old norse long vowel ( spelled with the letter á ) , but over time , it developed to an sound in most scandinavian language varieties ( in swedish and norwegian , it has eventually reached the pronunciation medieval writing often used doubled letters for long vowels , and the vowel continued to be written aa in old swedish the use of the ligature æ and of ø ( originally also a variant of the ligature œ ) that represented the sounds and respectively were gradually replaced by new letters it was first used in print in the gustav vasa bible that was published in 1541 and replaced aa in the 16th century 139 in an attempt to modernize the orthography , linguists tried to introduce the å to danish and norwegian writing in the 19th century most people felt no need for the new letter , although the letter group aa had already been pronounced like å for centuries in denmark and norway aa was usually treated as a single letter , spoken like the present å when spelling out names or words in a few names of danish cities or towns , the old spelling has been retained as an option due to local resistance , e.g the old norse letter á is retained , but the sound it now expresses is a diphthong , pronounced in icelandic and in faroese in some place names , the old aa spelling dominates , more often in denmark than in norway ( where it has been abolished in official use since 1917 ) å as a word means '' small river '' in danish , swedish , and norwegian and can be found in place names in family names , the bearer of the name uses aa or å according to their choice , but since family names are inherited they are resistant to change and the traditional aa style is often kept the surname aa is always spelled with double a , never with the single å the double a , representing a single sound , is usually kept in initials e.g correct alphabetization in danish and norwegian places å as the last letter in the alphabet , the sequence being æ , ø , å in the swedish and finnish alphabets , å is sorted after z , as the third letter from the end , the sequence being å , ä , ö because the finnish alphabet is derived from the swedish alphabet , å is carried over , but it has no native finnish use and is treated as in swedish the use of a single å letter to cover such pronunciations has been embraced by the new pan-walloon orthography , with one orthography for words regardless of the local phonetic variations

the å in scandinavian alphabets represents two sounds , one short and one long in danish and norwegian , the long version is pronounced ipa historically , the å derives from the old norse long vowel ( spelled with the letter á ) , but over time , it developed to an sound in most scandinavian language varieties ( in swedish and norwegian , it has eventually reached the pronunciation medieval writing often used doubled letters for long vowels , and the vowel continued to be written aa in old swedish the use of the ligature æ and of ø ( originally also a variant of the ligature œ ) that represented the sounds and respectively were gradually replaced by new letters this construction was also applied to construct a new grapheme where an '' aa '' had previously been used a minuscule o was placed on top of an a to create a new letter 139 in an attempt to modernize the orthography , linguists tried to introduce the å to danish and norwegian writing in the 19th century most people felt no need for the new letter , although the letter group aa had already been pronounced like å for centuries in denmark and norway aa was usually treated as a single letter , spoken like the present å when spelling out names or words in a few names of danish cities or towns , the old spelling has been retained as an option due to local resistance , e.g in some place names , the old aa spelling dominates , more often in denmark than in norway ( where it has been abolished in official use since 1917 ) å as a word means '' small river '' in danish , swedish , and norwegian and can be found in place names in family names , the bearer of the name uses aa or å according to their choice , but since family names are inherited they are resistant to change and the traditional aa style is often kept in the swedish and finnish alphabets , å is sorted after z , as the third letter from the end , the sequence being å , ä , ö its usage is limited to loanwords and names of swedish , danish or norwegian origin it is not advised to substitute aa for å in finnish , as aa is already a common letter combination with the value the use of a single å letter to cover such pronunciations has been embraced by the new pan-walloon orthography , with one orthography for words regardless of the local phonetic variations

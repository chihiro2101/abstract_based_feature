the å in scandinavian alphabets represents two sounds , one short and one long in danish and norwegian , the long version is pronounced ipa the å-sound originally had the same origin as the long sound in german and ( scandinavian , , english eel , hair ) historically , the å derives from the old norse long vowel ( spelled with the letter á ) , but over time , it developed to an sound in most scandinavian language varieties ( in swedish and norwegian , it has eventually reached the pronunciation medieval writing often used doubled letters for long vowels , and the vowel continued to be written aa in old swedish the use of the ligature æ and of ø ( originally also a variant of the ligature œ ) that represented the sounds and respectively were gradually replaced by new letters most people felt no need for the new letter , although the letter group aa had already been pronounced like å for centuries in denmark and norway in a few names of danish cities or towns , the old spelling has been retained as an option due to local resistance , e.g the old norse letter á is retained , but the sound it now expresses is a diphthong , pronounced in icelandic and in faroese in some place names , the old aa spelling dominates , more often in denmark than in norway ( where it has been abolished in official use since 1917 ) å as a word means '' small river '' in danish , swedish , and norwegian and can be found in place names correct alphabetization in danish and norwegian places å as the last letter in the alphabet , the sequence being æ , ø , å while it is recommended to keep the å intact wherever possible , the next best thing is to use the older , double a spelling ( e.g because the finnish alphabet is derived from the swedish alphabet , å is carried over , but it has no native finnish use and is treated as in swedish it is not advised to substitute aa for å in finnish , as aa is already a common letter combination with the value the use of a single å letter to cover such pronunciations has been embraced by the new pan-walloon orthography , with one orthography for words regardless of the local phonetic variations the istro-romanian alphabet is based on the standard romanian alphabet with three additional letters used to mark sounds specific only to this language : å , ľ and ń å and å are also used in the practical orthography of chamorro , a language indigenous to the people of northern mariana islands and guam

the english common name fieldfare dates back to at least the eleventh century about 65 species of medium to large thrushes are in the genus turdus , characterised by rounded heads , longish , pointed wings , and usually melodious songs although two european thrushes , the song thrush and mistle thrush , are early offshoots from the eurasian lineage of turdus thrushes after they spread north from africa , the fieldfare is descended from ancestors that had colonised the caribbean islands from africa and subsequently reached europe from there the fieldfare is easily recognisable with its slate-grey head , nape and rump , dark brown back , blackish tail and boldly speckled breast the scapulars and mantle feathers are dark chestnut-brown with dark central streaks and pale tips the chin , throat and upper breast are creamy-buff with bold streaks and speckles of brownish-black the lower breast is creamy-white with a diminishing buff tinge and fewer speckles and the belly is similarly creamy-white , with the speckles restricted to the uppermost parts the primaries are brownish-black with the leading edge fringed grey and the inner edge of the outer feathers grey near the base whereas the inner feathers are fringed with brown near the base the axillaries and under wing-coverts are white and the under tail-coverts have dark greyish-brown bases and margins and white centres and tips it is orange-yellow in winter , with the upper mandible somewhat brownish and both mandible tips brownish-black the female is very similar to the male but the upper parts are somewhat more brownish and the feathers on the crown have narrower black central stripes the beak is similar to the male 's winter beak it is a mixture of a few phrases like those of the common blackbird ( turdus merula ) interspersed with whistles , guttural squeaks and call notes this is sung on the wing and also from a tree and a subdued version of this song with more warbling notes is sung by a group of birds at communal roosts its winter range extends through western and southern europe to north africa , though it is uncommon in the mediterranean region in the summer the fieldfare frequents mixed woodland of birch , alder , pine , spruce and fir , often near marshes , moorland or other open ground they are usually ready to leave the nest after fourteen to sixteen days and there may be two broods in the season , especially in the southern parts of the breeding range in the united kingdom , at the extreme edge of the fieldfare 's breeding range , only a handful of pairs breed

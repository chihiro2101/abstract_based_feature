the english common name fieldfare dates back to at least the eleventh century the species was described by carl linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of systema naturae under its current scientific name about 65 species of medium to large thrushes are in the genus turdus , characterised by rounded heads , longish , pointed wings , and usually melodious songs although two european thrushes , the song thrush and mistle thrush , are early offshoots from the eurasian lineage of turdus thrushes after they spread north from africa , the fieldfare is descended from ancestors that had colonised the caribbean islands from africa and subsequently reached europe from there the fieldfare is easily recognisable with its slate-grey head , nape and rump , dark brown back , blackish tail and boldly speckled breast the ear coverts , nape , hind neck and rump are bluish-grey , usually with a white streak near the shaft of each rump feather there are fourteen tail feathers each with a pointed tip , the outer two slightly shorter than the others giving a rounded tail the outer edge of each tail feather is fringed with grey near the base and the outer pair of feathers have a narrow white border on the inner edge the chin , throat and upper breast are creamy-buff with bold streaks and speckles of brownish-black the axillaries and under wing-coverts are white and the under tail-coverts have dark greyish-brown bases and margins and white centres and tips the female is very similar to the male but the upper parts are somewhat more brownish and the feathers on the crown have narrower black central stripes the beak is similar to the male 's winter beak this is sung on the wing and also from a tree and a subdued version of this song with more warbling notes is sung by a group of birds at communal roosts its winter range extends through western and southern europe to north africa , though it is uncommon in the mediterranean region in the summer the fieldfare frequents mixed woodland of birch , alder , pine , spruce and fir , often near marshes , moorland or other open ground migration southwards from the breeding range starts in october but the bulk of birds arrive in the united kingdom in november they are usually ready to leave the nest after fourteen to sixteen days and there may be two broods in the season , especially in the southern parts of the breeding range in the united kingdom , at the extreme edge of the fieldfare 's breeding range , only a handful of pairs breed

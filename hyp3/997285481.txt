hyponymy shows the relationship between a generic term ( hypernym ) and a specific instance of it ( hyponym ) a hyponym is a word or phrase whose semantic field is more specific than its hypernym the semantic field of a hypernym , also known as a superordinate , is broader than that of a hyponym an approach to the relationship between hyponyms and hypernyms is to view a hypernym as consisting of hyponyms for example , verbs such as stare , gaze , view and peer can also be considered hyponyms of the verb look , which is their hypernym hyponymy is a transitive relation , if x is a hyponym of y , and y is a hyponym of z , then x is a hyponym of z for example , violet is a hyponym of purple and purple is a hyponym of color ; therefore violet is a hyponym of color the hierarchical structure of semantic fields can be mostly seen in hyponymy co-hyponyms are labelled as such when separate hyponyms share the same hypernym but are not hyponyms of one another , unless they happen to be synonymous a word is an autohyponym if it is used for both a hypernym and its hyponym similarly , the verb to drink ( a beverage ) is a hypernym for to drink ( an alcoholic beverage ) as a hypernym can be understood as a more general word than its hyponym , the relation is used in semantic compression by generalization to reduce a level of specialization

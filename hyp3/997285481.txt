hyponymy shows the relationship between a generic term ( hypernym ) and a specific instance of it ( hyponym ) a hyponym is a word or phrase whose semantic field is more specific than its hypernym the semantic field of a hypernym , also known as a superordinate , is broader than that of a hyponym an approach to the relationship between hyponyms and hypernyms is to view a hypernym as consisting of hyponyms for instance , the word screwdriver used in the previous example refers to screwdriver , and not to screwdriver ( cocktail ) hyponymy is a transitive relation , if x is a hyponym of y , and y is a hyponym of z , then x is a hyponym of z for example , violet is a hyponym of purple and purple is a hyponym of color ; therefore violet is a hyponym of color a word can be both a hypernym and a hyponym : for example purple is a hyponym of color but itself is a hypernym of the broad spectrum of shades of purple between the range of crimson and violet if the hypernym z consists of hyponyms x and y , x and y are identified as co-hyponyms co-hyponyms are labelled as such when separate hyponyms share the same hypernym but are not hyponyms of one another , unless they happen to be synonymous a word is an autohyponym if it is used for both a hypernym and its hyponym as a hypernym can be understood as a more general word than its hyponym , the relation is used in semantic compression by generalization to reduce a level of specialization

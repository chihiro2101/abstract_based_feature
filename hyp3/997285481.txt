hyponymy shows the relationship between a generic term ( hypernym ) and a specific instance of it ( hyponym ) a hyponym is a word or phrase whose semantic field is more specific than its hypernym the semantic field of a hypernym , also known as a superordinate , is broader than that of a hyponym for example , verbs such as stare , gaze , view and peer can also be considered hyponyms of the verb look , which is their hypernym hyponymy is a transitive relation , if x is a hyponym of y , and y is a hyponym of z , then x is a hyponym of z for example , violet is a hyponym of purple and purple is a hyponym of color ; therefore violet is a hyponym of color a word can be both a hypernym and a hyponym : for example purple is a hyponym of color but itself is a hypernym of the broad spectrum of shades of purple between the range of crimson and violet the second relation is said to be more discriminating and can be classified more specifically under the concept of taxonomy the form hypernym takes the -o- of hyponym as a part of hypo in the same way as in the contrast between hypertension and hypotension therefore , hyperonym is etymologically more faithful than hypernym 291 the nominalization hyperonymy is rarely used , because the neutral term to refer to the relationship is hyponymy as a hypernym can be understood as a more general word than its hyponym , the relation is used in semantic compression by generalization to reduce a level of specialization

hyponymy shows the relationship between a generic term ( hypernym ) and a specific instance of it ( hyponym ) a hyponym is a word or phrase whose semantic field is more specific than its hypernym the semantic field of a hypernym , also known as a superordinate , is broader than that of a hyponym an approach to the relationship between hyponyms and hypernyms is to view a hypernym as consisting of hyponyms while hyponyms are typically used to refer to nouns , it can also be used on other parts of speech hypernyms and hyponyms are asymmetric hyponymy is a transitive relation , if x is a hyponym of y , and y is a hyponym of z , then x is a hyponym of z for example , violet is a hyponym of purple and purple is a hyponym of color ; therefore violet is a hyponym of color a word can be both a hypernym and a hyponym : for example purple is a hyponym of color but itself is a hypernym of the broad spectrum of shades of purple between the range of crimson and violet the hierarchical structure of semantic fields can be mostly seen in hyponymy a word is an autohyponym if it is used for both a hypernym and its hyponym linguist ruth kempson had already observed that if there are hyponyms for one part of a set but not another , the hypernym can complement the existing hyponym by being used for the remaining part

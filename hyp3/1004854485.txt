wastelands game mechanics are based on those used in the tabletop role-playing games , such as tunnels and trolls and mercenaries , spies and private eyes created by wasteland designers ken st characters in wasteland have various statistics ( strength , intelligence , luck , speed , agility , dexterity , and charisma ) that allow the characters to use different skills and weapons through the course of the game the party can hold as many as seven characters by recruiting certain citizens and wasteland creatures wasteland was one of the first games featuring a persistent world , where changes to the game world were stored and kept returning to an area later in the game , the player would find it in the state the player left it in , rather than being reset , as was common for games of the time since hard drives were still rare in home computers in 1988 , this meant the original game disk had to be copied first , as the manual instructed one to do these paragraphs described encounters and conversations , contained clues , and added to the overall texture of the game because programming space was at a premium , it saved on resources to have most of the game 's story printed out in a separate manual rather than stored within the game 's code itself the paragraph books also served as a rudimentary form of copy protection ; someone playing a copied version of the game would miss out on much of the story and clues necessary to progress brian fargo in an interview with hartley and patricia lesse for microtimes in 1987 said that interplay started work on the game about a year ago he described the game as a hybrid of ultima games and the bard 's tale , while being post-apocalyptic and in a similar vein as the mad max films has stated that the genesis of wasteland came after the bard 's tale was a hit , as they wanted to make another role-playing video game for electronic arts asides from a sequel to the bard 's tale while searching for a gameplay system for their new game , they came across the system of mercenaries , spies and private eyes andre described to hickey that they wanted to make a game-changing computer role-playing game that will be better than any other at the time , hating the limitations other crpgs put on gamers according to him , the process of creating the story of the game took over a year , though it was mostly due to them feeding various possible scenarios into how the game should react at a given time alan pavlish had been chosen to be the lead developer of the video game , writing the game in apple ii machine language and programming the game to react to player choices said to be in development for five years , wasteland was originally released for the apple ii , commodore 64 , and ibm compatibles she also criticized having to insert the primary '' a '' disk in order to play the game after copying it from four disks , the game 's save system and characters starting out with useless items interplay has described its 1997 game fallout as the spiritual successor to wasteland in a kickstarter update for wasteland 2 on august 9 , 2013 , project lead chris keenan announced that they had reached an agreement with electronic arts to release the game for modern operating systems the next day , the game was also released on steam for the windows , mac and linux

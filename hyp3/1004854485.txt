wastelands game mechanics are based on those used in the tabletop role-playing games , such as tunnels and trolls and mercenaries , spies and private eyes created by wasteland designers ken st characters in wasteland have various statistics ( strength , intelligence , luck , speed , agility , dexterity , and charisma ) that allow the characters to use different skills and weapons through the course of the game the party can hold as many as seven characters by recruiting certain citizens and wasteland creatures unlike those of other computer rpgs of the time , these non-player character might at times refuse to follow the player 's commands , such as when the player orders the character to give up an item or perform an action wasteland was one of the first games featuring a persistent world , where changes to the game world were stored and kept returning to an area later in the game , the player would find it in the state the player left it in , rather than being reset , as was common for games of the time another feature of the game was the inclusion of a printed collection of paragraphs that the player would read at the appropriate times because programming space was at a premium , it saved on resources to have most of the game 's story printed out in a separate manual rather than stored within the game 's code itself the paragraph books also served as a rudimentary form of copy protection ; someone playing a copied version of the game would miss out on much of the story and clues necessary to progress the paragraphs included an unrelated story line about a mission to mars intended to mislead those who read the paragraphs when not instructed to , and a false set of passwords that would trip up cheaters brian fargo in an interview with hartley and patricia lesse for microtimes in 1987 said that interplay started work on the game about a year ago fargo further stated that game was created on apple ii as it was equally important to him like the commodore 64 he described the game as a hybrid of ultima games and the bard 's tale , while being post-apocalyptic and in a similar vein as the mad max films it was stated in january 1987 that michael stackpole , who authored mercenaries , spies and private eyes and batman 's sourcebook for dc heroes , would be involved as the game 's writer has stated that the genesis of wasteland came after the bard 's tale was a hit , as they wanted to make another role-playing video game for electronic arts asides from a sequel to the bard 's tale according to him , the process of creating the story of the game took over a year , though it was mostly due to them feeding various possible scenarios into how the game should react at a given time wasteland 's different story was mostly because of st interplay has described its 1997 game fallout as the spiritual successor to wasteland why wasteland 2 is worth getting excited about , ign , march 16 , 2012 all games in the fallout series are set in the world described by its characters as '' wasteland '' ( for example , the '' midwest wasteland '' in fallout tactics : brotherhood of steel or the '' capital wasteland '' in fallout 3 ) on november 7 , he announced that the re-release titled wasteland 1 - the original classic had gone gold and had been submitted to gog and steam for approval the next day , the game was also released on steam for the windows , mac and linux

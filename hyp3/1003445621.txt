johannes kepler was the first to successfully model planetary orbits to a high degree of accuracy , publishing his laws in 1605 isaac newton published more general laws of celestial motion in the first edition of philosophi√¶ naturalis principia mathematica ( 1687 ) , which gave a method for finding the orbit of a body following a parabola path from three observations gauss 's method was able to use just three observations ( in the form of pairs of right ascension and declination ) , to find the six orbital elements that completely describe an orbit the specific example discussed is of a satellite orbiting a planet , but the rules of thumb could also apply to other situations , such as orbits of small bodies around a star such as the sun a special case of this is a circular orbit ( a circle is a special case of ellipse ) with the planet at the center a line drawn from the planet to the satellite sweeps out equal areas in equal times no matter which portion of the orbit is measured without applying force ( such as firing a rocket engine ) , the period and shape of the satellite 's orbit wo n't change a satellite in a low orbit ( or low part of an elliptical orbit ) moves more quickly with respect to the surface of the planet than a satellite in a higher orbit ( or a high part of an elliptical orbit ) , due to the stronger gravitational attraction closer to the planet if thrust is applied at only one point in the satellite 's orbit , it will return to that same point on each subsequent orbit , though the rest of its path will change thrust applied in the direction of the satellite 's motion creates an elliptical orbit with its highest point ( apoapse ) 180 degrees away from the firing point for example , if two spacecraft are in the same circular orbit and wish to dock , unless they are very close , the trailing craft can not simply fire its engines to go faster this will change the shape of its orbit , causing it to gain altitude and actually slow down relative to the leading craft , missing the target for example , simple atmospheric drag is another complicating factor for objects in low earth orbit the universal variable formulation works well with the variation of parameters technique , except now , instead of the six keplerian orbital elements , we use a different set of orbital elements : namely , the satellite 's initial position and velocity vectors x_0 and v_0 at a given epoch t 0 in a two-body simulation , these elements are sufficient to compute the satellite 's position and velocity at any time in the future , using the universal variable formulation conversely , at any moment in the satellite 's orbit , we can measure its position and velocity , and then use the universal variable approach to determine what its initial position and velocity would have been at the epoch in spaceflight , an orbital maneuver is the use of propulsion systems to change the orbit of a spacecraft using low thrust engines ( such as electrical propulsion ) , if the initial orbit is supersynchronous to the final desired circular orbit then the optimal transfer orbit is achieved by thrusting continuously in the direction of the velocity at apogee this effect is that use of a propulsion system works better at high speeds , and hence course changes are best done when close to a gravitating body ; this can multiply the effective delta-v for example , it is possible to plot an orbit from high earth orbit to mars , passing close to one of the earth 's trojan points

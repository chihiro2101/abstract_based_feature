until the rise of spaceflight in the twentieth century , there was little distinction between orbital and celestial mechanics isaac newton published more general laws of celestial motion in the first edition of philosophiæ naturalis principia mathematica ( 1687 ) , which gave a method for finding the orbit of a body following a parabola path from three observations newton 's method of successive approximation was formalised into an analytic method by euler in 1744 , whose work was in turn generalised to elliptical and hyperbolic orbits by lambert in 1761–1777 gauss 's method was able to use just three observations ( in the form of pairs of right ascension and declination ) , to find the six orbital elements that completely describe an orbit the following rules of thumb are useful for situations approximated by classical mechanics under the standard assumptions of astrodynamics outlined below the rules the specific example discussed is of a satellite orbiting a planet , but the rules of thumb could also apply to other situations , such as orbits of small bodies around a star such as the sun kepler 's laws of planetary motion : orbits are ellipse , with the heavier body at one focus of the ellipse a line drawn from the planet to the satellite sweeps out equal areas in equal times no matter which portion of the orbit is measured the square of a satellite 's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its average distance from the planet without applying force ( such as firing a rocket engine ) , the period and shape of the satellite 's orbit wo n't change if thrust is applied at only one point in the satellite 's orbit , it will return to that same point on each subsequent orbit , though the rest of its path will change from a circular orbit , thrust applied in a direction opposite to the satellite 's motion changes orbit to elliptical ; the satellite will descend and reach the lowest orbital point ( the periapse ) at 180 degrees away from the firing point ; then it will ascend back the consequences of the rules of orbital mechanics are sometimes counter-intuitive for example , if two spacecraft are in the same circular orbit and wish to dock , unless they are very close , the trailing craft can not simply fire its engines to go faster celestial mechanics uses more general rules applicable to a wider variety of situations kepler 's laws of planetary motion , which can be mathematically derived from newton 's laws , hold strictly only in describing the motion of two gravitating bodies in the absence of non-gravitational forces ; they also describe parabolic and hyperbolic trajectories the fundamental laws of astrodynamics are newton 's law of universal gravitation and newton 's laws of motion , while the fundamental mathematical tool is differential calculus transfer orbits are usually elliptical orbits that allow spacecraft to move from one ( usually substantially circular ) orbit to another for the case of orbital transfer between non-coplanar orbits , the change-of-plane thrust must be made at the point where the orbital planes intersect ( the '' node '' ) orbital mechanics ( rocket and space technology ) java astrodynamics toolkit astrodynamics-based space traffic and event knowledge graph

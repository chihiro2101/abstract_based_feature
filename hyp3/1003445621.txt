until the rise of spaceflight in the twentieth century , there was little distinction between orbital and celestial mechanics isaac newton published more general laws of celestial motion in the first edition of philosophiæ naturalis principia mathematica ( 1687 ) , which gave a method for finding the orbit of a body following a parabola path from three observations gauss 's method was able to use just three observations ( in the form of pairs of right ascension and declination ) , to find the six orbital elements that completely describe an orbit modern orbit determination and prediction are used for operating all types of satellites and space probes , as it is necessary to know their future positions to a high degree of accuracy the following rules of thumb are useful for situations approximated by classical mechanics under the standard assumptions of astrodynamics outlined below the rules the specific example discussed is of a satellite orbiting a planet , but the rules of thumb could also apply to other situations , such as orbits of small bodies around a star such as the sun kepler 's laws of planetary motion : orbits are ellipse , with the heavier body at one focus of the ellipse a special case of this is a circular orbit ( a circle is a special case of ellipse ) with the planet at the center a satellite in a low orbit ( or low part of an elliptical orbit ) moves more quickly with respect to the surface of the planet than a satellite in a higher orbit ( or a high part of an elliptical orbit ) , due to the stronger gravitational attraction closer to the planet thus one can not move from one circular orbit to another with only one brief application of thrust from a circular orbit , thrust applied in a direction opposite to the satellite 's motion changes orbit to elliptical ; the satellite will descend and reach the lowest orbital point ( the periapse ) at 180 degrees away from the firing point ; then it will ascend back thrust applied in the direction of the satellite 's motion creates an elliptical orbit with its highest point ( apoapse ) 180 degrees away from the firing point the consequences of the rules of orbital mechanics are sometimes counter-intuitive for example , if two spacecraft are in the same circular orbit and wish to dock , unless they are very close , the trailing craft can not simply fire its engines to go faster in the close proximity of large objects like stars the differences between classical mechanics and general relativity also become important the fundamental laws of astrodynamics are newton 's law of universal gravitation and newton 's laws of motion , while the fundamental mathematical tool is differential calculus kepler 's laws of planetary motion may be derived from newton 's laws , when it is assumed that the orbiting body is subject only to the gravitational force of the central attractor for spacecraft far from earth—for example those in orbits around the sun—an orbital maneuver is called a deep-space maneuver ( dsm ) however , a small fraction of the orbital inclination change can be made at the node near the periapse , by slightly angling the transfer orbit injection thrust in the direction of the desired inclination change orbital mechanics ( rocket and space technology ) java astrodynamics toolkit astrodynamics-based space traffic and event knowledge graph

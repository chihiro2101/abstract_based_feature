until the rise of spaceflight in the twentieth century , there was little distinction between orbital and celestial mechanics isaac newton published more general laws of celestial motion in the first edition of philosophiæ naturalis principia mathematica ( 1687 ) , which gave a method for finding the orbit of a body following a parabola path from three observations newton 's method of successive approximation was formalised into an analytic method by euler in 1744 , whose work was in turn generalised to elliptical and hyperbolic orbits by lambert in 1761–1777 gauss 's method was able to use just three observations ( in the form of pairs of right ascension and declination ) , to find the six orbital elements that completely describe an orbit the theory of orbit determination has subsequently been developed to the point where today it is applied in gps receivers as well as the tracking and cataloguing of newly observed minor planets the following rules of thumb are useful for situations approximated by classical mechanics under the standard assumptions of astrodynamics outlined below the rules the specific example discussed is of a satellite orbiting a planet , but the rules of thumb could also apply to other situations , such as orbits of small bodies around a star such as the sun kepler 's laws of planetary motion : orbits are ellipse , with the heavier body at one focus of the ellipse a special case of this is a circular orbit ( a circle is a special case of ellipse ) with the planet at the center thus one can not move from one circular orbit to another with only one brief application of thrust from a circular orbit , thrust applied in a direction opposite to the satellite 's motion changes orbit to elliptical ; the satellite will descend and reach the lowest orbital point ( the periapse ) at 180 degrees away from the firing point ; then it will ascend back thrust applied in the direction of the satellite 's motion creates an elliptical orbit with its highest point ( apoapse ) 180 degrees away from the firing point the consequences of the rules of orbital mechanics are sometimes counter-intuitive kepler 's laws of planetary motion , which can be mathematically derived from newton 's laws , hold strictly only in describing the motion of two gravitating bodies in the absence of non-gravitational forces ; they also describe parabolic and hyperbolic trajectories the fundamental laws of astrodynamics are newton 's law of universal gravitation and newton 's laws of motion , while the fundamental mathematical tool is differential calculus kepler 's laws of planetary motion may be derived from newton 's laws , when it is assumed that the orbiting body is subject only to the gravitational force of the central attractor conversely , at any moment in the satellite 's orbit , we can measure its position and velocity , and then use the universal variable approach to determine what its initial position and velocity would have been at the epoch in spaceflight , an orbital maneuver is the use of propulsion systems to change the orbit of a spacecraft for example , it is possible to plot an orbit from high earth orbit to mars , passing close to one of the earth 's trojan points orbital mechanics ( rocket and space technology ) java astrodynamics toolkit astrodynamics-based space traffic and event knowledge graph

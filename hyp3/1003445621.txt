until the rise of spaceflight in the twentieth century , there was little distinction between orbital and celestial mechanics johannes kepler was the first to successfully model planetary orbits to a high degree of accuracy , publishing his laws in 1605 isaac newton published more general laws of celestial motion in the first edition of philosophiæ naturalis principia mathematica ( 1687 ) , which gave a method for finding the orbit of a body following a parabola path from three observations this was used by edmund halley to establish the orbits of various comets , including that which bears his name modern orbit determination and prediction are used for operating all types of satellites and space probes , as it is necessary to know their future positions to a high degree of accuracy the following rules of thumb are useful for situations approximated by classical mechanics under the standard assumptions of astrodynamics outlined below the rules the specific example discussed is of a satellite orbiting a planet , but the rules of thumb could also apply to other situations , such as orbits of small bodies around a star such as the sun kepler 's laws of planetary motion : orbits are ellipse , with the heavier body at one focus of the ellipse from a circular orbit , thrust applied in a direction opposite to the satellite 's motion changes orbit to elliptical ; the satellite will descend and reach the lowest orbital point ( the periapse ) at 180 degrees away from the firing point ; then it will ascend back thrust applied in the direction of the satellite 's motion creates an elliptical orbit with its highest point ( apoapse ) 180 degrees away from the firing point the consequences of the rules of orbital mechanics are sometimes counter-intuitive this will change the shape of its orbit , causing it to gain altitude and actually slow down relative to the leading craft , missing the target in the close proximity of large objects like stars the differences between classical mechanics and general relativity also become important the fundamental laws of astrodynamics are newton 's law of universal gravitation and newton 's laws of motion , while the fundamental mathematical tool is differential calculus in perfect two-body motion , these orbital elements would be invariant ( just like the keplerian elements would be ) the technique to compute the effect of perturbations becomes one of finding expressions , either exact or approximate , for the functions x_0 ( t ) and v_0 ( t ) for spacecraft far from earth—for example those in orbits around the sun—an orbital maneuver is called a deep-space maneuver ( dsm ) transfer orbits are usually elliptical orbits that allow spacecraft to move from one ( usually substantially circular ) orbit to another due to newton 's third law ( equal and opposite reaction ) , any momentum gained by a spacecraft must be lost by the planet , or vice versa orbital mechanics ( rocket and space technology ) java astrodynamics toolkit astrodynamics-based space traffic and event knowledge graph

however , a small number of exact solutions exist , most notably the five orbits referred to as '' lagrange points '' , which are orbital solutions for circular orbits in the case when one body is significantly more massive the key to discovering the interplanetary transport network was the investigation of the nature of the winding paths near the earth-sun and earth-moon lagrange points he noticed that the paths leading to and from any of those points would almost always settle , for a time , on an orbit about that point there are in fact an infinite number of paths taking one to the point and away from it , and all of which require nearly zero change in energy to reach when plotted , they form a tube with the orbit about the lagrange point at one end hiten , japan 's first lunar probe , was moved into lunar orbit using similar insight into the nature of paths between the earth and the moon this turned out to be useful , as many of these paths lead to some interesting points in space , such as the earth 's moon or between the galilean moons of jupiter as a result , for the cost of reaching the earth–sun point , which is rather low energy value , one can travel to a number of very interesting points for a little or no additional fuel cost statistical theory of interior–exterior transition and collision probabilities for minor bodies in the solar system , libration point orbits and applications ( eds for any two bodies in which one body orbits around the other , such as a star/planet or planet/moon system , there are five such points , denoted through there is , however , a semi-stable orbit around each of these points , called a halo orbit the spacecraft was able to maneuver around the earth 's neighborhood using little fuel by taking advantage of the unique gravity environment in a more recent example , the chinese spacecraft chang ' e 2 used the itn to travel from lunar orbit to the earth-sun point , then on to fly by the asteroid 4179 toutatis

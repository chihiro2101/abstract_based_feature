interplanetary transfer orbits are solutions to the gravitational three-body problem , which , for the general case , does not have analytical solutions , and is addressed by numerical analysis approximations however , a small number of exact solutions exist , most notably the five orbits referred to as '' lagrange points '' , which are orbital solutions for circular orbits in the case when one body is significantly more massive the key to discovering the interplanetary transport network was the investigation of the nature of the winding paths near the earth-sun and earth-moon lagrange points he noticed that the paths leading to and from any of those points would almost always settle , for a time , on an orbit about that point there are in fact an infinite number of paths taking one to the point and away from it , and all of which require nearly zero change in energy to reach when plotted , they form a tube with the orbit about the lagrange point at one end hiten , japan 's first lunar probe , was moved into lunar orbit using similar insight into the nature of paths between the earth and the moon this turned out to be useful , as many of these paths lead to some interesting points in space , such as the earth 's moon or between the galilean moons of jupiter but the trip from earth to mars or other distant locations would likely take thousands of years the transfers are so low-energy that they make travel to almost any point in the solar system possible although the forces balance at these points , the first three points ( the ones on the line between a certain large mass , e.g the first low energy transfer using what would later be called the itn was the rescue of japan 's hiten lunar mission in 1991 '' the interplanetary transport network '' by shane d

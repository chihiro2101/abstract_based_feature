interplanetary transfer orbits are solutions to the gravitational three-body problem , which , for the general case , does not have analytical solutions , and is addressed by numerical analysis approximations however , a small number of exact solutions exist , most notably the five orbits referred to as '' lagrange points '' , which are orbital solutions for circular orbits in the case when one body is significantly more massive the key to discovering the interplanetary transport network was the investigation of the nature of the winding paths near the earth-sun and earth-moon lagrange points he noticed that the paths leading to and from any of those points would almost always settle , for a time , on an orbit about that point when plotted , they form a tube with the orbit about the lagrange point at one end hiten , japan 's first lunar probe , was moved into lunar orbit using similar insight into the nature of paths between the earth and the moon this makes sense , since the orbit is unstable , which implies one will eventually end up on one of the outbound paths after spending no energy at all as a result , for the cost of reaching the earth–sun point , which is rather low energy value , one can travel to a number of very interesting points for a little or no additional fuel cost the network is also relevant to understanding solar system dynamics ; belbruno , e for instance , the earth–moon point lies on a line between the two , where gravitational forces between them exactly balance with the centrifugal force of an object placed in orbit there launched in 1978 , the isee-3 spacecraft was sent on a mission to orbit around one of the lagrange points another example of the use of the itn was nasa 's 2001–2003 genesis mission , which orbited the sun–earth point for over two years collecting material , before being redirected to the lagrange point , and finally redirected from there back to earth in a more recent example , the chinese spacecraft chang ' e 2 used the itn to travel from lunar orbit to the earth-sun point , then on to fly by the asteroid 4179 toutatis

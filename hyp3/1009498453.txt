interplanetary transfer orbits are solutions to the gravitational three-body problem , which , for the general case , does not have analytical solutions , and is addressed by numerical analysis approximations however , a small number of exact solutions exist , most notably the five orbits referred to as '' lagrange points '' , which are orbital solutions for circular orbits in the case when one body is significantly more massive the key to discovering the interplanetary transport network was the investigation of the nature of the winding paths near the earth-sun and earth-moon lagrange points he noticed that the paths leading to and from any of those points would almost always settle , for a time , on an orbit about that point when plotted , they form a tube with the orbit about the lagrange point at one end hiten , japan 's first lunar probe , was moved into lunar orbit using similar insight into the nature of paths between the earth and the moon as it turns out , it is very easy to transit from a path leading to the point to one leading back out this turned out to be useful , as many of these paths lead to some interesting points in space , such as the earth 's moon or between the galilean moons of jupiter nevertheless , they have already been used to transfer spacecraft to the earth–sun point , a useful point for studying the sun that was employed in a number of recent missions , including the genesis mission , the first to return solar wind samples to earth for instance , the earth–moon point lies on a line between the two , where gravitational forces between them exactly balance with the centrifugal force of an object placed in orbit there for example , the gravity environment of the sun–earth–moon system allows spacecraft to travel great distances on very little fuel , albeit on an often circuitous route launched in 1978 , the isee-3 spacecraft was sent on a mission to orbit around one of the lagrange points in a more recent example , the chinese spacecraft chang ' e 2 used the itn to travel from lunar orbit to the earth-sun point , then on to fly by the asteroid 4179 toutatis

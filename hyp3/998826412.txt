as transoceanic trade and exploration increased , hydrographic surveys started to be carried out as an exercise in their own right , and the commissioning of surveys was increasingly done by governments and special hydrographic offices thus were born dedicated national hydrographic organizations for the collection , organization , publication and distribution of hydrography incorporated into charts and sailing directions large-scale hydrography is usually undertaken by national or international organizations which sponsor data collection through precise surveys and publish charts and descriptive material for navigational purposes in many respects the data are interchangeable , but marine hydrographic data will be particularly directed toward marine navigation and safety of that navigation for example , hydrographic charts are designed to portray what is safe for navigation , and therefore will usually tend to maintain least depths and occasionally de-emphasize the actual submarine topography that would be portrayed on bathymetric charts & nbsp ; 2003â€“2005 have led to a narrowing of this difference , with many more hydrographic office maintaining '' best observed '' databases , and then making navigationally '' safe '' products as required even though , in places , hydrographic survey data may be collected in sufficient detail to portray bottom topography in some areas , hydrographic charts only show depth information relevant for safe navigation and should not be considered as a product that accurately portrays the actual shape of the bottom the soundings selected from the raw source depth data for placement on the nautical chart are selected for safe navigation and are biased to show predominately the shallowest depths that relate to safe navigation the hydrographic chart will use the best data available and will caveat its nature in a caution note or in the legend of the chart historically , this could include echo sounding being conducted under settings biased toward least depths , but in modern practice hydrographic surveys typically attempt to best measure the depths observed , with the adjustments for navigational safety being applied after the fact the united kingdom hydrographic office is one of the oldest , supplying a wide range of charts covering the globe to other countries , allied military organisations and the public

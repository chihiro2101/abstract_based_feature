in 1979 , network time synchronization technology was used in what was possibly the first public demonstration of internet services running over a trans-atlantic satellite network , at the national computer conference in new york the technology was later described in the 1981 internet engineering note ( ien ) 173 and a public protocol was developed from it that was documented in the technology was first deployed in a local area network as part of the hello routing protocol and implemented in the fuzzball router , an experimental operating system used in network prototyping , where it ran for many years they include the daytime and time protocols for recording the time of events , as well as the icmp timestamp and ip timestamp option despite the relatively slow computers and networks available at the time , accuracy of better than 100 milliseconds was usually obtained on atlantic spanning links , with accuracy of tens of milliseconds on ethernet networks it drew on the experimental results and clock filter algorithm documented in and was the first version to describe the client-server and peer-to-peer modes in 1989 , was published defining ntpv2 by means of a state machine , with pseudocode to describe its operation it introduced a management protocol and digital signature scheme which have both survived into ntpv4 , along with the bulk of the algorithm however the design of ntpv2 was criticized for lacking formal correctness by the dtss community , and the clock selection procedure was modified to incorporate marzullo 's algorithm for ntpv3 onwards ntp uses a hierarchical , semi-layered system of time sources stratum is not always an indication of quality or reliability ; it is common to find stratum 3 time sources that are higher quality than other stratum 2 time sources 21 ; stratum 1 : these are computers whose system time is synchronized to within a few microseconds of their attached stratum 0 devices they are also referred to as primary time servers stratum 2 computers may also peer with other stratum 2 computers to provide more stable and robust time for all devices in the peer group in addition to stratum , the protocol is able to identify the synchronization source for each server in terms of reference identifier ( refid ) the ntp reference implementation , along with the protocol , has been continuously developed for over 20 years simple network time protocol ( sntp ) is a less complex implementation of ntp , using the same protocol but without requiring the storage of state over extended periods of time if higher accuracy is desired , microsoft recommends using a newer version of windows or different ntp implementation although the ntp clock is actually halted during the event , because of the requirement that time must appear to be monotonically increasing , any processes that query the system time cause it to increase by a tiny amount , preserving the order of events apple was concerned enough about this vulerability that it used its auto-update capability for the first time systems that do not use the root daemon , such as bsd , are not subject to this flaw

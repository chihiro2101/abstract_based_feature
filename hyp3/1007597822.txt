in 1979 , network time synchronization technology was used in what was possibly the first public demonstration of internet services running over a trans-atlantic satellite network , at the national computer conference in new york the technology was later described in the 1981 internet engineering note ( ien ) 173 and a public protocol was developed from it that was documented in they include the daytime and time protocols for recording the time of events , as well as the icmp timestamp and ip timestamp option in 1985 , ntp version 0 ( ntpv0 ) was implemented in both fuzzball and unix , and the ntp packet header and round-trip delay and offset calculations , which have persisted into ntpv4 , were documented in in 1988 , a much more complete specification of the ntpv1 protocol , with associated algorithms , was published in it drew on the experimental results and clock filter algorithm documented in and was the first version to describe the client-server and peer-to-peer modes in 1991 , the ntpv1 architecture , protocol and algorithms were brought to the attention of a wider engineering community with the publication of an article by david l in subsequent years , as new features were added and algorithm improvements were made , it became apparent that a new protocol version was required stratum is not always an indication of quality or reliability ; it is common to find stratum 3 time sources that are higher quality than other stratum 2 time sources ntp servers can not advertise themselves as stratum 0 21 ; stratum 1 : these are computers whose system time is synchronized to within a few microseconds of their attached stratum 0 devices ; stratum 2 : these are computers that are synchronized over a network to stratum 1 servers often a stratum 2 computer queries several stratum 1 servers stratum 2 computers may also peer with other stratum 2 computers to provide more stable and robust time for all devices in the peer group the upper limit for stratum is 15 ; stratum 16 is used to indicate that a device is unsynchronized in addition to stratum , the protocol is able to identify the synchronization source for each server in terms of reference identifier ( refid ) outliers are discarded and an estimate of time offset is derived from the best three remaining candidates simple network time protocol ( sntp ) is a less complex implementation of ntp , using the same protocol but without requiring the storage of state over extended periods of time windows 10 and windows server 2016 support 1 & nbsp ; ms time accuracy under certain operating conditions whilst it is aimed more closely at the simpler generic needs of openbsd users , it also includes some protocol security improvements while still being compatible with existing ntp servers only a few other security problems have been identified in the reference implementation of the ntp codebase , but those that appeared in 2009 were cause for significant concern

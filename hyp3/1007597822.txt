in 1979 , network time synchronization technology was used in what was possibly the first public demonstration of internet services running over a trans-atlantic satellite network , at the national computer conference in new york the technology was later described in the 1981 internet engineering note ( ien ) 173 and a public protocol was developed from it that was documented in the technology was first deployed in a local area network as part of the hello routing protocol and implemented in the fuzzball router , an experimental operating system used in network prototyping , where it ran for many years they include the daytime and time protocols for recording the time of events , as well as the icmp timestamp and ip timestamp option in 1985 , ntp version 0 ( ntpv0 ) was implemented in both fuzzball and unix , and the ntp packet header and round-trip delay and offset calculations , which have persisted into ntpv4 , were documented in despite the relatively slow computers and networks available at the time , accuracy of better than 100 milliseconds was usually obtained on atlantic spanning links , with accuracy of tens of milliseconds on ethernet networks it drew on the experimental results and clock filter algorithm documented in and was the first version to describe the client-server and peer-to-peer modes in 1991 , the ntpv1 architecture , protocol and algorithms were brought to the attention of a wider engineering community with the publication of an article by david l ntp uses a hierarchical , semi-layered system of time sources stratum is not always an indication of quality or reliability ; it is common to find stratum 3 time sources that are higher quality than other stratum 2 time sources ntp servers can not advertise themselves as stratum 0 a stratum field set to 0 in ntp packet indicates an unspecified stratum 21 ; stratum 1 : these are computers whose system time is synchronized to within a few microseconds of their attached stratum 0 devices ; stratum 2 : these are computers that are synchronized over a network to stratum 1 servers stratum 2 computers may also peer with other stratum 2 computers to provide more stable and robust time for all devices in the peer group simple network time protocol ( sntp ) is a less complex implementation of ntp , using the same protocol but without requiring the storage of state over extended periods of time all microsoft windows versions since windows 2000 include the windows time service ( w32time ) , which has the ability to synchronize the computer clock to an ntp server a new ntp client , ntimed , was started by poul-henning kamp in 2014 the new implementation is sponsored by the linux foundation as a replacement for the reference implementation , as it was determined to be easier to write a new implementation from scratch than to reduce the size of the reference implementation only a few other security problems have been identified in the reference implementation of the ntp codebase , but those that appeared in 2009 were cause for significant concern ntp message spoofing from a man-in-the-middle attack can be used to move clocks on client computers and allow a number of attacks based on bypassing of cryptographic key expiration

in 1979 , network time synchronization technology was used in what was possibly the first public demonstration of internet services running over a trans-atlantic satellite network , at the national computer conference in new york the technology was first deployed in a local area network as part of the hello routing protocol and implemented in the fuzzball router , an experimental operating system used in network prototyping , where it ran for many years they include the daytime and time protocols for recording the time of events , as well as the icmp timestamp and ip timestamp option in 1985 , ntp version 0 ( ntpv0 ) was implemented in both fuzzball and unix , and the ntp packet header and round-trip delay and offset calculations , which have persisted into ntpv4 , were documented in despite the relatively slow computers and networks available at the time , accuracy of better than 100 milliseconds was usually obtained on atlantic spanning links , with accuracy of tens of milliseconds on ethernet networks it drew on the experimental results and clock filter algorithm documented in and was the first version to describe the client-server and peer-to-peer modes ntp uses a hierarchical , semi-layered system of time sources each level of this hierarchy is termed a stratum and is assigned a number starting with zero for the reference clock at the top a server synchronized to a stratum n server runs at stratum n + 1 stratum is not always an indication of quality or reliability ; it is common to find stratum 3 time sources that are higher quality than other stratum 2 time sources they generate a very accurate pulse per second signal that triggers an interrupt and timestamp on a connected computer stratum 0 devices are also known as reference clocks 21 ; stratum 1 : these are computers whose system time is synchronized to within a few microseconds of their attached stratum 0 devices stratum 1 servers may peer with other stratum 1 servers for sanity check and backup stratum 2 computers may also peer with other stratum 2 computers to provide more stable and robust time for all devices in the peer group ; stratum 3 : these are computers that are synchronized to stratum 2 servers they employ the same algorithms for peering and data sampling as stratum 2 , and can themselves act as servers for stratum 4 computers , and so on all microsoft windows versions since windows 2000 include the windows time service ( w32time ) , which has the ability to synchronize the computer clock to an ntp server if higher accuracy is desired , microsoft recommends using a newer version of windows or different ntp implementation windows 10 and windows server 2016 support 1 & nbsp ; ms time accuracy under certain operating conditions the new implementation is sponsored by the linux foundation as a replacement for the reference implementation , as it was determined to be easier to write a new implementation from scratch than to reduce the size of the reference implementation

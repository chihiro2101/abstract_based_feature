the technology was later described in the 1981 internet engineering note ( ien ) 173 and a public protocol was developed from it that was documented in they include the daytime and time protocols for recording the time of events , as well as the icmp timestamp and ip timestamp option in 1985 , ntp version 0 ( ntpv0 ) was implemented in both fuzzball and unix , and the ntp packet header and round-trip delay and offset calculations , which have persisted into ntpv4 , were documented in in 1988 , a much more complete specification of the ntpv1 protocol , with associated algorithms , was published in it drew on the experimental results and clock filter algorithm documented in and was the first version to describe the client-server and peer-to-peer modes following the retirement of mills from the university of delaware , the reference implementation is currently maintained as an open source project led by harlan stenn a server synchronized to a stratum n server runs at stratum n + 1 they generate a very accurate pulse per second signal that triggers an interrupt and timestamp on a connected computer stratum 0 devices are also known as reference clocks a stratum field set to 0 in ntp packet indicates an unspecified stratum 21 ; stratum 1 : these are computers whose system time is synchronized to within a few microseconds of their attached stratum 0 devices stratum 1 servers may peer with other stratum 1 servers for sanity check and backup ; stratum 2 : these are computers that are synchronized over a network to stratum 1 servers often a stratum 2 computer queries several stratum 1 servers stratum 2 computers may also peer with other stratum 2 computers to provide more stable and robust time for all devices in the peer group ; stratum 3 : these are computers that are synchronized to stratum 2 servers the upper limit for stratum is 15 ; stratum 16 is used to indicate that a device is unsynchronized accurate synchronization is achieved when both the incoming and outgoing routes between the client and the server have symmetrical nominal delay the ntp reference implementation , along with the protocol , has been continuously developed for over 20 years the new implementation is sponsored by the linux foundation as a replacement for the reference implementation , as it was determined to be easier to write a new implementation from scratch than to reduce the size of the reference implementation the codebase for the reference implementation has undergone security audits from several sources for several years

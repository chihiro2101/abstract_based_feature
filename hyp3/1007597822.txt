in 1979 , network time synchronization technology was used in what was possibly the first public demonstration of internet services running over a trans-atlantic satellite network , at the national computer conference in new york the technology was later described in the 1981 internet engineering note ( ien ) 173 and a public protocol was developed from it that was documented in the technology was first deployed in a local area network as part of the hello routing protocol and implemented in the fuzzball router , an experimental operating system used in network prototyping , where it ran for many years they include the daytime and time protocols for recording the time of events , as well as the icmp timestamp and ip timestamp option in 1985 , ntp version 0 ( ntpv0 ) was implemented in both fuzzball and unix , and the ntp packet header and round-trip delay and offset calculations , which have persisted into ntpv4 , were documented in despite the relatively slow computers and networks available at the time , accuracy of better than 100 milliseconds was usually obtained on atlantic spanning links , with accuracy of tens of milliseconds on ethernet networks it drew on the experimental results and clock filter algorithm documented in and was the first version to describe the client-server and peer-to-peer modes it introduced a management protocol and digital signature scheme which have both survived into ntpv4 , along with the bulk of the algorithm in subsequent years , as new features were added and algorithm improvements were made , it became apparent that a new protocol version was required ntp uses a hierarchical , semi-layered system of time sources a server synchronized to a stratum n server runs at stratum n + 1 stratum is not always an indication of quality or reliability ; it is common to find stratum 3 time sources that are higher quality than other stratum 2 time sources 21 ; stratum 1 : these are computers whose system time is synchronized to within a few microseconds of their attached stratum 0 devices ; stratum 2 : these are computers that are synchronized over a network to stratum 1 servers the ntp algorithms on each computer interact to construct a bellman-ford shortest-path spanning tree , to minimize the accumulated round-trip delay to the stratum 1 servers for all the clients in addition to stratum , the protocol is able to identify the synchronization source for each server in terms of reference identifier ( refid ) the version in windows 2000 and windows xp only implements sntp , and violates several aspects of the ntp version 3 standard beginning with windows server 2003 and windows vista , a compliant implementation of ntp is included if higher accuracy is desired , microsoft recommends using a newer version of windows or different ntp implementation windows 10 and windows server 2016 support 1 & nbsp ; ms time accuracy under certain operating conditions although the ntp clock is actually halted during the event , because of the requirement that time must appear to be monotonically increasing , any processes that query the system time cause it to increase by a tiny amount , preserving the order of events

the exact time or date of titian 's birth is uncertain when he was an old man he claimed in a letter to philip ii of spain , to have been born in 1474 , but this seems most unlikely cecil gould , the sixteenth century italian schools , national gallery catalogues , p 265 , london , 1975 , other writers contemporary to his old age give figures that would equate to birthdates between 1473 and after 1482 most modern scholars believe a date between 1488 and 1490 is more likely , hale , 5-6 ; also see references above though his age at death being 99 had been accepted into the 20th century david jaffé ( ed ) , titian , the national gallery company/yale , p many relatives , including titian 's grandfather , were notaries , and the family were well-established in the area , which was ruled by venice at the age of about ten to twelve he and his brother francesco ( who perhaps followed later ) were sent to an uncle in venice to find an apprenticeship with a painter at that time the bellinis , especially giovanni , were the leading artists in the city there titian found a group of young men about his own age , among them giovanni palma da serinalta , lorenzo lotto , sebastiano luciani , and giorgio da castelfranco , nicknamed giorgione francesco vecellio , titian 's older brother , later became a painter of some note in venice a fresco of hercules on the morosini palace is said to have been one of titian 's earliest works a substantial number of attributions have moved from giorgione to titian in the 20th century , with little traffic the other way in 1507–1508 giorgione was commissioned by the state to create frescoes on the re-erected fondaco dei tedeschi in return , he was bound to paint likenesses of the successive doges of his time at the fixed price of eight crowns each giorgione died in 1510 and giovanni bellini in 1516 , leaving titian unrivaled in the venetian school in 1516 , he completed his famous masterpiece , the assumption of the virgin , for the high altar of the santa maria gloriosa dei frari , where it is still in situ 14 the signoria took note and observed that titian was neglecting his work in the hall of the great council , but in 1516 he succeeded his master giovanni bellini in receiving a pension from the senate this is perhaps his most studied work , whose patiently developed plan is set forth with supreme display of order and freedom , originality and style here titian gave a new conception of the traditional groups of donors and holy persons moving in aerial space , the plans and different degrees set in an architectural framework charles hope in jaffé , pp 100–111 '' perhaps the most brilliant productions of the neo-pagan culture or '' alexandrianism '' of the renaissance , many times imitated but never surpassed even by rubens himself titian 's skill with colour is exemplified by his danaë , one of several mythological paintings , or '' poesie '' ( '' poems '' ) as the painter called them this painting was done for alessandro farnese , but a later variant was produced for philip ii , for whom titian painted many of his most important mythological paintings although michelangelo adjudged this piece deficient from the point of view of drawing , titian and his studio produced several versions for other patrons during the next period ( 1530–1550 ) , titian developed the style introduced by his dramatic death of st however , at the end of a year pordenone died , and titian , who meanwhile applied himself diligently to painting in the hall the battle of cadore , was reinstated but this period of the master 's work is still represented by the presentation of the blessed virgin ( venice , 1539 ) , one of his most popular canvasses , and by the ecce homo ( vienna , 1541 ) they were nevertheless much admired and imitated , rubens among others applying this system to his forty ceilings ( the sketches only remain ) of the jesuit church at antwerp from the beginning of his career , titian was a masterful portrait-painter , in works like la bella ( eleanora de gonzaga , duchess of urbino , at the pitti palace ) he painted the likenesses of princes , or doges , cardinals or monks , and artists or writers '' titian '' , the catholic encyclopedia among portrait-painters titian is compared to rembrandt and velázquez , with the interior life of the former , and the clearness , certainty , and obviousness of the latter in 1532 , after painting a portrait of the emperor charles v in bologna , he was made a count palatine and knight of the golden spur in 1540 he received a pension from d'avalos , marquis del vasto , and an annuity of 200 crowns ( which was afterwards doubled ) from charles v from the treasury of milan he visited rome in 1546 and obtained the freedom of the city—his immediate predecessor in that honor having been michelangelo in 1537 this caused problems of attribution and priority among versions of his works—which were also widely copied and faked outside his studio during his lifetime and afterwards for philip ii , he painted a series of large mythological paintings known as the '' poesie '' , mostly from ovid , which scholars regard as among his greatest works penny , 204 thanks to the prudishness of philip 's successors , these were later mostly given as gifts , and only two remain in the prado the '' poesie '' series contained the following works : danaë , sent to philip in 1553 , museo del prado , catálogo de las pinturas , 1996 , p 231–3 , 1983 , royal academy of arts , london another violent masterpiece is tarquin and lucretia ( cambridge , fitzwilliam museum ) he even attempted problems of chiaroscuro in fantastic night effects ( martyrdom of st laurence , church of the jesuits , venice ; st jerome , louvre ; crucifixion , church of san domenico , ancona ) in september 1565 titian went to cadore and designed the decorations for the church at pieve , partly executed by his pupils titian remarried , but little information is known about his second wife ; she was possibly the mother of his daughter lavinia his brother cesare , who also left some pictures , is well known by his book of engraved costumes , abiti antichi e moderni one of these , diana and actaeon , was purchased by london 's national gallery and the national galleries of scotland on 2 february 2009 for £50 & nbsp ; million ) ,

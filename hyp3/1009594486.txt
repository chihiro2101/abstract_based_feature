the exact time or date of titian 's birth is uncertain cecil gould , the sixteenth century italian schools , national gallery catalogues , p 265 , london , 1975 , other writers contemporary to his old age give figures that would equate to birthdates between 1473 and after 1482 he was the son of gregorio vecellio and his wife lucia , of whom little is known david jaffé ( ed ) , titian , the national gallery company/yale , p 11 , london 2003 , gregorio was also a distinguished councilor and soldier at the age of about ten to twelve he and his brother francesco ( who perhaps followed later ) were sent to an uncle in venice to find an apprenticeship with a painter the minor painter sebastian zuccato , whose sons became well-known mosaicists , and who may have been a family friend , arranged for the brothers to enter the studio of the elderly gentile bellini , from which they later transferred to that of his brother giovanni bellini at that time the bellinis , especially giovanni , were the leading artists in the city there titian found a group of young men about his own age , among them giovanni palma da serinalta , lorenzo lotto , sebastiano luciani , and giorgio da castelfranco , nicknamed giorgione francesco vecellio , titian 's older brother , later became a painter of some note in venice a fresco of hercules on the morosini palace is said to have been one of titian 's earliest works distinguishing between their work at this period remains a subject of scholarly controversy one of the earliest known titian works , christ carrying the cross in the scuola grande di san rocco , depicting the ecce homo scene , was long regarded as by giorgione 11–14 the two young masters were likewise recognized as the leaders of their new school of arte moderna , which is characterized by paintings made more flexible , freed from symmetry and the remnants of hieratic conventions still found in the works of giovanni bellini in 1507–1508 giorgione was commissioned by the state to create frescoes on the re-erected fondaco dei tedeschi titian and morto da feltre worked along with him , and some fragments of paintings remain , probably by giorgione titian 's talent in fresco is shown in those he painted in 1511 at padua in the carmelite church and in the scuola del santo , some of which have been preserved , among them the meeting at the golden gate , and three scenes ( miracoli di sant'antonio ) from the life of st explained here he became superintendent of the government works , especially charged with completing the paintings left unfinished by giovanni bellini in the hall of the great council in the ducal palace in return , he was bound to paint likenesses of the successive doges of his time at the fixed price of eight crowns each giorgione died in 1510 and giovanni bellini in 1516 , leaving titian unrivaled in the venetian school 14 the signoria took note and observed that titian was neglecting his work in the hall of the great council , but in 1516 he succeeded his master giovanni bellini in receiving a pension from the senate he finally reached a classic formula in the pesaro madonna , better known as the madonna di ca ' pesaro ( c here titian gave a new conception of the traditional groups of donors and holy persons moving in aerial space , the plans and different degrees set in an architectural framework 16–17 titian was then at the height of his fame , and towards 1521 , following the production of a figure of st to this period belongs a more extraordinary work , the death of st this was also the period of the three large and famous mythological scenes for the camerino of alfonso d'este in ferrara , the bacchanal of the andrians and the worship of venus in the museo del prado , and the bacchus and ariadne ( 1520–23 ) in london , jaffé , pp 100–111 '' perhaps the most brilliant productions of the neo-pagan culture or '' alexandrianism '' of the renaissance , many times imitated but never surpassed even by rubens himself titian 's skill with colour is exemplified by his danaë , one of several mythological paintings , or '' poesie '' ( '' poems '' ) as the painter called them this painting was done for alessandro farnese , but a later variant was produced for philip ii , for whom titian painted many of his most important mythological paintings during the next period ( 1530–1550 ) , titian developed the style introduced by his dramatic death of st in 1538 , the venetian government , dissatisfied with titian 's neglect of his work for the ducal palace , ordered him to refund the money he had received , and il pordenone , his rival of recent years , was installed in his place it depicted in life-size the moment when the venetian general d'alviano attacked the enemy , with horses and men crashing down into a stream it was titian 's most important attempt at a tumultuous and heroic scene of movement to rival raphael 's battle of constantine , michelangelo 's equally ill-fated battle of cascina , and leonardo da vinci 's the battle of anghiari ( these last two unfinished ) less successful were the pendentives of the cupola at santa maria della salute ( death of abel , sacrifice of abraham , david and goliath ) they were nevertheless much admired and imitated , rubens among others applying this system to his forty ceilings ( the sketches only remain ) of the jesuit church at antwerp giorgione had already dealt with the subject in his dresden picture , finished by titian , but here a purple drapery substituted for a landscape background changed , by its harmonious colouring , the whole meaning of the scene this state portrait of charles v ( 1548 ) at the battle of mühlberg established a new genre , that of the grand equestrian portrait in 1540 he received a pension from d'avalos , marquis del vasto , and an annuity of 200 crowns ( which was afterwards doubled ) from charles v from the treasury of milan titian had a favorite villa on the neighboring manza hill ( in front of the church of castello roganzuolo ) from which ( it may be inferred ) he made his chief observations of landscape form and effect heath , life of titian , p during the last twenty-six years of his life ( 1550–1576 ) , titian worked mainly for philip ii and as a portrait-painter he became more self-critical , an insatiable perfectionist , keeping some pictures in his studio for ten years—returning to them and retouching them , constantly adding new expressions at once more refined , concise , and subtle he also finished many copies that his pupils made of his earlier works this caused problems of attribution and priority among versions of his works—which were also widely copied and faked outside his studio during his lifetime and afterwards in the period 1517–1520 he designed a number of woodcuts , including an enormous and impressive one of the crossing of the red sea , intended as wall decoration in substitute for paintings ; schmidt , suzanne karr this was a noteworthy performance , of which titian ( the usual story ) became jealous ; so francesco was diverted from painting to soldiering , and afterwards to mercantile life , titian 's touch :

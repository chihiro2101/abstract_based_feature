the afrikaans name drakensberge comes from the name the earliest dutch settlers gave to the escarpment , namely drakensbergen , or dragons ' mountains the highest portion of the great escarpment is known in zulu as ukhahlamba and as maluti in sotho ( '' barrier of up-pointed spears '' ) about 180 million years ago , a mantle plume under southern gondwana caused bulging of the continental crust in the area that would later become southern africa consequently , a thick layer of marine sediment was deposited onto the continental shelf ( the lower steps of the original rift valley walls ) that surrounds the subcontinent the plateau is tilted such that its highest point is in the east , and it slopes gently downward toward the west and south it reaches its highest point ( above where the escarpment forms part of the international border between lesotho and the south african province of kwazulu-natal the upliftment of the central plateau over the past 20 & nbsp ; million years and erosion resulted in the original escarpment being moved inland , creating the present-day coastal plain the position of the present escarpment is approximately inland from the original fault lines that formed the walls of the rift valley that developed along the coast during the break-up of gondwana these rocks form the steep sides of the great escarpment in this region , where its upper edge reaches an elevation in excess of the erosional retreat of the escarpment from the coast to its present position , means that the rocks of the coastal plain are , with very few and small exceptions , older than those that cap the top of the escarpment thus the rocks of the mpumalanga veld below the mpumalanga portion of the great escarpment are more than 3000 & nbsp ; million years old the entire eastern portion of the great escarpment ( see the accompanying map ) constitutes the drakensberg the lower limpopo river and save river drain into the indian ocean through what remains of this relict incipient rift valley that now forms part of the south african low veld who first gave these mountains their afrikaans or dutch name drakensberg , and why , is unknown the kwazulu-natal – free state drakensberg are composed of softer rocks and therefore have a more rounded , softer appearance from below south of the 26°s parallel the drakensberg escarpment is composed of ecca group , which belong to the karoo supergroup , and they are 300 million years old the portion of the drakensberg that forms the kwazulu-natal – free state border is formed by slightly younger beaufort group ( 250 & nbsp ; million years old ) that also are part of the karoo supergroup the ecca and beaufort groups are composed of sedimentary rocks that are less erosion resistant than the other rocks that make up the drakensberg escarpment therefore , this portion of escarpment is not so impressive as the mpumalanga and lesotho stretches of the drakensberg the drakensberg area is '' home to 299 recorded bird species '' ' making up '' 37 % of all non-marine avian species in southern africa '' '' the site also indicates that '' the rock art of the drakensberg is the largest and most concentrated group of rock paintings in africa south of the sahara , and is outstanding both in quality and diversity of subject

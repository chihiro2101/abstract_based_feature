the afrikaans name drakensberge comes from the name the earliest dutch settlers gave to the escarpment , namely drakensbergen , or dragons ' mountains the highest portion of the great escarpment is known in zulu as ukhahlamba and as maluti in sotho ( '' barrier of up-pointed spears '' ) about 180 million years ago , a mantle plume under southern gondwana caused bulging of the continental crust in the area that would later become southern africa during the past 20 million years , further massive upliftment , especially in the east , has taken place in southern africa it reaches its highest point ( above where the escarpment forms part of the international border between lesotho and the south african province of kwazulu-natal the upliftment of the central plateau over the past 20 & nbsp ; million years and erosion resulted in the original escarpment being moved inland , creating the present-day coastal plain these rocks form the steep sides of the great escarpment in this region , where its upper edge reaches an elevation in excess of the erosional retreat of the escarpment from the coast to its present position , means that the rocks of the coastal plain are , with very few and small exceptions , older than those that cap the top of the escarpment thus the rocks of the mpumalanga veld below the mpumalanga portion of the great escarpment are more than 3000 & nbsp ; million years old in the main , the rocks of the kwazulu-natal midlands belong to the beaufort and ecca groups ( of the karoo supergroup ) , aged 220–310 & nbsp ; million years , and are therefore considerably older than the drakensberg lavas ( aged 180 & nbsp ; million years ) that cap the escarpment on the border between kwazulu-natal and lesotho the entire eastern portion of the great escarpment ( see the accompanying map ) constitutes the drakensberg the lower limpopo river and save river drain into the indian ocean through what remains of this relict incipient rift valley that now forms part of the south african low veld the '' lesotho mountains '' are formed away from the drakensberg escarpment by erosion gulleys which turn into deep valleys which contain tributaries of the orange river knight and grab mapped out the distribution of lightning strikes in the drakensburg and discovered that lightning significantly controls the evolution of the mountain landscapes because it helps to shape the summit areas – the highest areas – with this blasting effect south of the 26°s parallel the drakensberg escarpment is composed of ecca group , which belong to the karoo supergroup , and they are 300 million years old the portion of the drakensberg that forms the kwazulu-natal – free state border is formed by slightly younger beaufort group ( 250 & nbsp ; million years old ) that also are part of the karoo supergroup the ecca and beaufort groups are composed of sedimentary rocks that are less erosion resistant than the other rocks that make up the drakensberg escarpment therefore , this portion of escarpment is not so impressive as the mpumalanga and lesotho stretches of the drakensberg north of lesotho the range becomes lower and less rugged until entering mpumalanga where the quartzite mountains of the transvaal drakensberg are loftier and more broken and they form the eastern rim of the transvaal basin , the blyde river canyon lying within this stretch the grassy lower slopes ( from of the drakensberg in swaziland , south africa and lesotho constitute the drakensberg montane grasslands , woodlands , and forests ecoregion '' the site also indicates that '' the rock art of the drakensberg is the largest and most concentrated group of rock paintings in africa south of the sahara , and is outstanding both in quality and diversity of subject

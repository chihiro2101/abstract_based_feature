about 180 million years ago , a mantle plume under southern gondwana caused bulging of the continental crust in the area that would later become southern africa within 10–20 & nbsp ; million years rift valleys formed on either side of the central bulge , which became flooded to become the proto-atlantic and proto-indian oceans consequently , a thick layer of marine sediment was deposited onto the continental shelf ( the lower steps of the original rift valley walls ) that surrounds the subcontinent it reaches its highest point ( above where the escarpment forms part of the international border between lesotho and the south african province of kwazulu-natal the upliftment of the central plateau over the past 20 & nbsp ; million years and erosion resulted in the original escarpment being moved inland , creating the present-day coastal plain the position of the present escarpment is approximately inland from the original fault lines that formed the walls of the rift valley that developed along the coast during the break-up of gondwana the rate of the erosion of the escarpment in the drakensberg region is said to average per 1000 & nbsp ; years , or per year because of the extensive erosion of the plateau , which occurred throughout most of the mesozoic and cenozoic eras , none of its surface rocks ( except the kalahari sands ) are younger than 180 & nbsp ; million years these are the clarens formation laid down under desert conditions about 200 & nbsp ; million years ago , topped by a thick layer of lava which erupted , and covered most of southern africa , and large parts of gondwana , about 180 million years ago the erosional retreat of the escarpment from the coast to its present position , means that the rocks of the coastal plain are , with very few and small exceptions , older than those that cap the top of the escarpment thus the rocks of the mpumalanga veld below the mpumalanga portion of the great escarpment are more than 3000 & nbsp ; million years old the absence of the great escarpment for approximately to the north of tzaneen ( to reappear on the border between zimbabwe and mozambique in the chimanimani mountains ) is due to a failed westerly branch of the main rift that caused antarctica to start drifting away from southern africa during the breakup of gondwana about 150 million years ago the '' lesotho mountains '' are formed away from the drakensberg escarpment by erosion gulleys which turn into deep valleys which contain tributaries of the orange river south of the 26°s parallel the drakensberg escarpment is composed of ecca group , which belong to the karoo supergroup , and they are 300 million years old the portion of the drakensberg that forms the kwazulu-natal – free state border is formed by slightly younger beaufort group ( 250 & nbsp ; million years old ) that also are part of the karoo supergroup therefore , this portion of escarpment is not so impressive as the mpumalanga and lesotho stretches of the drakensberg the drakensberg that form the northeastern and eastern borders of lesotho , as well as the eastern cape drakensberg , are composed of a thick layer of basalt ( lava ) that erupted 180 million years ago the grassy lower slopes ( from of the drakensberg in swaziland , south africa and lesotho constitute the drakensberg montane grasslands , woodlands , and forests ecoregion fish are found in the many rivers and streams , including the maluti redfin ( pseudobarbus quathlambae ) that was thought to be extinct before being found in the senqunyane river in lesotho this portion of the drakensberg has between 35,000 and 40,000 works of san rock art , and is the largest collection of such parietal work in the world '' the site also indicates that '' the rock art of the drakensberg is the largest and most concentrated group of rock paintings in africa south of the sahara , and is outstanding both in quality and diversity of subject

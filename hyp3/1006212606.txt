the afrikaans name drakensberge comes from the name the earliest dutch settlers gave to the escarpment , namely drakensbergen , or dragons ' mountains the highest portion of the great escarpment is known in zulu as ukhahlamba and as maluti in sotho ( '' barrier of up-pointed spears '' ) about 180 million years ago , a mantle plume under southern gondwana caused bulging of the continental crust in the area that would later become southern africa within 10–20 & nbsp ; million years rift valleys formed on either side of the central bulge , which became flooded to become the proto-atlantic and proto-indian oceans the plateau is tilted such that its highest point is in the east , and it slopes gently downward toward the west and south it reaches its highest point ( above where the escarpment forms part of the international border between lesotho and the south african province of kwazulu-natal the upliftment of the central plateau over the past 20 & nbsp ; million years and erosion resulted in the original escarpment being moved inland , creating the present-day coastal plain the rate of the erosion of the escarpment in the drakensberg region is said to average per 1000 & nbsp ; years , or per year these are the clarens formation laid down under desert conditions about 200 & nbsp ; million years ago , topped by a thick layer of lava which erupted , and covered most of southern africa , and large parts of gondwana , about 180 million years ago in the main , the rocks of the kwazulu-natal midlands belong to the beaufort and ecca groups ( of the karoo supergroup ) , aged 220–310 & nbsp ; million years , and are therefore considerably older than the drakensberg lavas ( aged 180 & nbsp ; million years ) that cap the escarpment on the border between kwazulu-natal and lesotho the entire eastern portion of the great escarpment ( see the accompanying map ) constitutes the drakensberg the absence of the great escarpment for approximately to the north of tzaneen ( to reappear on the border between zimbabwe and mozambique in the chimanimani mountains ) is due to a failed westerly branch of the main rift that caused antarctica to start drifting away from southern africa during the breakup of gondwana about 150 million years ago the lower limpopo river and save river drain into the indian ocean through what remains of this relict incipient rift valley that now forms part of the south african low veld the '' lesotho mountains '' are formed away from the drakensberg escarpment by erosion gulleys which turn into deep valleys which contain tributaries of the orange river the limpopo and mpumalanga drakensberg are capped by an erosion resistant quartzite layer that is part of the transvaal supergroup , which also forms the magaliesberg to the north and northwest of pretoria south of the 26°s parallel the drakensberg escarpment is composed of ecca group , which belong to the karoo supergroup , and they are 300 million years old the portion of the drakensberg that forms the kwazulu-natal – free state border is formed by slightly younger beaufort group ( 250 & nbsp ; million years old ) that also are part of the karoo supergroup the ecca and beaufort groups are composed of sedimentary rocks that are less erosion resistant than the other rocks that make up the drakensberg escarpment the drakensberg that form the northeastern and eastern borders of lesotho , as well as the eastern cape drakensberg , are composed of a thick layer of basalt ( lava ) that erupted 180 million years ago other endemic species include three frogs found in the mountain streams , drakensberg river frog ( amietia dracomontana ) , phofung river frog ( amietia vertebralis ) , and maluti river frog ( amietia umbraculata ) '' the site also indicates that '' the rock art of the drakensberg is the largest and most concentrated group of rock paintings in africa south of the sahara , and is outstanding both in quality and diversity of subject

the afrikaans name drakensberge comes from the name the earliest dutch settlers gave to the escarpment , namely drakensbergen , or dragons ' mountains the highest portion of the great escarpment is known in zulu as ukhahlamba and as maluti in sotho ( '' barrier of up-pointed spears '' ) the plateau is tilted such that its highest point is in the east , and it slopes gently downward toward the west and south typically , the elevation of the edge of the eastern escarpments is in excess of it reaches its highest point ( above where the escarpment forms part of the international border between lesotho and the south african province of kwazulu-natal the position of the present escarpment is approximately inland from the original fault lines that formed the walls of the rift valley that developed along the coast during the break-up of gondwana the rate of the erosion of the escarpment in the drakensberg region is said to average per 1000 & nbsp ; years , or per year because of the extensive erosion of the plateau , which occurred throughout most of the mesozoic and cenozoic eras , none of its surface rocks ( except the kalahari sands ) are younger than 180 & nbsp ; million years these rocks form the steep sides of the great escarpment in this region , where its upper edge reaches an elevation in excess of thus the rocks of the mpumalanga veld below the mpumalanga portion of the great escarpment are more than 3000 & nbsp ; million years old the entire eastern portion of the great escarpment ( see the accompanying map ) constitutes the drakensberg the drakensberg terminate in the north near tzaneen at about the 22° s parallel the lower limpopo river and save river drain into the indian ocean through what remains of this relict incipient rift valley that now forms part of the south african low veld the limpopo , mpumalanga , and lesotho drakensberg have hard erosion-resistant upper surfaces and therefore have a very rugged appearance , combining steep-sided blocks and pinnacles ( giving rise to the zulu name '' barrier of up-pointed spears '' ) the '' lesotho mountains '' are formed away from the drakensberg escarpment by erosion gulleys which turn into deep valleys which contain tributaries of the orange river the limpopo and mpumalanga drakensberg are capped by an erosion resistant quartzite layer that is part of the transvaal supergroup , which also forms the magaliesberg to the north and northwest of pretoria south of the 26°s parallel the drakensberg escarpment is composed of ecca group , which belong to the karoo supergroup , and they are 300 million years old the portion of the drakensberg that forms the kwazulu-natal – free state border is formed by slightly younger beaufort group ( 250 & nbsp ; million years old ) that also are part of the karoo supergroup therefore , this portion of escarpment is not so impressive as the mpumalanga and lesotho stretches of the drakensberg there are numerous caves in the easily eroded sandstone of clarens formation , the layer below the thick , hard basalt layer on the kwazulu natal-lesotho border '' the site also indicates that '' the rock art of the drakensberg is the largest and most concentrated group of rock paintings in africa south of the sahara , and is outstanding both in quality and diversity of subject

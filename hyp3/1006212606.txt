the afrikaans name drakensberge comes from the name the earliest dutch settlers gave to the escarpment , namely drakensbergen , or dragons ' mountains the highest portion of the great escarpment is known in zulu as ukhahlamba and as maluti in sotho ( '' barrier of up-pointed spears '' ) about 180 million years ago , a mantle plume under southern gondwana caused bulging of the continental crust in the area that would later become southern africa within 10–20 & nbsp ; million years rift valleys formed on either side of the central bulge , which became flooded to become the proto-atlantic and proto-indian oceans earthquakes rarely occur in the region and there has been no volcanic or orogeny for about 50 & nbsp ; million years the plateau is tilted such that its highest point is in the east , and it slopes gently downward toward the west and south it reaches its highest point ( above where the escarpment forms part of the international border between lesotho and the south african province of kwazulu-natal the upliftment of the central plateau over the past 20 & nbsp ; million years and erosion resulted in the original escarpment being moved inland , creating the present-day coastal plain the rate of the erosion of the escarpment in the drakensberg region is said to average per 1000 & nbsp ; years , or per year geological map of south africa , lesotho and swaziland ( 1970 ) these are the clarens formation laid down under desert conditions about 200 & nbsp ; million years ago , topped by a thick layer of lava which erupted , and covered most of southern africa , and large parts of gondwana , about 180 million years ago these rocks form the steep sides of the great escarpment in this region , where its upper edge reaches an elevation in excess of the erosional retreat of the escarpment from the coast to its present position , means that the rocks of the coastal plain are , with very few and small exceptions , older than those that cap the top of the escarpment thus the rocks of the mpumalanga veld below the mpumalanga portion of the great escarpment are more than 3000 & nbsp ; million years old the entire eastern portion of the great escarpment ( see the accompanying map ) constitutes the drakensberg the kwazulu-natal – free state drakensberg are composed of softer rocks and therefore have a more rounded , softer appearance from below the '' lesotho mountains '' are formed away from the drakensberg escarpment by erosion gulleys which turn into deep valleys which contain tributaries of the orange river south of the 26°s parallel the drakensberg escarpment is composed of ecca group , which belong to the karoo supergroup , and they are 300 million years old therefore , this portion of escarpment is not so impressive as the mpumalanga and lesotho stretches of the drakensberg the grassy lower slopes ( from of the drakensberg in swaziland , south africa and lesotho constitute the drakensberg montane grasslands , woodlands , and forests ecoregion '' the site also indicates that '' the rock art of the drakensberg is the largest and most concentrated group of rock paintings in africa south of the sahara , and is outstanding both in quality and diversity of subject

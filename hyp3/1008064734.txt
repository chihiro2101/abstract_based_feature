in 1789 , two french inventors developed a three-wheeled vehicle , powered by pedals ; they called it the tricycle in 1876 , james starley developed the coventry lever tricycle , which used two small wheels on the right side and a large drive wheel on the left side ; power was supplied by hand levers in 1877 , starley developed a new vehicle he called the coventry rotary , which was '' one of the first rotary chain drive tricycles '' the first front steering tricycle was manufactured in 1881 by the leicester safety tricycle company of leicester , england , which was brought to the market in 1882 costing Â£18 they participate in day rides , tours , time trials , and a criterium ( massed start racing ) series a delta tricycle has one front wheel and two rear wheels a tadpole tricycle has two front wheels and one rear wheel some early pedal tricycles from the late 19th century used two wheels in tandem on one side and a larger driving wheel on the other upright resembles a two-wheeled bicycle , traditionally diamond frame , or open frame , but with either two widely spaced wheels at the back ( called delta ) or two wheels at the front ( called tadpole ) all non-tilting trikes have stability issues and great care must be used when riding a non tilting upright trike recumbent trikes ' advantages ( over conventional trikes ) include stability ( through low centre of gravity ) and low aerodynamic drag recumbent delta is similar to an upright , with two wheels at the back and one at the front , but has a recumbent layout in which the rider is seated in a chair-like seat steering is either through a linkage , with the handlebars under the seat ( under seat steering ) or directly to the front wheel with a large handlebar ( over seat steering ) delta trikes generally have higher seats and a tighter turning radius than tadpole trikes even with the higher seat a delta trike can be quite stable provided most of the weight ( including the rider ) is shifted back towards the rear wheels the hase kettwiesel delta trike has an high seat that is placed to put most of the weight onto the cambered rear wheels making it more stable delta trikes are suitable to be used as manual scooters for mobility , rehab and/or exercise the weight of a delta trike can be quite close to the weight of a tadpole trike if they are both of a similar quality and similar materials are used the hase kettwiesel allround delta trike has an aluminium frame and weighs 39.4 & nbsp ; lbs ( 17.9 & nbsp ; kg ) the tadpole trike is often used by middle-aged or retiree-age former bicyclists who are tired of the associated pains from normal upright bikes with its extremely low center of gravity , aerodynamic layout and light weight ( for trikes ) , tadpoles are considered the highest performance trikes most velomobiles are built in a tadpole trike configuration since a wide front and narrow rear offer superior aerodynamics to a delta trike configuration pull brakes are rarely fitted to front-drive trikes , but the child can slow the trike down by resisting the forward motion through the pedals with hand and foot trikes , the rider makes a pair of front wheels change directions by shifting the center of weight and moves forward by rotating the rear wheel some trike conversion sets can also be used with recumbent bicycles to form recumbent trikes recumbent trikes often brake one wheel with each hand , allowing the rider to brake one side alone to pull the trike in that direction

in 1876 , james starley developed the coventry lever tricycle , which used two small wheels on the right side and a large drive wheel on the left side ; power was supplied by hand levers in 1877 , starley developed a new vehicle he called the coventry rotary , which was '' one of the first rotary chain drive tricycles in the uk , upright tricycles are sometimes referred to as '' barrows '' they participate in day rides , tours , time trials , and a criterium ( massed start racing ) series a delta tricycle has one front wheel and two rear wheels a tadpole tricycle has two front wheels and one rear wheel rear wheel steering is sometimes used , although this increases the turning circle and can affect handling ( the geometry is similar to a regular tricycle operating in reverse , but with a steering damper added ) an in-line three-wheeled vehicle has two steered wheels , one at the front and the other in the middle or at the rear upright resembles a two-wheeled bicycle , traditionally diamond frame , or open frame , but with either two widely spaced wheels at the back ( called delta ) or two wheels at the front ( called tadpole ) the center of gravity is quite high compared to recumbent trikes recumbent trikes ' advantages ( over conventional trikes ) include stability ( through low centre of gravity ) and low aerodynamic drag recumbent delta is similar to an upright , with two wheels at the back and one at the front , but has a recumbent layout in which the rider is seated in a chair-like seat one or both rear wheels can be driven , while the front is used for steering ( the usual layout ) steering is either through a linkage , with the handlebars under the seat ( under seat steering ) or directly to the front wheel with a large handlebar ( over seat steering ) even with the higher seat a delta trike can be quite stable provided most of the weight ( including the rider ) is shifted back towards the rear wheels many delta trikes place the seat too far forward and that takes weight off the two rear wheels and puts more weight onto the front wheel making the trike more unstable the hase lepus comfort is an example of a rehab delta trike designed mainly for comfort and ease of use the hase kettwiesel allround delta trike has an aluminium frame and weighs 39.4 & nbsp ; lbs ( 17.9 & nbsp ; kg ) recumbent tadpole or reverse trike is a recumbent design with two steered wheels at the front and one driven wheel at the back , though one model has the front wheels driven while the rear wheel steers with its extremely low center of gravity , aerodynamic layout and light weight ( for trikes ) , tadpoles are considered the highest performance trikes most velomobiles are built in a tadpole trike configuration since a wide front and narrow rear offer superior aerodynamics to a delta trike configuration recumbent tandem trikes allow two people to ride in a recumbent position with an extra-strong backbone frame to hold the extra weight children 's trikes do not always have bicycle tire , having instead wheels of solid rubber or hollow plastic some trike conversion sets can also be used with recumbent bicycles to form recumbent trikes recumbent trikes are less affected by camber and , depending on track width and riding position , capable of very fast cornering recumbent trikes often brake one wheel with each hand , allowing the rider to brake one side alone to pull the trike in that direction

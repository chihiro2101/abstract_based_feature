in 1789 , two french inventors developed a three-wheeled vehicle , powered by pedals ; they called it the tricycle in 1818 , british inventor denis johnson patented his approach to designing tricycles in 1876 , james starley developed the coventry lever tricycle , which used two small wheels on the right side and a large drive wheel on the left side ; power was supplied by hand levers a delta tricycle has one front wheel and two rear wheels a tadpole tricycle has two front wheels and one rear wheel rear wheel steering is sometimes used , although this increases the turning circle and can affect handling ( the geometry is similar to a regular tricycle operating in reverse , but with a steering damper added ) some early pedal tricycles from the late 19th century used two wheels in tandem on one side and a larger driving wheel on the other upright resembles a two-wheeled bicycle , traditionally diamond frame , or open frame , but with either two widely spaced wheels at the back ( called delta ) or two wheels at the front ( called tadpole ) steering is through a handlebar directly connected to the front wheel via a conventional bicycle fork in delta , or via a form of ackermann steering geometry in the case of the upright tadpole all non-tilting trikes have stability issues and great care must be used when riding a non tilting upright trike recumbent trikes ' advantages ( over conventional trikes ) include stability ( through low centre of gravity ) and low aerodynamic drag recumbent delta is similar to an upright , with two wheels at the back and one at the front , but has a recumbent layout in which the rider is seated in a chair-like seat steering is either through a linkage , with the handlebars under the seat ( under seat steering ) or directly to the front wheel with a large handlebar ( over seat steering ) some delta trikes can be stored upright by lifting the front wheel and resting the top of the seat on the ground the tight turning radius is necessary if riding on trails with offset barriers , or navigating around closely placed obstacles even with the higher seat a delta trike can be quite stable provided most of the weight ( including the rider ) is shifted back towards the rear wheels many delta trikes place the seat too far forward and that takes weight off the two rear wheels and puts more weight onto the front wheel making the trike more unstable the hase kettwiesel allround delta trike has an aluminium frame and weighs 39.4 & nbsp ; lbs ( 17.9 & nbsp ; kg ) recumbent tadpole or reverse trike is a recumbent design with two steered wheels at the front and one driven wheel at the back , though one model has the front wheels driven while the rear wheel steers the tadpole trike is often used by middle-aged or retiree-age former bicyclists who are tired of the associated pains from normal upright bikes some recumbent tricycles are fully enclosed for all weather use as well as for aerodynamic benefits ; these are known as velomobiles with hand and foot trikes , the rider makes a pair of front wheels change directions by shifting the center of weight and moves forward by rotating the rear wheel the hand and foot trike can be also converted into a manual tricycle designed to be driven with both hands and both feet in the case of delta tricycles , the drive is often to just one of the rear wheels , though in some cases both wheels are driven through a differential the center-of-mass of most tadpole trikes is close to the front wheels , making the rear brake less useful recumbent trikes often brake one wheel with each hand , allowing the rider to brake one side alone to pull the trike in that direction

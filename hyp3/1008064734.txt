in 1789 , two french inventors developed a three-wheeled vehicle , powered by pedals ; they called it the tricycle in 1818 , british inventor denis johnson patented his approach to designing tricycles in 1877 , starley developed a new vehicle he called the coventry rotary , which was '' one of the first rotary chain drive tricycles '' starley 's inventions started a bike boom in britain ; by 1879 , there were '' twenty types of tricycles and multi-wheel cycles in the uk , upright tricycles are sometimes referred to as '' barrows '' many trike enthusiasts in the uk belong to the tricycle association , formed in 1929 a tadpole tricycle has two front wheels and one rear wheel some early pedal tricycles from the late 19th century used two wheels in tandem on one side and a larger driving wheel on the other all non-tilting trikes have stability issues and great care must be used when riding a non tilting upright trike the center of gravity is quite high compared to recumbent trikes recumbent trikes ' advantages ( over conventional trikes ) include stability ( through low centre of gravity ) and low aerodynamic drag the very low seat may make entry difficult , and on the road they may be less visible to other traffic steering is either through a linkage , with the handlebars under the seat ( under seat steering ) or directly to the front wheel with a large handlebar ( over seat steering ) delta trikes generally have higher seats and a tighter turning radius than tadpole trikes even with the higher seat a delta trike can be quite stable provided most of the weight ( including the rider ) is shifted back towards the rear wheels many delta trikes place the seat too far forward and that takes weight off the two rear wheels and puts more weight onto the front wheel making the trike more unstable the hase kettwiesel delta trike has an high seat that is placed to put most of the weight onto the cambered rear wheels making it more stable the hase kettwiesel allround delta trike has an aluminium frame and weighs 39.4 & nbsp ; lbs ( 17.9 & nbsp ; kg ) the tadpole trike is often used by middle-aged or retiree-age former bicyclists who are tired of the associated pains from normal upright bikes with its extremely low center of gravity , aerodynamic layout and light weight ( for trikes ) , tadpoles are considered the highest performance trikes many , but not all , cycles used for the purpose of vending goods such as ice cream cart trikes or hot dog vending trikes are cargo bicycles tricycles are typically used by children between the ages of two and five , after which point they usually switch to a bicycle , often with training wheels ( stabilisers ) some trikes have a push bar so adults can control the trike some trike conversion sets can also be used with recumbent bicycles to form recumbent trikes recumbent trikes are less affected by camber and , depending on track width and riding position , capable of very fast cornering recumbent trikes often brake one wheel with each hand , allowing the rider to brake one side alone to pull the trike in that direction

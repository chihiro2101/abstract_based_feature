a three-wheeled wheelchair was built in 1655 or 1680 by a disabled german man , stephan farffler , who wanted to be able to maintain his mobility in 1789 , two french inventors developed a three-wheeled vehicle , powered by pedals ; they called it the tricycle in 1876 , james starley developed the coventry lever tricycle , which used two small wheels on the right side and a large drive wheel on the left side ; power was supplied by hand levers a delta tricycle has one front wheel and two rear wheels a tadpole tricycle has two front wheels and one rear wheel rear wheel steering is sometimes used , although this increases the turning circle and can affect handling ( the geometry is similar to a regular tricycle operating in reverse , but with a steering damper added ) an in-line three-wheeled vehicle has two steered wheels , one at the front and the other in the middle or at the rear upright resembles a two-wheeled bicycle , traditionally diamond frame , or open frame , but with either two widely spaced wheels at the back ( called delta ) or two wheels at the front ( called tadpole ) steering is through a handlebar directly connected to the front wheel via a conventional bicycle fork in delta , or via a form of ackermann steering geometry in the case of the upright tadpole all non-tilting trikes have stability issues and great care must be used when riding a non tilting upright trike recumbent trikes ' advantages ( over conventional trikes ) include stability ( through low centre of gravity ) and low aerodynamic drag the very low seat may make entry difficult , and on the road they may be less visible to other traffic recumbent delta is similar to an upright , with two wheels at the back and one at the front , but has a recumbent layout in which the rider is seated in a chair-like seat one or both rear wheels can be driven , while the front is used for steering ( the usual layout ) some delta trikes can be stored upright by lifting the front wheel and resting the top of the seat on the ground delta trikes generally have higher seats and a tighter turning radius than tadpole trikes even with the higher seat a delta trike can be quite stable provided most of the weight ( including the rider ) is shifted back towards the rear wheels many delta trikes place the seat too far forward and that takes weight off the two rear wheels and puts more weight onto the front wheel making the trike more unstable the hase kettwiesel delta trike has an high seat that is placed to put most of the weight onto the cambered rear wheels making it more stable the weight of a delta trike can be quite close to the weight of a tadpole trike if they are both of a similar quality and similar materials are used recumbent tadpole or reverse trike is a recumbent design with two steered wheels at the front and one driven wheel at the back , though one model has the front wheels driven while the rear wheel steers the trike pictured is called the suv ( sensible utility vehicle ) and is produced by the company organic engines , which operates in florida in the united states children 's trikes can have pedals directly driving the front wheels , allowing braking with the pedals , or they can use chain drive the rear wheels , often without a differential , so one rear wheel spins free the hand and foot trike can be also converted into a manual tricycle designed to be driven with both hands and both feet some trike conversion sets can also be used with recumbent bicycles to form recumbent trikes recumbent trikes often brake one wheel with each hand , allowing the rider to brake one side alone to pull the trike in that direction

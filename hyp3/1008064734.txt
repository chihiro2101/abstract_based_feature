in 1876 , james starley developed the coventry lever tricycle , which used two small wheels on the right side and a large drive wheel on the left side ; power was supplied by hand levers a delta tricycle has one front wheel and two rear wheels a tadpole tricycle has two front wheels and one rear wheel rear wheel steering is sometimes used , although this increases the turning circle and can affect handling ( the geometry is similar to a regular tricycle operating in reverse , but with a steering damper added ) some early pedal tricycles from the late 19th century used two wheels in tandem on one side and a larger driving wheel on the other an in-line three-wheeled vehicle has two steered wheels , one at the front and the other in the middle or at the rear upright resembles a two-wheeled bicycle , traditionally diamond frame , or open frame , but with either two widely spaced wheels at the back ( called delta ) or two wheels at the front ( called tadpole ) steering is through a handlebar directly connected to the front wheel via a conventional bicycle fork in delta , or via a form of ackermann steering geometry in the case of the upright tadpole all non-tilting trikes have stability issues and great care must be used when riding a non tilting upright trike recumbent trikes ' advantages ( over conventional trikes ) include stability ( through low centre of gravity ) and low aerodynamic drag one or both rear wheels can be driven , while the front is used for steering ( the usual layout ) steering is either through a linkage , with the handlebars under the seat ( under seat steering ) or directly to the front wheel with a large handlebar ( over seat steering ) some delta trikes can be stored upright by lifting the front wheel and resting the top of the seat on the ground even with the higher seat a delta trike can be quite stable provided most of the weight ( including the rider ) is shifted back towards the rear wheels many delta trikes place the seat too far forward and that takes weight off the two rear wheels and puts more weight onto the front wheel making the trike more unstable the hase kettwiesel delta trike has an high seat that is placed to put most of the weight onto the cambered rear wheels making it more stable the hase kettwiesel allround delta trike has an aluminium frame and weighs 39.4 & nbsp ; lbs ( 17.9 & nbsp ; kg ) the catrike road tadpole trike has an aluminium frame and weighs 37.5 & nbsp ; lbs ( 17 & nbsp ; kg ) recumbent tadpole or reverse trike is a recumbent design with two steered wheels at the front and one driven wheel at the back , though one model has the front wheels driven while the rear wheel steers the tadpole trike is often used by middle-aged or retiree-age former bicyclists who are tired of the associated pains from normal upright bikes the hand-power only trikes can be used by individuals who do not have the use of their legs due to a disability or an injury tricycles are typically used by children between the ages of two and five , after which point they usually switch to a bicycle , often with training wheels ( stabilisers ) the advantages of a trike conversion set include lower cost compared with new hand built tricycles and the freedom to choose almost any donor bicycle frame some trike conversion sets can also be used with recumbent bicycles to form recumbent trikes adults may find upright tricycles difficult to ride because of familiarity with the countersteering required to balance a bicycle recumbent trikes often brake one wheel with each hand , allowing the rider to brake one side alone to pull the trike in that direction

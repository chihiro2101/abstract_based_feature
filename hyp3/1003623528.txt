leaves of grass has its genesis in an essay by ralph waldo emerson called '' the poet '' ( publ whitman , reading the essay , consciously set out to answer emerson 's call as he began working on the first edition of leaves of grass '' reynolds , 82 on may 15 , 1855 , whitman registered the title leaves of grass with the clerk of the united states district court , southern district of new jersey , and received its copyright the first edition was published on july 4 , 1855 , in brooklyn , at the printing shop of two scottish immigrants , james and andrew rome , whom whitman had known since the 1840s whitman paid for and did much of the typesetting for the first edition himself the book did not include the author 's name , and instead offered an engraving by samuel hollyer depicting whitman in work clothes and a jaunty hat , arms at his side the first edition was very small , collecting only twelve unnamed poems in 95 pages in a letter to whitman , emerson wrote , '' i find it the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom america has yet contributed it was emerson 's positive response to the first edition that inspired whitman to quickly produce a much-expanded second in 1856 , now 384 pages with a cover price of a dollar '' emerson later took offense that this letter was made public callow , 236 and became more critical of the work kaplan , 250 whitman claimed that the butterfly was real in order to foster his image as being '' one with nature the 1867 edition was intended to be , according to whitman , '' a new & much better edition of leaves of grass complete — that unkillable work ! '' reynolds , 474 he assumed it would be the final edition '' reynolds , 586 this last version of leaves of grass was published in 1892 and is referred to as the deathbed edition kaplan , 51 by the time this last edition was completed , leaves of grass had grown from a small book of 12 poems to a hefty tome of almost 400 poems as the volume changed , so did the pictures that whitman used to illustrate them—the last edition depicts an older whitman with a full beard and jacket these latter editions would include the poem '' when lilacs last in the dooryard bloom 'd '' , whitman 's elegy to abraham lincoln after his death while whitman has famously proclaimed ( in '' song of myself '' ) his poetry to be '' nature without check with original energy '' , scholars have discovered that whitman borrowed from a number of sources for his leaves of grass he also condensed a chapter from a popular science book into his poem '' the world below the brine '' originally written at a time of significant urbanization in america , leaves of grass also responds to the impact such has on the masses reynolds , 332 the title metaphor of grass , however , indicates a pastoral vision of rural idealism the '' i '' attempts to relieve both social and private problems by using powerful affirmative cultural images ; reynolds , 324 the emphasis on american culture in particular helped reach whitman 's intention of creating a distinctly american epic poem comparable to the works of homer miller , 155 as a believer in phrenology , whitman , in the 1855 preface to leaves of grass , includes the phrenologist among those he describes as '' the lawgivers of poets one critic has identified three major '' thematic drifts '' in leaves of grass : the period from 1855 to 1859 , from 1859 to 1865 , and from 1866 to his death in poems like '' out of the cradle endlessly rocking '' and '' when lilacs last in the dooryard bloom 'd '' , the prevailing themes are of love and of death whitman became more conservative in his old age , and had come to believe that the importance of law exceeded the importance of freedom '' similarly , a 1970 volume of whitman 's poetry published by the united states information agency describes whitman as a man who will '' mix indiscriminately '' with the people '' imagined america : walt whitman 's nationalism in the first edition of 'leaves of grass ' university of iowa press , volume 21 , november 3 , 2004 : 189–191 american singer lana del rey references walt whitman and leaves of grass in her song '' body electric '' , from her ep paradise ( 2012 )

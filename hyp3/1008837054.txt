a book published by the french music critic andré hodeir , titled since debussy , hodeir 1961 created controversy around barraqué by claiming this work as perhaps the finest piano sonata since beethoven as the work had still not been publicly performed , and only two other works by him had at this time , the extravagant claims made for barraqué in this book were received with some scepticism whilst with hindsight it is clear that hodeir had accurately perceived the exceptional features of barraqué 's music—notably its searing romantic intensity , which distinguishes it from the contemporaneous works of boulez or stockhausen as paul griffiths ' biography clarified , boulez had in fact attempted to get the barraqué piano sonata performed for some years after it was finished in any event , barraqué did not obtain ready access to the better-known new music festivals and concert series until much later than they barraqué then produced his only electronic piece , the musique concrète etude ( 1954 ) , made at pierre schaeffer 's studio subsequently , he planned a large-scale cycle of pieces , la mort de virgile , based on hermann broch 's novel the death of virgil , a book which barraqué 's friend and sometime lover michel foucault recommended to him most of barraqué 's creative efforts went into the works which were to take their place in 'fire ( the descent ) ' , which - to give an idea of the projected scope of the whole design - was to have consisted of thirteen works before his death he completed two of the projected parts : chant aprés chant ( 1966 ) , and le temps restitué ( 1957/68 ) au delà du hasard ( 1958–59 ) for three female voices and ensemble , and a concerto for clarinet , vibraphone and ensemble in 1962–68 , which are related to the death of virgil , but not actually part of that cycle 1966–69 ; 1972–73 ) : sketch for three solo voices and orchestra ( text by barraqué and hermann broch ) portiques du feu ( c 1968 ; 1972–73 ) : sketch for 18 solo voices ( text by barraqué and hermann broch ) hymnes à plotia for string quartet ( 1972–73 ) '' death , creativity , and voice in jean barraqué 's le temps restitué ''

the first seed of the story 's first chapter the horror in clay came from one of lovecraft 's own dreams he had in 1919 , which he described briefly in two different letters sent to his friend rheinhart kleiner on may 21 and december 14 , 1920 in the dream , lovecraft is visiting an antiquity museum in providence , attempting to convince the aged curator there to buy an odd bas-relief lovecraft himself had sculpted , who initially scoffs at him for trying to sell something recently made to a museum of antique objects lovecraft then remembers himself answering the curator with the response : '' why do you say that this thing is new ? the dreams of men are older than brooding egypt or the contemplative sphinx , or garden-girdled babylon , and this was fashioned in my dreams '' lovecraft then used this for a brief synopsis of a new story outlined in his own commonplace book at first in august 1925 , which developed organically out of the idea of what the bas-relief in the dream actually might have depicted in a footnote for his writing down of his own dream , lovecraft then finished with the suggestion '' add good development & describe nature of bas-relief '' to himself for future reference price claims the irregular sonnet '' the kraken '' , the kraken , the victorian web written in 1830 by alfred tennyson , was a major inspiration for lovecraft 's story , as both reference a huge aquatic creature sleeping for an eternity at the bottom of the ocean and destined to emerge from its slumber in an apocalyptic age schultz , '' call of cthulhu , the '' , an h it is also assumed he got inspiration from william scott-elliot 's the story of atlantis ( 1896 ) and the lost lemuria ( 1904 ) , which lovecraft read in 1926 shortly before he started to work on the story another dunsany work cited by price is a shop in go-by street ( 1919 ) , which stated '' the heaven of the gods who sleep '' , and '' unhappy are they that hear some old god speak while he sleeps being still deep in slumber '' this passage is also believed to have inspired lovecraft 's entity azathoth , hence the title of price 's essay a pulpy , tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary wings lovecraft has stated wilcox 's residence in his story is actually the fleur-de-lys studios in providence legrasse had discovered the relic months before in the swamps south of new orleans , during his raid on a supposed voodoo cult the idol resembles wilcox 's sculpture , and represented a '' thing , which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural malignancy , was of a somewhat bloated corpulence , and squatted evilly on a rectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters after killing five of the participants and arresting 47 others , legrasse interrogated the men before learning '' the central idea of their loathsome faith '' : '' they worshipped , so they said , the great old ones who lived ages before there were any men hidden in distant wastes and dark places all over the world until the time when the great priest cthulhu , from his dark house in the mighty city of r'lyeh under the waters , should rise and bring the earth again beneath his sway '' one particularly talkative cultist , known as old castro , named the center of their cult as iram of the pillars in arabia , and referred to a phrase in the necronomicon : '' that is not dead which can eternal lie , and with strange aeons even death may die lovecraft regarded the short story as '' rather middlingâ€”not as bad as the worst , but full of cheap and cumbrous touches '' to self-destruct , all dedicated to lovecraft 's cthulhu , as well as the band 's ex-bassist , cliff burton , who died in a bus accident in 1986 , while touring in support of their album master of puppets in 2018 , a survival horror role-playing video game called call of cthulhu : the official video game was developed for playstation 4 , xbox one , and windows pc in 2020 , elements of the call of cthulhu were adapted in the science fiction horror film underwater , directed by william eubank and released by 20th century fox

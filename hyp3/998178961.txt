the first seed of the story 's first chapter the horror in clay came from one of lovecraft 's own dreams he had in 1919 , which he described briefly in two different letters sent to his friend rheinhart kleiner on may 21 and december 14 , 1920 in the dream , lovecraft is visiting an antiquity museum in providence , attempting to convince the aged curator there to buy an odd bas-relief lovecraft himself had sculpted , who initially scoffs at him for trying to sell something recently made to a museum of antique objects lovecraft then remembers himself answering the curator with the response : '' why do you say that this thing is new ? the dreams of men are older than brooding egypt or the contemplative sphinx , or garden-girdled babylon , and this was fashioned in my dreams '' lovecraft then used this for a brief synopsis of a new story outlined in his own commonplace book at first in august 1925 , which developed organically out of the idea of what the bas-relief in the dream actually might have depicted in a footnote for his writing down of his own dream , lovecraft then finished with the suggestion '' add good development & describe nature of bas-relief '' to himself for future reference price claims the irregular sonnet '' the kraken '' , the kraken , the victorian web written in 1830 by alfred tennyson , was a major inspiration for lovecraft 's story , as both reference a huge aquatic creature sleeping for an eternity at the bottom of the ocean and destined to emerge from its slumber in an apocalyptic age joshi and david e it is also assumed he got inspiration from william scott-elliot 's the story of atlantis ( 1896 ) and the lost lemuria ( 1904 ) , which lovecraft read in 1926 shortly before he started to work on the story lovecraft , fortean times magazine price also notes that lovecraft admired the work of lord dunsany , who wrote the gods of pegana ( 1905 ) , which depicts a god constantly lulled to sleep to avoid the consequences of its reawakening this passage is also believed to have inspired lovecraft 's entity azathoth , hence the title of price 's essay wells ' the war of the worlds was an influence on '' the call of cthulhu '' , citing the thematic similarities of ancient , powerful , but indifferent aliens associated with deities ; physical similarities between cthulhu and the martians ; and the plot detail of a ship ramming an alien in a temporarily successful but ultimately futile gesture the story 's narrator , francis wayland thurston , recounts his discovery of various notes left behind by his great uncle , george gammell angell , a prominent professor of semitic languages at brown university in providence , rhode island , who died during the winter of 1926 after being jostled by a '' nautical-looking negro '' the first chapter , '' the horror in clay '' , concerns a small bas-relief sculpture found among the notes , which the narrator describes : '' my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus , a dragon , and a human caricature ” the sculpture is the work of henry anthony wilcox , a student at the rhode island school of design , who based his creation on a delirious dream of '' great cyclopean cities of titanic blocks and sky-flung monoliths , all dripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror lovecraft has stated wilcox 's residence in his story is actually the fleur-de-lys studios in providence hidden in distant wastes and dark places all over the world until the time when the great priest cthulhu , from his dark house in the mighty city of r'lyeh under the waters , should rise and bring the earth again beneath his sway the prisoners identify the confiscated idol as cthulhu himself , and translate their mysterious phrase as '' in his house at r'lyeh , dead cthulhu waits dreaming with the exception of johansen and a fellow sailor ( who then died as they made their way back to auckland , new zealand due to madness from seeing whatever was on that uncharted island ) , the remaining crewmembers perish on the island lovecraft regarded the short story as '' rather middling—not as bad as the worst , but full of cheap and cumbrous touches '' lovecraft : against the world , against life , described the story as the first of lovecraft 's '' great texts '' in 2018 , a survival horror role-playing video game called call of cthulhu : the official video game was developed for playstation 4 , xbox one , and windows pc

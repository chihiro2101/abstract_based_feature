the first seed of the story 's first chapter the horror in clay came from one of lovecraft 's own dreams he had in 1919 , which he described briefly in two different letters sent to his friend rheinhart kleiner on may 21 and december 14 , 1920 in the dream , lovecraft is visiting an antiquity museum in providence , attempting to convince the aged curator there to buy an odd bas-relief lovecraft himself had sculpted , who initially scoffs at him for trying to sell something recently made to a museum of antique objects lovecraft then remembers himself answering the curator with the response : '' why do you say that this thing is new ? the dreams of men are older than brooding egypt or the contemplative sphinx , or garden-girdled babylon , and this was fashioned in my dreams '' this can be compared to what the character of henry anthony wilcox tells the main character 's uncle while showing him his sculpted bas-relief for help in reading hieroglyphs on it which came through wilcox 's own fantastical dreams : : '' it is new , indeed , for i made it last night in a dream of strange cities ; and dreams are older than brooding tyre or the contemplative sphinx , or garden-girdled babylon '' lovecraft then used this for a brief synopsis of a new story outlined in his own commonplace book at first in august 1925 , which developed organically out of the idea of what the bas-relief in the dream actually might have depicted price claims the irregular sonnet '' the kraken '' , the kraken , the victorian web written in 1830 by alfred tennyson , was a major inspiration for lovecraft 's story , as both reference a huge aquatic creature sleeping for an eternity at the bottom of the ocean and destined to emerge from its slumber in an apocalyptic age lovecraft , fortean times magazine price also notes that lovecraft admired the work of lord dunsany , who wrote the gods of pegana ( 1905 ) , which depicts a god constantly lulled to sleep to avoid the consequences of its reawakening joshi says that , 'merritt 's mention of a '' moon-door '' that , when tilted , leads the characters into a lower region of wonder and horror seems similar to the huge door whose inadvertent opening by the sailors causes cthulhu to emerge from r'lyeh' wells ' the war of the worlds was an influence on '' the call of cthulhu '' , citing the thematic similarities of ancient , powerful , but indifferent aliens associated with deities ; physical similarities between cthulhu and the martians ; and the plot detail of a ship ramming an alien in a temporarily successful but ultimately futile gesture ” the sculpture is the work of henry anthony wilcox , a student at the rhode island school of design , who based his creation on a delirious dream of '' great cyclopean cities of titanic blocks and sky-flung monoliths , all dripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror ” references to both cthulhu and r'lyeh are included in letters written by wilcox the second chapter , '' the tale of inspector legrasse '' , discusses the first time the professor had heard the word '' cthulhu '' and seen a similar image after killing five of the participants and arresting 47 others , legrasse interrogated the men before learning '' the central idea of their loathsome faith '' : '' they worshipped , so they said , the great old ones who lived ages before there were any men hidden in distant wastes and dark places all over the world until the time when the great priest cthulhu , from his dark house in the mighty city of r'lyeh under the waters , should rise and bring the earth again beneath his sway '' one particularly talkative cultist , known as old castro , named the center of their cult as iram of the pillars in arabia , and referred to a phrase in the necronomicon : '' that is not dead which can eternal lie , and with strange aeons even death may die the article reports the discovery of a derelict ship in the pacific ocean with only one survivor—a norwegian sailor named gustaf johansen , second mate on board the emma , a schooner which originally sailed from auckland , new zealand commandeering their opponent 's vessel , the surviving crewmembers travel on and arrive at an uncharted island in the vicinity of when one of the sailors accidentally opens a '' monstrously carven portal '' , he releases cthulhu : '' it lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed its gelatinous green immensity through the black doorway call girl of cthulhu , released in 2014 , was an indie horror film directed by chris lamartina , loosely based on lovecraft 's writings in 2018 , a survival horror role-playing video game called call of cthulhu : the official video game was developed for playstation 4 , xbox one , and windows pc in 2018 , the villain black manta in the movie aquaman directed by james wan and released by dc quotes '' the call of chulthu '' : '' loathsomeness waits , and dreams in the deep , and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men ''

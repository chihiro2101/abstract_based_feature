the war of the second coalition in northern italian began with the inconclusive battle of verona on 26 march 1799 between the habsburg army of paul kray and the republican french army of italy under barthélemy louis joseph schérer the subsequent battle of magnano on 5 april was a clear-cut victory by kray over the french , with the austrians sustaining 6,000 casualties while inflicting losses of 8,000 men and 18 guns on their foes 151 the defeat was a crushing blow to french morale and prompted schérer to plead with the french directory to be relieved of command finding his strong position behind the mincio river outflanked on the north by 12,000 austrians , schérer left 12,000 troops to hold the key fortress of mantua , directed 1,600 more to defend peschiera del garda and retreated to the west on 12 april two days later , alexander suvorov arrived at vicenza with an russian empire army and assumed command of the combined austro-russian forces on 27 april , the coalition allies led by suvorov were victorious over jean victor marie moreau 's french army at the battle of cassano along the adda river the next day at verderio , jean-mathieu-philibert sérurier 's division was surrounded and in the fighting that followed the french lost 252 men killed before the 2,700 survivors gave up the defeats caused moreau to fall back , leaving 2,400 men to hold the milan citadel on the morning of 26 may , josef philipp vukassovich 's advance guard seized turin with its arsenal and over 300 cannons plus large stocks of ammunition 80-82 early june found the allied main body of 47,087 troops under suvorov , rosenberg and michael von melas camped near turin karl joseph hadik von futak with 9,900 austrians watched the swiss mountain passes to face this array , moreau counted about 25,000 soldiers in the divisions of paul grenier , claude victor-perrin , pierre garnier de laboissière at genoa , paul louis gaultier de kervéguen at florence and joseph hélie désiré perruquet de montrichard at bologna but the allies were aware that jacques macdonald had a strong french occupation force in southern and central italy on 14 april 1799 , the french directory ordered macdonald to help the french forces in northern italy macdonald reached rome on 16 may and florence ten days later from there , the safest course was to use the west coast road to reach genoa , keeping the apennine mountains between him and the allies after his passage across the apennines , macdonald hoped to crush some of the austrian covering forces 87 as it moved north , the army of naples absorbed the divisions of victor , montrichard and gaultier , bringing its total field force to 36,728 soldiers on 9 june suvorov received news from peter karl ott von bátorkéz that victor and montrichard reinforced macdonald and that the french captured pontremoli ott commanded 5,000 soldiers that belonged to bellegarde 's corps , but were acting independently near parma immediately , suvorov ordered ott to conduct a staged withdrawal to stradella , but to hold that position at all hazards with the exception of kaim 's division , the austro-russian army marched to asti , reaching there on 11 june suvorov ordered bellegarde 's corps to march on alessandria to keep an eye on moreau while the rest of his army concentrated against macdonald the westernmost column was made up of victor 's division marching from borgo val di taro down the taro river toward parma because macdonald 's offensive across the apennines was so unlikely , it took the austrian covering forces by surprise 88 prince friedrich franz xaver of hohenzollern-hechingen at modena with 4,800 troops and ott west of fornovo di taro 89 on 12 june in the battle of modena , the french inflicted losses of 750 killed and wounded on their enemies while capturing 1,650 men , eight guns and three colors 158 during the pursuit , macdonald was set upon by a troop of french royalist cavalry and suffered saber cuts on the head and arm before his own soldiers could finish off their enemies since the fortress of alessandria commanded the only crossing of the bormida , the austro-russian main body waited on a pontoon train which finally arrived on 15 june at 5:00 pm the span was in place and suvorov 's army crossed and marched all night to reach castelnuovo scrivia on the morning of the 16th after only three hours of rest , the soldiers continued the forced march during the day to their bivouac between casteggio and casatisma in a period of 24 hours the allied army covered to provide security for his right flank , suvorov detached mikhail mikhailovich veletsky with one battalion of the jung-baden musketeer regiment , 50 cossacks and 80 dragoons from the karaczay regiment to keep macdonald from raising the siege of mantua , kray manned the north bank of the po with several thousand troops 90 on 16 june at 10:00 am , macdonald 's vanguard arrived near piacenza and began pressing ott 's command by this time austrian military engineer albert johann de best got the piacenza citadel into a defensible state after eight days of work ; two or three companies of the fröhlich regiment were assigned to garrison it victor 's division led the french attack on ott as rusca 's soldiers edged toward the south as if to flank the austrians out of position if ott were forced back into the narrow stradella position , it would be difficult for the allies to form a line of battle and might even cause a rout rosenberg personally accompanied the second column in the center the division commander was lieutenant general förster and his infantry was made up of two battalions each of the miloradovich and tyrtov musketeer regiments and one battalion each of the baranovsky , förster and jung-baden

plentiful cover to repulse austrian cavalry charges together , ott and fröhlich pushed montrichard and olivier back beyond the trebbia by evening hearing what they believed to be moreau 's artillery , three french battalions mounted an extemporaneous attack at 9:30 pm , surprising an austrian battalion but with bagration 's forces pulled to the south by dombrowski 's ill-fated attack , rusca 's men

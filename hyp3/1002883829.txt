the war of the second coalition in northern italian began with the inconclusive battle of verona on 26 march 1799 between the habsburg army of paul kray and the republican french army of italy under barthélemy louis joseph schérer the subsequent battle of magnano on 5 april was a clear-cut victory by kray over the french , with the austrians sustaining 6,000 casualties while inflicting losses of 8,000 men and 18 guns on their foes two days later , alexander suvorov arrived at vicenza with an russian empire army and assumed command of the combined austro-russian forces on 27 april , the coalition allies led by suvorov were victorious over jean victor marie moreau 's french army at the battle of cassano along the adda river the next day at verderio , jean-mathieu-philibert sérurier 's division was surrounded and in the fighting that followed the french lost 252 men killed before the 2,700 survivors gave up 152-153 on 6 may the garrison of peschiera capitulated to kray while on 11 may pizzighettone and 1,500 french soldiers surrendered to konrad valentin von kaim 154-155 ferrara , ravenna and milan all capitulated to austrian besieging forces on 24 may 80-82 early june found the allied main body of 47,087 troops under suvorov , rosenberg and michael von melas camped near turin kray 's 19,760-man corps was engaged in the siege of mantua , covered by 6,122 austrians under johann von klenau at ferrera finally , suvorov summoned the 19,458-strong corps of count heinrich von bellegarde from switzerland to milan where they arrived on 5 june but the allies were aware that jacques macdonald had a strong french occupation force in southern and central italy on 14 april 1799 , the french directory ordered macdonald to help the french forces in northern italy macdonald reached rome on 16 may and florence ten days later but perhaps the real reason was that macdonald wished to make a theatrical entrance to the campaign by smashing his way through the coalition allies 87 as it moved north , the army of naples absorbed the divisions of victor , montrichard and gaultier , bringing its total field force to 36,728 soldiers ott commanded 5,000 soldiers that belonged to bellegarde 's corps , but were acting independently near parma immediately , suvorov ordered ott to conduct a staged withdrawal to stradella , but to hold that position at all hazards the allied troops reached the bormida river near the french-held fortress of alessandria on 13 june that day , suvorov got definite news of macdonald 's offensive meanwhile , a french squadron put in at genoa on 2 june to drop off french reinforcements the westernmost column was made up of victor 's division marching from borgo val di taro down the taro river toward parma because macdonald 's offensive across the apennines was so unlikely , it took the austrian covering forces by surprise macdonald planned to destroy hohenzollern 's division by pinning it with his own column while enveloping it with dombrowski 's division from the west and rusca 's division from the east duffy ( 1999 ) , p 89 on 12 june in the battle of modena , the french inflicted losses of 750 killed and wounded on their enemies while capturing 1,650 men , eight guns and three colors 158 during the pursuit , macdonald was set upon by a troop of french royalist cavalry and suffered saber cuts on the head and arm before his own soldiers could finish off their enemies at 5:00 pm the span was in place and suvorov 's army crossed and marched all night to reach castelnuovo scrivia on the morning of the 16th in a period of 24 hours the allied army covered 91 by this time , bellegarde and 14,500 troops arrived to maintain the siege of alessandria and contain moreau 90 on 16 june at 10:00 am , macdonald 's vanguard arrived near piacenza and began pressing ott 's command victor 's division led the french attack on ott as rusca 's soldiers edged toward the south as if to flank the austrians out of position following behind was an improvised force including the wouwermanns grenadier battalion , three battalions of the fröhlich regiment , the remainder of the karaczay regiment and one and one-half batteries of horse artillery if ott could hold out along the tidone river , it would allow ample space for the austro-russian army to deploy between the po and the mountain spurs to the south if ott were forced back into the narrow stradella position , it would be difficult for the allies to form a line of battle and might even cause a rout duffy ( 1999 ) , p the austrian forces numbered 9,851 foot and 4,586 horse while the russians counted 16,219 infantry and 2,000 cossacks ott 's division included four battalions of the nádasdy nr fröhlich 's reserve consisted of the morzin 29 , paar 109 , pertusi 106 , schiaffinatti 37 , weber 62 and wouwermanns 102 grenadier battalions 8 2 and listed seven rather than six austrian grenadier battalions in the 8 june order of battle that follows , the figures in parentheses are unit strengths the 4th division was commanded by general of division watrin and consisted of the 62nd line ( 3,420 ) and 78th light ( 2,120 ) infantry demi-brigade , 25th chasseurs à cheval regiment ( 260 ) and artillerists ( 33 ) this yielded a strength of 30,980 infantry , 3,616 cavalry and 1,088 artillerymen and sappers for a 35,684 grand total tidone river - 17 june because of the wounds he sustained at modena , macdonald was bedridden in the village of borgo san antonio to the west of piacenza as senior officer victor should have assumed tactical control of the fight , but he stayed in piacenza , resulting in poor coordination of the french effort nevertheless , the determined initial assault ousted the d'aspre jägers from their west-bank positions in the hamlets of agazzino , pontetidone and veratto di sopra as dombrowski 's troops mounted a flank attack to the south , the troops of victor 's division fought their way to the village of sarmato where they were held up by an austrian artillery battery and two battalions of the nádasdy regiment suvorov inspired the russian columns by suddenly appearing at odd places along the line of march despite the odds turning against them , the french continued to mount spirited attacks by the end of the day , 30,656 austrian and russian troops were present to face the now-outnumbered french finally , the allies recaptured sarmato and the abandoned austrian cannons , compelling the french to retreat salme 's advanced guard covered the last stages of the withdrawal , forming square at ca ' del bosco on the northern part of the battlefield the french infantry charged across the trebbia while a horse artillery battery mauled the rosenberg grenadier regiment moving in two bodies , the french force brushed aside the austrian outpost line the austrian guns proceeded to bombard their enemies , encouraging them in their decision to recross the trebbia though the austrians made prisoners of 300 french french general of division alexis aimé pierre cambray was mortally wounded during the battle and died 2 july the army of naples withdrew southeast toward parma where 200 wounded soldiers were abandoned by 28 june the army of naples was back at pistoia where it stayed for several days before marching to the west coast in early july

the war of the second coalition in northern italian began with the inconclusive battle of verona on 26 march 1799 between the habsburg army of paul kray and the republican french army of italy under barthélemy louis joseph schérer the subsequent battle of magnano on 5 april was a clear-cut victory by kray over the french , with the austrians sustaining 6,000 casualties while inflicting losses of 8,000 men and 18 guns on their foes 151 the defeat was a crushing blow to french morale and prompted schérer to plead with the french directory to be relieved of command two days later , alexander suvorov arrived at vicenza with an russian empire army and assumed command of the combined austro-russian forces on 27 april , the coalition allies led by suvorov were victorious over jean victor marie moreau 's french army at the battle of cassano along the adda river the next day at verderio , jean-mathieu-philibert sérurier 's division was surrounded and in the fighting that followed the french lost 252 men killed before the 2,700 survivors gave up the defeats caused moreau to fall back , leaving 2,400 men to hold the milan citadel 152-153 on 6 may the garrison of peschiera capitulated to kray while on 11 may pizzighettone and 1,500 french soldiers surrendered to konrad valentin von kaim on 12 may , suvorov 's subordinate andrei grigorevich rosenberg suffered a minor setback in the battle of bassignana 156 meanwhile , 30,000 allies under suvorov moved up the north bank of the po river toward turin pascal antoine fiorella and his 3,400-man french garrison withdrew to the citadel where they were besieged 80-82 early june found the allied main body of 47,087 troops under suvorov , rosenberg and michael von melas camped near turin finally , suvorov summoned the 19,458-strong corps of count heinrich von bellegarde from switzerland to milan where they arrived on 5 june but the allies were aware that jacques macdonald had a strong french occupation force in southern and central italy on 14 april 1799 , the french directory ordered macdonald to help the french forces in northern italy however , macdonald believed that the coast road was unusable for his artillery beyond lerici and feared that austrian columns might interfere with the operation but perhaps the real reason was that macdonald wished to make a theatrical entrance to the campaign by smashing his way through the coalition allies in order to accomplish this , he asked moreau to march north and east to meet him near piacenza , an impractical move that would place the army of italy in the midst of its enemies after his passage across the apennines , macdonald hoped to crush some of the austrian covering forces on 9 june suvorov received news from peter karl ott von bátorkéz that victor and montrichard reinforced macdonald and that the french captured pontremoli ott commanded 5,000 soldiers that belonged to bellegarde 's corps , but were acting independently near parma immediately , suvorov ordered ott to conduct a staged withdrawal to stradella , but to hold that position at all hazards with the exception of kaim 's division , the austro-russian army marched to asti , reaching there on 11 june the allied troops reached the bormida river near the french-held fortress of alessandria on 13 june that day , suvorov got definite news of macdonald 's offensive suvorov ordered bellegarde 's corps to march on alessandria to keep an eye on moreau while the rest of his army concentrated against macdonald the westernmost column was made up of victor 's division marching from borgo val di taro down the taro river toward parma 88 prince friedrich franz xaver of hohenzollern-hechingen at modena with 4,800 troops and ott west of fornovo di taro klenau deduced the french strategy and shifted northeast behind the panaro river to block rusca 89 on 12 june in the battle of modena , the french inflicted losses of 750 killed and wounded on their enemies while capturing 1,650 men , eight guns and three colors 158 during the pursuit , macdonald was set upon by a troop of french royalist cavalry and suffered saber cuts on the head and arm before his own soldiers could finish off their enemies in a period of 24 hours the allied army covered to provide security for his right flank , suvorov detached mikhail mikhailovich veletsky with one battalion of the jung-baden musketeer regiment , 50 cossacks and 80 dragoons from the karaczay regiment allowing for the possibility of defeat , the russian army commander ordered the po to be bridged at cava manara for the main army and valenza for bellegarde 's corps victor 's division led the french attack on ott as rusca 's soldiers edged toward the south as if to flank the austrians out of position following behind was an improvised force including the wouwermanns grenadier battalion , three battalions of the fröhlich regiment , the remainder of the karaczay regiment and one and one-half batteries of horse artillery the first column on the right was headed by an advance guard under major general pyotr bagration which included the dendrygin , kalemin , lomonosov and sanaev combined grenadier battalions , two battalions of the bagration jäger regiment , grekov and posdeev cossack regiments and six squadrons of the austrian karaczay dragoon regiment nr austrian casualties are

cavalry ( 500 ) this second source gave the following division strengths for the end of may : salme 2,997 , olivier 5,826 , rusca 5,397 , montrichard 5,773 , watrin 4,880 , dombrowski 3,555 and victor 6,750 from this , losses from the battle of modena and other causes must be deducted tidone river - 17 june with steep banks 2 to 3 metres high and a width of about , the stream has some defensive value as senior officer victor should have assumed tactical control of the fight , but he stayed in piacenza , resulting in poor coordination of the french effort 94 soon afterward melas arrived with three battalions of austrians foot and some squadrons of the archduke joseph hussars chasteler 's units hustled off to the south to block a turning movement by dombrowski 's division by the end of the day , 30,656 austrian and russian troops were present to face the now-outnumbered french finally , the allies recaptured sarmato and the abandoned austrian cannons , compelling the french to retreat the french fell back stubbornly , taking advantage of plentiful cover to repulse austrian cavalry charges unexpectedly confronted by a large austro-russian army , macdonald was in a dilemma they somehow penetrated the french lines as far as settima where they routed a french detachment and liberated some prisoners farther north , victor 's division was repulsed by a combination of schveikovsky 's left wing and förster 's division and withdrew to the french-held east bank the austrian guns proceeded to bombard their enemies , encouraging them in their decision to recross the trebbia though the austrians made prisoners of 300 french from a total of 33,000 french , he estimated losses as 2,000 killed , 7,500 wounded ( most of whom became prisoners ) plus 7,000 men , seven guns and eight colors captured the austrians advanced into piacenza where they found the wounded generals olivier , rusca and salme along with the other non-transportable french wounded suvorov determined from captured dispatches that macdonald 's mangled army was no longer a threat to northern italy and marched the allied army back west on the 23rd , hoping to catch moreau between himself and belegarde

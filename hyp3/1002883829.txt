the war of the second coalition in northern italian began with the inconclusive battle of verona on 26 march 1799 between the habsburg army of paul kray and the republican french army of italy under barthélemy louis joseph schérer the subsequent battle of magnano on 5 april was a clear-cut victory by kray over the french , with the austrians sustaining 6,000 casualties while inflicting losses of 8,000 men and 18 guns on their foes smith ( 1998 ) , p 151 the defeat was a crushing blow to french morale and prompted schérer to plead with the french directory to be relieved of command finding his strong position behind the mincio river outflanked on the north by 12,000 austrians , schérer left 12,000 troops to hold the key fortress of mantua , directed 1,600 more to defend peschiera del garda and retreated to the west on 12 april two days later , alexander suvorov arrived at vicenza with an russian empire army and assumed command of the combined austro-russian forces on 27 april , the coalition allies led by suvorov were victorious over jean victor marie moreau 's french army at the battle of cassano along the adda river the next day at verderio , jean-mathieu-philibert sérurier 's division was surrounded and in the fighting that followed the french lost 252 men killed before the 2,700 survivors gave up the defeats caused moreau to fall back , leaving 2,400 men to hold the milan citadel 152-153 on 6 may the garrison of peschiera capitulated to kray while on 11 may pizzighettone and 1,500 french soldiers surrendered to konrad valentin von kaim on 12 may , suvorov 's subordinate andrei grigorevich rosenberg suffered a minor setback in the battle of bassignana pascal antoine fiorella and his 3,400-man french garrison withdrew to the citadel where they were besieged 80-82 early june found the allied main body of 47,087 troops under suvorov , rosenberg and michael von melas camped near turin kray 's 19,760-man corps was engaged in the siege of mantua , covered by 6,122 austrians under johann von klenau at ferrera finally , suvorov summoned the 19,458-strong corps of count heinrich von bellegarde from switzerland to milan where they arrived on 5 june but the allies were aware that jacques macdonald had a strong french occupation force in southern and central italy on 14 april 1799 , the french directory ordered macdonald to help the french forces in northern italy accordingly , he assembled the army of naples and moved north , leaving southern italy in the hands of local forces macdonald reached rome on 16 may and florence ten days later however , macdonald believed that the coast road was unusable for his artillery beyond lerici and feared that austrian columns might interfere with the operation in order to accomplish this , he asked moreau to march north and east to meet him near piacenza , an impractical move that would place the army of italy in the midst of its enemies after his passage across the apennines , macdonald hoped to crush some of the austrian covering forces 87 as it moved north , the army of naples absorbed the divisions of victor , montrichard and gaultier , bringing its total field force to 36,728 soldiers on 9 june suvorov received news from peter karl ott von bátorkéz that victor and montrichard reinforced macdonald and that the french captured pontremoli ott commanded 5,000 soldiers that belonged to bellegarde 's corps , but were acting independently near parma the russian commander quickly made up his mind to move east to confront macdonald the allied troops reached the bormida river near the french-held fortress of alessandria on 13 june that day , suvorov got definite news of macdonald 's offensive meanwhile , a french squadron put in at genoa on 2 june to drop off french reinforcements intelligence indicated that moreau was about to descend from the mountains suvorov ordered bellegarde 's corps to march on alessandria to keep an eye on moreau while the rest of his army concentrated against macdonald next to the west were the divisions of jean-baptiste olivier and françois watrin , accompanied by macdonald and advancing from pistoia on modena because macdonald 's offensive across the apennines was so unlikely , it took the austrian covering forces by surprise 88 prince friedrich franz xaver of hohenzollern-hechingen at modena with 4,800 troops and ott west of fornovo di taro macdonald planned to destroy hohenzollern 's division by pinning it with his own column while enveloping it with dombrowski 's division from the west and rusca 's division from the east klenau deduced the french strategy and shifted northeast behind the panaro river to block rusca macdonald lost touch with dombrowski 's command nevertheless , macdonald fell on the austrians at modena with two divisions 89 on 12 june in the battle of modena , the french inflicted losses of 750 killed and wounded on their enemies while capturing 1,650 men , eight guns and three colors 158 during the pursuit , macdonald was set upon by a troop of french royalist cavalry and suffered saber cuts on the head and arm before his own soldiers could finish off their enemies at 5:00 pm the span was in place and suvorov 's army crossed and marched all night to reach castelnuovo scrivia on the morning of the 16th after only three hours of rest , the soldiers continued the forced march during the day to their bivouac between casteggio and casatisma 91 by this time , bellegarde and 14,500 troops arrived to maintain the siege of alessandria and contain moreau victor 's division led the french attack on ott as rusca 's soldiers edged toward the south as if to flank the austrians out of position if ott were forced back into the narrow stradella position , it would be difficult for the allies to form a line of battle and might even cause a rout the third column under general der kavallerie melas was made up of a division under feldmarschall-leutnant ott and a reserve under feldmarschall-leutnant michael von fröhlich with attached artillery 64 fröhlich 's reserve consisted of the morzin 29 , paar 109 , pertusi 106 , schiaffinatti 37 , weber 62 and wouwermanns 102 grenadier battalions a second source stated that there were 17,000 russians and 20,000 austrians present and added three battalions of the fröhlich nr in the 8 june order of battle that follows , the figures in parentheses are unit strengths on 17 june at 8:00 am the french opened their attack against ott 's positions behind the tidone the french divisions were deployed with victor on the right , rusca in the center and dombrowski on the left because of the wounds he sustained at modena , macdonald was bedridden in the village of borgo san antonio to the west of piacenza hearing what they believed to be moreau 's artillery , three french battalions mounted an extemporaneous attack at 9:30 pm , surprising an austrian battalion meanwhile , macdonald determined to launch an assault , putting his faith in the french soldier 's enthusiasm for the attack and his troops ' good morale farther north , victor 's division was repulsed by a combination of schveikovsky 's left wing and förster 's division and withdrew to the french-held east bank he stated french losses as 9,500 killed and wounded and 7,000 captured out of 33,000 a total of 1,099 french soldiers surrendered along with six guns and three colors suvorov determined from captured dispatches that macdonald 's mangled army was no longer a threat to northern italy and marched the allied army back west on the 23rd , hoping to catch moreau between himself and belegarde

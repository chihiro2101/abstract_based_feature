after its creation st was ranked 14th among the top 20 semiconductor suppliers with sales of around us 850 million owner thomson sa sold its stake in the company in 1998 when the company also listed on the italian bourse in milan in 2002 , motorola and tsmc joined st and philips in a new technology partnership the crolles 2 alliance was created with a new 12 '' wafer manufacturing facility located in crolles , france by 2005 , st was ranked fifth , behind intel , samsung , texas instruments and toshiba , but ahead of infineon , renesas , nec , nxp semiconductors , and freescale the company was the largest european semiconductors supplier , ahead of infineon and nxp early in 2007 , '' nxp semiconductors '' ( formerly '' philips semiconductors '' ) and '' freescale '' ( formerly '' motorola semiconductors '' ) decided to stop their participation in crolles 2 alliance semiconductor market consolidation continued with st and nxp announcing on april 10 , 2008 , the creation of a new joint venture of their mobile activities , with st owning 80 % of the new company and nxp 20 % '' st ericsson '' was a multinational manufacturer of wireless products and semiconductors , supplying to mobile device manufacturers st-ericsson was a 50/50 joint venture of stmicroelectronics and ericsson established on february 3 , 2009 , and dissolved on august 2 , 2013 headquartered in geneva , switzerland , it was a fabless company , outsourcing semiconductor manufacturing to foundry companies in 2011 , st announced the creation of a joint lab with sant'anna school of advanced studies as of december 31 , 2014 , the shareholders were : 68.4 % public ( new york stock exchange , euronext paris , borsa italiana ) 4.1 % treasury shares 27.6 % stmicroelectronics holding b.v unlike fabless semiconductor company , stmicroelectronics owns and operates its own semiconductor wafer fabs most of the production is scaled at 0.18 & nbsp ; µm , 0.13 & nbsp ; µm , 90 & nbsp ; nm and 65 & nbsp ; nm ( measurements of transistor gate length ) all the historical wafer fab lines are now closed but the site hosts the headquarters of many divisions ( marketing , design , industrialization ) and an important r & d center , focused on silicon and software design and fab process development the crolles site hosts a and a fab and was originally built as a common r & d center for submicrometre technologies as part of the 1990 grenoble 92 partnership between sgs-thomson and cnet , the r & d center of french telecom company france telecom the fab , known as crolles 1 , is the company 's first and was built as part of a 1991 partnership between sgs-thomson and philips to develop new manufacturing technologies it includes a r & d center which focuses on developing new nanometric technology processes for 90 & nbsp ; nm to 32 & nbsp ; nm scale using wafers and it was developed for the crolles 2 alliance this alliance of stmicroelectronics , tsmc , nxp semiconductors ( formerly philips semiconductor ) and freescale ( formerly motorola semiconductor ) partnered in 2002 to develop the facility and to work together on process development employing around 3,000 staff , rousset hosts several division headquarters including smartcards , microcontrollers , and eeprom as well as several r & d centers rousset also hosts an 8-inch ( 200 & nbsp ; mm ) fab which was opened on may 15 , 2000 by french prime minister lionel jospin the site opened in 1979 as a fab operated by eurotechnique , a joint venture between saint-gobain of france and national semiconductor of the us in 1988 , a small group of employees from the thomson rousset plant ( including the director , marc lassus ) founded a start-up company , gemalto ( formerly known as gemplus ) which became a leader in the smartcard industry employing 1,500 staff , this site hosts a fab and r & d centers the site has several fab lines ( including an fab ) and an r & d center update-2012 : numonyx jv ( with intel ) is acquired by micron as such , r2 fab ( agrate previous r & d 200mm fab ) is currently a micron entity the site 's two major wafer fabs are a fab , opened in april 1997 by then-italian prime minister romano prodi , and a fab that has never been completed and which was transferred in its current state to '' numonyx '' in 2008 in 1970 , sgs created its first assembly back-end plant in singapore , in the area of toa payoh the phoenix , arizona 8 & nbsp ; inch ( 200 & nbsp ; mm ) fab , the carrollton , texas 6 & nbsp ; inch ( 150 & nbsp ; mm ) fab , and the ain sebaa , morocco fab are beginning rampdown plans , and are destined to close by 2010 the company 's second 8 '' fab after crolles 1 , the site was first dedicated to producing microprocessors for cyrix initially equipped with a 4-inch ( 100 & nbsp ; mm ) fab , it was converted into a 6-inch ( 150 & nbsp ; mm ) fab in 1988

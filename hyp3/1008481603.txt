'' thomson semiconducteurs '' was created in 1982 by the french government 's widespread nationalization of industries at the time of the merger of these two companies in 1987 , the newborn corporation was named '' sgs-thomson '' but took its current name in may 1998 following thomson ’ s sale of its shares after its creation st was ranked 14th among the top 20 semiconductor suppliers with sales of around us 850 million on december 8 , 1994 , the company completed its initial public offering on the paris and new york stock exchanges owner thomson sa sold its stake in the company in 1998 when the company also listed on the italian bourse in milan the crolles 2 alliance was created with a new 12 '' wafer manufacturing facility located in crolles , france the company was the largest european semiconductors supplier , ahead of infineon and nxp on may 22 , 2007 , st and intel created a joint venture in the memory application called numonyx : this new company merged st and '' intel flash memory '' activities semiconductor market consolidation continued with st and nxp announcing on april 10 , 2008 , the creation of a new joint venture of their mobile activities , with st owning 80 % of the new company and nxp 20 % '' st ericsson '' was a multinational manufacturer of wireless products and semiconductors , supplying to mobile device manufacturers headquartered in geneva , switzerland , it was a fabless company , outsourcing semiconductor manufacturing to foundry companies unlike fabless semiconductor company , stmicroelectronics owns and operates its own semiconductor wafer fabs the company owned five 8 & nbsp ; inch ( 200 & nbsp ; mm ) wafer fabs and one 12 & nbsp ; inch ( 300 & nbsp ; mm ) wafer fab in 2006 most of the production is scaled at 0.18 & nbsp ; µm , 0.13 & nbsp ; µm , 90 & nbsp ; nm and 65 & nbsp ; nm ( measurements of transistor gate length ) grenoble is one of the company 's most important r & d centres , employing around 4,000 staff the polygone site employs 2,200 staff and is one of the historical bases of the company ( ex sgs ) all the historical wafer fab lines are now closed but the site hosts the headquarters of many divisions ( marketing , design , industrialization ) and an important r & d center , focused on silicon and software design and fab process development the fab , known as crolles 1 , is the company 's first and was built as part of a 1991 partnership between sgs-thomson and philips to develop new manufacturing technologies the fab was inaugurated by french president jacques chirac , on february 27 , 2003 it includes a r & d center which focuses on developing new nanometric technology processes for 90 & nbsp ; nm to 32 & nbsp ; nm scale using wafers and it was developed for the crolles 2 alliance employing around 3,000 staff , rousset hosts several division headquarters including smartcards , microcontrollers , and eeprom as well as several r & d centers rousset also hosts an 8-inch ( 200 & nbsp ; mm ) fab which was opened on may 15 , 2000 by french prime minister lionel jospin in 1988 , a small group of employees from the thomson rousset plant ( including the director , marc lassus ) founded a start-up company , gemalto ( formerly known as gemplus ) which became a leader in the smartcard industry the site has several fab lines ( including an fab ) and an r & d center castelletto , employs 300 to 400 staff and hosts some divisions and r & d centers the catania plant in sicily employs 5,000 staff and hosts several r & d centers and divisions , focusing on flash memory technologies as well as two fabs shenzhen , guangdong province , china , near hong kong : in 1994 , st and the shenzhen electronics group signed a partnership to construct and jointly operate an assembly plant ( st has majority with 60 % ) ang mo kio , singapore : in 1970 , sgs created its first assembly back-end plant in singapore , in the area of toa payoh converted up to 8 & nbsp ; inch ( 200 & nbsp ; mm ) fab , this is now an important 8 & nbsp ; inch ( 200 & nbsp ; mm ) wafer fab of the st group with 120 employees , it was the largest design center of the company outside europe at the time toronto , canada : hw & sw design center primarily involved with the design of video processor ics as part of st 's tvm division later , under sgs-thomson , an 8-inch ( 200 & nbsp ; mm ) fab was completed in phoenix in 1995

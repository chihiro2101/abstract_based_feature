at the time of the merger of these two companies in 1987 , the newborn corporation was named '' sgs-thomson '' but took its current name in may 1998 following thomson ’ s sale of its shares after its creation st was ranked 14th among the top 20 semiconductor suppliers with sales of around us 850 million the company has participated in the consolidation of the semiconductor industry since its formation , with acquisitions including : in 1989 , british company inmos known for its transputer microprocessors from parent thorn emi ; in 1994 , canada-based nortel 's semiconductor activities ; in 2000 , waferscale integration inc owner thomson sa sold its stake in the company in 1998 when the company also listed on the italian bourse in milan the crolles 2 alliance was created with a new 12 '' wafer manufacturing facility located in crolles , france by 2005 , st was ranked fifth , behind intel , samsung , texas instruments and toshiba , but ahead of infineon , renesas , nec , nxp semiconductors , and freescale the company was the largest european semiconductors supplier , ahead of infineon and nxp on may 22 , 2007 , st and intel created a joint venture in the memory application called numonyx : this new company merged st and '' intel flash memory '' activities semiconductor market consolidation continued with st and nxp announcing on april 10 , 2008 , the creation of a new joint venture of their mobile activities , with st owning 80 % of the new company and nxp 20 % on february 10 , 2009 , st ericsson , a joint venture bringing together '' st-nxp wireless '' and '' ericsson mobile platforms '' , was established headquartered in geneva , switzerland , it was a fabless company , outsourcing semiconductor manufacturing to foundry companies as of december 31 , 2014 , the shareholders were : 68.4 % public ( new york stock exchange , euronext paris , borsa italiana ) 4.1 % treasury shares 27.6 % stmicroelectronics holding b.v unlike fabless semiconductor company , stmicroelectronics owns and operates its own semiconductor wafer fabs the company owned five 8 & nbsp ; inch ( 200 & nbsp ; mm ) wafer fabs and one 12 & nbsp ; inch ( 300 & nbsp ; mm ) wafer fab in 2006 most of the production is scaled at 0.18 & nbsp ; µm , 0.13 & nbsp ; µm , 90 & nbsp ; nm and 65 & nbsp ; nm ( measurements of transistor gate length ) grenoble is one of the company 's most important r & d centres , employing around 4,000 staff the polygone site employs 2,200 staff and is one of the historical bases of the company ( ex sgs ) all the historical wafer fab lines are now closed but the site hosts the headquarters of many divisions ( marketing , design , industrialization ) and an important r & d center , focused on silicon and software design and fab process development the crolles site hosts a and a fab and was originally built as a common r & d center for submicrometre technologies as part of the 1990 grenoble 92 partnership between sgs-thomson and cnet , the r & d center of french telecom company france telecom the fab , known as crolles 1 , is the company 's first and was built as part of a 1991 partnership between sgs-thomson and philips to develop new manufacturing technologies it includes a r & d center which focuses on developing new nanometric technology processes for 90 & nbsp ; nm to 32 & nbsp ; nm scale using wafers and it was developed for the crolles 2 alliance this alliance of stmicroelectronics , tsmc , nxp semiconductors ( formerly philips semiconductor ) and freescale ( formerly motorola semiconductor ) partnered in 2002 to develop the facility and to work together on process development employing around 3,000 staff , rousset hosts several division headquarters including smartcards , microcontrollers , and eeprom as well as several r & d centers rousset also hosts an 8-inch ( 200 & nbsp ; mm ) fab which was opened on may 15 , 2000 by french prime minister lionel jospin the site opened in 1979 as a fab operated by eurotechnique , a joint venture between saint-gobain of france and national semiconductor of the us employing 6,000 staff , the milan facilities match grenoble in importance in 1970 , sgs created its first assembly back-end plant in singapore , in the area of toa payoh then in 1981 , sgs decided to build a wafer fab in singapore the singapore technical engineers have been trained in italy and the fab of ang mo kio started to produce its first wafers in 1984 converted up to 8 & nbsp ; inch ( 200 & nbsp ; mm ) fab , this is now an important 8 & nbsp ; inch ( 200 & nbsp ; mm ) wafer fab of the st group toronto , canada : hw & sw design center primarily involved with the design of video processor ics as part of st 's tvm division initially equipped with a 4-inch ( 100 & nbsp ; mm ) fab , it was converted into a 6-inch ( 150 & nbsp ; mm ) fab in 1988

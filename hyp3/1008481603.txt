'' thomson semiconducteurs '' was created in 1982 by the french government 's widespread nationalization of industries at the time of the merger of these two companies in 1987 , the newborn corporation was named '' sgs-thomson '' but took its current name in may 1998 following thomson ’ s sale of its shares after its creation st was ranked 14th among the top 20 semiconductor suppliers with sales of around us 850 million the company has participated in the consolidation of the semiconductor industry since its formation , with acquisitions including : in 1989 , british company inmos known for its transputer microprocessors from parent thorn emi ; in 1994 , canada-based nortel 's semiconductor activities ; in 2000 , waferscale integration inc on december 8 , 1994 , the company completed its initial public offering on the paris and new york stock exchanges owner thomson sa sold its stake in the company in 1998 when the company also listed on the italian bourse in milan in 2002 , motorola and tsmc joined st and philips in a new technology partnership the crolles 2 alliance was created with a new 12 '' wafer manufacturing facility located in crolles , france the company was the largest european semiconductors supplier , ahead of infineon and nxp early in 2007 , '' nxp semiconductors '' ( formerly '' philips semiconductors '' ) and '' freescale '' ( formerly '' motorola semiconductors '' ) decided to stop their participation in crolles 2 alliance on may 22 , 2007 , st and intel created a joint venture in the memory application called numonyx : this new company merged st and '' intel flash memory '' activities semiconductor market consolidation continued with st and nxp announcing on april 10 , 2008 , the creation of a new joint venture of their mobile activities , with st owning 80 % of the new company and nxp 20 % '' st ericsson '' was a multinational manufacturer of wireless products and semiconductors , supplying to mobile device manufacturers st-ericsson was a 50/50 joint venture of stmicroelectronics and ericsson established on february 3 , 2009 , and dissolved on august 2 , 2013 headquartered in geneva , switzerland , it was a fabless company , outsourcing semiconductor manufacturing to foundry companies 50 % ft1ci ( bpifrance 79.2 % and french alternative energies and atomic energy commission ( cea ) 20.8 % ; previously 50 % ministero dell'economia e delle finanze of italy unlike fabless semiconductor company , stmicroelectronics owns and operates its own semiconductor wafer fabs most of the production is scaled at 0.18 & nbsp ; µm , 0.13 & nbsp ; µm , 90 & nbsp ; nm and 65 & nbsp ; nm ( measurements of transistor gate length ) the polygone site employs 2,200 staff and is one of the historical bases of the company ( ex sgs ) all the historical wafer fab lines are now closed but the site hosts the headquarters of many divisions ( marketing , design , industrialization ) and an important r & d center , focused on silicon and software design and fab process development it includes a r & d center which focuses on developing new nanometric technology processes for 90 & nbsp ; nm to 32 & nbsp ; nm scale using wafers and it was developed for the crolles 2 alliance this alliance of stmicroelectronics , tsmc , nxp semiconductors ( formerly philips semiconductor ) and freescale ( formerly motorola semiconductor ) partnered in 2002 to develop the facility and to work together on process development employing around 3,000 staff , rousset hosts several division headquarters including smartcards , microcontrollers , and eeprom as well as several r & d centers as part of the nationalisation , a former thomson plant in the center of aix-en-provence operating since the 1960s was closed and staff were transferred to the new rousset site the catania plant in sicily employs 5,000 staff and hosts several r & d centers and divisions , focusing on flash memory technologies as well as two fabs the site 's two major wafer fabs are a fab , opened in april 1997 by then-italian prime minister romano prodi , and a fab that has never been completed and which was transferred in its current state to '' numonyx '' in 2008 the singapore technical engineers have been trained in italy and the fab of ang mo kio started to produce its first wafers in 1984 stmicroelectronics is , as of 2008 , the largest private employer on the island , employing around 1,800 people shenzhen , guangdong province , china , near hong kong : in 1994 , st and the shenzhen electronics group signed a partnership to construct and jointly operate an assembly plant ( st has majority with 60 % ) with 120 employees , it was the largest design center of the company outside europe at the time sgs 's first presence in the us was a sales office based in phoenix in the early 1980s bristol , uk this r & d site housed the british company inmos which in 1978 began development of the famous transputer microprocessor

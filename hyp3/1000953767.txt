the earliest experiments in rdf were carried out in 1888 when heinrich hertz discovered the directionality of an loop antenna used as an antenna when the antenna was aligned so it pointed at the signal it produced maximum gain , and produced zero signal when face on this meant there was always an ambiguity in the location of the signal , it would produce the same output if the signal was in front or back of the antenna later experimenters also used dipole antennas , which worked in the opposite sense , reaching maximum gain at right angles and zero when aligned rdf systems using mechanically swung loop or dipole antennas were common by the turn of the 20th century early radio systems generally used medium wave and longwave signals for longwave use , this resulted in loop antennas tens of feet on a side , often with more than one loop connected together to improve the signal the signals from the antennas were sent into coils wrapped around a wooden frame about the size of a pop can , where the signals were re-created in the area between the coils a separate loop antenna located in this area could then be used to hunt for the direction , without moving the main antennas this made rdf so much more practical that it was soon being used for navigation on a wide scale , often as the first form of aerial navigation available , with ground stations homing in on the aircraft 's radio set a major improvement in the rdf technique was introduced by robert watson-watt as part of his experiments to locate lightning strikes as a method to indicate the direction of thunderstorms for sailors and airmen development was limited until the mid-1930s , when the various british forces began widespread development and deployment of these '' high-frequency direction finding '' , or '' huff-duff '' systems to avoid rdf , the germans had developed a method of broadcasting short messages under 30 seconds , less than the 60 seconds that a trained bellini-tosi operator would need to determine the direction however , this was useless against huff-duff systems , which located the signal with reasonable accuracy in seconds several developments in electronics during and after the second world war led to greatly improved methods of comparing the phase of signals in particular , the ability to compare the phase of signals led to phase-comparison rdf , which is perhaps the most widely used technique today signals from the loops are sent into a phase comparison circuit , whose output phase directly indicates the direction of the signal pseudo-doppler radio direction finder systems use a series of small dipole antennas arranged in a ring and use electronic switching to rapidly select dipoles to feed into the receiver doppler rdf systems have widely replaced the huff-duff system for location of fleeting signals in ships and small boats , rdf receivers first employed large metal loop antennas , similar to aircraft , but usually mounted atop a portable battery-powered receiver in the united states , commercial am radio stations were required to broadcast their station identifier once per hour for use by pilots and mariners as an aid to navigation , 1920 radiogoniometro marconi per uso di bordo : descrizione , funzionamento , manutenzione , impiego nella condotta della navigazione , genova : tip radio , 1923 radiogoniometro marconi r : g istruzioni per l'uso e la manutenzione del segnale d'allarme automatico senza regolaggio tipo s

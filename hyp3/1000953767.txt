the earliest experiments in rdf were carried out in 1888 when heinrich hertz discovered the directionality of an loop antenna used as an antenna this meant there was always an ambiguity in the location of the signal , it would produce the same output if the signal was in front or back of the antenna later experimenters also used dipole antennas , which worked in the opposite sense , reaching maximum gain at right angles and zero when aligned rdf systems using mechanically swung loop or dipole antennas were common by the turn of the 20th century by the early 1900s , many experimenters were looking for ways to use this concept for locating the position of a transmitter early radio systems generally used medium wave and longwave signals their system used two such antennas , typically triangular loops , arranged at right angles a separate loop antenna located in this area could then be used to hunt for the direction , without moving the main antennas this made rdf so much more practical that it was soon being used for navigation on a wide scale , often as the first form of aerial navigation available , with ground stations homing in on the aircraft 's radio set bellini-tosi direction finders were widespread from the 1920s into the 1950s adcock antennas were widely used with bellini-tosi detectors from the 1920s on he had long worked with conventional rdf systems , but these were difficult to use with the fleeting signals from the lightning development was limited until the mid-1930s , when the various british forces began widespread development and deployment of these '' high-frequency direction finding '' , or '' huff-duff '' systems to avoid rdf , the germans had developed a method of broadcasting short messages under 30 seconds , less than the 60 seconds that a trained bellini-tosi operator would need to determine the direction several developments in electronics during and after the second world war led to greatly improved methods of comparing the phase of signals improved vacuum tubes and the introduction of the transistor allowed much higher frequencies to be used economically , which led to widespread use of vhf and uhf signals in particular , the ability to compare the phase of signals led to phase-comparison rdf , which is perhaps the most widely used technique today signals from the loops are sent into a phase comparison circuit , whose output phase directly indicates the direction of the signal by sending this to any manner of display , and locking the signal using pll , the direction to the broadcaster can be continuously displayed doppler rdf systems have widely replaced the huff-duff system for location of fleeting signals at first , this system was used by land and marine-based radio operators , using a simple rotatable loop antenna linked to a degree indicator navy rdf model se 995 which used a sense antenna was in use during world war i today many ndbs have been decommissioned in favor of faster and far more accurate gps navigational systems radio , 1923 radiogoniometro marconi r : g

the earliest experiments in rdf were carried out in 1888 when heinrich hertz discovered the directionality of an loop antenna used as an antenna this meant there was always an ambiguity in the location of the signal , it would produce the same output if the signal was in front or back of the antenna later experimenters also used dipole antennas , which worked in the opposite sense , reaching maximum gain at right angles and zero when aligned rdf systems using mechanically swung loop or dipole antennas were common by the turn of the 20th century early radio systems generally used medium wave and longwave signals antennas are generally sensitive to signals only when they have a length that is a significant portion of the wavelength , or larger a key improvement in the rdf concept was introduced by ettore bellini and alessandro tosi in 1909 ( u.s their system used two such antennas , typically triangular loops , arranged at right angles this made rdf so much more practical that it was soon being used for navigation on a wide scale , often as the first form of aerial navigation available , with ground stations homing in on the aircraft 's radio set early rdf systems were useful largely for long wave signals these signals are able to travel very long distances , which made them useful for long-range navigation the rdf station might now receive the same signal from two or more locations , especially during the day , which caused serious problems trying to determine the location the us army air corps in 1931 tested a primitive radio compass that used commercial stations as the beacon he had long worked with conventional rdf systems , but these were difficult to use with the fleeting signals from the lightning when the office was moved , his new location at a radio research station provided him with both an adcock antenna and a suitable oscilloscope , and he presented his new system in 1926 development was limited until the mid-1930s , when the various british forces began widespread development and deployment of these '' high-frequency direction finding '' , or '' huff-duff '' systems however , this was useless against huff-duff systems , which located the signal with reasonable accuracy in seconds signals from the loops are sent into a phase comparison circuit , whose output phase directly indicates the direction of the signal by sending this to any manner of display , and locking the signal using pll , the direction to the broadcaster can be continuously displayed pseudo-doppler radio direction finder systems use a series of small dipole antennas arranged in a ring and use electronic switching to rapidly select dipoles to feed into the receiver since these radio signals are broadcast in all directions ( omnidirectional ) during the day , the signal itself does not include direction information , and these beacons are therefore referred to as non-directional beacons , or ndbs in the united states , commercial am radio stations were required to broadcast their station identifier once per hour for use by pilots and mariners as an aid to navigation automatic direction finder ( adf ) acronyms and abbreviations in avionics amateur radio direction finding battle of the beams cardioid direction finding hf/df radio navigation real-time locating system traffic analysis vor/dme wullenweber toffaloni , 1942 21 : il radiogoniometro marconi per stazioni terrestri : tipo 12 a , roma , ufficio marconi , 1923 tosi , a

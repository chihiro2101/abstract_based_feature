the earliest experiments in rdf were carried out in 1888 when heinrich hertz discovered the directionality of an loop antenna used as an antenna later experimenters also used dipole antennas , which worked in the opposite sense , reaching maximum gain at right angles and zero when aligned rdf systems using mechanically swung loop or dipole antennas were common by the turn of the 20th century by the early 1900s , many experimenters were looking for ways to use this concept for locating the position of a transmitter early radio systems generally used medium wave and longwave signals antennas are generally sensitive to signals only when they have a length that is a significant portion of the wavelength , or larger for longwave use , this resulted in loop antennas tens of feet on a side , often with more than one loop connected together to improve the signal their system used two such antennas , typically triangular loops , arranged at right angles the signals from the antennas were sent into coils wrapped around a wooden frame about the size of a pop can , where the signals were re-created in the area between the coils a separate loop antenna located in this area could then be used to hunt for the direction , without moving the main antennas early rdf systems were useful largely for long wave signals these signals are able to travel very long distances , which made them useful for long-range navigation adcock antennas were widely used with bellini-tosi detectors from the 1920s on the us army air corps in 1931 tested a primitive radio compass that used commercial stations as the beacon he had long worked with conventional rdf systems , but these were difficult to use with the fleeting signals from the lightning pseudo-doppler radio direction finder systems use a series of small dipole antennas arranged in a ring and use electronic switching to rapidly select dipoles to feed into the receiver doppler rdf systems have widely replaced the huff-duff system for location of fleeting signals radio direction finding works by comparing the signal strength of a directional antenna pointing in different directions at first , this system was used by land and marine-based radio operators , using a simple rotatable loop antenna linked to a degree indicator on pre-world war ii aircraft , rdf antennas are easy to identify as the circular loops mounted above or below the fuselage since these radio signals are broadcast in all directions ( omnidirectional ) during the day , the signal itself does not include direction information , and these beacons are therefore referred to as non-directional beacons , or ndbs as the commercial medium wave broadcast band lies within the frequency capability of most rdf units , these stations and their transmitters can also be used for navigational fixes dello stato , 1934 radiogoniometro marconi per uso di bordo , tipo 11 f , roma , tip radio , 1923 radiogoniometro marconi r : g

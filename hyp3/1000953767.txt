the earliest experiments in rdf were carried out in 1888 when heinrich hertz discovered the directionality of an loop antenna used as an antenna this meant there was always an ambiguity in the location of the signal , it would produce the same output if the signal was in front or back of the antenna later experimenters also used dipole antennas , which worked in the opposite sense , reaching maximum gain at right angles and zero when aligned rdf systems using mechanically swung loop or dipole antennas were common by the turn of the 20th century by the early 1900s , many experimenters were looking for ways to use this concept for locating the position of a transmitter early radio systems generally used medium wave and longwave signals antennas are generally sensitive to signals only when they have a length that is a significant portion of the wavelength , or larger the us navy overcame this problem , to a point , by mounting antennas on ships and sailing in circles such systems were unwieldily and impractical for many uses their system used two such antennas , typically triangular loops , arranged at right angles a separate loop antenna located in this area could then be used to hunt for the direction , without moving the main antennas this made rdf so much more practical that it was soon being used for navigation on a wide scale , often as the first form of aerial navigation available , with ground stations homing in on the aircraft 's radio set early rdf systems were useful largely for long wave signals however , when the same technique was being applied to higher frequencies , unexpected difficulties arose due to the reflection of high frequency signals from the ionosphere the rdf station might now receive the same signal from two or more locations , especially during the day , which caused serious problems trying to determine the location he had long worked with conventional rdf systems , but these were difficult to use with the fleeting signals from the lightning development was limited until the mid-1930s , when the various british forces began widespread development and deployment of these '' high-frequency direction finding '' , or '' huff-duff '' systems however , this was useless against huff-duff systems , which located the signal with reasonable accuracy in seconds in particular , the ability to compare the phase of signals led to phase-comparison rdf , which is perhaps the most widely used technique today pseudo-doppler radio direction finder systems use a series of small dipole antennas arranged in a ring and use electronic switching to rapidly select dipoles to feed into the receiver doppler rdf systems have widely replaced the huff-duff system for location of fleeting signals on pre-world war ii aircraft , rdf antennas are easy to identify as the circular loops mounted above or below the fuselage navy rdf model se 995 which used a sense antenna was in use during world war i since these radio signals are broadcast in all directions ( omnidirectional ) during the day , the signal itself does not include direction information , and these beacons are therefore referred to as non-directional beacons , or ndbs

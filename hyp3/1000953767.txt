the earliest experiments in rdf were carried out in 1888 when heinrich hertz discovered the directionality of an loop antenna used as an antenna when the antenna was aligned so it pointed at the signal it produced maximum gain , and produced zero signal when face on this meant there was always an ambiguity in the location of the signal , it would produce the same output if the signal was in front or back of the antenna later experimenters also used dipole antennas , which worked in the opposite sense , reaching maximum gain at right angles and zero when aligned rdf systems using mechanically swung loop or dipole antennas were common by the turn of the 20th century early radio systems generally used medium wave and longwave signals for longwave use , this resulted in loop antennas tens of feet on a side , often with more than one loop connected together to improve the signal their system used two such antennas , typically triangular loops , arranged at right angles a separate loop antenna located in this area could then be used to hunt for the direction , without moving the main antennas early rdf systems were useful largely for long wave signals the rdf station might now receive the same signal from two or more locations , especially during the day , which caused serious problems trying to determine the location the us army air corps in 1931 tested a primitive radio compass that used commercial stations as the beacon he had long worked with conventional rdf systems , but these were difficult to use with the fleeting signals from the lightning however , this was useless against huff-duff systems , which located the signal with reasonable accuracy in seconds several developments in electronics during and after the second world war led to greatly improved methods of comparing the phase of signals in particular , the ability to compare the phase of signals led to phase-comparison rdf , which is perhaps the most widely used technique today signals from the loops are sent into a phase comparison circuit , whose output phase directly indicates the direction of the signal operation consists solely of tuning in the station , and is so automatic that these systems are normally referred to as automatic direction finder pseudo-doppler radio direction finder systems use a series of small dipole antennas arranged in a ring and use electronic switching to rapidly select dipoles to feed into the receiver doppler rdf systems have widely replaced the huff-duff system for location of fleeting signals navy rdf model se 995 which used a sense antenna was in use during world war i as the commercial medium wave broadcast band lies within the frequency capability of most rdf units , these stations and their transmitters can also be used for navigational fixes while these commercial radio stations can be useful due to their high power and location near major cities , there may be several miles between the location of the station and its transmitter , which can reduce the accuracy of the 'fix ' when approaching the broadcast city radio , 1923 radiogoniometro marconi r : g

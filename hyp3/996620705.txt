a program to simulate this game would consist of several portions , one of which would be responsible for calculating the precise impacts between the billiard balls while computer simulation needs to simulate real-world physics as precisely as possible , computer games need to simulate real-world physics in an acceptable way , in real time and robustly collision detection in computer simulation some use the softness of the material to calculate a force , which will resolve the collision in the following time steps like it is in reality some simulators estimate the time of collision by linear interpolation , roll back the simulation , and calculate the collision by the more abstract methods of conservation laws some iterate the linear interpolation ( newton 's method ) to calculate the time of collision with a much higher precision than the rest of the simulation after an inelastic collision , special states of sliding and resting can occur and , for example , the open dynamics engine uses constraints to simulate them in other words , physical simulators usually function one of two ways , where the collision is detected a posteriori ( after the collision occurs ) or a priori ( before the collision occurs ) in addition to the a posteriori and a priori distinction , almost all modern collision detection algorithms are broken into a hierarchy of algorithms at each simulation step , a list of all intersecting bodies is created , and the positions and trajectories of these objects are '' fixed '' to account for the collision this method is called a posteriori because it typically misses the actual instant of collision , and only catches the collision after it has actually happened the instants of collision are calculated with high precision , and the physical bodies never actually interpenetrate this is called a priori because the collision detection algorithm calculates the instants of collision before it updates the configuration of the physical bodies in this case , the collision detection algorithm need not be aware of the myriad of physical variables ; a simple list of physical bodies is fed to the algorithm , and the program returns a list of intersecting bodies the collision detection algorithm does n't need to understand friction , elastic collisions , or worse , nonelastic collisions and deformable bodies in many applications , the configuration of physical bodies from one time step to the next changes very little at the coarse level of collision detection , the objective is to find pairs of objects which might potentially intersect lin at the university of california , berkeley who suggested using axis-aligned bounding boxes for all n bodies in the scene almost all games use a posteriori collision detection , and collisions are often resolved using very simple rules these are the hallmarks of a failing collision detection and physical simulation system

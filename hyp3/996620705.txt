an initial description of the situation would be given , with a very precise physical description of the billiard table and balls , as well as initial positions of all the balls while computer simulation needs to simulate real-world physics as precisely as possible , computer games need to simulate real-world physics in an acceptable way , in real time and robustly collision detection in computer simulation physical simulators differ in the way they react on a collision some simulators estimate the time of collision by linear interpolation , roll back the simulation , and calculate the collision by the more abstract methods of conservation laws in other words , physical simulators usually function one of two ways , where the collision is detected a posteriori ( after the collision occurs ) or a priori ( before the collision occurs ) in the a posteriori case , the physical simulation is advanced by a small step , then checked to see if any objects are intersecting or visibly considered intersecting at each simulation step , a list of all intersecting bodies is created , and the positions and trajectories of these objects are '' fixed '' to account for the collision in the a priori methods , there is a collision detection algorithm which will be able to predict very precisely the trajectories of the physical bodies the instants of collision are calculated with high precision , and the physical bodies never actually interpenetrate this is called a priori because the collision detection algorithm calculates the instants of collision before it updates the configuration of the physical bodies in this case , the collision detection algorithm need not be aware of the myriad of physical variables ; a simple list of physical bodies is fed to the algorithm , and the program returns a list of intersecting bodies the collision detection algorithm does n't need to understand friction , elastic collisions , or worse , nonelastic collisions and deformable bodies moreover , if the discrete step is too large , the collision could go undetected , resulting in an object which passes through another if it is sufficiently fast or small at the coarse level of collision detection , the objective is to find pairs of objects which might potentially intersect a common algorithm for collision detection of bounding boxes is sweep and prune almost all games use a posteriori collision detection , and collisions are often resolved using very simple rules these are the hallmarks of a failing collision detection and physical simulation system a hitbox is an invisible shape commonly used in video games for real-time collision detection ; it is a type of bounding box steven cameron ( oxford university ) web site on collision detection how to avoid a collision by george beck , wolfram demonstrations project

a program to simulate this game would consist of several portions , one of which would be responsible for calculating the precise impacts between the billiard balls while computer simulation needs to simulate real-world physics as precisely as possible , computer games need to simulate real-world physics in an acceptable way , in real time and robustly collision detection in computer simulation physical simulators differ in the way they react on a collision some simulators estimate the time of collision by linear interpolation , roll back the simulation , and calculate the collision by the more abstract methods of conservation laws collision detection utilizes time coherence to allow even finer time steps without much increasing cpu demand , such as in air traffic control after an inelastic collision , special states of sliding and resting can occur and , for example , the open dynamics engine uses constraints to simulate them in other words , physical simulators usually function one of two ways , where the collision is detected a posteriori ( after the collision occurs ) or a priori ( before the collision occurs ) in addition to the a posteriori and a priori distinction , almost all modern collision detection algorithms are broken into a hierarchy of algorithms this method is called a posteriori because it typically misses the actual instant of collision , and only catches the collision after it has actually happened in the a priori methods , there is a collision detection algorithm which will be able to predict very precisely the trajectories of the physical bodies the instants of collision are calculated with high precision , and the physical bodies never actually interpenetrate this is called a priori because the collision detection algorithm calculates the instants of collision before it updates the configuration of the physical bodies in this case , the collision detection algorithm need not be aware of the myriad of physical variables ; a simple list of physical bodies is fed to the algorithm , and the program returns a list of intersecting bodies it is difficult ( but not completely impossible ) to separate the physical simulation from the collision detection algorithm some objects are in resting contact , that is , in collision , but neither bouncing off , nor interpenetrating , such as a vase resting on a table the obvious approaches to collision detection for multiple objects are very slow in many applications , the configuration of physical bodies from one time step to the next changes very little a common algorithm for collision detection of bounding boxes is sweep and prune a hitbox is an invisible shape commonly used in video games for real-time collision detection ; it is a type of bounding box

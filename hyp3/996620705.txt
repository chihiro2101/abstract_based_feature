the physics of bouncing billiard balls are well understood , under the umbrella of rigid body motion and elastic collisions while computer simulation needs to simulate real-world physics as precisely as possible , computer games need to simulate real-world physics in an acceptable way , in real time and robustly collision detection in computer simulation some simulators estimate the time of collision by linear interpolation , roll back the simulation , and calculate the collision by the more abstract methods of conservation laws some iterate the linear interpolation ( newton 's method ) to calculate the time of collision with a much higher precision than the rest of the simulation collision detection utilizes time coherence to allow even finer time steps without much increasing cpu demand , such as in air traffic control in other words , physical simulators usually function one of two ways , where the collision is detected a posteriori ( after the collision occurs ) or a priori ( before the collision occurs ) in addition to the a posteriori and a priori distinction , almost all modern collision detection algorithms are broken into a hierarchy of algorithms at each simulation step , a list of all intersecting bodies is created , and the positions and trajectories of these objects are '' fixed '' to account for the collision in the a priori methods , there is a collision detection algorithm which will be able to predict very precisely the trajectories of the physical bodies the instants of collision are calculated with high precision , and the physical bodies never actually interpenetrate this is called a priori because the collision detection algorithm calculates the instants of collision before it updates the configuration of the physical bodies in addition , the a posteriori algorithms are in effect one dimension simpler than the a priori algorithms it is difficult ( but not completely impossible ) to separate the physical simulation from the collision detection algorithm some objects are in resting contact , that is , in collision , but neither bouncing off , nor interpenetrating , such as a vase resting on a table the obvious approaches to collision detection for multiple objects are very slow ) in each list , each interval is allowed to intersect all other intervals in the list in many cases for video games , approximating the characters by a point is sufficient for the purpose of collision detection with the environment a hitbox is an invisible shape commonly used in video games for real-time collision detection ; it is a type of bounding box steven cameron ( oxford university ) web site on collision detection how to avoid a collision by george beck , wolfram demonstrations project

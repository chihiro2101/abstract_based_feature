corey ( the surname was anglicized from the lebanon arabic khoury , meaning priest ) was born to lebanese greek orthodox christian immigrants in methuen , massachusetts , north of boston elias james corey – autobiography nobelprize.org his mother changed his name to '' elias '' to honor his father , who died eighteen months after corey 's birth as a young boy , corey was independent and enjoyed sports such as baseball , football , and hiking at the age of 16 corey entered mit , where he earned both a bachelor 's degree in 1948 and a ph.d upon entering mit , corey 's only experience with science was in mathematics , and he began his college career pursuing a degree in engineering after his first chemistry class in his sophomore year he began rethinking his long-term career plans and graduated with a bachelor 's degree in chemistry sheehan , corey remained at mit for his ph.d after his graduate career he was offered an appointment at the university of illinois at urbana–champaign , where he became a full professor of chemistry in 1956 at the age of 27 fraternity – awards – hall of fame – alpha chi sigma in 1959 , he moved to harvard university , where he is currently an emeritus professor of organic chemistry with an active corey group research program among numerous honors , corey was awarded the national medal of science in 1988 , national science foundation – the president 's national medal of science the nobel prize in chemistry in 1990 , and the american chemical society 's greatest honor , the priestley medal , in 2004 corey has developed several new synthetic reagents : pyridinium chlorochromate , also referred to as the corey-suggs reagent , is widely used for the oxidation of alcohols to corresponding ketones and aldehydes the slightly acidic character of pcc makes it useful for cyclization reactions with alcohols and alkenes ( scheme 2 ) the initial oxidation yields the corresponding aldehyde , which can then undergo a prins reaction with the neighboring alkene the development of these protecting groups allowed the synthesis of several natural products that did not have the functional group compatibility to withstand standard chemical transformations although the synthetic community is now moving away from the use of protecting groups it is still rare that a published synthesis of a natural product omits them since 1972 the tbs group has become the most popular silicon protecting group protecting groups ; georg thieme verlag : germany , 2000 in the field of complex molecule synthesis , tbs has been widely used as one of the most versatile of the silicon-based protecting groups ( scheme 4 ) tips ethers are more stable under acidic and basic conditions , the disadvantage of this protecting group over tbs ethers being that the group is less labile for deprotection the most common reagents used for cleavage employ the same conditions as tbs ether , but longer reaction times are generally needed corey in 1965 as a temporary modification of a carbonyl group in displacement and addition reactions the pka of dithianes is approximately 30 , allowing deprotonation with an alkyl lithium reagent , typically n-butyllithium the reaction with dithianes and aldehydes is now known as the corey-seebach reaction the utility of such reactions has expanded the field of organic synthesis by allowing synthetic chemists to use umpolung disconnections in total synthesis ( scheme 8 ) in addition , corey commenced detailed studies on cationic polyolefin cyclizations utilized in enzymatic production of cholesterol from simpler plant terpenes corey established the details of the remarkable cyclization process by first studying the biological synthesis of sterols from squalene several reactions developed in corey 's lab have become commonplace in modern synthetic organic chemistry at least 302 methods have been developed in the corey group since 1950 the corey group first demonstrated the synthesis of the catalyst using borane and chiral aminoalcohols strategic applications of named reactions in organic synthesis ; elsevier : burlington , 2005 enantioselective chemical synthesis ; direct book publishing : dallas , 2010 later , corey demonstrated that substituted boranes were easier to prepare and much more stable migration of the hydride from borane to the electrophilic ketone center occurs via a 6-membered ring transition state , leading to a four-membered ring intermediate ultimately providing the chiral product and regeneration of the catalyst the reaction has also been of great use to natural products chemists ( scheme 11 ) the synthesis of dysidiolide by corey and co-workers was achieved via an enantioselective cbs reduction using a borane-dimethylsulfide complex corey-fuchs reaction is the synthesis of terminal alkynes through a one-carbon homologation of aldehydes using triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide professor t.k.m shing et al used the corey-winter olefination reaction to synthesize ( + ) -boesenoxide ( scheme 16 ) the presence of both cis and trans olefins as well as five asymmetric carbon atoms renders the molecule a desirable challenge for organic chemists corey and lászló kürti , enantioselective chemical synthesis : methods , logic , and practice , direct book publishing llc , 2010 , elias james corey , xue-min cheng corey , impossible dreams tab this was corey 's first public statement on his claim that starting on may 5 , 1964 woodward put forth corey 's explanation as his own thought with no mention of corey and the conversation of may 4

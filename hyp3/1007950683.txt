corey ( the surname was anglicized from the lebanon arabic khoury , meaning priest ) was born to lebanese greek orthodox christian immigrants in methuen , massachusetts , north of boston elias james corey â€“ autobiography nobelprize.org his mother changed his name to '' elias '' to honor his father , who died eighteen months after corey 's birth his widowed mother , brother , two sisters and an aunt and uncle all lived together in a spacious house , struggling through the great depression as a young boy , corey was independent and enjoyed sports such as baseball , football , and hiking he attended a catholic elementary school and lawrence high school in lawrence , massachusetts at the age of 16 corey entered mit , where he earned both a bachelor 's degree in 1948 and a ph.d upon entering mit , corey 's only experience with science was in mathematics , and he began his college career pursuing a degree in engineering after his first chemistry class in his sophomore year he began rethinking his long-term career plans and graduated with a bachelor 's degree in chemistry he chose to work in organic chemistry because of '' its intrinsic beauty and its great relevance to human health '' he has also been an advisor to pfizer for more than 50 years corey has developed several new synthetic reagents : pyridinium chlorochromate , also referred to as the corey-suggs reagent , is widely used for the oxidation of alcohols to corresponding ketones and aldehydes the initial oxidation yields the corresponding aldehyde , which can then undergo a prins reaction with the neighboring alkene the development of these protecting groups allowed the synthesis of several natural products that did not have the functional group compatibility to withstand standard chemical transformations although the synthetic community is now moving away from the use of protecting groups it is still rare that a published synthesis of a natural product omits them the use of csa provides selective removal of a primary tbs ether in the presence of tertiary tbs ether and tips ethers the formation of dithiane was the initial development that introduced umpolung chemistry and is widely used for inversion of reactivity the reaction with dithianes and aldehydes is now known as the corey-seebach reaction the utility of such reactions has expanded the field of organic synthesis by allowing synthetic chemists to use umpolung disconnections in total synthesis ( scheme 8 ) in addition , corey commenced detailed studies on cationic polyolefin cyclizations utilized in enzymatic production of cholesterol from simpler plant terpenes corey established the details of the remarkable cyclization process by first studying the biological synthesis of sterols from squalene the corey group first demonstrated the synthesis of the catalyst using borane and chiral aminoalcohols strategic applications of named reactions in organic synthesis ; elsevier : burlington , 2005 the complexation of the substrate occurs from the most accessible lone pair of the oxygen leading to restricted rotation around the b-o bond due to the sterically neighboring phenyl group the reaction has also been of great use to natural products chemists ( scheme 11 ) the synthesis of dysidiolide by corey and co-workers was achieved via an enantioselective cbs reduction using a borane-dimethylsulfide complex corey-fuchs reaction is the synthesis of terminal alkynes through a one-carbon homologation of aldehydes using triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide 1972 , 3769 the mechanism is similar to that of the wittig reaction by the formation of a phosphorus ylide with triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide more recently , a one-pot synthesis using a modified procedure has been developed this synthetic transformation has been proven successful in the total synthesis ( + ) -taylorione by w.j the corey-kim reagent is formed in situ when ncs and dms are reacted to form dimethylsuccinimidosulfonium chloride species ( scheme 14 ) the reaction accommodates a wide array of functional groups , but allylic and benzylic alcohols are typically transformed into allylic and benzylic chlorides its application in synthesis is based on the mild protocol conditions and functional and protecting group compatibility specifically , the reaction between the thionocarbonate and the trialkylphosphite proceeds either through the formation of a phosphorus ylide species or a carbenoid intermediate one of the first examples of this protocol was applied to the total synthesis of zearalenone ( scheme 20 ) corey and his research group have completed many total synthesis see publications in in 2002 , the american chemical society ( acs ) recognized him as the '' most cited author in chemistry '' a database of 580 former members and their current affiliation was developed for corey 's 80th birthday in july , 2008 corey elias james corey nobel lecture ( pdf ) podcast interview with e.j

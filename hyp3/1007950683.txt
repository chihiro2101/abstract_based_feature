corey ( the surname was anglicized from the lebanon arabic khoury , meaning priest ) was born to lebanese greek orthodox christian immigrants in methuen , massachusetts , north of boston elias james corey – autobiography nobelprize.org his mother changed his name to '' elias '' to honor his father , who died eighteen months after corey 's birth at the age of 16 corey entered mit , where he earned both a bachelor 's degree in 1948 and a ph.d upon entering mit , corey 's only experience with science was in mathematics , and he began his college career pursuing a degree in engineering after his graduate career he was offered an appointment at the university of illinois at urbana–champaign , where he became a full professor of chemistry in 1956 at the age of 27 fraternity – awards – hall of fame – alpha chi sigma in 1959 , he moved to harvard university , where he is currently an emeritus professor of organic chemistry with an active corey group research program he chose to work in organic chemistry because of '' its intrinsic beauty and its great relevance to human health '' the slightly acidic character of pcc makes it useful for cyclization reactions with alcohols and alkenes ( scheme 2 ) the initial oxidation yields the corresponding aldehyde , which can then undergo a prins reaction with the neighboring alkene although the synthetic community is now moving away from the use of protecting groups it is still rare that a published synthesis of a natural product omits them since 1972 the tbs group has become the most popular silicon protecting group protecting groups ; georg thieme verlag : germany , 2000 in the field of complex molecule synthesis , tbs has been widely used as one of the most versatile of the silicon-based protecting groups ( scheme 4 ) tips protecting groups were also pioneered by corey and provide increased selectivity of primary alcohol protection over secondary and tertiary alcohol protection the most common reagents used for cleavage employ the same conditions as tbs ether , but longer reaction times are generally needed the mem protecting group was first described by corey in 1976 this protecting group is similar in reactivity and stability to other alkoxy methyl ethers under acidic conditions corey in 1965 as a temporary modification of a carbonyl group in displacement and addition reactions the formation of dithiane was the initial development that introduced umpolung chemistry and is widely used for inversion of reactivity the pka of dithianes is approximately 30 , allowing deprotonation with an alkyl lithium reagent , typically n-butyllithium the utility of such reactions has expanded the field of organic synthesis by allowing synthetic chemists to use umpolung disconnections in total synthesis ( scheme 8 ) several reactions developed in corey 's lab have become commonplace in modern synthetic organic chemistry at least 302 methods have been developed in the corey group since 1950 the corey group first demonstrated the synthesis of the catalyst using borane and chiral aminoalcohols lack of donation from the nitrogen to the boron increases its lewis acidity , allowing coordination with the ketone substrate migration of the hydride from borane to the electrophilic ketone center occurs via a 6-membered ring transition state , leading to a four-membered ring intermediate ultimately providing the chiral product and regeneration of the catalyst the reaction has also been of great use to natural products chemists ( scheme 11 ) corey-fuchs reaction is the synthesis of terminal alkynes through a one-carbon homologation of aldehydes using triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide this synthetic transformation has been proven successful in the total synthesis ( + ) -taylorione by w.j the corey-kim reagent is formed in situ when ncs and dms are reacted to form dimethylsuccinimidosulfonium chloride species ( scheme 14 ) in the total synthesis of ingenol , kuwajima and co-workers exploited the corey-kim oxidation by selectively oxidizing the less hindered secondary alcohol ( scheme 15 ) specifically , the reaction between the thionocarbonate and the trialkylphosphite proceeds either through the formation of a phosphorus ylide species or a carbenoid intermediate nonetheless , the reaction is stereospecific for most substrates unless the product would lead to an exceedingly strained structure more importantly , stereospecfic alkenes are present in several natural products as the method continues to be exploited to yield a series of complex substrates after the development of this reaction the cbs reagent proved to be a very versatile reagent for a series of several powerful synthetic transformations the use of a chiral lewis acid such as the cbs catalyst includes a broad range of unsaturated enones substrates later corey developed an asymmetric diels-alder reaction employing a chiral oxazoborolidine , greatly simplifying the synthetic route to the prostaglandins a database of 580 former members and their current affiliation was developed for corey 's 80th birthday in july , 2008 corey elias james corey nobel lecture ( pdf ) podcast interview with e.j

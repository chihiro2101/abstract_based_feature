corey ( the surname was anglicized from the lebanon arabic khoury , meaning priest ) was born to lebanese greek orthodox christian immigrants in methuen , massachusetts , north of boston elias james corey – autobiography his widowed mother , brother , two sisters and an aunt and uncle all lived together in a spacious house , struggling through the great depression upon entering mit , corey 's only experience with science was in mathematics , and he began his college career pursuing a degree in engineering he was initiated as a member of the zeta chapter of alpha chi sigma at the university of illinois in 1952 he chose to work in organic chemistry because of '' its intrinsic beauty and its great relevance to human health '' among numerous honors , corey was awarded the national medal of science in 1988 , national science foundation – the president 's national medal of science the nobel prize in chemistry in 1990 , and the american chemical society 's greatest honor , the priestley medal , in 2004 one of these advantages is that the compound is available as an air-stable yellow solid that is not very hygroscopic the slightly acidic character of pcc makes it useful for cyclization reactions with alcohols and alkenes ( scheme 2 ) the initial oxidation yields the corresponding aldehyde , which can then undergo a prins reaction with the neighboring alkene the robustness of pcc as an oxidizing agent has also rendered it useful in the realm of total synthesis ( scheme 3 ) the development of these protecting groups allowed the synthesis of several natural products that did not have the functional group compatibility to withstand standard chemical transformations since 1972 the tbs group has become the most popular silicon protecting group protecting groups ; georg thieme verlag : germany , 2000 in the field of complex molecule synthesis , tbs has been widely used as one of the most versatile of the silicon-based protecting groups ( scheme 4 ) the use of csa provides selective removal of a primary tbs ether in the presence of tertiary tbs ether and tips ethers other means of tbs deprotection include acids ( also lewis acids ) , and fluorides tips protecting groups were also pioneered by corey and provide increased selectivity of primary alcohol protection over secondary and tertiary alcohol protection tips ethers are more stable under acidic and basic conditions , the disadvantage of this protecting group over tbs ethers being that the group is less labile for deprotection the most common reagents used for cleavage employ the same conditions as tbs ether , but longer reaction times are generally needed usually tbs ethers are severed by tbaf , but the hindered tbs ether above survives the reaction conditions upon primary tips removal ( scheme 5 ) the utility of such reactions has expanded the field of organic synthesis by allowing synthetic chemists to use umpolung disconnections in total synthesis ( scheme 8 ) in addition , corey commenced detailed studies on cationic polyolefin cyclizations utilized in enzymatic production of cholesterol from simpler plant terpenes corey established the details of the remarkable cyclization process by first studying the biological synthesis of sterols from squalene several reactions developed in corey 's lab have become commonplace in modern synthetic organic chemistry at least 302 methods have been developed in the corey group since 1950 the corey group first demonstrated the synthesis of the catalyst using borane and chiral aminoalcohols the reaction uses the chiral amino acid proline and in the presence of borane leads to the cbs catalyst ( scheme 9 ) lack of donation from the nitrogen to the boron increases its lewis acidity , allowing coordination with the ketone substrate the complexation of the substrate occurs from the most accessible lone pair of the oxygen leading to restricted rotation around the b-o bond due to the sterically neighboring phenyl group the synthesis of dysidiolide by corey and co-workers was achieved via an enantioselective cbs reduction using a borane-dimethylsulfide complex 1972 , 3769 the mechanism is similar to that of the wittig reaction by the formation of a phosphorus ylide with triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide the corey–kim oxidation was a newly developed transformation for the conversion of alcohols into corresponding aldehydes and ketones its application in synthesis is based on the mild protocol conditions and functional and protecting group compatibility in the total synthesis of ingenol , kuwajima and co-workers exploited the corey-kim oxidation by selectively oxidizing the less hindered secondary alcohol ( scheme 15 ) the formation of sterically hindered trans alkenes present in 7-membered rings was attempted by corey and coworkers , but was unsuccessful even when employing this new synthetic methodology incurring enormous ring strain the presence of both cis and trans olefins as well as five asymmetric carbon atoms renders the molecule a desirable challenge for organic chemists one of the examples that exemplified this protocol was an intermediate in the prostaglandin synthesis revealing a 9:1 mixture of the desired diastereomer ( scheme 24 ) while altom was the second suicide in as many years in corey 's lab , corey was devastated and bewildered by his student 's death corey elias james corey nobel lecture ( pdf ) podcast interview with e.j

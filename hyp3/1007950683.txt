elias james corey â€“ autobiography nobelprize.org his mother changed his name to '' elias '' to honor his father , who died eighteen months after corey 's birth he attended a catholic elementary school and lawrence high school in lawrence , massachusetts at the age of 16 corey entered mit , where he earned both a bachelor 's degree in 1948 and a ph.d upon entering mit , corey 's only experience with science was in mathematics , and he began his college career pursuing a degree in engineering corey has developed several new synthetic reagents : pyridinium chlorochromate , also referred to as the corey-suggs reagent , is widely used for the oxidation of alcohols to corresponding ketones and aldehydes unlike other oxidizing agents , pcc can accomplish single oxidations with only about 1.5 equivalents ( scheme 1 ) the slightly acidic character of pcc makes it useful for cyclization reactions with alcohols and alkenes ( scheme 2 ) the initial oxidation yields the corresponding aldehyde , which can then undergo a prins reaction with the neighboring alkene if this product is undesired , powdered sodium acetate can be used as a buffer to achieve only initial oxidation t-butyldimethylsilyl ether ( tbs ) , triisopropylsilyl ether ( tips ) , and methoxyethoxymethyl ( mem ) : are popular alcohol protecting groups the development of these protecting groups allowed the synthesis of several natural products that did not have the functional group compatibility to withstand standard chemical transformations more importantly , tbs ethers are stable to some carbon nucleophiles such as grignard reagents and enolates protecting groups ; georg thieme verlag : germany , 2000 in the field of complex molecule synthesis , tbs has been widely used as one of the most versatile of the silicon-based protecting groups ( scheme 4 ) the use of csa provides selective removal of a primary tbs ether in the presence of tertiary tbs ether and tips ethers tips ethers are more stable under acidic and basic conditions , the disadvantage of this protecting group over tbs ethers being that the group is less labile for deprotection usually tbs ethers are severed by tbaf , but the hindered tbs ether above survives the reaction conditions upon primary tips removal ( scheme 5 ) the mem protecting group was first described by corey in 1976 cleavage of mem protecting groups is usually accomplished under acidic conditions , but coordination with metal halides greatly enhances lability via assisted cleavage ( scheme 6 ) 1,3-dithianes are also used as protecting groups for carbonyl compounds expressing the versatility and utility of this functional group in addition , corey commenced detailed studies on cationic polyolefin cyclizations utilized in enzymatic production of cholesterol from simpler plant terpenes corey established the details of the remarkable cyclization process by first studying the biological synthesis of sterols from squalene several reactions developed in corey 's lab have become commonplace in modern synthetic organic chemistry the corey group first demonstrated the synthesis of the catalyst using borane and chiral aminoalcohols the reaction uses the chiral amino acid proline and in the presence of borane leads to the cbs catalyst ( scheme 9 ) enantioselective chemical synthesis ; direct book publishing : dallas , 2010 later , corey demonstrated that substituted boranes were easier to prepare and much more stable lack of donation from the nitrogen to the boron increases its lewis acidity , allowing coordination with the ketone substrate migration of the hydride from borane to the electrophilic ketone center occurs via a 6-membered ring transition state , leading to a four-membered ring intermediate ultimately providing the chiral product and regeneration of the catalyst the reaction has also been of great use to natural products chemists ( scheme 11 ) the synthesis of dysidiolide by corey and co-workers was achieved via an enantioselective cbs reduction using a borane-dimethylsulfide complex corey-fuchs reaction is the synthesis of terminal alkynes through a one-carbon homologation of aldehydes using triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide 1972 , 3769 the mechanism is similar to that of the wittig reaction by the formation of a phosphorus ylide with triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide in the total synthesis of ingenol , kuwajima and co-workers exploited the corey-kim oxidation by selectively oxidizing the less hindered secondary alcohol ( scheme 15 ) more importantly , stereospecfic alkenes are present in several natural products as the method continues to be exploited to yield a series of complex substrates the reaction likely proceeds via a highly organized 6-membered ring pre-transition state to deliver highly enantio-enriched products ( scheme 17 ) corey-nicolaou macrolactonization provides the first method for preparing medium to large sized lactones later corey developed an asymmetric diels-alder reaction employing a chiral oxazoborolidine , greatly simplifying the synthetic route to the prostaglandins corey , impossible dreams tab this was corey 's first public statement on his claim that starting on may 5 , 1964 woodward put forth corey 's explanation as his own thought with no mention of corey and the conversation of may 4 in the rebuttal , hoffmann states that he asked corey over the course of their long discussion of the matter why corey did not make the issue public

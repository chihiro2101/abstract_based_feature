elias james corey – autobiography nobelprize.org his mother changed his name to '' elias '' to honor his father , who died eighteen months after corey 's birth as a young boy , corey was independent and enjoyed sports such as baseball , football , and hiking after his first chemistry class in his sophomore year he began rethinking his long-term career plans and graduated with a bachelor 's degree in chemistry he chose to work in organic chemistry because of '' its intrinsic beauty and its great relevance to human health '' corey has developed several new synthetic reagents : pyridinium chlorochromate , also referred to as the corey-suggs reagent , is widely used for the oxidation of alcohols to corresponding ketones and aldehydes the initial oxidation yields the corresponding aldehyde , which can then undergo a prins reaction with the neighboring alkene t-butyldimethylsilyl ether ( tbs ) , triisopropylsilyl ether ( tips ) , and methoxyethoxymethyl ( mem ) : are popular alcohol protecting groups the development of these protecting groups allowed the synthesis of several natural products that did not have the functional group compatibility to withstand standard chemical transformations since 1972 the tbs group has become the most popular silicon protecting group tbs is stable to chromatography and labile enough for cleavage under basic and acidic conditions the use of csa provides selective removal of a primary tbs ether in the presence of tertiary tbs ether and tips ethers tips ethers are more stable under acidic and basic conditions , the disadvantage of this protecting group over tbs ethers being that the group is less labile for deprotection usually tbs ethers are severed by tbaf , but the hindered tbs ether above survives the reaction conditions upon primary tips removal ( scheme 5 ) the mem protecting group was first described by corey in 1976 cleavage of mem protecting groups is usually accomplished under acidic conditions , but coordination with metal halides greatly enhances lability via assisted cleavage ( scheme 6 ) the formations of dithianes can be accomplished with a lewis acid ( scheme 7 ) or directly from carbonyl compounds after deprotection of the dithiane , usually with hgo , a ketone product is observed from the masked acyl dithiane anion the utility of such reactions has expanded the field of organic synthesis by allowing synthetic chemists to use umpolung disconnections in total synthesis ( scheme 8 ) 1,3-dithianes are also used as protecting groups for carbonyl compounds expressing the versatility and utility of this functional group in addition , corey commenced detailed studies on cationic polyolefin cyclizations utilized in enzymatic production of cholesterol from simpler plant terpenes several reactions developed in corey 's lab have become commonplace in modern synthetic organic chemistry at least 302 methods have been developed in the corey group since 1950 the corey group first demonstrated the synthesis of the catalyst using borane and chiral aminoalcohols the reaction uses the chiral amino acid proline and in the presence of borane leads to the cbs catalyst ( scheme 9 ) strategic applications of named reactions in organic synthesis ; elsevier : burlington , 2005 enantioselective chemical synthesis ; direct book publishing : dallas , 2010 later , corey demonstrated that substituted boranes were easier to prepare and much more stable the synthesis of dysidiolide by corey and co-workers was achieved via an enantioselective cbs reduction using a borane-dimethylsulfide complex corey-fuchs reaction is the synthesis of terminal alkynes through a one-carbon homologation of aldehydes using triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide the corey–kim oxidation was a newly developed transformation for the conversion of alcohols into corresponding aldehydes and ketones its application in synthesis is based on the mild protocol conditions and functional and protecting group compatibility specifically , the reaction between the thionocarbonate and the trialkylphosphite proceeds either through the formation of a phosphorus ylide species or a carbenoid intermediate more importantly , stereospecfic alkenes are present in several natural products as the method continues to be exploited to yield a series of complex substrates after the development of this reaction the cbs reagent proved to be a very versatile reagent for a series of several powerful synthetic transformations two sulfur ylide variants have been employed that give different chemeoselective products ( scheme 21 ) specifically the synthesis of prostaglandin f 2α presents several challenges in the rebuttal , hoffmann states that he asked corey over the course of their long discussion of the matter why corey did not make the issue public corey , about e.j corey elias james corey nobel lecture ( pdf ) podcast interview with e.j

image : fastrak transponder.jpg right frame fastrak , an rfid tag used for electronic toll collection in california in 1945 , l√©on theremin invented a listening device for the soviet union which retransmitted incident radio waves with the added audio information even though this device was a covert listening device , rather than an identification tag , it is considered to be a predecessor of rfid because it was passive , being energized and activated by waves from an outside source similar technology , such as the identification friend or foe transponder , was routinely used by the allies and germany in world war ii to identify aircraft as friendly or hostile in 1973 , an early demonstration of reflected power ( modulated backscatter ) rfid tags , both passive and semi-passive , was performed by steven depp , alfred koelle and robert frayman at the los alamos national laboratory this technique is used by the majority of today 's uhfid and microwave rfid tags two-way radio transmitter-receivers called interrogators or readers send a signal to the tag and read its response the rfid tag includes either fixed or programmable logic for processing the transmission and sensor data , respectively a battery-assisted passive tag has a small battery on board and is activated when in the presence of an rfid reader the rfid tag receives the message and then responds with its identification and other information since tags have individual serial numbers , the rfid system design can discriminate among several tags that might be within the range of the rfid reader and read them simultaneously an active reader passive tag ( arpt ) system has an active reader , which transmits interrogator signals and also receives authentication replies from passive tags

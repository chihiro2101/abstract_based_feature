sound waves vibrated a diaphragm which slightly altered the shape of the resonator , which modulated the reflected radio frequency even though this device was a covert listening device , rather than an identification tag , it is considered to be a predecessor of rfid because it was passive , being energized and activated by waves from an outside source '' mario cardullo 's device , patented on january 23 , 1973 , was the first true ancestor of modern rfid , as it was a passive radio transponder with memory this technique is used by the majority of today 's uhfid and microwave rfid tags a radio-frequency identification system uses tags , or labels attached to the objects to be identified tags may either be read-only , having a factory-assigned serial number that is used as a key into a database , or may be read/write , where object-specific data can be written into the tag by the system user the rfid tag receives the message and then responds with its identification and other information since tags have individual serial numbers , the rfid system design can discriminate among several tags that might be within the range of the rfid reader and read them simultaneously a passive reader active tag ( prat ) system has a passive reader which only receives radio signals from active tags ( battery operated , transmit only ) an active reader active tag ( arat ) system uses active tags activated with an interrogator signal from the active reader uhf rfid tags that comply with the epc2 gen 2 class 1 standard usually support this mechanism , while protecting the chip from being killed with a password

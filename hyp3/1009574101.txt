even though this device was a covert listening device , rather than an identification tag , it is considered to be a predecessor of rfid because it was passive , being energized and activated by waves from an outside source similar technology , such as the identification friend or foe transponder , was routinely used by the allies and germany in world war ii to identify aircraft as friendly or hostile '' mario cardullo 's device , patented on january 23 , 1973 , was the first true ancestor of modern rfid , as it was a passive radio transponder with memory the portable system operated at 915 & nbsp ; mhz and used 12-bit tags this technique is used by the majority of today 's uhfid and microwave rfid tags a radio-frequency identification system uses tags , or labels attached to the objects to be identified the rfid tag includes either fixed or programmable logic for processing the transmission and sensor data , respectively rfid tags can be either passive , active or battery-assisted passive a battery-assisted passive tag has a small battery on board and is activated when in the presence of an rfid reader a passive tag is cheaper and smaller because it has no battery ; instead , the tag uses the radio energy transmitted by the reader an active reader active tag ( arat ) system uses active tags activated with an interrogator signal from the active reader

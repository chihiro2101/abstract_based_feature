image : fastrak transponder.jpg right frame fastrak , an rfid tag used for electronic toll collection in california in 1945 , l√©on theremin invented a listening device for the soviet union which retransmitted incident radio waves with the added audio information even though this device was a covert listening device , rather than an identification tag , it is considered to be a predecessor of rfid because it was passive , being energized and activated by waves from an outside source a radio-frequency identification system uses tags , or labels attached to the objects to be identified rfid tags are made out of three pieces : a micro chip ( an integrated circuit which stores and processes information and modulates and demodulates radio-frequency ( rf ) signals ) , an antenna for receiving and transmitting the signal and a substrate a passive tag is cheaper and smaller because it has no battery ; instead , the tag uses the radio energy transmitted by the reader however , to operate a passive tag , it must be illuminated with a power level roughly a thousand times stronger than an active tag for signal transmission tags may either be read-only , having a factory-assigned serial number that is used as a key into a database , or may be read/write , where object-specific data can be written into the tag by the system user field programmable tags may be write-once , read-multiple ; '' blank '' tags may be written with an electronic product code by the user the rfid tag receives the message and then responds with its identification and other information since tags have individual serial numbers , the rfid system design can discriminate among several tags that might be within the range of the rfid reader and read them simultaneously an active reader passive tag ( arpt ) system has an active reader , which transmits interrogator signals and also receives authentication replies from passive tags

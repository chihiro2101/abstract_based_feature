they originated settlers from eastern polynesian islands , who arrived in new zealand in several waves of canoe voyages at some time between 1250 and 1300 māori settled the islands and developed a distinct culture over several hundred years māori mythology is a distinctive corpus of gods and heroes , sharing some polynesian motifs māori often call themselves '' tangata whenua '' ( people of the land ) , placing particular importance on a lifestyle connected to land and sea the concept of tapu ( meaning taboo or sacred ) is also a strong force in māori culture , applied to objects , people , or even mountains māori traditionally had a penchant for war , especially between 1805 and 1842 during the musket wars and diseases introduced , destabilized the traditional māori society the treaty of waitangi 1840 formed the basis of the establishment of british rule over new zealand the most serious conflict between māori and european settlers was between 1863 and 1864 which resulted in land being confiscated from the defeated tribes however their population began to increase again from the late nineteenth century , and a cultural revival began in the 1960s , sometimes known as the māori renaissance . pākehā ( new zealand european ) culture pākehā culture ( usually synonymous with new zealand european culture ) derives mainly from that of the british , particularly english settlers who colonised new zealand in the nineteenth century until about the 1950s many pākehā saw themselves as a british people , and retained strong cultural ties to '' mother england '' yet there was a common perception that people born in new zealand were likely to be physically stronger and more adaptable than people in britain another distinctive trait of pākehā culture has been the egalitarian tradition , as opposed to the british class system within pākehā culture there are also sub-cultures derived from irish , italian and other european groups , as well as various non-ethnic subcultures part of the problem is that high culture is often mistaken for culture in general , and the lack of recognition historically given to new zealand 's artists , writers and composers is seen as evidence of a lack of culture liu , tim mccreanor , tracey mcintosh and teresia teaiwa , eds , new zealand identities : departures and destinations , p.53 one of the goals of pākehā anti-racist groups of the 1980s was to enable pākehā to see their own culture as such , rather than thinking what they did was normal and what other people did was 'ethnic ' and strange miranda johnson ( 2005 ) , ' '' the land of the wrong white cloud '' : anti-racist organizations and pakeha identity politics in the 1970s ' , new zealand journal of history , 39 , 2 , pp.137–57 settler groups from many cultures added to the make-up of the country , with many groups concentrated around specific geographic areas these include dalmatian settlers in northland , danish settlers in inland hawke 's bay , and cantonese people and levantine settlers in otago two of the major ones are polyfest , which showcases performances of the secondary school cultural groups in the auckland region , and pasifika , a festival that celebrates pacific island heritage through traditional food , music , dance , and entertainment from the 1830s many māori nominally converted to christianity and in the process learned to read and write , by the late nineteenth century new zealand when formal schooling finished for most at 12 , māori were as likely to be literate as pākehā a number of religions , such as pai mārire and ringatū , arose in the nineteenth century , blending māori tradition and christianity after the defeat of rebel māori who attempted to establish a renegade state in the king country , the adoption of pākehā culture became less of a free choice as pākehā began to outnumber māori parliament passed legislation affecting māori , such as the native schools act ( 1867 ) which required english to be the dominant medium of instruction for māori children although this was weakly enforced from the 1880s a small number of western educated graduates emerged from māori colleges such as te aute men such as pomare , ngata and buck believed that further adopting pākehā culture would advance māori in new zealand together they formed the young māori party which was very influential in starting improved health and education for māori ngata went on to become a leading new zealand politician and acting prime minister school of maori and pacific development & international centre for cultural studies ( iccs ) , pp from the early twentieth century and especially from the 1970s , māori activists began to protest against eurocentrism and demanded equal recognition for their own culture māori culture has also provided inspiration to pākehā artists the most famous example of this is the haka of the all blacks , a māori posture dance which is performed before international rugby matches ( there are many non-māori polynesian all blacks , thus making this a multi-ethnic borrowing ) walker , ranginui ( 1990 ) , ka whawhai tonu matou : struggle without end , pp.221–5 most pākehā are now more respectful of māori culture and often consult māori before using māori cultural forms some pākehā have been deeply involved in the revival of otherwise lost māori arts māori history has mainly been recorded by pākehā authors such as michael king , james belich and paul moon traditionally māori were reluctant to reveal their tribal knowledge to europeans for fear of being mocked or considered barbaric , and also a belief in keeping tribal secrets both māori and pākehā have borrowed cultural forms and styles from other countries , particularly britain and the united states although there is evidence of a '' new zealand style '' , many groups incorporate new zealand themes into their work , so this style affects each genre differently an eastern polynesian language , te reo māori , is closely related to tahitian and cook islands māori ; slightly less closely to hawaiian and marquesan ; and more distantly to the languages of western polynesia , including samoan , niuean and tongan the 2013 census found that māori was spoken by 3.7 % of the population new zealand sign language it uses more lip-patterns in conjunction with hand and facial movement to cue signs than bsl , reflecting new zealand 's history of oralist education of deaf people new zealand sign language became an official language of new zealand in april 2006 new zealand has two 'high culture ' traditions : māori and western because of this and new zealand 's small population , most new zealand artists , performers and writers struggle to make a living from their art heritage new zealand and the ministry for culture and heritage are national bodies that assist with heritage preservation rita angus and others used the landscape to try and achieve this while painters such as gordon walters used māori motifs a number of māori artists , including paratene matchitt and shane cotton have combined western modernism with traditional māori art kapa haka , ( kapa meaning 'rank ' or 'row ' and haka referring to a māori dance ) , is the 'cultural dance ' component of traditional māori performing arts the haka ( often mistaken as always being a war dance or ritual challenge ) has become part of wider new zealand culture , being performed by the all blacks as a group ritual before international games and by homesick new zealanders of all races who want to express their new zealandness hip-hop is popular and there are small but thriving live music , dance party and indie music scenes new zealand has a national orchestra and many regional orchestras from the 1950s , frank sargeson , janet frame and others had ( non lucrative ) writing careers while still living in new zealand barry crump was a popular author who embodied and expounded the myth of the kiwi larrikin and multi-skilled labourer new zealand has a number of reciprocal working holiday agreements , allowing people in their 20s to live and work overseas , usually for up to a year social reforms pioneered by new zealand include women 's suffrage , the welfare state , and respect for indigenous peoples ( through the treaty of waitangi and the waitangi tribunal ) new zealanders , both those of pākehā and māori roots , have been described as an individualistic people , who take intrusion very personally , especially when it occurs onto private land ( but also sometimes in a wider sense ) a major difference between british and pākehā food was that meat was more readily available to all social classes in new zealand new zealanders increasingly come from many ethnic backgrounds , and most immigrants to new zealand have tried to reproduce their native cuisines or national dishes in new zealand

the māori are the indigenous inhabitants of new zealand they originated settlers from eastern polynesian islands , who arrived in new zealand in several waves of canoe voyages at some time between 1250 and 1300 oral history tells of a long voyage from hawaiki ( the mythical homeland in tropical polynesia ) in large ocean-going canoes ( waka ) central to many cultural events is the marae , where families and tribes gather for special occasions , such as pōwhiri or tangi māori often call themselves '' tangata whenua '' ( people of the land ) , placing particular importance on a lifestyle connected to land and sea communal living , sharing , and living off the land are strong traditional values the distinct values , history , and worldview of māori are expressed through traditional arts and skills such as haka , tā moko , waiata , carving , weaving , and poi the concept of tapu ( meaning taboo or sacred ) is also a strong force in māori culture , applied to objects , people , or even mountains māori traditionally had a penchant for war , especially between 1805 and 1842 during the musket wars and diseases introduced , destabilized the traditional māori society the treaty of waitangi 1840 formed the basis of the establishment of british rule over new zealand . pākehā ( new zealand european ) culture pākehā culture ( usually synonymous with new zealand european culture ) derives mainly from that of the british , particularly english settlers who colonised new zealand in the nineteenth century until about the 1950s many pākehā saw themselves as a british people , and retained strong cultural ties to '' mother england '' yet there was a common perception that people born in new zealand were likely to be physically stronger and more adaptable than people in britain the largely rural life in early new zealand led to the image of new zealanders being rugged , industrious problem solvers part of the problem is that high culture is often mistaken for culture in general , and the lack of recognition historically given to new zealand 's artists , writers and composers is seen as evidence of a lack of culture one of the goals of pākehā anti-racist groups of the 1980s was to enable pākehā to see their own culture as such , rather than thinking what they did was normal and what other people did was 'ethnic ' and strange miranda johnson ( 2005 ) , ' '' the land of the wrong white cloud '' : anti-racist organizations and pakeha identity politics in the 1970s ' , new zealand journal of history , 39 , 2 , pp.137–57 ethnic communities within new zealand retain features of their own cultures , and these have , in some areas , spread to become popular with the general population the popular music style of urban pasifika also has its origins in the new zealand pacific island community , and has become a major strand in new zealand music culture the annual pacific music awards recognise the contribution to new zealand music made by pacific island musicians and musical styles māori borrowing from pākehā culture from the 1830s many māori nominally converted to christianity and in the process learned to read and write , by the late nineteenth century new zealand when formal schooling finished for most at 12 , māori were as likely to be literate as pākehā a number of religions , such as pai mārire and ringatū , arose in the nineteenth century , blending māori tradition and christianity from the 1820s māori began building vessels in the european boat building tradition after the defeat of rebel māori who attempted to establish a renegade state in the king country , the adoption of pākehā culture became less of a free choice as pākehā began to outnumber māori men such as pomare , ngata and buck believed that further adopting pākehā culture would advance māori in new zealand ngata went on to become a leading new zealand politician and acting prime minister school of maori and pacific development & international centre for cultural studies ( iccs ) , pp from the early twentieth century and especially from the 1970s , māori activists began to protest against eurocentrism and demanded equal recognition for their own culture many māori have become successful practitioners of european-derived art forms ; indeed many of new zealand 's biggest arts success stories are māori or part māori māori culture has also provided inspiration to pākehā artists image : all blacks haka.jpg thumb 350px right a multi-ethnic all black squad perform a haka many pākehā in other countries use an aspect of māori culture to express their new zealandness one example of this is the '' haka party attack '' of 1979 university of auckland engineering students had a tradition of performing a mock haka at graduation after pleas from māori students to discontinue the practice were ignored , a group assaulted the engineering students walker , ranginui ( 1990 ) , ka whawhai tonu matou : struggle without end , pp.221–5 most pākehā are now more respectful of māori culture and often consult māori before using māori cultural forms both māori and pākehā have borrowed cultural forms and styles from other countries , particularly britain and the united states most popular new zealand music derives from anglo-american styles , particularly rock music , hip-hop , electronic dance music and related subgenres since the 2000s , dubstep , drum and bass , jungle trance and related subgenres , derived from england , has been further developed by new zealanders into a unique sound , exemplified by salmonella dub , shapeshifter and many others in general , the development of international mass media and mass communication has meant new zealanders have always been aware of developments in other countries ; this lends itself to the adoption of new forms and styles from overseas some of these differences show new zealand english to have more affinity with the english of southern england than australian english does the language went into decline in terms of use following european colonisation , but since the 1970s mildly successful efforts have been made to reverse this trend the 2013 census found that māori was spoken by 3.7 % of the population new zealand sign language new zealand sign language has its roots in british sign language ( bsl ) , and may be technically considered a dialect of british , australian and new zealand sign language ( banzsl ) it uses more lip-patterns in conjunction with hand and facial movement to cue signs than bsl , reflecting new zealand 's history of oralist education of deaf people according to the 2013 census , 174 languages are used in new zealand ( including sign languages ) because of this and new zealand 's small population , most new zealand artists , performers and writers struggle to make a living from their art some funding for the arts is provided through a specific arts based government department , creative new zealand heritage new zealand and the ministry for culture and heritage are national bodies that assist with heritage preservation both recorded stories and legends and also had religious roles a longstanding concern of pākehā artists has been the creation of a distinctly new zealand artistic style the haka ( often mistaken as always being a war dance or ritual challenge ) has become part of wider new zealand culture , being performed by the all blacks as a group ritual before international games and by homesick new zealanders of all races who want to express their new zealandness new zealand drama , both on stage and screen , has been plagued during much of its history by cost and lack of popular interest in new zealand culture hip-hop is popular and there are small but thriving live music , dance party and indie music scenes reggae is also popular within some communities , with bands such as herbs , katchafire , 1814 , house of shem , unity pacific all reflecting their roots , perspectives and cultural pride and heritage through their music a number of new zealand composers have developed international reputations voted 'new zealand player of the century ' by new zealand rugby monthly magazine , meads was the second all black to be sent off the field , and once played a match with a broken arm the evolution of café culture has been a major part of growth within new zealand

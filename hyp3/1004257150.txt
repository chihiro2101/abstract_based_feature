the māori are the indigenous inhabitants of new zealand they originated settlers from eastern polynesian islands , who arrived in new zealand in several waves of canoe voyages at some time between 1250 and 1300 māori settled the islands and developed a distinct culture over several hundred years central to many cultural events is the marae , where families and tribes gather for special occasions , such as pōwhiri or tangi māori often call themselves '' tangata whenua '' ( people of the land ) , placing particular importance on a lifestyle connected to land and sea the concept of tapu ( meaning taboo or sacred ) is also a strong force in māori culture , applied to objects , people , or even mountains māori traditionally had a penchant for war , especially between 1805 and 1842 during the musket wars and diseases introduced , destabilized the traditional māori society the most serious conflict between māori and european settlers was between 1863 and 1864 which resulted in land being confiscated from the defeated tribes from 1820 māori entered a long period of cultural and numerical decline however their population began to increase again from the late nineteenth century , and a cultural revival began in the 1960s , sometimes known as the māori renaissance . pākehā ( new zealand european ) culture pākehā culture ( usually synonymous with new zealand european culture ) derives mainly from that of the british , particularly english settlers who colonised new zealand in the nineteenth century until about the 1950s many pākehā saw themselves as a british people , and retained strong cultural ties to '' mother england '' the largely rural life in early new zealand led to the image of new zealanders being rugged , industrious problem solvers it has been claimed that pākehā do not actually have a culture , or if they do it is not a distinct one part of the problem is that high culture is often mistaken for culture in general , and the lack of recognition historically given to new zealand 's artists , writers and composers is seen as evidence of a lack of culture in contrast , pākehā pop culture is generally highly visible and valued others argue that belief in the 'absence ' of culture in nz is a symptom of white privilege , allowing members of a dominant group to see their culture as 'normal ' or 'default ' , rather than as a specific position of relative advantage tim mccreanor ( 2005 ) , ' '' sticks and stones may break my bones there was an interest in '' kiwiana '' —items from new zealand 's heritage that are seen as representing iconic kiwi elements , such as the pohutakawa ( new zealand christmas tree ) , pāua-shell ash-tray , buzzy bee , pineapple lumps , gumboots and jandals ethnic communities within new zealand retain features of their own cultures , and these have , in some areas , spread to become popular with the general population to celebrate its diverse pacific cultures , the auckland region hosts several pacific island festivals the annual pacific music awards recognise the contribution to new zealand music made by pacific island musicians and musical styles māori borrowing from pākehā culture since the arrival of europeans , māori have been receptive adopters of most aspects of pākehā culture from the 1830s many māori nominally converted to christianity and in the process learned to read and write , by the late nineteenth century new zealand when formal schooling finished for most at 12 , māori were as likely to be literate as pākehā a number of religions , such as pai mārire and ringatū , arose in the nineteenth century , blending māori tradition and christianity european tools and particularly weapons were frequently decorated with traditional motifs , for example wooden musket and rifle stocks acquired elaborate carving parliament passed legislation affecting māori , such as the native schools act ( 1867 ) which required english to be the dominant medium of instruction for māori children although this was weakly enforced from the 1880s a small number of western educated graduates emerged from māori colleges such as te aute men such as pomare , ngata and buck believed that further adopting pākehā culture would advance māori in new zealand together they formed the young māori party which was very influential in starting improved health and education for māori ngata went on to become a leading new zealand politician and acting prime minister māori traditional culture became less critical in normal everyday life as advanced western technology- electricity , lights telegraphy , roads , mass production radio , aeroplanes and refrigeration made most aspects of māori culture redundant but was still practised at events such as tangihanga ( funerals ) school of maori and pacific development & international centre for cultural studies ( iccs ) , pp many māori have become successful practitioners of european-derived art forms ; indeed many of new zealand 's biggest arts success stories are māori or part māori māori culture has also provided inspiration to pākehā artists since the late nineteenth century , pākehā have used māori cultural practices when they required something distinctive the tourist industry has also made heavy use of māori culture in an effort to present tourists with distinctly new zealand experiences and items walker , ranginui ( 1990 ) , ka whawhai tonu matou : struggle without end , pp.221–5 most pākehā are now more respectful of māori culture and often consult māori before using māori cultural forms although there is evidence of a '' new zealand style '' , many groups incorporate new zealand themes into their work , so this style affects each genre differently the visual arts have also shown the influence of international movements , for example cubism in the early work of colin mccahon the māori language and new zealand sign language also have official status , in certain contexts , as defined by their respective statutes new zealand english is close to australian english in pronunciation , but has several differences often overlooked by people from outside these countries some of these differences show new zealand english to have more affinity with the english of southern england than australian english does the new zealand accent also has some scottish and irish influences from the large number of settlers from those places during the 19th century at the time of the 2013 census , english was spoken by 96.1 % of the total population the language went into decline in terms of use following european colonisation , but since the 1970s mildly successful efforts have been made to reverse this trend these include the granting of official language status through the māori language act 1987 , a māori language week and a māori television channel new zealand sign language has its roots in british sign language ( bsl ) , and may be technically considered a dialect of british , australian and new zealand sign language ( banzsl ) new zealand has two 'high culture ' traditions : māori and western however most cultural material consumed in new zealand is imported from overseas , particularly from britain and the united states because of this and new zealand 's small population , most new zealand artists , performers and writers struggle to make a living from their art from the early twentieth century āpirana ngata and others began a programme of reviving traditional māori arts , and many new meeting houses were built with traditional carving and tukutuku woven wall panels were built rita angus and others used the landscape to try and achieve this while painters such as gordon walters used māori motifs a number of māori artists , including paratene matchitt and shane cotton have combined western modernism with traditional māori art kapa haka , ( kapa meaning 'rank ' or 'row ' and haka referring to a māori dance ) , is the 'cultural dance ' component of traditional māori performing arts one of its major features was tapu ( sacred and/or forbidden ) , which was used to maintain the status of chiefs and tohunga ( priests ) and also for purposes such as conserving resources it has been blamed for new zealand 's culture of heavy drinking and its high male suicide rate new zealand social policy has tended to oscillate between social progressiveness and conservatism architecture of new zealand national symbols of new zealand demographics of new zealand history of new zealand public holidays in new zealand culture of australia etiquette in australia and new zealand christmas in new zealand

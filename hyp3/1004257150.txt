the māori are the indigenous inhabitants of new zealand they originated settlers from eastern polynesian islands , who arrived in new zealand in several waves of canoe voyages at some time between 1250 and 1300 māori settled the islands and developed a distinct culture over several hundred years central to many cultural events is the marae , where families and tribes gather for special occasions , such as pōwhiri or tangi communal living , sharing , and living off the land are strong traditional values the concept of tapu ( meaning taboo or sacred ) is also a strong force in māori culture , applied to objects , people , or even mountains māori traditionally had a penchant for war , especially between 1805 and 1842 during the musket wars and diseases introduced , destabilized the traditional māori society new zealand became partly self-governing in 1852 with the establishment of its own parliament the most serious conflict between māori and european settlers was between 1863 and 1864 which resulted in land being confiscated from the defeated tribes from 1820 māori entered a long period of cultural and numerical decline however their population began to increase again from the late nineteenth century , and a cultural revival began in the 1960s , sometimes known as the māori renaissance . pākehā ( new zealand european ) culture pākehā culture ( usually synonymous with new zealand european culture ) derives mainly from that of the british , particularly english settlers who colonised new zealand in the nineteenth century until about the 1950s many pākehā saw themselves as a british people , and retained strong cultural ties to '' mother england '' the largely rural life in early new zealand led to the image of new zealanders being rugged , industrious problem solvers another distinctive trait of pākehā culture has been the egalitarian tradition , as opposed to the british class system it has been claimed that pākehā do not actually have a culture , or if they do it is not a distinct one part of the problem is that high culture is often mistaken for culture in general , and the lack of recognition historically given to new zealand 's artists , writers and composers is seen as evidence of a lack of culture in contrast , pākehā pop culture is generally highly visible and valued liu , tim mccreanor , tracey mcintosh and teresia teaiwa , eds , new zealand identities : departures and destinations , p.53 one of the goals of pākehā anti-racist groups of the 1980s was to enable pākehā to see their own culture as such , rather than thinking what they did was normal and what other people did was 'ethnic ' and strange miranda johnson ( 2005 ) , ' '' the land of the wrong white cloud '' : anti-racist organizations and pakeha identity politics in the 1970s ' , new zealand journal of history , 39 , 2 , pp.137–57 from the 1980s pākehā began to further explore their distinctive traditions and to argue that new zealanders had a culture which was neither māori nor british these include dalmatian settlers in northland , danish settlers in inland hawke 's bay , and cantonese people and levantine settlers in otago these added to larger-scale pākehā settlement which itself varied between english settlers ( e.g from the mid twentieth century on , waves of immigrants have entered the country from different ethnic backgrounds , notable dutch and central europeans during the 1950s , pacific islanders since the 1960s , and northern chinese , indians , and southeast asians since the 1980s various aspects of each culture have added to new zealand culture ; chinese new year is celebrated for example , especially in auckland and dunedin , and south auckland has strong samoan cultural links the annual pacific music awards recognise the contribution to new zealand music made by pacific island musicians and musical styles pacific island heritage is also celebrated in much of new zealand 's fine art , with notable artists such as fatu feu ' u , lily laita , john pule , yuki kihara , and michel tuffery all heavily influenced by their pacific origins since the arrival of europeans , māori have been receptive adopters of most aspects of pākehā culture from the 1830s many māori nominally converted to christianity and in the process learned to read and write , by the late nineteenth century new zealand when formal schooling finished for most at 12 , māori were as likely to be literate as pākehā a number of religions , such as pai mārire and ringatū , arose in the nineteenth century , blending māori tradition and christianity similarly māori traditional chants were put to victorian music , or written to european tunes , european designs and metal tools adopted by carvers , altering their style and british fabrics and cloth , such as blanketing adopted to form new dress from the 1820s māori began building vessels in the european boat building tradition many of these activities were conducted in collaboration with pākehā traders and settlers the majority of māori encouraged their children to learn the english language and pākehā ways of life to function economically and socially men such as pomare , ngata and buck believed that further adopting pākehā culture would advance māori in new zealand many māori have become successful practitioners of european-derived art forms ; indeed many of new zealand 's biggest arts success stories are māori or part māori pākehā borrowing from māori culture many pākehā in other countries use an aspect of māori culture to express their new zealandness ) for many years pākehā did not consult māori over the use of their culture , and māori generally did not protest loudly unless a symbol was being used in a particularly inappropriate way after pleas from māori students to discontinue the practice were ignored , a group assaulted the engineering students they were later charged with assault but defended by māori elders who testified that the engineers ' haka was deeply offensive when kingitanga allowed michael king to write the biography of '' princess '' te puea , because of his sensitivity to māori , they still withheld material that would not show her in a good light since the 2000s , dubstep , drum and bass , jungle trance and related subgenres , derived from england , has been further developed by new zealanders into a unique sound , exemplified by salmonella dub , shapeshifter and many others other languages are also spoken in new zealand by some immigrant communities new zealand english is close to australian english in pronunciation , but has several differences often overlooked by people from outside these countries the new zealand accent also has some scottish and irish influences from the large number of settlers from those places during the 19th century these include the granting of official language status through the māori language act 1987 , a māori language week and a māori television channel new zealand sign language has its roots in british sign language ( bsl ) , and may be technically considered a dialect of british , australian and new zealand sign language ( banzsl ) there are 62.5 % similarities found in british sign language and nzsl , compared with 33 % of nzsl signs found in american sign language it uses more lip-patterns in conjunction with hand and facial movement to cue signs than bsl , reflecting new zealand 's history of oralist education of deaf people its vocabulary includes māori concepts such as marae and tangi , and signs for new zealand placenames new zealand sign language became an official language of new zealand in april 2006 according to the 2013 census , 174 languages are used in new zealand ( including sign languages ) new zealand has two 'high culture ' traditions : māori and western because of this and new zealand 's small population , most new zealand artists , performers and writers struggle to make a living from their art some māori adopted western styles and a number of nineteenth century meeting houses feature walls painted with portraits and plant designs it has also been evidenced that new zealand 's lack of religion correlates with income and income correlates with urban location ; in auckland , for example , the richest suburbs are the least religious following the arrival of british settlers , māori adopted many of their foods , especially pork and potatoes , the latter of which transformed the māori agricultural economy architecture of new zealand national symbols of new zealand demographics of new zealand history of new zealand public holidays in new zealand culture of australia etiquette in australia and new zealand christmas in new zealand

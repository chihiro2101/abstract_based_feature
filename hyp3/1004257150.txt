the māori are the indigenous inhabitants of new zealand they originated settlers from eastern polynesian islands , who arrived in new zealand in several waves of canoe voyages at some time between 1250 and 1300 māori settled the islands and developed a distinct culture over several hundred years māori often call themselves '' tangata whenua '' ( people of the land ) , placing particular importance on a lifestyle connected to land and sea the distinct values , history , and worldview of māori are expressed through traditional arts and skills such as haka , tā moko , waiata , carving , weaving , and poi the concept of tapu ( meaning taboo or sacred ) is also a strong force in māori culture , applied to objects , people , or even mountains europeans migrated to new zealand in increasing numbers from 1855 māori traditionally had a penchant for war , especially between 1805 and 1842 during the musket wars and diseases introduced , destabilized the traditional māori society the treaty of waitangi 1840 formed the basis of the establishment of british rule over new zealand new zealand became partly self-governing in 1852 with the establishment of its own parliament however māori sold most of their land after 1870 and continued to do so until the 1980s . pākehā ( new zealand european ) culture pākehā culture ( usually synonymous with new zealand european culture ) derives mainly from that of the british , particularly english settlers who colonised new zealand in the nineteenth century yet there was a common perception that people born in new zealand were likely to be physically stronger and more adaptable than people in britain the largely rural life in early new zealand led to the image of new zealanders being rugged , industrious problem solvers within pākehā culture there are also sub-cultures derived from irish , italian and other european groups , as well as various non-ethnic subcultures tim mccreanor ( 2005 ) , ' '' sticks and stones may break my bones one of the goals of pākehā anti-racist groups of the 1980s was to enable pākehā to see their own culture as such , rather than thinking what they did was normal and what other people did was 'ethnic ' and strange miranda johnson ( 2005 ) , ' '' the land of the wrong white cloud '' : anti-racist organizations and pakeha identity politics in the 1970s ' , new zealand journal of history , 39 , 2 , pp.137–57 from the 1980s pākehā began to further explore their distinctive traditions and to argue that new zealanders had a culture which was neither māori nor british ethnic communities within new zealand retain features of their own cultures , and these have , in some areas , spread to become popular with the general population settler groups from many cultures added to the make-up of the country , with many groups concentrated around specific geographic areas two of the major ones are polyfest , which showcases performances of the secondary school cultural groups in the auckland region , and pasifika , a festival that celebrates pacific island heritage through traditional food , music , dance , and entertainment the popular music style of urban pasifika also has its origins in the new zealand pacific island community , and has become a major strand in new zealand music culture the annual pacific music awards recognise the contribution to new zealand music made by pacific island musicians and musical styles māori borrowing from pākehā culture since the arrival of europeans , māori have been receptive adopters of most aspects of pākehā culture from the 1830s many māori nominally converted to christianity and in the process learned to read and write , by the late nineteenth century new zealand when formal schooling finished for most at 12 , māori were as likely to be literate as pākehā a number of religions , such as pai mārire and ringatū , arose in the nineteenth century , blending māori tradition and christianity many of these activities were conducted in collaboration with pākehā traders and settlers parliament passed legislation affecting māori , such as the native schools act ( 1867 ) which required english to be the dominant medium of instruction for māori children although this was weakly enforced the majority of māori encouraged their children to learn the english language and pākehā ways of life to function economically and socially men such as pomare , ngata and buck believed that further adopting pākehā culture would advance māori in new zealand together they formed the young māori party which was very influential in starting improved health and education for māori many māori have become successful practitioners of european-derived art forms ; indeed many of new zealand 's biggest arts success stories are māori or part māori pākehā borrowing from māori culture since the late nineteenth century , pākehā have used māori cultural practices when they required something distinctive however pākehā artists such as colin mccahon and gordon walters have also incorporated māori motifs into their art , and a number of early pākehā writers used māori themes and topics in an effort to create an authentically new zealand literature the tourist industry has also made heavy use of māori culture in an effort to present tourists with distinctly new zealand experiences and items an example of this is the mass haka which takes place in parliament square in london every waitangi day some pākehā have been deeply involved in the revival of otherwise lost māori arts māori history has mainly been recorded by pākehā authors such as michael king , james belich and paul moon although there is evidence of a '' new zealand style '' , many groups incorporate new zealand themes into their work , so this style affects each genre differently since the 2000s , dubstep , drum and bass , jungle trance and related subgenres , derived from england , has been further developed by new zealanders into a unique sound , exemplified by salmonella dub , shapeshifter and many others the visual arts have also shown the influence of international movements , for example cubism in the early work of colin mccahon new zealand has three official languages the māori language and new zealand sign language also have official status , in certain contexts , as defined by their respective statutes new zealand english is close to australian english in pronunciation , but has several differences often overlooked by people from outside these countries some of these differences show new zealand english to have more affinity with the english of southern england than australian english does these include the granting of official language status through the māori language act 1987 , a māori language week and a māori television channel new zealand sign language new zealand sign language has its roots in british sign language ( bsl ) , and may be technically considered a dialect of british , australian and new zealand sign language ( banzsl ) early pākehā art focussed mainly on landscape painting , although some of the best known pākehā artists of the nineteenth century ( c kapa haka , ( kapa meaning 'rank ' or 'row ' and haka referring to a māori dance ) , is the 'cultural dance ' component of traditional māori performing arts kapa haka is an avenue for māori people to express their heritage and cultural identity through song and dance it has undergone a renaissance , with national competitions held yearly and kapa haka used in many state occasions new zealand drama , both on stage and screen , has been plagued during much of its history by cost and lack of popular interest in new zealand culture new zealand 's most popular comedian was the late billy t changes to british immigration law in this period required new zealanders to obtain visas to work in britain or live there for extended periods , unless they had recent british ancestry following the arrival of british settlers , māori adopted many of their foods , especially pork and potatoes , the latter of which transformed the māori agricultural economy new zealanders increasingly come from many ethnic backgrounds , and most immigrants to new zealand have tried to reproduce their native cuisines or national dishes in new zealand

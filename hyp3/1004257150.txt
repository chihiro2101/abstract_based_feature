the māori are the indigenous inhabitants of new zealand they originated settlers from eastern polynesian islands , who arrived in new zealand in several waves of canoe voyages at some time between 1250 and 1300 māori settled the islands and developed a distinct culture over several hundred years māori often call themselves '' tangata whenua '' ( people of the land ) , placing particular importance on a lifestyle connected to land and sea communal living , sharing , and living off the land are strong traditional values the distinct values , history , and worldview of māori are expressed through traditional arts and skills such as haka , tā moko , waiata , carving , weaving , and poi europeans migrated to new zealand in increasing numbers from 1855 māori traditionally had a penchant for war , especially between 1805 and 1842 during the musket wars and diseases introduced , destabilized the traditional māori society new zealand became partly self-governing in 1852 with the establishment of its own parliament however māori sold most of their land after 1870 and continued to do so until the 1980s from 1820 māori entered a long period of cultural and numerical decline however their population began to increase again from the late nineteenth century , and a cultural revival began in the 1960s , sometimes known as the māori renaissance . pākehā ( new zealand european ) culture pākehā culture ( usually synonymous with new zealand european culture ) derives mainly from that of the british , particularly english settlers who colonised new zealand in the nineteenth century until about the 1950s many pākehā saw themselves as a british people , and retained strong cultural ties to '' mother england '' yet there was a common perception that people born in new zealand were likely to be physically stronger and more adaptable than people in britain the largely rural life in early new zealand led to the image of new zealanders being rugged , industrious problem solvers another distinctive trait of pākehā culture has been the egalitarian tradition , as opposed to the british class system within pākehā culture there are also sub-cultures derived from irish , italian and other european groups , as well as various non-ethnic subcultures liu , tim mccreanor , tracey mcintosh and teresia teaiwa , eds , new zealand identities : departures and destinations , p.53 one of the goals of pākehā anti-racist groups of the 1980s was to enable pākehā to see their own culture as such , rather than thinking what they did was normal and what other people did was 'ethnic ' and strange miranda johnson ( 2005 ) , ' '' the land of the wrong white cloud '' : anti-racist organizations and pakeha identity politics in the 1970s ' , new zealand journal of history , 39 , 2 , pp.137–57 from the 1980s pākehā began to further explore their distinctive traditions and to argue that new zealanders had a culture which was neither māori nor british settler groups from many cultures added to the make-up of the country , with many groups concentrated around specific geographic areas these include dalmatian settlers in northland , danish settlers in inland hawke 's bay , and cantonese people and levantine settlers in otago māori borrowing from pākehā culture a number of religions , such as pai mārire and ringatū , arose in the nineteenth century , blending māori tradition and christianity from the 1820s māori began building vessels in the european boat building tradition after the defeat of rebel māori who attempted to establish a renegade state in the king country , the adoption of pākehā culture became less of a free choice as pākehā began to outnumber māori parliament passed legislation affecting māori , such as the native schools act ( 1867 ) which required english to be the dominant medium of instruction for māori children although this was weakly enforced the majority of māori encouraged their children to learn the english language and pākehā ways of life to function economically and socially men such as pomare , ngata and buck believed that further adopting pākehā culture would advance māori in new zealand māori culture has also provided inspiration to pākehā artists pākehā borrowing from māori culture the most famous example of this is the haka of the all blacks , a māori posture dance which is performed before international rugby matches ( there are many non-māori polynesian all blacks , thus making this a multi-ethnic borrowing ) although māori are generally involved , most participants are pākehā ( see hei-tiki ) for many years pākehā did not consult māori over the use of their culture , and māori generally did not protest loudly unless a symbol was being used in a particularly inappropriate way from the 1970s , māori increasingly began to object to pākehā use of their culture , especially when this use was disrespectful they were later charged with assault but defended by māori elders who testified that the engineers ' haka was deeply offensive some pākehā have been deeply involved in the revival of otherwise lost māori arts traditionally māori were reluctant to reveal their tribal knowledge to europeans for fear of being mocked or considered barbaric , and also a belief in keeping tribal secrets when kingitanga allowed michael king to write the biography of '' princess '' te puea , because of his sensitivity to māori , they still withheld material that would not show her in a good light new zealand has three official languages other languages are also spoken in new zealand by some immigrant communities the new zealand accent also has some scottish and irish influences from the large number of settlers from those places during the 19th century these include the granting of official language status through the māori language act 1987 , a māori language week and a māori television channel historically , there were distinct dialects of te reo , most notably a softer version associated with the southern extreme of the country , though these have been almost completely subsumed by a standardised dialect originally found around the waikato area new zealand sign language has its roots in british sign language ( bsl ) , and may be technically considered a dialect of british , australian and new zealand sign language ( banzsl ) there are 62.5 % similarities found in british sign language and nzsl , compared with 33 % of nzsl signs found in american sign language its vocabulary includes māori concepts such as marae and tangi , and signs for new zealand placenames new zealand sign language became an official language of new zealand in april 2006 about 20,000 people use new zealand sign language new zealand has two 'high culture ' traditions : māori and western because of this and new zealand 's small population , most new zealand artists , performers and writers struggle to make a living from their art heritage new zealand and the ministry for culture and heritage are national bodies that assist with heritage preservation most towns and cities have museums and often art galleries , and the national museum and art gallery is te papa ( 'our place ' ) , in wellington pre-colonial māori visual art had two main forms : carving and weaving from the early twentieth century āpirana ngata and others began a programme of reviving traditional māori arts , and many new meeting houses were built with traditional carving and tukutuku woven wall panels were built a longstanding concern of pākehā artists has been the creation of a distinctly new zealand artistic style new zealand men are supposed to still have many of these qualities , even though most new zealanders have lived in urban areas since the late nineteenth century a major difference between british and pākehā food was that meat was more readily available to all social classes in new zealand

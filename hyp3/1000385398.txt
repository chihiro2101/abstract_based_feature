1970s : richard and linda thompson by the 1970s , thompson had begun a relationship with the singer linda peters , who had sung on henry the human fly in october 1972 the couple were married , and thompson , with linda now effectively his front woman , regrouped for his next album and the next phase of his career the first richard and linda thompson album , i want to see the bright lights tonight , was recorded in may 1973 in short time and on a small budget largely because of the petrol shortage in britain and its impact on the availability of vinyl for records , bright lights was held back by island records for nearly a year before being released in april 1974 the album was well received by critics , though sales were less than stellar the thompsons recorded two more albums—hokey pokey and pour down like silver , both released in 1975—before richard thompson decided to leave the music business i want to see the bright lights tonight was recorded before this conversion , but released some time afterwards the songs for the second richard and linda album , hokey pokey , were similarly written some time ahead of the album 's recording and eventual release the trilogy of albums released before and after his sojourn in the commune was heavily influenced by thompson 's beliefs and by sufi scripture , but in the long run his religious beliefs have not influenced his work in an obvious manner he played on an album by sandy denny , and had undertaken a short tour and started recording with a group of musicians who were also sufis boyd had already invited richard thompson to play on julie covington 's debut album with spare studio time and the american session musicians hired to work on the covington album available , the thompsons went back into the studio to record under their own name for the first time in three years the resulting album , first light , was warmly received by critics but did not sell particularly well gerry rafferty had booked the thompsons as the support act for his 1980 tour , and had also used richard as a session player on his night owl album rafferty offered to finance the recording of a new richard and linda thompson album which he would then use to secure a contract for the thompsons nevertheless , rafferty kept his side of the bargain and presented the album to several record companies – none of which expressed interest in signing the thompsons about a year later joe boyd signed the thompsons to his small hannibal label and a new album was recorded linda thompson was pregnant at the time of the recording , so the album 's release was delayed until they could tour behind the album as an interim measure , richard thompson agreed to a short ( 5-day ) , low-key solo tour of the u.s it was during this tour that thompson and covey developed an intimate relationship , and during that month , richard and linda thompson separated both the album and their live shows were well received by the american media , and shoot out the lights effectively relaunched their career – just as their marriage was falling apart the performances , with a backing band including both simon nicol and dave mattacks of fairport convention , were seen as strong , but the tension between richard and linda was all too obvious his 1983 album hand of kindness saw him working with boyd again , but with a revised backing band and a more extroverted and up-tempo song selection in 1983 and 1984 he toured the us and europe with the richard thompson big band , which included two saxophone players in addition to the more usual rhythm section , second guitar and accordion thompson put together a new look backing band for the tour to promote this album , and some shows were filmed for a live video

while french immigrants had lived and traded alongside indigenous people since the earliest days of new france , coureurs des bois reached their apex during the second half of the 17th century after 1681 , the independent coureur des bois was gradually replaced by state-sponsored voyageurs , who were workers associated with licensed fur traders coureurs des bois lost their importance in the fur trade by the early 18th century yet , even while their numbers were dwindling , the coureur des bois developed as a symbol of the colony , creating a lasting myth that would continue to define new france for centuries shortly after founding a permanent settlement at quebec city in 1608 , samuel de champlain sought to ally himself with the local native peoples or first nations he decided to send french boys to live among them to learn their languages in order to serve as interpreters , in the hope of persuading the natives to trade with the french rather than with the dutch , who were active along the hudson river and atlantic coast early explorers such as brûlé educated the french colonists on the complex trading networks of the natives , served as interpreters , and encouraged the burgeoning fur trade over time , these early explorers and interpreters played an increasingly active role in the fur trade , paving the way for the emergence of the coureurs des bois proper in the mid-17th century the term '' coureur des bois '' is most strongly associated with those who engaged in the fur trade in ways that were considered to be outside of the mainstream native peoples were essential because they trapped the fur-bearing animals ( especially beaver ) and prepared the skins sexual relationships with coureurs des bois therefore offered native women an alternative to polygamy in a society with few available men french officials preferred coureurs des bois and voyageurs to settle around quebec city and montreal this figure has achieved mythological status , leading to many false accounts , and to the coureurs des bois being assimilated with '' canadiens '' ( canadians ) the myth of the coureurs des bois as representative of the canadians was stimulated by the writings of 18th-century jesuit priest f-x but charlevoix was influential ; his work was often cited by other authors , which further propagated the myth of the canadian as a coureur des bois finally , roman du terroir ( rural novels ) also added to the myth of the coureurs des bois by featuring them out of proportion to their number and influence most coureurs des bois were primarily or solely fur-trade entrepreneurs and not individually well known he traveled to new france with samuel de champlain radisson through this adoption , radisson learned native languages that would later serve him well as an interpreter

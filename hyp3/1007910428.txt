the cipm also says that '' in order to avoid any risk of confusion between the absorbed dose d and the dose equivalent h , the special names for the respective units should be used , that is , the name gray should be used instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of absorbed dose d and the name sievert instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of dose equivalent h '' the sievert – quantity h - dose equivalent :1 & nbsp ; sv 1 & nbsp ; joule/kilogram – a biological effect the sievert represents the equivalent biological effect of the deposit of a joule of radiation energy in a kilogram of human tissue : '' the sievert is the special name for the si unit of equivalent dose , effective dose , and operational dose quantities '' the sievert is used for a number of dose quantities which are described in this article and are part of the international radiological protection system devised and defined by the icrp and icru when the sievert is used to represent the stochastic effects of external ionizing radiation on human tissue , the radiation doses received are measured in practice by radiometric instruments and dosimeters and are called operational quantities although the cipm definition states that the linear energy transfer function ( q ) of the icru is used in calculating the biological effect , the icrp in 1990 icrp publication 60 published in 1991 developed the '' protection '' dose quantities effective and equivalent dose which are calculated from more complex computational models and are distinguished by not having the phrase dose equivalent in their name only the operational dose quantities which still use q for calculation retain the phrase dose equivalent however , there are joint icru/icrp proposals to simplify this system by changes to the operational dose definitions to harmonise with those of protection quantities radiation fluence is the number of radiation particles impinging per unit area per unit time , kerma is the ionising effect on air of gamma rays and x-rays and is used for instrument calibration , and absorbed dose is the amount of radiation energy deposited per unit mass in the matter or tissue under consideration operational quantities are measured in practice , and are the means of directly measuring dose uptake due to exposure , or predicting dose uptake in a measured environment icrp publication 103 , paragraph b64 as protection quantities can not practically be measured , operational quantities must be used to relate them to practical radiation instrument and dosimeter responses these dose quantities are weighted averages of absorbed dose designed to be representative of the stochastic health effects of radiation , and use of the sievert implies that appropriate weighting factors have been applied to the absorbed dose measurement or calculation ( expressed in grays ) the radiation factor w r , which is specific for radiation type r – this is used in calculating the equivalent dose h t which can be for the whole body or for individual organs acute radiation syndrome becquerel ( disintegrations per second ) counts per minute exposure ( radiation ) rutherford ( unit ) sverdrup ( a non-si unit of volume transport with the same symbol sv as sievert )

the si definition given by the cipm says : '' the quantity dose equivalent h is the product of the absorbed dose d of ionizing radiation and the dimensionless factor q ( quality factor ) defined as a function of linear energy transfer by the icru '' : h q × d the value of q is not defined further by cipm , but it requires the use of the relevant icru recommendations to provide this value the cipm also says that '' in order to avoid any risk of confusion between the absorbed dose d and the dose equivalent h , the special names for the respective units should be used , that is , the name gray should be used instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of absorbed dose d and the name sievert instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of dose equivalent h '' in summary : the gray – quantity d - absorbed dose :1 & nbsp ; gy 1 & nbsp ; joule/kilogram – a physical quantity 1 & nbsp ; gy is the deposit of a joule of radiation energy per kg of matter or tissue the sievert – quantity h - dose equivalent :1 & nbsp ; sv 1 & nbsp ; joule/kilogram – a biological effect the sievert represents the equivalent biological effect of the deposit of a joule of radiation energy in a kilogram of human tissue : '' the sievert is the special name for the si unit of equivalent dose , effective dose , and operational dose quantities '' the sievert is used for a number of dose quantities which are described in this article and are part of the international radiological protection system devised and defined by the icrp and icru when the sievert is used to represent the stochastic effects of external ionizing radiation on human tissue , the radiation doses received are measured in practice by radiometric instruments and dosimeters and are called operational quantities the icru is primarily responsible for the operational dose quantities , based upon the application of ionising radiation metrology , and the icrp is primarily responsible for the protection quantities , based upon modelling of dose uptake and biological sensitivity of the human body although the cipm definition states that the linear energy transfer function ( q ) of the icru is used in calculating the biological effect , the icrp in 1990 icrp publication 60 published in 1991 developed the '' protection '' dose quantities effective and equivalent dose which are calculated from more complex computational models and are distinguished by not having the phrase dose equivalent in their name operational quantities are measured in practice , and are the means of directly measuring dose uptake due to exposure , or predicting dose uptake in a measured environment icrp publication 103 , paragraph b147 the calibration of individual and area dosimeters in photon fields is performed by measuring the collision '' air kerma free in air '' under conditions of secondary electron equilibrium these dose quantities are weighted averages of absorbed dose designed to be representative of the stochastic health effects of radiation , and use of the sievert implies that appropriate weighting factors have been applied to the absorbed dose measurement or calculation ( expressed in grays ) since different radiation types have different biological effects for the same deposited energy , a corrective radiation weighting factor w r , which is dependent on the radiation type and on the target tissue , is applied to convert the absorbed dose measured in the unit gray to determine the equivalent dose

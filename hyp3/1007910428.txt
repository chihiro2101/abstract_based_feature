in summary : the gray – quantity d - absorbed dose :1 & nbsp ; gy 1 & nbsp ; joule/kilogram – a physical quantity the sievert – quantity h - dose equivalent :1 & nbsp ; sv 1 & nbsp ; joule/kilogram – a biological effect the sievert represents the equivalent biological effect of the deposit of a joule of radiation energy in a kilogram of human tissue the equivalence to absorbed dose is denoted by q : '' the sievert is the special name for the si unit of equivalent dose , effective dose , and operational dose quantities '' the sievert is used for a number of dose quantities which are described in this article and are part of the international radiological protection system devised and defined by the icrp and icru to relate these actual received doses to likely health effects , protection quantities have been developed to predict the likely health effects using the results of large epidemiological studies the icru is primarily responsible for the operational dose quantities , based upon the application of ionising radiation metrology , and the icrp is primarily responsible for the protection quantities , based upon modelling of dose uptake and biological sensitivity of the human body the icru/icrp dose quantities have specific purposes and meanings , but some use common words in a different order there can be confusion between , for instance , equivalent dose and dose equivalent only the operational dose quantities which still use q for calculation retain the phrase dose equivalent operational quantities are measured in practice , and are the means of directly measuring dose uptake due to exposure , or predicting dose uptake in a measured environment the sievert is used in external radiation protection for equivalent dose ( the external-source , whole-body exposure effects , in a uniform field ) , and effective dose ( which depends on the body parts irradiated ) when a whole body is irradiated uniformly only the radiation weighting factor w r is used , and the effective dose equals the whole body equivalent dose this approach calculates the biological risk contribution to the whole body , taking into account complete or partial irradiation , and the radiation type or types

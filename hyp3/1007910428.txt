in summary : the gray – quantity d - absorbed dose :1 & nbsp ; gy 1 & nbsp ; joule/kilogram – a physical quantity the sievert – quantity h - dose equivalent :1 & nbsp ; sv 1 & nbsp ; joule/kilogram – a biological effect the sievert represents the equivalent biological effect of the deposit of a joule of radiation energy in a kilogram of human tissue : '' the sievert is the special name for the si unit of equivalent dose , effective dose , and operational dose quantities '' the sievert is used for a number of dose quantities which are described in this article and are part of the international radiological protection system devised and defined by the icrp and icru to relate these actual received doses to likely health effects , protection quantities have been developed to predict the likely health effects using the results of large epidemiological studies consequently , this has required the creation of a number of different dose quantities within a coherent system developed by the icru working with the icrp the icru is primarily responsible for the operational dose quantities , based upon the application of ionising radiation metrology , and the icrp is primarily responsible for the protection quantities , based upon modelling of dose uptake and biological sensitivity of the human body icrp publication 103 , paragraph b147 the calibration of individual and area dosimeters in photon fields is performed by measuring the collision '' air kerma free in air '' under conditions of secondary electron equilibrium kramer physikalisch-technische bundesanstalt ( ptb ) , d-38116 braunschweig , germany simple ( non-anthropomorphic ) '' phantoms '' are used to relate operational quantities to measured free-air irradiation to allow for back-scattering and absorption of the human body , the '' slab phantom '' is used to represent the human torso for practical calibration of whole body dosimeters icrp publication 103 , paragraph b64 as protection quantities can not practically be measured , operational quantities must be used to relate them to practical radiation instrument and dosimeter responses the radiation factor w r , which is specific for radiation type r – this is used in calculating the equivalent dose h t which can be for the whole body or for individual organs when a whole body is irradiated uniformly only the radiation weighting factor w r is used , and the effective dose equals the whole body equivalent dose since different radiation types have different biological effects for the same deposited energy , a corrective radiation weighting factor w r , which is dependent on the radiation type and on the target tissue , is applied to convert the absorbed dose measured in the unit gray to determine the equivalent dose

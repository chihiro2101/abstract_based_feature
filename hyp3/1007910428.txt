the cipm also says that '' in order to avoid any risk of confusion between the absorbed dose d and the dose equivalent h , the special names for the respective units should be used , that is , the name gray should be used instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of absorbed dose d and the name sievert instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of dose equivalent h '' the sievert represents the equivalent biological effect of the deposit of a joule of radiation energy in a kilogram of human tissue icrp definition of the sievert : '' the sievert is the special name for the si unit of equivalent dose , effective dose , and operational dose quantities '' the sievert is used for a number of dose quantities which are described in this article and are part of the international radiological protection system devised and defined by the icrp and icru when the sievert is used to represent the stochastic effects of external ionizing radiation on human tissue , the radiation doses received are measured in practice by radiometric instruments and dosimeters and are called operational quantities consequently , this has required the creation of a number of different dose quantities within a coherent system developed by the icru working with the icrp the icru is primarily responsible for the operational dose quantities , based upon the application of ionising radiation metrology , and the icrp is primarily responsible for the protection quantities , based upon modelling of dose uptake and biological sensitivity of the human body only the operational dose quantities which still use q for calculation retain the phrase dose equivalent these were outlined at the 3rd international symposium on radiological protection in october 2015 , and if implemented would make the naming of operational quantities more logical by introducing '' dose to lens of eye '' and '' dose to local skin '' as equivalent doses kramer physikalisch-technische bundesanstalt ( ptb ) , d-38116 braunschweig , germany simple ( non-anthropomorphic ) '' phantoms '' are used to relate operational quantities to measured free-air irradiation protection quantities are calculated models , and are used as '' limiting quantities '' to specify exposure limits to ensure , in the words of icrp , '' that the occurrence of stochastic health effects is kept below unacceptable levels and that tissue reactions are avoided '' icrp publication 103 , paragraph b64 as protection quantities can not practically be measured , operational quantities must be used to relate them to practical radiation instrument and dosimeter responses when a whole body is irradiated uniformly only the radiation weighting factor w r is used , and the effective dose equals the whole body equivalent dose since different radiation types have different biological effects for the same deposited energy , a corrective radiation weighting factor w r , which is dependent on the radiation type and on the target tissue , is applied to convert the absorbed dose measured in the unit gray to determine the equivalent dose

in summary : the gray – quantity d - absorbed dose :1 & nbsp ; gy 1 & nbsp ; joule/kilogram – a physical quantity 1 & nbsp ; gy is the deposit of a joule of radiation energy per kg of matter or tissue the icrp definition of the sievert is : icrp publication 103 - glossary : '' the sievert is the special name for the si unit of equivalent dose , effective dose , and operational dose quantities '' the sievert is used for a number of dose quantities which are described in this article and are part of the international radiological protection system devised and defined by the icrp and icru when the sievert is used to represent the stochastic effects of external ionizing radiation on human tissue , the radiation doses received are measured in practice by radiometric instruments and dosimeters and are called operational quantities consequently , this has required the creation of a number of different dose quantities within a coherent system developed by the icru working with the icrp the icru is primarily responsible for the operational dose quantities , based upon the application of ionising radiation metrology , and the icrp is primarily responsible for the protection quantities , based upon modelling of dose uptake and biological sensitivity of the human body only the operational dose quantities which still use q for calculation retain the phrase dose equivalent in the usa there are differently named dose quantities which are not part of the icrp nomenclature operational quantities are measured in practice , and are the means of directly measuring dose uptake due to exposure , or predicting dose uptake in a measured environment protection quantities are calculated models , and are used as '' limiting quantities '' to specify exposure limits to ensure , in the words of icrp , '' that the occurrence of stochastic health effects is kept below unacceptable levels and that tissue reactions are avoided '' the sievert is used in external radiation protection for equivalent dose ( the external-source , whole-body exposure effects , in a uniform field ) , and effective dose ( which depends on the body parts irradiated ) these dose quantities are weighted averages of absorbed dose designed to be representative of the stochastic health effects of radiation , and use of the sievert implies that appropriate weighting factors have been applied to the absorbed dose measurement or calculation ( expressed in grays ) when a whole body is irradiated uniformly only the radiation weighting factor w r is used , and the effective dose equals the whole body equivalent dose

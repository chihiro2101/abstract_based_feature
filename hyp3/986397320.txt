an adequate account of quantum indeterminacy requires a theory of measurement many theories have been proposed since the beginning of quantum mechanics and quantum measurement continues to be an active research area in both theoretical and experimental physics khalili , quantum measurements , cambridge university press , 1992 in this formulation , the state of a physical system corresponds to a vector of length 1 in a hilbert space h over the complex numbers if the system is in state ψ , then immediately after measurement the system will occupy a state which is an eigenvector e of a and the observed value λ will be the corresponding eigenvalue of the equation a e λ e quantum indeterminacy is often understood as information ( or lack of it ) whose existence we infer , occurring in individual quantum systems , prior to measurement in diametrical contrast , in the case of quantum physics , the theorems of kochen and specker , s kochen and e p specker , the problem of hidden variables in quantum mechanics , journal of mathematics and mechanics 17 ( 1967 ) , 59–87 tomasz paterek , johannes kofler , robert prevedel , peter klimek , markus aspelmeyer , anton zeilinger , and caslav brukner , '' logical independence and quantum randomness '' , new journal of physics 12 ( 2010 ) , no tomasz paterek , johannes kofler , robert prevedel , peter klimek , markus aspelmeyer , anton zeilinger , and caslav brukner , '' logical independence and quantum randomness — with experimental data '' , ( 2010 ) uncertainty principle quantum mechanics quantum entanglement complementarity ( physics ) interpretations of quantum mechanics : comparisons chart quantum measurement counterfactual definiteness epr paradox von neumann , mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics , princeton university press , 1955

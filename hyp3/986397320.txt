an adequate account of quantum indeterminacy requires a theory of measurement many theories have been proposed since the beginning of quantum mechanics and quantum measurement continues to be an active research area in both theoretical and experimental physics that theory was based in turn on the theory of projection-valued measures for self-adjoint operators which had been recently developed ( by von neumann and independently by marshall stone ) and the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics ( attributed by von neumann to paul dirac ) quantum mechanics , moreover , gives a recipe for computing a probability distribution pr on the possible outcomes given the initial system state is ψ logical independence and quantum randomness in diametrical contrast , in the case of quantum physics , the theorems of kochen and specker , s kochen and e p specker , the problem of hidden variables in quantum mechanics , journal of mathematics and mechanics 17 ( 1967 ) , 59–87 the inequalities of john bell , john bell , on the einstein podolsky rosen paradox , physics 1 ( 1964 ) , 195–200 they proved that quantum randomness is , exclusively , the output of measurement experiments whose input settings introduce logical independence into quantum systems tomasz paterek , johannes kofler , robert prevedel , peter klimek , markus aspelmeyer , anton zeilinger , and caslav brukner , '' logical independence and quantum randomness '' , new journal of physics 12 ( 2010 ) , no uncertainty principle quantum mechanics quantum entanglement complementarity ( physics ) interpretations of quantum mechanics : comparisons chart quantum measurement counterfactual definiteness epr paradox von neumann , mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics , princeton university press , 1955

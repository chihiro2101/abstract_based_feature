an adequate account of quantum indeterminacy requires a theory of measurement many theories have been proposed since the beginning of quantum mechanics and quantum measurement continues to be an active research area in both theoretical and experimental physics possibly the first systematic attempt at a mathematical theory was developed by john von neumann if the system is in state ψ , then immediately after measurement the system will occupy a state which is an eigenvector e of a and the observed value λ will be the corresponding eigenvalue of the equation a e λ e quantum mechanics , moreover , gives a recipe for computing a probability distribution pr on the possible outcomes given the initial system state is ψ this is a probability measure defined on the borel subsets of r which is the probability distribution obtained by measuring a in s quantum indeterminacy is often understood as information ( or lack of it ) whose existence we infer , occurring in individual quantum systems , prior to measurement in diametrical contrast , in the case of quantum physics , the theorems of kochen and specker , s kochen and e p specker , the problem of hidden variables in quantum mechanics , journal of mathematics and mechanics 17 ( 1967 ) , 59–87 alain aspect , philippe grangier , and gérard roger , experimental realization of einstein–podolsky–rosen–bohm gedankenexperiment : a new violation of bell ’ s inequalities , physical review letters 49 ( 1982 ) , no tomasz paterek , johannes kofler , robert prevedel , peter klimek , markus aspelmeyer , anton zeilinger , and caslav brukner , '' logical independence and quantum randomness '' , new journal of physics 12 ( 2010 ) , no uncertainty principle quantum mechanics quantum entanglement complementarity ( physics ) interpretations of quantum mechanics : comparisons chart quantum measurement counterfactual definiteness epr paradox

an adequate account of quantum indeterminacy requires a theory of measurement many theories have been proposed since the beginning of quantum mechanics and quantum measurement continues to be an active research area in both theoretical and experimental physics that theory was based in turn on the theory of projection-valued measures for self-adjoint operators which had been recently developed ( by von neumann and independently by marshall stone ) and the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics ( attributed by von neumann to paul dirac ) quantum mechanics , moreover , gives a recipe for computing a probability distribution pr on the possible outcomes given the initial system state is ψ quantum indeterminacy is often understood as information ( or lack of it ) whose existence we infer , occurring in individual quantum systems , prior to measurement alain aspect , philippe grangier , and gérard roger , experimental realization of einstein–podolsky–rosen–bohm gedankenexperiment : a new violation of bell ’ s inequalities , physical review letters 49 ( 1982 ) , no tomasz paterek , johannes kofler , robert prevedel , peter klimek , markus aspelmeyer , anton zeilinger , and caslav brukner , '' logical independence and quantum randomness — with experimental data '' , ( 2010 ) tomasz paterek , johannes kofler , robert prevedel , peter klimek , markus aspelmeyer , anton zeilinger , and caslav brukner , '' logical independence and quantum randomness '' , new journal of physics 12 ( 2010 ) , no tomasz paterek , johannes kofler , robert prevedel , peter klimek , markus aspelmeyer , anton zeilinger , and caslav brukner , '' logical independence and quantum randomness — with experimental data '' , ( 2010 ) in 2020 , steve faulkner reported on work following up on the findings of tomasz paterek et al ; showing what logical independence in the paterek boolean propositions means , in the domain of matrix mechanics proper von neumann , mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics , princeton university press , 1955

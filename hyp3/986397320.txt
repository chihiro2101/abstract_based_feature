an adequate account of quantum indeterminacy requires a theory of measurement many theories have been proposed since the beginning of quantum mechanics and quantum measurement continues to be an active research area in both theoretical and experimental physics that theory was based in turn on the theory of projection-valued measures for self-adjoint operators which had been recently developed ( by von neumann and independently by marshall stone ) and the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics ( attributed by von neumann to paul dirac ) in this formulation , the state of a physical system corresponds to a vector of length 1 in a hilbert space h over the complex numbers if the system is in state ψ , then immediately after measurement the system will occupy a state which is an eigenvector e of a and the observed value λ will be the corresponding eigenvalue of the equation a e λ e quantum mechanics , moreover , gives a recipe for computing a probability distribution pr on the possible outcomes given the initial system state is ψ this is a probability measure defined on the borel subsets of r which is the probability distribution obtained by measuring a in s quantum indeterminacy is often understood as information ( or lack of it ) whose existence we infer , occurring in individual quantum systems , prior to measurement quantum randomness is the statistical manifestation of that indeterminacy , witnessable in results of experiments repeated many times all indicate that quantum randomness does not stem from any such physical information uncertainty principle quantum mechanics quantum entanglement complementarity ( physics ) interpretations of quantum mechanics : comparisons chart quantum measurement counterfactual definiteness epr paradox

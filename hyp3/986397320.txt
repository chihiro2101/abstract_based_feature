an adequate account of quantum indeterminacy requires a theory of measurement many theories have been proposed since the beginning of quantum mechanics and quantum measurement continues to be an active research area in both theoretical and experimental physics in this formulation , the state of a physical system corresponds to a vector of length 1 in a hilbert space h over the complex numbers if the system is in state ψ , then immediately after measurement the system will occupy a state which is an eigenvector e of a and the observed value λ will be the corresponding eigenvalue of the equation a e λ e quantum mechanics , moreover , gives a recipe for computing a probability distribution pr on the possible outcomes given the initial system state is ψ in diametrical contrast , in the case of quantum physics , the theorems of kochen and specker , s kochen and e p specker , the problem of hidden variables in quantum mechanics , journal of mathematics and mechanics 17 ( 1967 ) , 59–87 tomasz paterek , johannes kofler , robert prevedel , peter klimek , markus aspelmeyer , anton zeilinger , and caslav brukner , '' logical independence and quantum randomness '' , new journal of physics 12 ( 2010 ) , no tomasz paterek , johannes kofler , robert prevedel , peter klimek , markus aspelmeyer , anton zeilinger , and caslav brukner , '' logical independence and quantum randomness — with experimental data '' , ( 2010 ) , the researchers demonstrate a link connecting quantum randomness and logical independence in a formal system of boolean propositions tomasz paterek , johannes kofler , robert prevedel , peter klimek , markus aspelmeyer , anton zeilinger , and caslav brukner , '' logical independence and quantum randomness '' , new journal of physics 12 ( 2010 ) , no tomasz paterek , johannes kofler , robert prevedel , peter klimek , markus aspelmeyer , anton zeilinger , and caslav brukner , '' logical independence and quantum randomness — with experimental data '' , ( 2010 )

phoenician sailors visiting its coast around the 12th century bc mistook the european rabbit for the familiar rock hyrax ( procavia capensis ) of their homeland in the british isles , these preserves were known as warrens or , and rabbits were known as , to differentiate them from the similar hare the term warren was also used as a name for the location where hares , partridges and pheasants were kept , under the watch of a game keeper called a warrener in order to confine and protect the rabbits , a wall or thick hedge might be constructed around the warren , or a warren might be established on an island the practice of rabbit domestication also came from rome christian monasteries throughout europe and the middle east kept rabbits since at least the 5th century while rabbits might be allowed to wander freely within the monastery walls , a more common method was the employment of rabbit courts or rabbit pits a rabbit court was a walled area lined with brick and cement , while a pit was similar , although less well-lined and more sunken rabbits would be kept in a group in these pits or courts , and individuals collected when desired for eating or pelts rabbit keepers transferred rabbits to individual hutches or pens for easy cleaning , handling , or for selective breeding , as pits did not allow keepers to perform these tasks hutches or pens were originally made of wood , but are now more frequently made of metal in order to allow for better sanitation these rabbits were largely 'common ' or 'meat ' rabbits and not of a particular breed , although regional strains and types did arise another rabbit type that standardized into a breed was the brabancon , a meat rabbit of the region of limbourg and what is now belgium rabbits of this breed were bred for the ostend port market , destined for london markets the development of the refrigerated shipping vessels led to the eventual collapse of the european meat rabbit trade , as the over-populated feral rabbits in australia could now be harvested and sold the brabancon is now considered extinct , although a descendant , the dutch breed , remains a popular small rabbit for the pet trade in addition to being harvested for meat , properly prepared rabbit pelts were also an economic factor both wild rabbits and domestic rabbit pelts were valued , and it followed that pelts of particular rabbits would be more highly prized as far back as 1631 , price differentials were noted between ordinary rabbit pelts and the pelts of quality 'riche ' rabbit in the champagne region of france they made their way to england , where during the rule of king henry viii , laws banned the exportation of long-haired rabbits as they were a national treasure european explorers and sailors took rabbits with them to new ports around the world , and brought new varieties back to europe and england with them rabbits , along with goats and other hardy livestock , were frequently released on islands to produce a food supply for later ships while cattle and horses were used across the socio-economic spectrum , and especially were concentrated among the wealthy , rabbits were kept by lower-income classes and peasants from the santa duromo mountains of brazil comes the rustico , which is known in the united states as the brazilian rabbit with the rise of scientific animal breeding in the late 1700s , led by robert bakewell ( among others ) , distinct livestock breeds were developed for specific purposes this led to a short-lived '' boom '' in rabbit breeding , selling , and speculation , when a quality breeding animal could bring 75 to 200 image : farmrabbits.jpg thumb right meat-type rabbits were raised for supplementary food in the great depression of the 1930s. 350px science played another role in rabbit raising , this time with rabbits themselves as the tools used for scientific advancement production of quality animals for meat sale and scientific experimentation has driven a number of advancements in rabbit husbandry and nutrition this eventually resulted in the development of various recipes for pellet feed gradual refinement of diets has resulted in the widespread availability of pelleted feeds , which increase yield , reduce waste , and promote rabbit health , particularly maternal breeding health the final leg of rabbit breeding & mdash ; beyond meat , wool , fur , and laboratory use & mdash ; was the breeding of 'fancy ' animals as pets and curiosities the term 'fancy ' was originally applied to long-eared lop rabbit , as they were the first type to be bred for exhibition with the advent of national-level organizations , rabbit breeders had a framework for establishing breeds and varieties utilizing recognized standards , and breeding for rabbit exhibitions began to expand rapidly this may have been , in part , because rabbits require less physical space than dogs or cats , and do not require a specialized habitat like goldfish several breeds of rabbit & mdash ; such as the holland lop , the polish , the netherland dwarf , and the lionhead & mdash ; have been specifically bred for the pet trade outside of the exhibition circles , rabbit raising remained a small-scale but persistent household and farm endeavor , in many locations unregulated by the rules that governed the production of larger livestock with the ongoing urbanization of populations worldwide , rabbit raising gradually declined , but saw resurgences in both europe and north america during world warii , in conjunction with victory garden eventually , farmers across europe and in the united states began to approach cuniculture with the same scientific principles as had already been applied to the production of grains , poultry , and hoofed livestock national breeding centers focused on developing strains for production purposes , including meat , pelts , and wool meanwhile , rabbit raising for local markets gained prominence in developing nations as an economical means of producing protein the animals are particularly useful in areas where women are limited in employment outside the household , because rabbits can be kept successfully in small areas these same factors have contributed to the increased popularity of rabbits as '' backyard livestock '' among locavores and homesteaders in more developed countries in north america and europe in contrast , throughout asia ( and particularly in china ) rabbits are increasingly being raised and sold for export around the world approximately 1.2 billion rabbits are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide the use of animals , including rabbits , in animal testing has been subject to increased scrutiny in developed countries of beef , pork and poultry as a significant factor in choosing to raise rabbits for meat the specific future direction of cuniculture is unclear , but does not appear to be in danger of disappearing in any particular part of the world sub-par or '' cull '' animals from other breeding goals ( laboratory , exhibition , show , wool , or pet ) may also be used for meat , particularly in smallholder operations in contrast to the multitude of breeds and types used in smaller operations , breeds such as the new zealand and the californian , along with hybrids of these breeds , are most frequently utilized for meat in commercial rabbitries the primary qualities of good meat-rabbit breeding stock are growth rate and size at slaughter , but also good mothering ability various industries also have commonly accepted practices which produce predictable results for that type of rabbit product extensive cuniculture refers to the practice of keeping rabbits at a lower density and a lower production level than intensive culture in the biomedical research community and the pharmaceutical industry , rabbits genetics are important for producing antibodies , toxicity test , and in model organism research

beyond meat , wool , fur , and laboratory use & mdash ; was the breeding of 'fancy ' animals as pets and curiosities this organization would become the american rabbit breeders association with the advent of national-level organizations , rabbit breeders had a framework for establishing breeds and varieties utilizing recognized standards , and breeding for rabbit exhibitions began to expand rapidly while rabbits have been kept as companions for centuries , the sale of rabbits as pets began to rise in the last half of the twentieth century with the ongoing urbanization of populations worldwide , rabbit raising gradually declined , but saw resurgences in both europe and north america during world warii , in conjunction with victory garden eventually , farmers across europe and in the united states began to approach cuniculture with the same scientific principles as had already been applied to the production of grains , poultry , and hoofed livestock meanwhile , rabbit raising for local markets gained prominence in developing nations as an economical means of producing protein various aid agencies promote the use of rabbits as livestock the animals are particularly useful in areas where women are limited in employment outside the household , because rabbits can be kept successfully in small areas the addition of rabbits to the watchlist of endangered heritage breeds that is kept by the livestock conservancy has also led to increased interest from livestock conservationists in contrast , throughout asia ( and particularly in china ) rabbits are increasingly being raised and sold for export around the world the world rabbit science association ( wrsa ) , formed in 1976 , was established '' to facilitate in all possible ways the exchange of knowledge and experience among persons in all parts of the world who are contributing to the advancement of the various branches of the rabbit industry '' meanwhile , various rescue groups under the house rabbit society umbrella have taken an increasingly strident stance against any breeding of rabbits ( even as food in developing countries ) on the grounds that it contributes to the number of mistreated , unwanted or abandoned animals of beef , pork and poultry as a significant factor in choosing to raise rabbits for meat smallholder or backyard operations remain common in many countries , while large-scale commercial operations are centered in europe and asia for the smaller enterprise , multiple local rabbit breeds may be easier to use in contrast to the multitude of breeds and types used in smaller operations , breeds such as the new zealand and the californian , along with hybrids of these breeds , are most frequently utilized for meat in commercial rabbitries specific lines of commercial breeds have been developed that maximize these qualities – rabbits may be slaughtered as early as seven weeks and does of these strains routinely raise litters of 8 to 12 kits other breeds of rabbit developed for commercial meat production include the florida white and the altex an operation in an urban area may emphasize odor control and space utilization by stacking cages over each other with automatic cleaning systems that flush away faeces and urine in rural sub-tropical and tropical areas , temperature control becomes more of an issue , and the use of air-conditioned buildings is common in many areas prior to the development of modern balanced rabbit rations , rabbit breeding was limited by the nutrition available to the doe advances in nutrition , such as those published by the usda rabbit research station , resulted in greater health for breeding animals and the survival of young stock criticism of the more intensive breeding schedules has been made on the grounds that re-breeding that closely is excessively stressful for the doe in efficient production systems , rabbits can turn 20 percent of the proteins they eat into edible meat , compared to 22 to 23 percent for broiler chickens , 16 to 18 percent for pigs and 8 to 12 percent for beef ; rabbit meat is more economical in terms of feed energy than beef '' rabbit roasters '' are rabbits from 90 days to 6 & nbsp ; months old , weighing in live weight many rabbit keepers breed their rabbits for competition among other purebred rabbits of the same breed jpg japan in 2016 file : rabbits kaurharman.6.jpg india in 2016 file : rabbit cage.jpg poland in 2009 file : খরগোশ.jpg bangladesh in 2013 file : károly nyúl.jpg hungary in 2015 pasturing rabbits within a fence ( but not a cage ) , also known as colony husbandry , has not been commonly pursued due to the high death rate from weather and predators the american rabbit breeders association ( arba ) was founded in 1910 and is the national authority on rabbit raising and rabbit breeds , having a uniform '' standard of perfection '' , registration and judging system a rabbit 's coat has either two pigments ( pheomelanin for yellow , and eumelanin for dark brown ) or no pigment ( for an albino rabbit )

an abundance of ancient rabbits may have played a part in the naming of spain phoenician sailors visiting its coast around the 12th century bc mistook the european rabbit for the familiar rock hyrax ( procavia capensis ) of their homeland among the numerous foodstuffs imported by sea to rome during her domination of the mediterranean were shipments of rabbits from spain romans also imported ferrets for rabbit hunting , and the romans then distributed rabbits and the habit of rabbit keeping to the rest of italy , to france , and then across the roman empire , including the british isles rabbits were kept in both walled areas as well as more extensively in game-preserves the term warren was also used as a name for the location where hares , partridges and pheasants were kept , under the watch of a game keeper called a warrener in order to confine and protect the rabbits , a wall or thick hedge might be constructed around the warren , or a warren might be established on an island with the rise of falconry , hawk and falcon were also used to collect rabbits and hares the practice of rabbit domestication also came from rome christian monasteries throughout europe and the middle east kept rabbits since at least the 5th century while rabbits might be allowed to wander freely within the monastery walls , a more common method was the employment of rabbit courts or rabbit pits rabbits would be kept in a group in these pits or courts , and individuals collected when desired for eating or pelts husbandry of the rabbits , including collecting weeds and grasses for fodder , typically fell to the children of the household or farmstead some of these strains remain as regional breeds , such as the gotland of sweden , while others , such as the land kaninchen , a spotted rabbit of germany , have become extinct another rabbit type that standardized into a breed was the brabancon , a meat rabbit of the region of limbourg and what is now belgium rabbits of this breed were bred for the ostend port market , destined for london markets the brabancon is now considered extinct , although a descendant , the dutch breed , remains a popular small rabbit for the pet trade in addition to being harvested for meat , properly prepared rabbit pelts were also an economic factor both wild rabbits and domestic rabbit pelts were valued , and it followed that pelts of particular rabbits would be more highly prized as far back as 1631 , price differentials were noted between ordinary rabbit pelts and the pelts of quality 'riche ' rabbit in the champagne region of france they made their way to england , where during the rule of king henry viii , laws banned the exportation of long-haired rabbits as they were a national treasure in 1723 , long haired rabbits were imported to southern france by english sailors , who described the animals as originally coming from the angora region of turkey while cattle and horses were used across the socio-economic spectrum , and especially were concentrated among the wealthy , rabbits were kept by lower-income classes and peasants from the santa duromo mountains of brazil comes the rustico , which is known in the united states as the brazilian rabbit production of quality animals for meat sale and scientific experimentation has driven a number of advancements in rabbit husbandry and nutrition the final leg of rabbit breeding & mdash ; beyond meat , wool , fur , and laboratory use & mdash ; was the breeding of 'fancy ' animals as pets and curiosities the term 'fancy ' was originally applied to long-eared lop rabbit , as they were the first type to be bred for exhibition this organization would become the american rabbit breeders association with the advent of national-level organizations , rabbit breeders had a framework for establishing breeds and varieties utilizing recognized standards , and breeding for rabbit exhibitions began to expand rapidly closely overlapping with breeding for exhibition and for fur has been the breeding of rabbits for the pet trade this may have been , in part , because rabbits require less physical space than dogs or cats , and do not require a specialized habitat like goldfish national breeding centers focused on developing strains for production purposes , including meat , pelts , and wool the addition of rabbits to the watchlist of endangered heritage breeds that is kept by the livestock conservancy has also led to increased interest from livestock conservationists the world rabbit science association ( wrsa ) , formed in 1976 , was established '' to facilitate in all possible ways the exchange of knowledge and experience among persons in all parts of the world who are contributing to the advancement of the various branches of the rabbit industry '' the use of animals , including rabbits , in animal testing has been subject to increased scrutiny in developed countries increasing regulation has raised the cost of producing animals for this purpose , and made other experimental options more attractive of beef , pork and poultry as a significant factor in choosing to raise rabbits for meat the specific future direction of cuniculture is unclear , but does not appear to be in danger of disappearing in any particular part of the world for the smaller enterprise , multiple local rabbit breeds may be easier to use or other heritage type breeds may be used only in a specific geographic area sub-par or '' cull '' animals from other breeding goals ( laboratory , exhibition , show , wool , or pet ) may also be used for meat , particularly in smallholder operations in contrast to the multitude of breeds and types used in smaller operations , breeds such as the new zealand and the californian , along with hybrids of these breeds , are most frequently utilized for meat in commercial rabbitries the primary qualities of good meat-rabbit breeding stock are growth rate and size at slaughter , but also good mothering ability specific lines of commercial breeds have been developed that maximize these qualities â€“ rabbits may be slaughtered as early as seven weeks and does of these strains routinely raise litters of 8 to 12 kits , any color other than white ) typically garner a lower price than '' white fryers '' ( also called '' albino fryers '' ) , because of the slightly darker tinge to the meat china is among the world 's largest producers and consumers of rabbit meat , accounting for some 30 % of the world 's total consumption . wool rabbits and pelt rabbits in 1972 , around 450,000 rabbits were used for experiments in the united states , decreasing to around 240,000 in 2006 albino rabbits are typically used in the draize tests because they have less tear flow than other animals and the lack of eye pigment make the effects easier to visualize various industries also have commonly accepted practices which produce predictable results for that type of rabbit product the american rabbit breeders association ( arba ) was founded in 1910 and is the national authority on rabbit raising and rabbit breeds , having a uniform '' standard of perfection '' , registration and judging system the study of rabbit genetics is of interest to medical researchers , fanciers , and the fur and meat industries a rabbit 's coat has either two pigments ( pheomelanin for yellow , and eumelanin for dark brown ) or no pigment ( for an albino rabbit )

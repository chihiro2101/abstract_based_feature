phoenician sailors visiting its coast around the 12th century bc mistook the european rabbit for the familiar rock hyrax ( procavia capensis ) of their homeland among the numerous foodstuffs imported by sea to rome during her domination of the mediterranean were shipments of rabbits from spain romans also imported ferrets for rabbit hunting , and the romans then distributed rabbits and the habit of rabbit keeping to the rest of italy , to france , and then across the roman empire , including the british isles the term warren was also used as a name for the location where hares , partridges and pheasants were kept , under the watch of a game keeper called a warrener with the rise of falconry , hawk and falcon were also used to collect rabbits and hares the practice of rabbit domestication also came from rome christian monasteries throughout europe and the middle east kept rabbits since at least the 5th century while rabbits might be allowed to wander freely within the monastery walls , a more common method was the employment of rabbit courts or rabbit pits rabbits would be kept in a group in these pits or courts , and individuals collected when desired for eating or pelts husbandry of the rabbits , including collecting weeds and grasses for fodder , typically fell to the children of the household or farmstead these rabbits were largely 'common ' or 'meat ' rabbits and not of a particular breed , although regional strains and types did arise some of these strains remain as regional breeds , such as the gotland of sweden , while others , such as the land kaninchen , a spotted rabbit of germany , have become extinct another rabbit type that standardized into a breed was the brabancon , a meat rabbit of the region of limbourg and what is now belgium the brabancon is now considered extinct , although a descendant , the dutch breed , remains a popular small rabbit for the pet trade in addition to being harvested for meat , properly prepared rabbit pelts were also an economic factor both wild rabbits and domestic rabbit pelts were valued , and it followed that pelts of particular rabbits would be more highly prized as far back as 1631 , price differentials were noted between ordinary rabbit pelts and the pelts of quality 'riche ' rabbit in the champagne region of france ( this regional type would go on to be recognized as the , the 'silver rabbit of champagne ' they made their way to england , where during the rule of king henry viii , laws banned the exportation of long-haired rabbits as they were a national treasure european explorers and sailors took rabbits with them to new ports around the world , and brought new varieties back to europe and england with them the importations occasionally met with disastrous results , such as in the rabbits in australia while cattle and horses were used across the socio-economic spectrum , and especially were concentrated among the wealthy , rabbits were kept by lower-income classes and peasants with the rise of scientific animal breeding in the late 1700s , led by robert bakewell ( among others ) , distinct livestock breeds were developed for specific purposes breed of rabbit from europe to the united states , beginning in 1888 ) in 1900 , a single animal-export company recorded 6,000 rabbits successfully shipped to the united states and canada production of quality animals for meat sale and scientific experimentation has driven a number of advancements in rabbit husbandry and nutrition while early rabbit keepers were limited to local and seasonal foodstuffs , which did not permit the maximization of production , health or growth , by 1930 researchers were conducting experiments in rabbit nutrition , similar to the experiments that had isolated vitamins and other nutritional components the final leg of rabbit breeding & mdash ; beyond meat , wool , fur , and laboratory use & mdash ; was the breeding of 'fancy ' animals as pets and curiosities meanwhile , in the united states , clubs promoting various breeds were chartered in the 1880s , and the national pet stock association was formed in 1910 with the advent of national-level organizations , rabbit breeders had a framework for establishing breeds and varieties utilizing recognized standards , and breeding for rabbit exhibitions began to expand rapidly closely overlapping with breeding for exhibition and for fur has been the breeding of rabbits for the pet trade outside of the exhibition circles , rabbit raising remained a small-scale but persistent household and farm endeavor , in many locations unregulated by the rules that governed the production of larger livestock national agriculture breeding stations were established to improve local rabbit strains and to introduce more productive breeds meanwhile , rabbit raising for local markets gained prominence in developing nations as an economical means of producing protein the animals are particularly useful in areas where women are limited in employment outside the household , because rabbits can be kept successfully in small areas the addition of rabbits to the watchlist of endangered heritage breeds that is kept by the livestock conservancy has also led to increased interest from livestock conservationists in contrast , throughout asia ( and particularly in china ) rabbits are increasingly being raised and sold for export around the world of beef , pork and poultry as a significant factor in choosing to raise rabbits for meat the specific future direction of cuniculture is unclear , but does not appear to be in danger of disappearing in any particular part of the world rabbits have been raised for meat production in a variety of settings around the world for the smaller enterprise , multiple local rabbit breeds may be easier to use sub-par or '' cull '' animals from other breeding goals ( laboratory , exhibition , show , wool , or pet ) may also be used for meat , particularly in smallholder operations in contrast to the multitude of breeds and types used in smaller operations , breeds such as the new zealand and the californian , along with hybrids of these breeds , are most frequently utilized for meat in commercial rabbitries the primary qualities of good meat-rabbit breeding stock are growth rate and size at slaughter , but also good mothering ability rabbit breeding stock raised in france is particularly popular with meat rabbit farmers internationally , some being purchased as far away as china in order to improve the local rabbit herd in rural sub-tropical and tropical areas , temperature control becomes more of an issue , and the use of air-conditioned buildings is common in many areas breeding schedules for rabbits vary by individual operation prior to the development of modern balanced rabbit rations , rabbit breeding was limited by the nutrition available to the doe determination of health effects of breeding schedules is made more difficult by the domestic rabbit 's reproductive physiology â€“ in contrast to several other mammal species , rabbits are more likely to develop uterine cancer when not used for breeding than when bred frequently the most extensive rabbit '' keeping '' methods would be the harvest of wild or feral rabbits for meat or fur market , such as occurred in australia prior to the 1990s warren-based cuniculture is somewhat more controlled , as the animals are generally kept to a specific area and a limited amount of supplemental feeding provided the american rabbit breeders association ( arba ) was founded in 1910 and is the national authority on rabbit raising and rabbit breeds , having a uniform '' standard of perfection '' , registration and judging system among rabbit fanciers and in the fiber and fur industry , the genetics of coat color and hair properties are paramount

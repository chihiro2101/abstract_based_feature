an abundance of ancient rabbits may have played a part in the naming of spain domestication of the european rabbit rose slowly from a combination of game-keeping and animal husbandry among the numerous foodstuffs imported by sea to rome during her domination of the mediterranean were shipments of rabbits from spain romans also imported ferrets for rabbit hunting , and the romans then distributed rabbits and the habit of rabbit keeping to the rest of italy , to france , and then across the roman empire , including the british isles a warrener was responsible for controlling poachers and other predators and would collect the rabbits with snares , nets , hounds ( such as greyhounds ) , or by hunting with ferrets with the rise of falconry , hawk and falcon were also used to collect rabbits and hares while rabbits might be allowed to wander freely within the monastery walls , a more common method was the employment of rabbit courts or rabbit pits rabbit keepers transferred rabbits to individual hutches or pens for easy cleaning , handling , or for selective breeding , as pits did not allow keepers to perform these tasks left rabbits were typically kept as part of the household livestock by peasants and villagers throughout europe husbandry of the rabbits , including collecting weeds and grasses for fodder , typically fell to the children of the household or farmstead these rabbits were largely 'common ' or 'meat ' rabbits and not of a particular breed , although regional strains and types did arise the development of the refrigerated shipping vessels led to the eventual collapse of the european meat rabbit trade , as the over-populated feral rabbits in australia could now be harvested and sold the brabancon is now considered extinct , although a descendant , the dutch breed , remains a popular small rabbit for the pet trade in addition to being harvested for meat , properly prepared rabbit pelts were also an economic factor both wild rabbits and domestic rabbit pelts were valued , and it followed that pelts of particular rabbits would be more highly prized as far back as 1631 , price differentials were noted between ordinary rabbit pelts and the pelts of quality 'riche ' rabbit in the champagne region of france ) among the earliest of the commercial breeds was the angora , which some say may have developed in the carpathian mountains they made their way to england , where during the rule of king henry viii , laws banned the exportation of long-haired rabbits as they were a national treasure in 1723 , long haired rabbits were imported to southern france by english sailors , who described the animals as originally coming from the angora region of turkey thus two distinct strains arose , one in france and one in england with the second voyage of christopher columbus in 1494 , european domestic livestock were brought to the new world while cattle and horses were used across the socio-economic spectrum , and especially were concentrated among the wealthy , rabbits were kept by lower-income classes and peasants from the santa duromo mountains of brazil comes the rustico , which is known in the united states as the brazilian rabbit this led to a short-lived '' boom '' in rabbit breeding , selling , and speculation , when a quality breeding animal could bring 75 to 200 image : farmrabbits.jpg thumb right meat-type rabbits were raised for supplementary food in the great depression of the 1930s. 350px science played another role in rabbit raising , this time with rabbits themselves as the tools used for scientific advancement beginning with louis pasteur 's experiments in rabies in the later half of the nineteenth century , rabbits have been used as models to investigate various medical and biological problems , including the transmission of disease and protective antiserum the final leg of rabbit breeding & mdash ; beyond meat , wool , fur , and laboratory use & mdash ; was the breeding of 'fancy ' animals as pets and curiosities this club eventually expanded to become the british rabbit council this organization would become the american rabbit breeders association thousands of rabbit shows take place each year and are sanctioned in canada , mexico , malaysia , indonesia and the united states by arba with the advent of national-level organizations , rabbit breeders had a framework for establishing breeds and varieties utilizing recognized standards , and breeding for rabbit exhibitions began to expand rapidly closely overlapping with breeding for exhibition and for fur has been the breeding of rabbits for the pet trade while rabbits have been kept as companions for centuries , the sale of rabbits as pets began to rise in the last half of the twentieth century several breeds of rabbit & mdash ; such as the holland lop , the polish , the netherland dwarf , and the lionhead & mdash ; have been specifically bred for the pet trade outside of the exhibition circles , rabbit raising remained a small-scale but persistent household and farm endeavor , in many locations unregulated by the rules that governed the production of larger livestock with the ongoing urbanization of populations worldwide , rabbit raising gradually declined , but saw resurgences in both europe and north america during world warii , in conjunction with victory garden national breeding centers focused on developing strains for production purposes , including meat , pelts , and wool the animals are particularly useful in areas where women are limited in employment outside the household , because rabbits can be kept successfully in small areas the addition of rabbits to the watchlist of endangered heritage breeds that is kept by the livestock conservancy has also led to increased interest from livestock conservationists approximately 1.2 billion rabbits are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide increasing regulation has raised the cost of producing animals for this purpose , and made other experimental options more attractive the variety of applications , as well as the versatile utility of the species , appears sufficient to keep rabbit raising a going concern in one aspect or another around the planet for the smaller enterprise , multiple local rabbit breeds may be easier to use dwarf breeds , too , are rarely used , due to the high production costs , slow growth , and low offspring rate in contrast to the multitude of breeds and types used in smaller operations , breeds such as the new zealand and the californian , along with hybrids of these breeds , are most frequently utilized for meat in commercial rabbitries the primary qualities of good meat-rabbit breeding stock are growth rate and size at slaughter , but also good mothering ability other breeds of rabbit developed for commercial meat production include the florida white and the altex rabbit breeding stock raised in france is particularly popular with meat rabbit farmers internationally , some being purchased as far away as china in order to improve the local rabbit herd prior to the development of modern balanced rabbit rations , rabbit breeding was limited by the nutrition available to the doe the most extensive rabbit '' keeping '' methods would be the harvest of wild or feral rabbits for meat or fur market , such as occurred in australia prior to the 1990s the american rabbit breeders association ( arba ) was founded in 1910 and is the national authority on rabbit raising and rabbit breeds , having a uniform '' standard of perfection '' , registration and judging system the study of rabbit genetics is of interest to medical researchers , fanciers , and the fur and meat industries the genes are : b : black ( chestnut agouti , black otter , black ) b : brown ( chocolate agouti , chocolate otter , chocolate ) '' c '' represents the color locus

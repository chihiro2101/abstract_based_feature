an abundance of ancient rabbits may have played a part in the naming of spain phoenician sailors visiting its coast around the 12th century bc mistook the european rabbit for the familiar rock hyrax ( procavia capensis ) of their homeland domestication of the european rabbit rose slowly from a combination of game-keeping and animal husbandry among the numerous foodstuffs imported by sea to rome during her domination of the mediterranean were shipments of rabbits from spain romans also imported ferrets for rabbit hunting , and the romans then distributed rabbits and the habit of rabbit keeping to the rest of italy , to france , and then across the roman empire , including the british isles in order to confine and protect the rabbits , a wall or thick hedge might be constructed around the warren , or a warren might be established on an island the practice of rabbit domestication also came from rome christian monasteries throughout europe and the middle east kept rabbits since at least the 5th century while rabbits might be allowed to wander freely within the monastery walls , a more common method was the employment of rabbit courts or rabbit pits a rabbit court was a walled area lined with brick and cement , while a pit was similar , although less well-lined and more sunken left rabbits were typically kept as part of the household livestock by peasants and villagers throughout europe these rabbits were largely 'common ' or 'meat ' rabbits and not of a particular breed , although regional strains and types did arise some of these strains remain as regional breeds , such as the gotland of sweden , while others , such as the land kaninchen , a spotted rabbit of germany , have become extinct another rabbit type that standardized into a breed was the brabancon , a meat rabbit of the region of limbourg and what is now belgium rabbits of this breed were bred for the ostend port market , destined for london markets the development of the refrigerated shipping vessels led to the eventual collapse of the european meat rabbit trade , as the over-populated feral rabbits in australia could now be harvested and sold the brabancon is now considered extinct , although a descendant , the dutch breed , remains a popular small rabbit for the pet trade both wild rabbits and domestic rabbit pelts were valued , and it followed that pelts of particular rabbits would be more highly prized in 1723 , long haired rabbits were imported to southern france by english sailors , who described the animals as originally coming from the angora region of turkey the importations occasionally met with disastrous results , such as in the rabbits in australia while cattle and horses were used across the socio-economic spectrum , and especially were concentrated among the wealthy , rabbits were kept by lower-income classes and peasants with the rise of scientific animal breeding in the late 1700s , led by robert bakewell ( among others ) , distinct livestock breeds were developed for specific purposes ) in 1900 , a single animal-export company recorded 6,000 rabbits successfully shipped to the united states and canada production of quality animals for meat sale and scientific experimentation has driven a number of advancements in rabbit husbandry and nutrition gradual refinement of diets has resulted in the widespread availability of pelleted feeds , which increase yield , reduce waste , and promote rabbit health , particularly maternal breeding health the final leg of rabbit breeding & mdash ; beyond meat , wool , fur , and laboratory use & mdash ; was the breeding of 'fancy ' animals as pets and curiosities meanwhile , in the united states , clubs promoting various breeds were chartered in the 1880s , and the national pet stock association was formed in 1910 thousands of rabbit shows take place each year and are sanctioned in canada , mexico , malaysia , indonesia and the united states by arba with the advent of national-level organizations , rabbit breeders had a framework for establishing breeds and varieties utilizing recognized standards , and breeding for rabbit exhibitions began to expand rapidly closely overlapping with breeding for exhibition and for fur has been the breeding of rabbits for the pet trade while rabbits have been kept as companions for centuries , the sale of rabbits as pets began to rise in the last half of the twentieth century several breeds of rabbit & mdash ; such as the holland lop , the polish , the netherland dwarf , and the lionhead & mdash ; have been specifically bred for the pet trade outside of the exhibition circles , rabbit raising remained a small-scale but persistent household and farm endeavor , in many locations unregulated by the rules that governed the production of larger livestock eventually , farmers across europe and in the united states began to approach cuniculture with the same scientific principles as had already been applied to the production of grains , poultry , and hoofed livestock national agriculture breeding stations were established to improve local rabbit strains and to introduce more productive breeds national breeding centers focused on developing strains for production purposes , including meat , pelts , and wool meanwhile , rabbit raising for local markets gained prominence in developing nations as an economical means of producing protein various aid agencies promote the use of rabbits as livestock in more recent years and in some countries , cuniculture has come under pressure from animal rights activists on several fronts meanwhile , various rescue groups under the house rabbit society umbrella have taken an increasingly strident stance against any breeding of rabbits ( even as food in developing countries ) on the grounds that it contributes to the number of mistreated , unwanted or abandoned animals the specific future direction of cuniculture is unclear , but does not appear to be in danger of disappearing in any particular part of the world the variety of applications , as well as the versatile utility of the species , appears sufficient to keep rabbit raising a going concern in one aspect or another around the planet for the smaller enterprise , multiple local rabbit breeds may be easier to use or other heritage type breeds may be used only in a specific geographic area sub-par or '' cull '' animals from other breeding goals ( laboratory , exhibition , show , wool , or pet ) may also be used for meat , particularly in smallholder operations in contrast to the multitude of breeds and types used in smaller operations , breeds such as the new zealand and the californian , along with hybrids of these breeds , are most frequently utilized for meat in commercial rabbitries specific lines of commercial breeds have been developed that maximize these qualities â€“ rabbits may be slaughtered as early as seven weeks and does of these strains routinely raise litters of 8 to 12 kits rabbit breeding stock raised in france is particularly popular with meat rabbit farmers internationally , some being purchased as far away as china in order to improve the local rabbit herd various industries also have commonly accepted practices which produce predictable results for that type of rabbit product may be part of large-scale operations , while individual rabbits in smaller setups may receive better & mdash ; or worse & mdash ; care the study of rabbit genetics is of interest to medical researchers , fanciers , and the fur and meat industries among rabbit fanciers and in the fiber and fur industry , the genetics of coat color and hair properties are paramount a rabbit 's coat has either two pigments ( pheomelanin for yellow , and eumelanin for dark brown ) or no pigment ( for an albino rabbit )

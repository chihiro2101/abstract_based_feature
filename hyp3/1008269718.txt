socrates , the philosopher who runs the thinkery strepsiades , student who joins the thinkery pheidippides , his son chaerephon , disciple of socrates the clouds the play begins with strepsiades suddenly sitting up in bed while his son , pheidippides , remains blissfully asleep in the bed next to him pheidippides at first agrees to do as he 's asked then changes his mind when he learns that his father wants to enroll him in the thinkery , a school for wastrels and bums that no self-respecting , athletic young man dares to be associated with strepsiades explains that students of the thinkery learn how to turn inferior arguments into winning arguments and this is the only way he can beat their aggrieved creditors in court pheidippides however will not be persuaded and strepsiades decides to enroll himself in the thinkery in spite of his advanced age the philosopher descends and quickly begins the induction ceremony for the new elderly student , the highlight of which is a parade of the clouds , the patron goddesses of thinkers and other layabouts the clouds arrive singing majestically of the regions whence they arose and of the land they have now come to visit , loveliest in all being greece socrates leads him into the dingy thinkery for his first lesson and the clouds step forward to address the audience putting aside their cloud-like costumes , the chorus declares that this is the author 's cleverest play and that it cost him the greatest effort the chorus then resumes its appearance as clouds , promising divine favours if the audience punishes cleon for corruption and rebuking athenians for messing about with the calendar , since this has put athens out of step with the moon his son , pheidippides , subsequently yields to threats by strepsiades and reluctantly returns with him to the thinkery , where they encounter the personified arguments superior ( right ) and inferior ( wrong ) , associates of socrates at the end of the debate , a quick survey of the audience reveals that buggers – people schooled by inferior arguments – have got into the most powerful positions in athens superior argument accepts his inevitable defeat , inferior argument leads pheidippides into the thinkery for a life-changing education and strepsiades goes home happy rejoicing in the prospect of talking their way out of financial trouble , strepsiades leads the youth home for celebrations , just moments before the first of their aggrieved creditors arrives with a witness to summon him to court thus the original production of the clouds in 423 bc came at a time when athens was looking forward to a period of peace aristophanes however had singled cleon out for special treatment in his previous play the knights in 424 and there are relatively few references to him in the clouds freed from political and war-time issues , aristophanes focuses in the clouds on a broader issue that underlies many conflicts depicted in his plays – the issue of old versus new , or the battle of ideas aristophanes : lysistrata , the acharnians , the clouds a aristophanes : lysistrata , the acharnians , the clouds a aristophanes : lysistrata , the acharnians , clouds a aristophanes : lysistrata , the acharnians , clouds a plato appears to have considered the clouds a contributing factor in socrates ' trial and execution in 399 bc postmodern platos catherine h.zuckert , university of chicago press 1996 , page 133 , commenting on socrates and aristophanes by leo strauss , university of chicago press 1994 the oxford university dramatic society staged it in the original greek in 1905 , with c.w.mercer as strepsiades and compton mackenzie as pheidippides the clouds translated by ian johnston the clouds : a study guide john curtis franklin – aristophanes clouds essay on satire in aristophanes 's the clouds has a very good analysis of the clouds and on satire in general

protestants , for instance , consider marriage vow as an unchangeable divine law since it needs not only '' conciliar assertion '' but also the support of the scripture , making marriage a form of divine ordinance within the world of monks and nuns , a vow is sometimes a transaction between a person and a deity , where the former promises to render some service or gift , or devotes something valuable to the deity 's use the vow is a kind of oath , with the deity being both the witness and recipient of the promise in the roman catholic code of canon law , the vow and the oath are not considered acts of worship ( cultus ) like the liturgical celebration here , an important characteristic of the vow involves the manner by which non-catholics are recognized to be capable of making a vow , which must also be fulfilled by reason of the virtue of religion ' the vow , however , contained so large an element of ordinary prayer that in the greek language one and the same word ( ) expressed both the characteristic mark of the vow , as the suda and the greek church fathers remark , was that it was a promise either of things to be offered to god in the future and at once consecrated to him in view of their being so offered , or of austerities to be undergone a vow is an oath , but an oath is only a vow if the divine being is the recipient of the promise and is not merely a witness '' in christianity , the vow has more weight than an oath when approached from the view that it binds one to god whereas the oath binds one to man for the obligation of a vow arises from the fidelity we owe god , which binds us to fulfil our promises to him

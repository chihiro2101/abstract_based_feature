pressing the string against the fret reduces the vibrating length of the string to that between the bridge and the next fret between the fretting finger and the bridge frets make it much easier for a player to achieve an acceptable standard of intonation , since the frets determine the positions for the correct notes on instruments with frets that are thicker off the fingerboard , string tension and pitch vary with finger pressure behind the fret since the intonation of most modern western fretted instruments is equal tempered , the ratio of the distances of two consecutive frets to the bridge is \sqrt12 ( the twelfth root of two ) , or approximately 1.059463 to compensate for the increase in string tension when the string is pressed against the frets , the bridge position is adjusted slightly so the 12th fret plays exactly in tune image : saz frets.jpg thumb right frets tied on to the neck of a saz ; note microtone frets between semitones fan frets ( also fanned frets , slanted frets ) , or multi-scale : while frets are generally perpendicular to the instrument 's neck centerline and parallel to each other , on a '' fanned '' fretboard , the frets are angled ( spread like a fan ) with only one center fret perpendicular to the neck â€™ s centerline fat frets : on older guitars ( especially the fender stratocaster ) , frets were typically made out of thin wire , and some electric guitar players replaced that with thicker wire , for '' fat frets '' or '' jumbo frets '' as well , large frets , offering more metal , remain playable much longer than thin frets one arrangement is for the frets to extend only part of the way along the neck so that the higher notes can be played with the smooth expression possible with a fretless fingerboard tied gut frets , used on instruments such as the lute or viol , wear quickly , and must be replaced regularly

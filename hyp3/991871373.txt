pressing the string against the fret reduces the vibrating length of the string to that between the bridge and the next fret between the fretting finger and the bridge a disadvantage of frets is that they restrict pitches to the temperament defined by the fret positions a player may still influence intonation , however , by pulling the string to the side to increase string tension and raise the pitch on instruments with frets that are thicker off the fingerboard , string tension and pitch vary with finger pressure behind the fret since the intonation of most modern western fretted instruments is equal tempered , the ratio of the distances of two consecutive frets to the bridge is \sqrt12 ( the twelfth root of two ) , or approximately 1.059463 to compensate for the increase in string tension when the string is pressed against the frets , the bridge position is adjusted slightly so the 12th fret plays exactly in tune image : saz frets.jpg thumb right frets tied on to the neck of a saz ; note microtone frets between semitones fan frets ( also fanned frets , slanted frets ) , or multi-scale : while frets are generally perpendicular to the instrument 's neck centerline and parallel to each other , on a '' fanned '' fretboard , the frets are angled ( spread like a fan ) with only one center fret perpendicular to the neck ’ s centerline fat frets : on older guitars ( especially the fender stratocaster ) , frets were typically made out of thin wire , and some electric guitar players replaced that with thicker wire , for '' fat frets '' or '' jumbo frets '' fret buzz occurs when the vibrating part of one or more strings physically strikes the frets that are higher than the fretted note ( or open note ) how to replace frets – photo story installing the frets in a fretted stringed musical instrument an article on fret installation for a new instrument on the liutaio mottola lutherie information website

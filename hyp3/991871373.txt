pressing the string against the fret reduces the vibrating length of the string to that between the bridge and the next fret between the fretting finger and the bridge frets make it much easier for a player to achieve an acceptable standard of intonation , since the frets determine the positions for the correct notes a disadvantage of frets is that they restrict pitches to the temperament defined by the fret positions a player may still influence intonation , however , by pulling the string to the side to increase string tension and raise the pitch on instruments with frets that are thicker off the fingerboard , string tension and pitch vary with finger pressure behind the fret however , except for instruments that accommodate extensive string pulling , like the sitar , much less influence on intonation is possible than on unfretted instruments since the intonation of most modern western fretted instruments is equal tempered , the ratio of the distances of two consecutive frets to the bridge is \sqrt12 ( the twelfth root of two ) , or approximately 1.059463 theoretically , the twelfth fret should divide the string in two exact halves to compensate for the increase in string tension when the string is pressed against the frets , the bridge position is adjusted slightly so the 12th fret plays exactly in tune when this happens , the instrument may need refretting ( the frets are removed and replaced ) or , in less severe cases , '' fret dressing '' ( the frets are leveled , polished , and possibly recrowned ) how to replace frets â€“ photo story installing the frets in a fretted stringed musical instrument an article on fret installation for a new instrument on the liutaio mottola lutherie information website

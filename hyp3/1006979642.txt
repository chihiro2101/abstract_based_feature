in terms of its etymology , eudaimonia is an abstract noun derived from the words eu ( 'good , well ' ) and daimōn ( 'spirit ' ) , the latter referring to a minor deity or a guardian spirit '' in his nicomachean ethics ( §21 ; 1095a15–22 ) , aristotle says that everyone agrees that eudaimonia is the highest good for human beings , but that there is substantial disagreement on what sort of life counts as doing and living well ; i.e aristotle presents various popular conceptions of the best life for human beings positive psychology on eudaemonia the '' questionnaire for eudaimonic well-being '' developed in positive psychology lists six dimensions of eudaimonia : kjell , oscar ( 2011 ) one important move in greek philosophy to answer the question of how to achieve eudaimonia is to bring in another important concept in ancient philosophy , aretē ( 'virtue ' ) so , the ancient ethical theorists tend to agree that virtue is closely bound up with happiness ( areté is bound up with eudaimonia ) one problem with the english translation of areté as 'virtue ' is that we are inclined to understand virtue in a moral sense , which is not always what the ancients had in mind for a greek , areté pertains to all sorts of qualities we would not regard as relevant to ethics , for example , physical beauty the sense of virtue which areté connotes would include saying something like '' speed is a virtue in a horse , '' or '' height is a virtue in a basketball player the moral virtues are simply a subset of the general sense in which a human being is capable of functioning well or excellently a literal view of eudaimonia means achieving a state of being similar to benevolent deity , or being protected and looked after by a benevolent deity despite this etymology , however , discussions of eudaimonia in ancient greek ethics are often conducted independently of any super-natural significance in his nicomachean ethics , ( 1095a15 & ndash ; 22 ) aristotle says that eudaimonia means 'doing and living well ' it is significant that synonyms for eudaimonia are living well and doing well the word happiness does not entirely capture the meaning of the greek word for example , when we say that someone is '' a very happy person , '' we usually mean that they seem subjectively contented with the way things are going in their life we mean to imply that they feel good about the way things are going for them in contrast , eudaimonia is a more encompassing notion than feeling happy since events that do not contribute to one 's experience of feeling happy may affect one 's eudaimonia ascribing eudaimonia to a person , then , may include ascribing such things as being virtuous , being loved and having good friends so , eudaimonia corresponds to the idea of having an objectively good or desirable life , to some extent independently of whether one knows that certain things exist or not these translations may avoid some of the misleading associations carried by '' happiness '' although each tends to raise some problems of its own in some modern texts therefore , the other alternative is to leave the term in an english form of the original greek , as eudaimonia classical views on eudaimonia and aretē as with all ancient ethical thinkers , socrates thought that all human beings wanted eudaimonia more than anything else ( see plato , apology 30b , euthydemus 280d & ndash ; 282d , meno 87d & ndash ; 89a ) however , socrates adopted a quite radical form of eudaimonism ( see above ) : he seems to have thought that virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia the basic argument presented by thrasymachus and callicles is that justice ( being just ) hinders or prevents the achievement of eudaimonia because conventional morality requires that we control ourselves and hence live with un-satiated desires this idea is vividly illustrated in book 2 of the republic when glaucon , taking up thrasymachus ' challenge , recounts a myth of the magical ring of gyges but if eudaimonia is to be achieved through the satisfaction of desire , whereas being just or acting justly requires suppression of desire , then it is not in the interests of the strong man to act according to the dictates of conventional morality plato 's ethical theory is eudaimonistic because it maintains that eudaimonia depends on virtue on plato 's version of the relationship , virtue is depicted as the most crucial and the dominant constituent of eudaimonia aristotle 's account is articulated in the nicomachean ethics and the eudemian ethics in outline , for aristotle , eudaimonia involves activity , exhibiting virtue ( aretē sometimes translated as excellence ) in accordance with reason it follows that eudaimonia for a human being is the attainment of excellence ( areté ) in reason eudaimonia requires not only good character but rational activity moreover , he claims this excellence can not be isolated and so competencies are also required appropriate to related functions which is to say , to be fully engaged in the intellectually stimulating and fulfilling work at which one achieves well-earned success the rest of the nicomachean ethics is devoted to filling out the claim that the best life for a human being is the life of excellence in accordance with reason since reason for aristotle is not only theoretical but practical as well , he spends quite a bit of time discussing excellence of character , which enables a person to exercise his practical reason ( i.e however , it is aristotle 's explicit view that virtue is necessary but not sufficient for eudaimonia however , the stoic concept of arete is much nearer to the christian conception of virtue , which refers to the moral virtues anscombe in her article '' modern moral philosophy '' ( 1958 ) argued that duty-based ethics are conceptually incoherent for they are based on the idea of a '' law without a lawgiver models of eudaimonia in psychology and positive psychology emerged from early work on self-actualization and the means of its accomplishment by researchers such as erik erikson , gordon allport , and abraham maslow ancient ethical theory , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy aristotle 's ethics , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy aristotle : ethics , internet encyclopedia of philosophy

in terms of its etymology , eudaimonia is an abstract noun derived from the words eu ( 'good , well ' ) and daimōn ( 'spirit ' ) , the latter referring to a minor deity or a guardian spirit '' in his nicomachean ethics ( §21 ; 1095a15–22 ) , aristotle says that everyone agrees that eudaimonia is the highest good for human beings , but that there is substantial disagreement on what sort of life counts as doing and living well ; i.e eudaimon : verbally there is a very general agreement ; for both the general run of men and people of superior refinement say that it is eudaimonia , and identify living well and faring well with being happy ; but with regard to what eudaimonia is they differ , and the many do not give the same account as the wise for the former think it is some plain and obvious thing like pleasure , wealth or honour… 1095a17 so , as aristotle points out , saying that eudaimon life is a life which is objectively desirable , and means living well , is not saying very much positive psychology on eudaemonia the '' questionnaire for eudaimonic well-being '' developed in positive psychology lists six dimensions of eudaimonia : kjell , oscar ( 2011 ) one important move in greek philosophy to answer the question of how to achieve eudaimonia is to bring in another important concept in ancient philosophy , aretē ( 'virtue ' ) aristotle says that the eudaimon life is one of '' virtuous activity in accordance with reason '' 1097b22 & ndash ; 1098a20 ; even epicurus , who argues that the eudaimon life is the life of pleasure , maintains that the life of pleasure coincides with the life of virtue so , the ancient ethical theorists tend to agree that virtue is closely bound up with happiness ( areté is bound up with eudaimonia ) one problem with the english translation of areté as 'virtue ' is that we are inclined to understand virtue in a moral sense , which is not always what the ancients had in mind for a greek , areté pertains to all sorts of qualities we would not regard as relevant to ethics , for example , physical beauty so it is important to bear in mind that the sense of ‘ virtue ' operative in ancient ethics is not exclusively moral and includes more than states such as wisdom , courage and compassion the sense of virtue which areté connotes would include saying something like '' speed is a virtue in a horse , '' or '' height is a virtue in a basketball player '' doing anything well requires virtue , and each characteristic activity ( such as carpentry , flute playing , etc the alternative translation 'excellence ' ( or ' a desirable quality ' ) might be helpful in conveying this general meaning of the term in his nicomachean ethics , ( 1095a15 & ndash ; 22 ) aristotle says that eudaimonia means 'doing and living well ' on the standard english translation , this would be to say that ‘ happiness is doing well and living well ' one important difference is that happiness often connotes being or tending to be in a certain pleasant state of mind for example , when we say that someone is '' a very happy person , '' we usually mean that they seem subjectively contented with the way things are going in their life in contrast , eudaimonia is a more encompassing notion than feeling happy since events that do not contribute to one 's experience of feeling happy may affect one 's eudaimonia eudaimonia depends on all the things that would make us happy if we knew of their existence , but quite independently of whether we do know about them conversely , being loved by your children would not count towards your happiness if you did not know that they loved you ( and perhaps thought that they did not ) , but it would count towards your eudaimonia so , eudaimonia corresponds to the idea of having an objectively good or desirable life , to some extent independently of whether one knows that certain things exist or not ( see aristotle 's discussion : nicomachean ethics , book 1.10–1.11 ) because of this discrepancy between the meanings of eudaimonia and happiness , some alternative translations have been proposed ross suggests 'well-being ' and john cooper proposes 'flourishing ' scholars typically divide plato 's works into three periods : the early , middle , and late periods socrates is convinced that virtues such as self-control , courage , justice , piety , wisdom and related qualities of mind and soul are absolutely crucial if a person is to lead a good and happy ( eudaimon ) life for example , in the meno , with respect to wisdom , he says : '' everything the soul endeavours or endures under the guidance of wisdom ends in happiness '' ( meno 88c ) it does not seem like human nature for me to have neglected all my own affairs and to have tolerated this neglect for so many years while i was always concerned with you , approaching each one of you like a father or an elder brother to persuade you to care for virtue ( 31a & ndash ; b ; italics added ) it emerges a bit further on that this concern for one 's soul , that one 's soul might be in the best possible state , amounts to acquiring moral virtue so socrates ' pointing out that the athenians should care for their souls means that they should care for their virtue , rather than pursuing honour or riches moreover , according to socrates , this state of the soul , moral virtue , is the most important good someone with a virtuous soul is better off than someone who is wealthy and honoured but whose soul is corrupted by unjust actions in outline , for aristotle , eudaimonia involves activity , exhibiting virtue ( aretē sometimes translated as excellence ) in accordance with reason this conception of eudaimonia derives from aristotle 's essentialism understanding of human nature , the view that reason ( logos sometimes translated as rationality ) is unique to human beings and that the ideal function or work ( ergon ) of a human being is the fullest or most perfect exercise of reason it follows that eudaimonia for a human being is the attainment of excellence ( areté ) in reason according to aristotle , eudaimonia actually requires energeia , action , so that it is not sufficient for a person to possess a squandered ability or disposition for example , if being a truly outstanding scientist requires impressive math skills , one might say '' doing mathematics well is necessary to be a first rate scientist '' the rest of the nicomachean ethics is devoted to filling out the claim that the best life for a human being is the life of excellence in accordance with reason while emphasizing the importance of the rational aspect of the psyche , he does not ignore the importance of other ‘ goods ' such as friends , wealth , and power in a life that is eudaimonic anscombe recommends a return to the eudaimonistic ethical theories of the ancients , particularly aristotle , which ground morality in the interests and well-being of human moral agents , and can do so without appealing to any such lawgiver julia driver in the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy explains : anscombe 's article modern moral philosophy stimulated the development of virtue ethics as an alternative to utilitarianism , kantian ethics , and social contract theories ancient ethical theory , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy aristotle 's ethics , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy aristotle : ethics , internet encyclopedia of philosophy

in terms of its etymology , eudaimonia is an abstract noun derived from the words eu ( 'good , well ' ) and daimōn ( 'spirit ' ) , the latter referring to a minor deity or a guardian spirit '' in his nicomachean ethics ( §21 ; 1095a15–22 ) , aristotle says that everyone agrees that eudaimonia is the highest good for human beings , but that there is substantial disagreement on what sort of life counts as doing and living well ; i.e for the former think it is some plain and obvious thing like pleasure , wealth or honour… 1095a17 so , as aristotle points out , saying that eudaimon life is a life which is objectively desirable , and means living well , is not saying very much aristotle presents various popular conceptions of the best life for human beings the candidates that he mentions are a ( 1 ) life of pleasure , ( 2 ) a life of political activity , and ( 3 ) a philosophical life positive psychology on eudaemonia the '' questionnaire for eudaimonic well-being '' developed in positive psychology lists six dimensions of eudaimonia : kjell , oscar ( 2011 ) aristotle says that the eudaimon life is one of '' virtuous activity in accordance with reason '' 1097b22 & ndash ; 1098a20 ; even epicurus , who argues that the eudaimon life is the life of pleasure , maintains that the life of pleasure coincides with the life of virtue so , the ancient ethical theorists tend to agree that virtue is closely bound up with happiness ( areté is bound up with eudaimonia ) we shall consider the main theories in a moment , but first a warning about the proper translation of areté for a greek , areté pertains to all sorts of qualities we would not regard as relevant to ethics , for example , physical beauty so it is important to bear in mind that the sense of ‘ virtue ' operative in ancient ethics is not exclusively moral and includes more than states such as wisdom , courage and compassion the sense of virtue which areté connotes would include saying something like '' speed is a virtue in a horse , '' or '' height is a virtue in a basketball player the alternative translation 'excellence ' ( or ' a desirable quality ' ) might be helpful in conveying this general meaning of the term the moral virtues are simply a subset of the general sense in which a human being is capable of functioning well or excellently as this would be considered the most positive state to be in , the word is often translated as 'happiness ' although incorporating the divine nature of the word extends the meaning to also include the concepts of being fortunate , or blessed despite this etymology , however , discussions of eudaimonia in ancient greek ethics are often conducted independently of any super-natural significance on the standard english translation , this would be to say that ‘ happiness is doing well and living well ' the word happiness does not entirely capture the meaning of the greek word one important difference is that happiness often connotes being or tending to be in a certain pleasant state of mind eudaimonia depends on all the things that would make us happy if we knew of their existence , but quite independently of whether we do know about them ascribing eudaimonia to a person , then , may include ascribing such things as being virtuous , being loved and having good friends conversely , being loved by your children would not count towards your happiness if you did not know that they loved you ( and perhaps thought that they did not ) , but it would count towards your eudaimonia so , eudaimonia corresponds to the idea of having an objectively good or desirable life , to some extent independently of whether one knows that certain things exist or not ( see aristotle 's discussion : nicomachean ethics , book 1.10–1.11 however , socrates adopted a quite radical form of eudaimonism ( see above ) : he seems to have thought that virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia for example , in the meno , with respect to wisdom , he says : '' everything the soul endeavours or endures under the guidance of wisdom ends in happiness '' ( meno 88c ) in the apology , socrates clearly presents his disagreement with those who think that the eudaimon life is the life of honour or pleasure , when he chastises the athenians for caring more for riches and honour than the state of their souls ( 31a & ndash ; b ; italics added ) it emerges a bit further on that this concern for one 's soul , that one 's soul might be in the best possible state , amounts to acquiring moral virtue moreover , according to socrates , this state of the soul , moral virtue , is the most important good in summary , socrates seems to think that virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia this idea is vividly illustrated in book 2 of the republic when glaucon , taking up thrasymachus ' challenge , recounts a myth of the magical ring of gyges the thrust of glaucon 's challenge is that no one would be just if he could escape the retribution he would normally encounter for fulfilling his desires at whim on plato 's version of the relationship , virtue is depicted as the most crucial and the dominant constituent of eudaimonia in outline , for aristotle , eudaimonia involves activity , exhibiting virtue ( aretē sometimes translated as excellence ) in accordance with reason basically , well-being ( eudaimonia ) is gained by proper development of one 's highest and most human capabilities and human beings are '' the rational animal '' aristotle clearly maintains that to live in accordance with reason means achieving excellence thereby the rest of the nicomachean ethics is devoted to filling out the claim that the best life for a human being is the life of excellence in accordance with reason ancient greek ethics is eudaimonist because it links virtue and eudaimonia , where eudaimonia refers to an individual 's well-being epicurus ' doctrine can be considered eudaimonist since epicurus argues that a life of pleasure will coincide with a life of virtue so whereas aristotle would not say that one ought to aim for virtue in order to attain pleasure , epicurus would endorse this claim according to the stoics , virtue is necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia ( 1995 ) plato 's ethics , oxford : oxford university press ancient ethical theory , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy aristotle 's ethics , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy aristotle : ethics , internet encyclopedia of philosophy

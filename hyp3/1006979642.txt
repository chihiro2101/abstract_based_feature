in terms of its etymology , eudaimonia is an abstract noun derived from the words eu ( 'good , well ' ) and daimōn ( 'spirit ' ) , the latter referring to a minor deity or a guardian spirit '' in his nicomachean ethics ( §21 ; 1095a15–22 ) , aristotle says that everyone agrees that eudaimonia is the highest good for human beings , but that there is substantial disagreement on what sort of life counts as doing and living well ; i.e for the former think it is some plain and obvious thing like pleasure , wealth or honour… 1095a17 so , as aristotle points out , saying that eudaimon life is a life which is objectively desirable , and means living well , is not saying very much everyone wants to be eudaimon ; and everyone agrees that being eudaimon is related to faring well and to an individual 's well-being the really difficult question is to specify just what sort of activities enable one to live well aristotle presents various popular conceptions of the best life for human beings the candidates that he mentions are a ( 1 ) life of pleasure , ( 2 ) a life of political activity , and ( 3 ) a philosophical life positive psychology on eudaemonia the '' questionnaire for eudaimonic well-being '' developed in positive psychology lists six dimensions of eudaimonia : kjell , oscar ( 2011 ) one important move in greek philosophy to answer the question of how to achieve eudaimonia is to bring in another important concept in ancient philosophy , aretē ( 'virtue ' ) aristotle says that the eudaimon life is one of '' virtuous activity in accordance with reason '' 1097b22 & ndash ; 1098a20 ; even epicurus , who argues that the eudaimon life is the life of pleasure , maintains that the life of pleasure coincides with the life of virtue so , the ancient ethical theorists tend to agree that virtue is closely bound up with happiness ( areté is bound up with eudaimonia ) the sense of virtue which areté connotes would include saying something like '' speed is a virtue in a horse , '' or '' height is a virtue in a basketball player despite this etymology , however , discussions of eudaimonia in ancient greek ethics are often conducted independently of any super-natural significance in his nicomachean ethics , ( 1095a15 & ndash ; 22 ) aristotle says that eudaimonia means 'doing and living well ' on the standard english translation , this would be to say that ‘ happiness is doing well and living well ' the word happiness does not entirely capture the meaning of the greek word for example , when we say that someone is '' a very happy person , '' we usually mean that they seem subjectively contented with the way things are going in their life in contrast , eudaimonia is a more encompassing notion than feeling happy since events that do not contribute to one 's experience of feeling happy may affect one 's eudaimonia conversely , being loved by your children would not count towards your happiness if you did not know that they loved you ( and perhaps thought that they did not ) , but it would count towards your eudaimonia so , eudaimonia corresponds to the idea of having an objectively good or desirable life , to some extent independently of whether one knows that certain things exist or not these translations may avoid some of the misleading associations carried by '' happiness '' although each tends to raise some problems of its own this division will be employed here in dividing up the positions of socrates and plato on eudaimonia socrates is convinced that virtues such as self-control , courage , justice , piety , wisdom and related qualities of mind and soul are absolutely crucial if a person is to lead a good and happy ( eudaimon ) life for example , in the meno , with respect to wisdom , he says : '' everything the soul endeavours or endures under the guidance of wisdom ends in happiness '' ( meno 88c ) so socrates ' pointing out that the athenians should care for their souls means that they should care for their virtue , rather than pursuing honour or riches moreover , according to socrates , this state of the soul , moral virtue , is the most important good the basic argument presented by thrasymachus and callicles is that justice ( being just ) hinders or prevents the achievement of eudaimonia because conventional morality requires that we control ourselves and hence live with un-satiated desires but if eudaimonia is to be achieved through the satisfaction of desire , whereas being just or acting justly requires suppression of desire , then it is not in the interests of the strong man to act according to the dictates of conventional morality ) throughout the rest of the republic , plato aims to refute this claim by showing that the virtue of justice is necessary for eudaimonia in brief , plato argues that virtues are states of the soul , and that the just person is someone whose soul is ordered and harmonious , with all its parts functioning properly to the person 's benefit plato 's ethical theory is eudaimonistic because it maintains that eudaimonia depends on virtue aristotle 's account is articulated in the nicomachean ethics and the eudemian ethics in outline , for aristotle , eudaimonia involves activity , exhibiting virtue ( aretē sometimes translated as excellence ) in accordance with reason this conception of eudaimonia derives from aristotle 's essentialism understanding of human nature , the view that reason ( logos sometimes translated as rationality ) is unique to human beings and that the ideal function or work ( ergon ) of a human being is the fullest or most perfect exercise of reason basically , well-being ( eudaimonia ) is gained by proper development of one 's highest and most human capabilities and human beings are '' the rational animal '' according to aristotle , eudaimonia actually requires energeia , action , so that it is not sufficient for a person to possess a squandered ability or disposition aristotle clearly maintains that to live in accordance with reason means achieving excellence thereby from this it follows that eudaimonia , living well , consists in activities exercising the rational part of the psyche in accordance with the virtues or excellency of reason 1097b22 & ndash ; 1098a20 aristotle 's ethical theory is eudaimonist because it maintains that eudaimonia depends on virtue aristotle maintains that eudaimonia is what everyone wants ( and epicurus would agree ) so whereas aristotle would not say that one ought to aim for virtue in order to attain pleasure , epicurus would endorse this claim this stoic doctrine re-emerges later in the history of ethical philosophy in the writings of immanuel kant , who argues that the possession of a '' good will '' is the only unconditional good ataraxia eudaemon ( mythology ) eudaemons eupraxsophy humanism maslow 's hierarchy of needs nicomachean ethics perfectionism phronesis social quality summum bonum virtue ethics well-being

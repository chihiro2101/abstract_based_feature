in terms of its etymology , eudaimonia is an abstract noun derived from the words eu ( 'good , well ' ) and daimōn ( 'spirit ' ) , the latter referring to a minor deity or a guardian spirit '' in his nicomachean ethics ( §21 ; 1095a15–22 ) , aristotle says that everyone agrees that eudaimonia is the highest good for human beings , but that there is substantial disagreement on what sort of life counts as doing and living well ; i.e eudaimon : verbally there is a very general agreement ; for both the general run of men and people of superior refinement say that it is eudaimonia , and identify living well and faring well with being happy ; but with regard to what eudaimonia is they differ , and the many do not give the same account as the wise for the former think it is some plain and obvious thing like pleasure , wealth or honour… 1095a17 so , as aristotle points out , saying that eudaimon life is a life which is objectively desirable , and means living well , is not saying very much the really difficult question is to specify just what sort of activities enable one to live well aristotle presents various popular conceptions of the best life for human beings the candidates that he mentions are a ( 1 ) life of pleasure , ( 2 ) a life of political activity , and ( 3 ) a philosophical life one important move in greek philosophy to answer the question of how to achieve eudaimonia is to bring in another important concept in ancient philosophy , aretē ( 'virtue ' ) aristotle says that the eudaimon life is one of '' virtuous activity in accordance with reason '' 1097b22 & ndash ; 1098a20 ; even epicurus , who argues that the eudaimon life is the life of pleasure , maintains that the life of pleasure coincides with the life of virtue for a greek , areté pertains to all sorts of qualities we would not regard as relevant to ethics , for example , physical beauty so it is important to bear in mind that the sense of ‘ virtue ' operative in ancient ethics is not exclusively moral and includes more than states such as wisdom , courage and compassion eudaimonia implies a positive and divine state of being that humanity is able to strive toward and possibly reach a literal view of eudaimonia means achieving a state of being similar to benevolent deity , or being protected and looked after by a benevolent deity in his nicomachean ethics , ( 1095a15 & ndash ; 22 ) aristotle says that eudaimonia means 'doing and living well ' on the standard english translation , this would be to say that ‘ happiness is doing well and living well ' one important difference is that happiness often connotes being or tending to be in a certain pleasant state of mind for example , when we say that someone is '' a very happy person , '' we usually mean that they seem subjectively contented with the way things are going in their life in contrast , eudaimonia is a more encompassing notion than feeling happy since events that do not contribute to one 's experience of feeling happy may affect one 's eudaimonia eudaimonia depends on all the things that would make us happy if we knew of their existence , but quite independently of whether we do know about them so , eudaimonia corresponds to the idea of having an objectively good or desirable life , to some extent independently of whether one knows that certain things exist or not ( see aristotle 's discussion : nicomachean ethics , book 1.10–1.11 ) because of this discrepancy between the meanings of eudaimonia and happiness , some alternative translations have been proposed ross suggests 'well-being ' and john cooper proposes 'flourishing ' as with all ancient ethical thinkers , socrates thought that all human beings wanted eudaimonia more than anything else ( see plato , apology 30b , euthydemus 280d & ndash ; 282d , meno 87d & ndash ; 89a ) however , socrates adopted a quite radical form of eudaimonism ( see above ) : he seems to have thought that virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia in the apology , socrates clearly presents his disagreement with those who think that the eudaimon life is the life of honour or pleasure , when he chastises the athenians for caring more for riches and honour than the state of their souls in summary , socrates seems to think that virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia a person who is not virtuous can not be happy , and a person with virtue can not fail to be happy plato 's great work of the middle period , the republic , is devoted to answering a challenge made by the sophist thrasymachus , that conventional morality , particularly the 'virtue ' of justice , actually prevents the strong man from achieving eudaimonia ) throughout the rest of the republic , plato aims to refute this claim by showing that the virtue of justice is necessary for eudaimonia plato 's ethical theory is eudaimonistic because it maintains that eudaimonia depends on virtue in outline , for aristotle , eudaimonia involves activity , exhibiting virtue ( aretē sometimes translated as excellence ) in accordance with reason according to aristotle , eudaimonia actually requires energeia , action , so that it is not sufficient for a person to possess a squandered ability or disposition which is to say , to be fully engaged in the intellectually stimulating and fulfilling work at which one achieves well-earned success the rest of the nicomachean ethics is devoted to filling out the claim that the best life for a human being is the life of excellence in accordance with reason aristotle 's ethical theory is eudaimonist because it maintains that eudaimonia depends on virtue however , it is aristotle 's explicit view that virtue is necessary but not sufficient for eudaimonia he doubts the likelihood of being eudaimonic if one lacks certain external goods such as ‘ good birth , good children , and beauty ' so , a person who is hideously ugly or has '' lost children or good friends through death '' ( 1099b5–6 ) , or who is isolated , is unlikely to be eudaimon rather , eudaimonia is what we achieve ( assuming that we are n't particularly unfortunate in the possession of external goods ) when we live according to the requirements of reason interest in the concept of eudaimonia and ancient ethical theory more generally had a revival in the 20th century related concepts are happiness , flourishing , quality of life , contentment , and meaningful life ancient ethical theory , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy aristotle 's ethics , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy aristotle : ethics , internet encyclopedia of philosophy

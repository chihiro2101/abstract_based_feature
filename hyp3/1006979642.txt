in terms of its etymology , eudaimonia is an abstract noun derived from the words eu ( 'good , well ' ) and daimōn ( 'spirit ' ) , the latter referring to a minor deity or a guardian spirit '' in his nicomachean ethics ( §21 ; 1095a15–22 ) , aristotle says that everyone agrees that eudaimonia is the highest good for human beings , but that there is substantial disagreement on what sort of life counts as doing and living well ; i.e eudaimon : verbally there is a very general agreement ; for both the general run of men and people of superior refinement say that it is eudaimonia , and identify living well and faring well with being happy ; but with regard to what eudaimonia is they differ , and the many do not give the same account as the wise for the former think it is some plain and obvious thing like pleasure , wealth or honour… 1095a17 so , as aristotle points out , saying that eudaimon life is a life which is objectively desirable , and means living well , is not saying very much everyone wants to be eudaimon ; and everyone agrees that being eudaimon is related to faring well and to an individual 's well-being the really difficult question is to specify just what sort of activities enable one to live well aristotle presents various popular conceptions of the best life for human beings the candidates that he mentions are a ( 1 ) life of pleasure , ( 2 ) a life of political activity , and ( 3 ) a philosophical life one important move in greek philosophy to answer the question of how to achieve eudaimonia is to bring in another important concept in ancient philosophy , aretē ( 'virtue ' ) aristotle says that the eudaimon life is one of '' virtuous activity in accordance with reason '' 1097b22 & ndash ; 1098a20 ; even epicurus , who argues that the eudaimon life is the life of pleasure , maintains that the life of pleasure coincides with the life of virtue so , the ancient ethical theorists tend to agree that virtue is closely bound up with happiness ( areté is bound up with eudaimonia ) one problem with the english translation of areté as 'virtue ' is that we are inclined to understand virtue in a moral sense , which is not always what the ancients had in mind for a greek , areté pertains to all sorts of qualities we would not regard as relevant to ethics , for example , physical beauty the sense of virtue which areté connotes would include saying something like '' speed is a virtue in a horse , '' or '' height is a virtue in a basketball player '' doing anything well requires virtue , and each characteristic activity ( such as carpentry , flute playing , etc the moral virtues are simply a subset of the general sense in which a human being is capable of functioning well or excellently despite this etymology , however , discussions of eudaimonia in ancient greek ethics are often conducted independently of any super-natural significance in his nicomachean ethics , ( 1095a15 & ndash ; 22 ) aristotle says that eudaimonia means 'doing and living well ' for example , when we say that someone is '' a very happy person , '' we usually mean that they seem subjectively contented with the way things are going in their life in contrast , eudaimonia is a more encompassing notion than feeling happy since events that do not contribute to one 's experience of feeling happy may affect one 's eudaimonia eudaimonia depends on all the things that would make us happy if we knew of their existence , but quite independently of whether we do know about them ascribing eudaimonia to a person , then , may include ascribing such things as being virtuous , being loved and having good friends but these are all objective judgments about someone 's life : they concern a person 's really being virtuous , really being loved , and really having fine friends so , eudaimonia corresponds to the idea of having an objectively good or desirable life , to some extent independently of whether one knows that certain things exist or not they tend to agree also that plato 's earliest works quite faithfully represent the teachings of socrates and that plato 's own views , which go beyond those of socrates , appear for the first time in the middle works such as the phaedo and the republic as with all ancient ethical thinkers , socrates thought that all human beings wanted eudaimonia more than anything else ( see plato , apology 30b , euthydemus 280d & ndash ; 282d , meno 87d & ndash ; 89a ) in the apology , socrates clearly presents his disagreement with those who think that the eudaimon life is the life of honour or pleasure , when he chastises the athenians for caring more for riches and honour than the state of their souls so socrates ' pointing out that the athenians should care for their souls means that they should care for their virtue , rather than pursuing honour or riches moreover , according to socrates , this state of the soul , moral virtue , is the most important good someone with a virtuous soul is better off than someone who is wealthy and honoured but whose soul is corrupted by unjust actions it is much more valuable… ? much more… ( 47e–48a ) here , socrates argues that life is not worth living if the soul is ruined by wrongdoing in summary , socrates seems to think that virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia this idea is vividly illustrated in book 2 of the republic when glaucon , taking up thrasymachus ' challenge , recounts a myth of the magical ring of gyges the thrust of glaucon 's challenge is that no one would be just if he could escape the retribution he would normally encounter for fulfilling his desires at whim but if eudaimonia is to be achieved through the satisfaction of desire , whereas being just or acting justly requires suppression of desire , then it is not in the interests of the strong man to act according to the dictates of conventional morality from this it follows that eudaimonia , living well , consists in activities exercising the rational part of the psyche in accordance with the virtues or excellency of reason 1097b22 & ndash ; 1098a20 the rest of the nicomachean ethics is devoted to filling out the claim that the best life for a human being is the life of excellence in accordance with reason aristotle 's ethical theory is eudaimonist because it maintains that eudaimonia depends on virtue however , it is aristotle 's explicit view that virtue is necessary but not sufficient for eudaimonia while emphasizing the importance of the rational aspect of the psyche , he does not ignore the importance of other ‘ goods ' such as friends , wealth , and power in a life that is eudaimonic he also thinks that eudaimonia is best achieved by a life of virtuous activity in accordance with reason related concepts are happiness , flourishing , quality of life , contentment , and meaningful life ancient ethical theory , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy aristotle 's ethics , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy aristotle : ethics , internet encyclopedia of philosophy

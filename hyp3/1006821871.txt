if the petals are free from one another in the corolla , the plant is polypetalous or choripetalous ; while if the petals are at least partially fused , it is gamopetalous or sympetalous for example , flowers on eudicots ( the largest group of dicots ) most frequently have four or five petals while flowers on monocots have three or six petals , although there are many exceptions to this rule if all of the petals are essentially identical in size and shape , the flower is said to be regular or actinomorphic ( meaning '' ray-formed '' ) in irregular flowers , other floral parts may be modified from the regular form , but the petals show the greatest deviation from radial symmetry claws are developed in petals of some flowers of the family brassicaceae , such as erysimum cheiri petals of different species of plants vary greatly in color or color pattern , both in visible light and in ultraviolet the genetics behind the formation of petals , in accordance with the abc model of flower development , are that sepals , petals , stamens , and carpels are modified versions of each other however , pollinators are rather selective in determining the flowers they choose to pollinate this develops competition between flowers and as a result flowers must provide incentives to appeal to pollinators ( unless the flower self-pollinates or is involved in wind pollination ) the petals could produce different scents to allure desirable pollinators or repel undesirable pollinators some flowers will also mimic the scents produced by materials such as decaying meat , to attract pollinators to them for example , large petals and flowers will attract pollinators at a large distance or that are large themselves wind-pollinated flowers often have small , dull petals and produce little or no scent insects such as the bee or butterfly can see the ultraviolet marks which are contained on these flowers , acting as an attractive mechanism which is not visible towards the human eye flowers adapt the mechanism on their petals to change color in acting as a communicative mechanism for the bird to visit

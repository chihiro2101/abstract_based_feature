a corolla of separate petals , without fusion of individual segments , is apopetalous if the petals are free from one another in the corolla , the plant is polypetalous or choripetalous ; while if the petals are at least partially fused , it is gamopetalous or sympetalous petals can differ dramatically in different species for example , flowers on eudicots ( the largest group of dicots ) most frequently have four or five petals while flowers on monocots have three or six petals , although there are many exceptions to this rule in irregular flowers , other floral parts may be modified from the regular form , but the petals show the greatest deviation from radial symmetry in some plants such as narcissus the lower part of the petals or tepals are fused to form a floral cup ( hypanthium ) above the ovary , and from which the petals proper extend claws are developed in petals of some flowers of the family brassicaceae , such as erysimum cheiri such patterns often function as guides to pollinators and are variously known as nectar guides , pollen guides , and floral guides the genetics behind the formation of petals , in accordance with the abc model of flower development , are that sepals , petals , stamens , and carpels are modified versions of each other pollen is produced by the male flower or by the male organs of monoecious flowers in general , petals operate to protect some parts of the flower and attract/repel specific pollinators this is where the positioning of the flower petals are located on the flower is the corolla e.g for example , large petals and flowers will attract pollinators at a large distance or that are large themselves some of these flowers will often have no petals at all flowers adapt the mechanism on their petals to change color in acting as a communicative mechanism for the bird to visit

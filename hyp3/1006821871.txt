the role of the corolla in plant evolution has been studied extensively since charles darwin postulated a theory of the origin of elongated corollae and corolla tubes a corolla of separate petals , without fusion of individual segments , is apopetalous if the petals are free from one another in the corolla , the plant is polypetalous or choripetalous ; while if the petals are at least partially fused , it is gamopetalous or sympetalous petals can differ dramatically in different species for example , flowers on eudicots ( the largest group of dicots ) most frequently have four or five petals while flowers on monocots have three or six petals , although there are many exceptions to this rule in irregular flowers , other floral parts may be modified from the regular form , but the petals show the greatest deviation from radial symmetry claws are developed in petals of some flowers of the family brassicaceae , such as erysimum cheiri petals of different species of plants vary greatly in color or color pattern , both in visible light and in ultraviolet the genetics behind the formation of petals , in accordance with the abc model of flower development , are that sepals , petals , stamens , and carpels are modified versions of each other henceforth pollination dispersal could occur and the survival of many species of flowers could prolong in general , petals operate to protect some parts of the flower and attract/repel specific pollinators this is where the positioning of the flower petals are located on the flower is the corolla e.g some flowers can change the color of their petals as a signal to mutual pollinators to approach or keep away for example , large petals and flowers will attract pollinators at a large distance or that are large themselves some of these flowers will often have no petals at all

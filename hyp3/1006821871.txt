a corolla of separate petals , without fusion of individual segments , is apopetalous if the petals are free from one another in the corolla , the plant is polypetalous or choripetalous ; while if the petals are at least partially fused , it is gamopetalous or sympetalous for example , flowers on eudicots ( the largest group of dicots ) most frequently have four or five petals while flowers on monocots have three or six petals , although there are many exceptions to this rule the petal whorl or corolla may be either radially or bilaterally symmetrical ( see symmetry in biology and floral symmetry ) if all of the petals are essentially identical in size and shape , the flower is said to be regular or actinomorphic ( meaning '' ray-formed '' ) in irregular flowers , other floral parts may be modified from the regular form , but the petals show the greatest deviation from radial symmetry in some plants such as narcissus the lower part of the petals or tepals are fused to form a floral cup ( hypanthium ) above the ovary , and from which the petals proper extend the genetics behind the formation of petals , in accordance with the abc model of flower development , are that sepals , petals , stamens , and carpels are modified versions of each other this is where the positioning of the flower petals are located on the flower is the corolla e.g the buttercup having shiny yellow flower petals which contain guidelines amongst the petals in aiding the pollinator towards the nectar the petals could produce different scents to allure desirable pollinators or repel undesirable pollinators wind-pollinated flowers often have small , dull petals and produce little or no scent some of these flowers will often have no petals at all flowers adapt the mechanism on their petals to change color in acting as a communicative mechanism for the bird to visit the dactylanthus has only its flowers pointing to the surface and the flowers lack color but have the advantage of containing much nectar and a strong scent

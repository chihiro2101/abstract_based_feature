as a theology student , schleiermacher pursued an independent course of reading and neglected the study of the old testament and of oriental languages at the same time , he studied the writings of immanuel kant and friedrich heinrich jacobi and began to apply ideas from the greek philosophers to a reconstruction of kant 's system schleiermacher developed a deep-rooted skepticism as a student and soon rejected orthodox christianity haykin , liberal protestantism , p 3 brian gerrish , a scholar of the works of schleiermacher , wrote : schleiermacher confessed : '' faith is the regalia of the godhead , you say alas ! dearest father , if you believe that without this faith no one can attain to salvation in the next world , nor to tranquility in this—and such , i know , is your belief—oh ! then pray to god to grant it to me , for to me it is now lost i can not believe that he who called himself the son of man was the true , eternal god ; i can not believe that his death was a vicarious atonement at the completion of his course at halle , schleiermacher became the private tutor to the family of friedrich alexander burggraf und graf zu dohna-schlobitten ( 1741–1810 ) , developing in a cultivated and aristocratic household his deep love of family and social life lacking scope for the development of his preaching skills , he sought mental and spiritual satisfaction in the city 's cultivated society and in intensive philosophical studies , beginning to construct the framework of his philosophical and religious system here schleiermacher became acquainted with art , literature , science and general culture though his ultimate principles remained unchanged , he placed more emphasis on human emotion and the imagination the literary product of that period of rapid development was his influential book , reden über die religion ( on religion ) , and his '' new year 's gift '' to the new century , the monologen ( soliloquies ) in the monologen , he revealed his ethical manifesto in which he proclaimed his ideas on the freedom and independence of the spirit and on the relationship of the mind to the sensual world , and he sketched his ideal of the future of the individual and of society he relieved friedrich schlegel entirely of his nominal responsibility for the translation of plato , which they had together undertaken ( vols it contends that the tests of the soundness of a moral system are the completeness of its view of the laws and ends of human life as a whole and the harmonious arrangement of its subject-matter under one fundamental principle although it is almost exclusively critical and negative , the book announces schleiermacher 's later view of moral science , attaching prime importance to a güterlehre , or doctrine of the ends to be obtained by moral action the obscurity of the book 's style and its negative tone prevented immediate success he quickly obtained a reputation as professor and preacher and exercised a powerful influence in spite of contradictory charges , which accused him of atheism , spinozism and pietism at the foundation of the university of berlin ( 1810 ) , in which he took a prominent part , schleiermacher obtained a theological chair and soon became secretary to the prussian academy of sciences the 24 years of his professional career in berlin began with his short outline of theological study ( kurze darstellung des theologischen studiums , 1811 ) in which he sought to do for theology what he had done for religion in his speeches at the same time , schleiermacher prepared his chief theological work , der christliche glaube nach den grundsätzen der evangelischen kirche ( 1821–1822 ; 2nd ed the aim of the work was to reform protestant theology , to put an end to the unreason and superficiality of both supernaturalism and rationalism , and to deliver religion and theology from dependence on perpetually changing systems of philosophy he felt isolated although his church and his lecture-room continued to be crowded '' the specific functions of the ego , as determined by the relative predominance of sense or intellect , are either functions of the senses ( or organism ) or functions of the intellect both cognition and volition are functions of thought as well as forms of moral action religious feeling therefore is the highest form of thought and of life ; in it we are conscious of our unity with the world and god ; it is thus the sense of absolute dependence schleiermacher 's doctrine of knowledge accepts the fundamental principle of kant that knowledge is bounded by experience , but it seeks to remove kant 's scepticism as to knowledge of the ding an sich ( the noumenon ) or sein , as schleiermacher 's term is the idea of knowledge or scientific thought as distinguished from the passive form of thought — of aesthetics and religion — is thought which is produced by all thinkers in the same form and which corresponds to being all knowledge takes the form of the concept ( begriff ) or the judgment ( urteil ) , the former conceiving the variety of being as a definite unity and plurality , and the latter simply connecting the concept with certain individual objects this uniformity is not based on the sameness of either the intellectual or the organic functions alone , but on the correspondence of the forms of thought and sensation with the forms of being the sum of being consists of the two systems of substantial forms and interactional relations , and it reappears in the form of concept and judgment , the concept representing being and the judgment being in action throughout the domain of knowledge the two forms are found in constant mutual relations , another proof of the fundamental unity of thought and being or of the objectivity of knowledge plato , spinoza and kant had contributed characteristic elements of their thought to this system , and directly or indirectly it was largely indebted to schelling for fundamental conceptions schleiermacher 's work has had a profound impact upon the philosophical field of hermeneutics duke concludes that the kimmerle edition '' reproduces the full , incontestably genuine corpus of schleiermacher literature on hermeneutics though he was certainly interested in interpreting scripture , he thought one could only do so properly once one had established a system of interpretation that was applicable to all texts this process was not a systematic or strictly philological approach , but what he called '' the art of understanding '' schleiermacher , friedrich d '' the hermeneutics : outline of the 1819 lectures , '' new literary history , vol.10 , no schleiermacher understood that reading a text was a discourse between the interpreter and the text itself ; however , he considered the text as the means by which the author is communicating thoughts previous to the creation of the text '' the hermeneutics : outline of the 1819 lectures , '' new literary history , vol.10 , no 1 , literary hermeneutics ( autumn , 1978 ) , 2-3 these thoughts are what ultimately cause the author to produce the text , thus the place where these '' inner thoughts '' become '' outer expression '' in language is at the moment of text creation this is where the meaning of a text ultimately resides for schleiermacher the ultimate goal of hermeneutics for schleiermacher is '' understanding in the highest sense the relationship of the author to language is cyclical , since the author is limited by his/her language and historical context , but s/he also contributes to language as a whole through new ideas and the appropriation of language '' the hermeneutics : outline of the 1819 lectures , '' new literary history , vol schleiermacher , '' the hermeneutics : outline of the 1819 lectures , '' new literary history , vol since the language used by an author '' is what mediates sensuously and externally between utterer and listener '' schleiermacher , friedrich d '' the hermeneutics : outline of the 1819 lectures , '' new literary history , vol therefore , the process of understanding is not only a historical process , learning about the context in which the author wrote , but also a psychological process , drawing upon the connection between interpreter and the author as a theoretical or speculative science it is purely descriptive and not practical , being correlated on the one hand to physical science and on the other to history duties are divided with reference to the principle that every man make his own the entire moral problem and act at the same time in an existing moral society church and theology : the systematic function of the church concept in modern theology , westminster press , 1971 , paperback : fifteen sermons of friedrich schleiermacher delivered to celebrate the beginning of a new year ( monologues , 1800 ) , tr

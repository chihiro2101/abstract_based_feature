as a theology student , schleiermacher pursued an independent course of reading and neglected the study of the old testament and of oriental languages however , he attended the lectures of semler and became acquainted with the techniques of historical criticism of the new testament , and of johann augustus eberhard from whom he acquired a love of the philosophy of plato and aristotle at the same time , he studied the writings of immanuel kant and friedrich heinrich jacobi and began to apply ideas from the greek philosophers to a reconstruction of kant 's system schleiermacher developed a deep-rooted skepticism as a student and soon rejected orthodox christianity 3 brian gerrish , a scholar of the works of schleiermacher , wrote : schleiermacher confessed : '' faith is the regalia of the godhead , you say alas ! dearest father , if you believe that without this faith no one can attain to salvation in the next world , nor to tranquility in this—and such , i know , is your belief—oh ! then pray to god to grant it to me , for to me it is now lost i can not believe that he who called himself the son of man was the true , eternal god ; i can not believe that his death was a vicarious atonement at the completion of his course at halle , schleiermacher became the private tutor to the family of friedrich alexander burggraf und graf zu dohna-schlobitten ( 1741–1810 ) , developing in a cultivated and aristocratic household his deep love of family and social life two years later , in 1796 , he became chaplain to the charité hospital in berlin lacking scope for the development of his preaching skills , he sought mental and spiritual satisfaction in the city 's cultivated society and in intensive philosophical studies , beginning to construct the framework of his philosophical and religious system he was strongly influenced by german romanticism , as represented by his friend karl wilhelm friedrich von schlegel that interest is borne out by his confidential letters on schlegel 's lucinde as well as by his seven-year relationship ( 1798–1805 ) with eleonore christiane grunow ( née krüger ) ( 1769/1770–1837 ) , the wife of berlin clergyman august christian wilhelm grunow ( 1764–1831 ) in the first book , schleiermacher gave religion an unchanging place among the divine mysteries of human nature , distinguished it from what he regarded as current caricatures of religion and described the perennial forms of its manifestation in the monologen , he revealed his ethical manifesto in which he proclaimed his ideas on the freedom and independence of the spirit and on the relationship of the mind to the sensual world , and he sketched his ideal of the future of the individual and of society it contends that the tests of the soundness of a moral system are the completeness of its view of the laws and ends of human life as a whole and the harmonious arrangement of its subject-matter under one fundamental principle although it is almost exclusively critical and negative , the book announces schleiermacher 's later view of moral science , attaching prime importance to a güterlehre , or doctrine of the ends to be obtained by moral action he took a prominent part in the reorganization of the prussian church and became the most powerful advocate of the union of the lutheran and reformed divisions of german protestantism , paving the way for the prussian union of churches ( 1817 ) the 24 years of his professional career in berlin began with his short outline of theological study ( kurze darstellung des theologischen studiums , 1811 ) in which he sought to do for theology what he had done for religion in his speeches in politics , schleiermacher supported liberty and progress , and in the period of reaction that followed the overthrow of napoleon , he was charged by the prussian government with '' demagogic agitation '' in conjunction with the patriot ernst moritz arndt the aim of the work was to reform protestant theology , to put an end to the unreason and superficiality of both supernaturalism and rationalism , and to deliver religion and theology from dependence on perpetually changing systems of philosophy schleiermacher 's psychology takes as its basis the phenomenal dualism of the ego and the non-ego , and regards the life of man as the interaction of these elements with their interpenetration as its infinite destination the dualism is therefore not absolute , and , though present in man 's own constitution as composed of body and soul , is relative only even there our '' organization '' or sense nature has its intellectual element , and our '' intellect '' its organic element , and there is no such thing as '' pure mind '' or '' pure body the former fall into the two classes of feelings ( subjective ) and perceptions ( objective ) ; the latter , according as the receptive or the spontaneous element predominates , into cognition and volition in cognition , thought is ontologically oriented to the object ; and in volition it is the teleological purpose of thought both cognition and volition are functions of thought as well as forms of moral action as the non-ego helps or hinders , enlarges or limits , our inner life , we feel pleasure or pain schleiermacher 's doctrine of knowledge accepts the fundamental principle of kant that knowledge is bounded by experience , but it seeks to remove kant 's scepticism as to knowledge of the ding an sich ( the noumenon ) or sein , as schleiermacher 's term is the universal uniformity of the production of judgments presupposes the uniformity of our relations to the outward world , and the uniformity of concepts rests similarly on the likeness of our inward nature knowledge has under both forms the same object , the relative difference of the two being that when the conceptual form predominates we have speculative science and when the form of judgment prevails we have empirical or historical science throughout the domain of knowledge the two forms are found in constant mutual relations , another proof of the fundamental unity of thought and being or of the objectivity of knowledge plato , spinoza and kant had contributed characteristic elements of their thought to this system , and directly or indirectly it was largely indebted to schelling for fundamental conceptions schleiermacher 's work has had a profound impact upon the philosophical field of hermeneutics in fact , schleiermacher is often referred to as '' the father of modern hermeneutics as a general study '' the hermeneutics : outline of the 1819 lectures , '' new literary history , vol.10 , no '' schleiermacher , friedrich d : cambridge university press , 228 in this way , the object to be understood stems from a thought of an author , and then is expressed through language the relationship of the author to language is cyclical , since the author is limited by his/her language and historical context , but s/he also contributes to language as a whole through new ideas and the appropriation of language the art of understanding becomes just as much the art of avoiding misunderstanding qualitative misunderstanding is not understanding the content , or '' the confusion of the meaning of a word for another quantitative is misunderstanding the nuance in the author ’ s own '' sphere the grammatical interpretation leads to the technical interpretation as the reader attempts to understand why the author selected the language s/he did to convey his/her inner thoughts part of the task of hermeneutics is to fully understand these thoughts through the author ’ s discourse , even better than the author him/herself '' the hermeneutics : outline of the 1819 lectures , '' new literary history , vol the interpreter can then evaluate what the effect of the work was on the author ’ s context if a reader can understand the psyche of the author , s/he can understand the work , but only in balance with the grammatical side of interpretation , which attempts to understand the work to understand the inner thoughts of the author therefore , the process of understanding is not only a historical process , learning about the context in which the author wrote , but also a psychological process , drawing upon the connection between interpreter and the author thus , hermeneutics is a cyclical task , but for schleiermacher it is not viciously circular because of the role of intuition as humans , therefore , interpreters approach a text with some shared understanding with the author that creates the possibility of understanding the art puts the interpreter in the best position by '' putting oneself in possession of all the conditions of understanding in his earlier essays he endeavoured to point out the defects of ancient and modern ethical thinkers , particularly of kant and fichte , with only plato and spinoza finding favour in his eyes the ontological basis of ethics is the unity of the real and the ideal , and the psychological and actual basis of the ethical process is the tendency of reason and nature to unite in the form of the complete organization of the latter by the former but the moral law must not be conceived under the form of an '' imperative '' or a '' sollen '' ; it differs from a law of nature only as being descriptive of the fact that it ranks the mind as conscious will , or zweckdenken , above nature his religious thought found its expression most notably in the christian faith , one of the most influential works of christian theology of its time in his earlier days he called it a feeling or intuition of the universe , consciousness of the unity of reason and nature , of the infinite and the eternal within the finite and the temporal

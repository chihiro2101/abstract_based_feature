however , pietism moravian theology failed to satisfy his increasing doubts , and his father reluctantly gave him permission to enter the university of halle , which had already abandoned pietism and adopted the rationalism spirit of christian wolff and johann salomo semler as a theology student , schleiermacher pursued an independent course of reading and neglected the study of the old testament and of oriental languages however , he attended the lectures of semler and became acquainted with the techniques of historical criticism of the new testament , and of johann augustus eberhard from whom he acquired a love of the philosophy of plato and aristotle at the same time , he studied the writings of immanuel kant and friedrich heinrich jacobi and began to apply ideas from the greek philosophers to a reconstruction of kant 's system schleiermacher developed a deep-rooted skepticism as a student and soon rejected orthodox christianity 3 brian gerrish , a scholar of the works of schleiermacher , wrote : schleiermacher confessed : '' faith is the regalia of the godhead , you say alas ! dearest father , if you believe that without this faith no one can attain to salvation in the next world , nor to tranquility in this—and such , i know , is your belief—oh ! then pray to god to grant it to me , for to me it is now lost i can not believe that he who called himself the son of man was the true , eternal god ; i can not believe that his death was a vicarious atonement at the completion of his course at halle , schleiermacher became the private tutor to the family of friedrich alexander burggraf und graf zu dohna-schlobitten ( 1741–1810 ) , developing in a cultivated and aristocratic household his deep love of family and social life two years later , in 1796 , he became chaplain to the charité hospital in berlin lacking scope for the development of his preaching skills , he sought mental and spiritual satisfaction in the city 's cultivated society and in intensive philosophical studies , beginning to construct the framework of his philosophical and religious system he was strongly influenced by german romanticism , as represented by his friend karl wilhelm friedrich von schlegel though his ultimate principles remained unchanged , he placed more emphasis on human emotion and the imagination in the first book , schleiermacher gave religion an unchanging place among the divine mysteries of human nature , distinguished it from what he regarded as current caricatures of religion and described the perennial forms of its manifestation that established the programme of his subsequent theological system from 1802 to 1804 , schleiermacher served as a pastor of a small reformed church in the pomeranian town of stolp it contends that the tests of the soundness of a moral system are the completeness of its view of the laws and ends of human life as a whole and the harmonious arrangement of its subject-matter under one fundamental principle although it is almost exclusively critical and negative , the book announces schleiermacher 's later view of moral science , attaching prime importance to a güterlehre , or doctrine of the ends to be obtained by moral action the obscurity of the book 's style and its negative tone prevented immediate success in 1804 , schleiermacher moved as university preacher and professor of theology to the university of halle , where he remained until 1807 after the battle of jena , he returned to berlin ( 1807 ) , was soon appointed pastor of the trinity church and , on may 18 , 1809 , married henriette von willich ( née von mühlenfels ) ( 1788–1840 ) , the widow of his friend ehrenfried von willich ( 1777–1807 ) at the foundation of the university of berlin ( 1810 ) , in which he took a prominent part , schleiermacher obtained a theological chair and soon became secretary to the prussian academy of sciences he took a prominent part in the reorganization of the prussian church and became the most powerful advocate of the union of the lutheran and reformed divisions of german protestantism , paving the way for the prussian union of churches ( 1817 ) in politics , schleiermacher supported liberty and progress , and in the period of reaction that followed the overthrow of napoleon , he was charged by the prussian government with '' demagogic agitation '' in conjunction with the patriot ernst moritz arndt its fundamental principle is that the source and the basis of dogmatic theology are the religious feeling , the sense of absolute dependence on god as communicated by jesus through the church , not the creeds or the letter of scripture or the rationalistic understanding the work is therefore simply a description of the facts of religious feeling , or of the inner life of the soul in its relations to god , and the inward facts are looked at in the various stages of their development and presented in their systematic connection the aim of the work was to reform protestant theology , to put an end to the unreason and superficiality of both supernaturalism and rationalism , and to deliver religion and theology from dependence on perpetually changing systems of philosophy schleiermacher continued with his translation of plato and prepared a new and greatly-altered edition of his christlicher glaube , anticipating the latter in two letters to his friend gottfried lücke ( in the studien und kritiken , 1829 ) in which he defended his theological position generally and his book in particular against opponents on both the right and the left the dualism is therefore not absolute , and , though present in man 's own constitution as composed of body and soul , is relative only even there our '' organization '' or sense nature has its intellectual element , and our '' intellect '' its organic element , and there is no such thing as '' pure mind '' or '' pure body '' the specific functions of the ego , as determined by the relative predominance of sense or intellect , are either functions of the senses ( or organism ) or functions of the intellect the former fall into the two classes of feelings ( subjective ) and perceptions ( objective ) ; the latter , according as the receptive or the spontaneous element predominates , into cognition and volition both cognition and volition are functions of thought as well as forms of moral action as the non-ego helps or hinders , enlarges or limits , our inner life , we feel pleasure or pain religious feeling therefore is the highest form of thought and of life ; in it we are conscious of our unity with the world and god ; it is thus the sense of absolute dependence schleiermacher 's doctrine of knowledge accepts the fundamental principle of kant that knowledge is bounded by experience , but it seeks to remove kant 's scepticism as to knowledge of the ding an sich ( the noumenon ) or sein , as schleiermacher 's term is all knowledge takes the form of the concept ( begriff ) or the judgment ( urteil ) , the former conceiving the variety of being as a definite unity and plurality , and the latter simply connecting the concept with certain individual objects the sum of being consists of the two systems of substantial forms and interactional relations , and it reappears in the form of concept and judgment , the concept representing being and the judgment being in action knowledge has under both forms the same object , the relative difference of the two being that when the conceptual form predominates we have speculative science and when the form of judgment prevails we have empirical or historical science throughout the domain of knowledge the two forms are found in constant mutual relations , another proof of the fundamental unity of thought and being or of the objectivity of knowledge in fact , schleiermacher is often referred to as '' the father of modern hermeneutics as a general study his published and unpublished writings on hermeneutics were collected together after his death , albeit with some disagreement over ordering and placement of individual texts and lecture notes '' the hermeneutics : outline of the 1819 lectures , '' new literary history , vol.10 , no '' the former deals with the language of the text , the latter with the thoughts and aims of the author the relationship of the author to language is cyclical , since the author is limited by his/her language and historical context , but s/he also contributes to language as a whole through new ideas and the appropriation of language schleiermacher , friedrich d '' the hermeneutics : outline of the 1819 lectures , '' new literary history , vol the interpreter must understand how its original audience understood this language schleiermacher , '' the hermeneutics : outline of the 1819 lectures , '' new literary history , vol '' the hermeneutics : outline of the 1819 lectures , '' new literary history , vol despite schleiermacher ’ s claim to the potential understanding of the author ’ s thoughts better than the author , he grants that '' good interpretation can only be approximated '' and that hermeneutics is not a '' perfect art but the moral law must not be conceived under the form of an '' imperative '' or a '' sollen '' ; it differs from a law of nature only as being descriptive of the fact that it ranks the mind as conscious will , or zweckdenken , above nature though a moral action may have these four characteristics at various degrees of strength , it ceases to be moral if one of them is quite absent under the title gesamtausgabe der werke schleiermachers in drei abteilungen , schleiermacher 's works were first published in three sections : theological ( 11 vols first alcibiades fidelity and transparency allegorical interpretations of plato , for schleiermacher 's influential plato interpretation plato 's unwritten doctrines , for the reaction against schleiermacher 's plato interpretation hermeneutic circle

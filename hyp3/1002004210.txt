however , pietism moravian theology failed to satisfy his increasing doubts , and his father reluctantly gave him permission to enter the university of halle , which had already abandoned pietism and adopted the rationalism spirit of christian wolff and johann salomo semler as a theology student , schleiermacher pursued an independent course of reading and neglected the study of the old testament and of oriental languages however , he attended the lectures of semler and became acquainted with the techniques of historical criticism of the new testament , and of johann augustus eberhard from whom he acquired a love of the philosophy of plato and aristotle at the same time , he studied the writings of immanuel kant and friedrich heinrich jacobi and began to apply ideas from the greek philosophers to a reconstruction of kant 's system 3 brian gerrish , a scholar of the works of schleiermacher , wrote : schleiermacher confessed : '' faith is the regalia of the godhead , you say alas ! dearest father , if you believe that without this faith no one can attain to salvation in the next world , nor to tranquility in this—and such , i know , is your belief—oh ! then pray to god to grant it to me , for to me it is now lost i can not believe that he who called himself the son of man was the true , eternal god ; i can not believe that his death was a vicarious atonement at the completion of his course at halle , schleiermacher became the private tutor to the family of friedrich alexander burggraf und graf zu dohna-schlobitten ( 1741–1810 ) , developing in a cultivated and aristocratic household his deep love of family and social life here schleiermacher became acquainted with art , literature , science and general culture in the first book , schleiermacher gave religion an unchanging place among the divine mysteries of human nature , distinguished it from what he regarded as current caricatures of religion and described the perennial forms of its manifestation from 1802 to 1804 , schleiermacher served as a pastor of a small reformed church in the pomeranian town of stolp it contends that the tests of the soundness of a moral system are the completeness of its view of the laws and ends of human life as a whole and the harmonious arrangement of its subject-matter under one fundamental principle although it is almost exclusively critical and negative , the book announces schleiermacher 's later view of moral science , attaching prime importance to a güterlehre , or doctrine of the ends to be obtained by moral action in 1804 , schleiermacher moved as university preacher and professor of theology to the university of halle , where he remained until 1807 he took a prominent part in the reorganization of the prussian church and became the most powerful advocate of the union of the lutheran and reformed divisions of german protestantism , paving the way for the prussian union of churches ( 1817 ) the 24 years of his professional career in berlin began with his short outline of theological study ( kurze darstellung des theologischen studiums , 1811 ) in which he sought to do for theology what he had done for religion in his speeches at the same time , schleiermacher prepared his chief theological work , der christliche glaube nach den grundsätzen der evangelischen kirche ( 1821–1822 ; 2nd ed , 1884 ; the christian faith according to the principles of the evangelical church ) its fundamental principle is that the source and the basis of dogmatic theology are the religious feeling , the sense of absolute dependence on god as communicated by jesus through the church , not the creeds or the letter of scripture or the rationalistic understanding the work is therefore simply a description of the facts of religious feeling , or of the inner life of the soul in its relations to god , and the inward facts are looked at in the various stages of their development and presented in their systematic connection he felt isolated although his church and his lecture-room continued to be crowded schleiermacher 's psychology takes as its basis the phenomenal dualism of the ego and the non-ego , and regards the life of man as the interaction of these elements with their interpenetration as its infinite destination our '' organization '' or sense nature has its intellectual element , and our '' intellect '' its organic element , and there is no such thing as '' pure mind '' or '' pure body '' the specific functions of the ego , as determined by the relative predominance of sense or intellect , are either functions of the senses ( or organism ) or functions of the intellect in cognition , thought is ontologically oriented to the object ; and in volition it is the teleological purpose of thought in the first case we receive ( in our fashion ) the object of thought into ourselves both cognition and volition are functions of thought as well as forms of moral action this self-consciousness is the third special form or function of thought — which is also called feeling and immediate knowledge schleiermacher 's doctrine of knowledge accepts the fundamental principle of kant that knowledge is bounded by experience , but it seeks to remove kant 's scepticism as to knowledge of the ding an sich ( the noumenon ) or sein , as schleiermacher 's term is the idea of knowledge or scientific thought as distinguished from the passive form of thought — of aesthetics and religion — is thought which is produced by all thinkers in the same form and which corresponds to being the universal uniformity of the production of judgments presupposes the uniformity of our relations to the outward world , and the uniformity of concepts rests similarly on the likeness of our inward nature the sum of being consists of the two systems of substantial forms and interactional relations , and it reappears in the form of concept and judgment , the concept representing being and the judgment being in action knowledge has under both forms the same object , the relative difference of the two being that when the conceptual form predominates we have speculative science and when the form of judgment prevails we have empirical or historical science duke notes , '' it was not until heinz kimmerle 's edition , based on a careful transcription of the original handwritten manuscripts , that an assured and comprehensive overview of schleiermacher 's theory of hermeneutics became possible duke concludes that the kimmerle edition '' reproduces the full , incontestably genuine corpus of schleiermacher literature on hermeneutics this process was not a systematic or strictly philological approach , but what he called '' the art of understanding the ultimate goal of hermeneutics for schleiermacher is '' understanding in the highest sense the relationship of the author to language is cyclical , since the author is limited by his/her language and historical context , but s/he also contributes to language as a whole through new ideas and the appropriation of language schleiermacher , '' the hermeneutics : outline of the 1819 lectures , '' new literary history , vol since the language used by an author '' is what mediates sensuously and externally between utterer and listener '' schleiermacher , friedrich d quantitative is misunderstanding the nuance in the author ’ s own '' sphere the grammatical interpretation leads to the technical interpretation as the reader attempts to understand why the author selected the language s/he did to convey his/her inner thoughts part of the task of hermeneutics is to fully understand these thoughts through the author ’ s discourse , even better than the author him/herself '' the hermeneutics : outline of the 1819 lectures , '' new literary history , vol therefore , the process of understanding is not only a historical process , learning about the context in which the author wrote , but also a psychological process , drawing upon the connection between interpreter and the author thus , hermeneutics is a cyclical task , but for schleiermacher it is not viciously circular because of the role of intuition 1 , literary hermeneutics ( autumn , 1978 ) , 14 the art puts the interpreter in the best position by '' putting oneself in possession of all the conditions of understanding the claim of schleiermacher as the father of hermeneutics seems to be justified by the fact that his work marks the beginning of hermeneutics as a general field of inquiry , separate from the specific disciplines ( e.g his focus on hermeneutics as a theory of interpretation for any textual expression would be expanded even further to the theory of interpretation of lived experiences in the twentieth century by those like heidegger , gadamer , and ricoeur next to religion and theology , schleiermacher devoted himself to the moral world , of which the phenomena of religion and theology were , in his systems , only constituent elements in his christian ethics he dealt with the subject from the basis of the christian consciousness instead of from that of reason generally ; the ethical phenomena dealt with are the same in both systems , and they throw light on each other , while the christian system treats more at length and less aphoristically the principal ethical realities — church , state , family , art , science and society in so doing , he attempts to overcome the latent weakness of schleiermacher ’ s doctrine of revelation through his emphasis on the ecclesiological doctrine of revelation asteroid 12694 schleiermacher is named for this german theologian—the name was chosen by german astronomer freimut börngen first alcibiades fidelity and transparency allegorical interpretations of plato , for schleiermacher 's influential plato interpretation plato 's unwritten doctrines , for the reaction against schleiermacher 's plato interpretation hermeneutic circle

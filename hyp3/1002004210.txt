as a theology student , schleiermacher pursued an independent course of reading and neglected the study of the old testament and of oriental languages however , he attended the lectures of semler and became acquainted with the techniques of historical criticism of the new testament , and of johann augustus eberhard from whom he acquired a love of the philosophy of plato and aristotle at the same time , he studied the writings of immanuel kant and friedrich heinrich jacobi and began to apply ideas from the greek philosophers to a reconstruction of kant 's system schleiermacher developed a deep-rooted skepticism as a student and soon rejected orthodox christianity 3 brian gerrish , a scholar of the works of schleiermacher , wrote : schleiermacher confessed : '' faith is the regalia of the godhead , you say i can not believe that he who called himself the son of man was the true , eternal god ; i can not believe that his death was a vicarious atonement at the completion of his course at halle , schleiermacher became the private tutor to the family of friedrich alexander burggraf und graf zu dohna-schlobitten ( 1741–1810 ) , developing in a cultivated and aristocratic household his deep love of family and social life lacking scope for the development of his preaching skills , he sought mental and spiritual satisfaction in the city 's cultivated society and in intensive philosophical studies , beginning to construct the framework of his philosophical and religious system here schleiermacher became acquainted with art , literature , science and general culture that interest is borne out by his confidential letters on schlegel 's lucinde as well as by his seven-year relationship ( 1798–1805 ) with eleonore christiane grunow ( née krüger ) ( 1769/1770–1837 ) , the wife of berlin clergyman august christian wilhelm grunow ( 1764–1831 ) he sympathised with some of jacobi 's positions , and took some ideas from fichte and schelling the literary product of that period of rapid development was his influential book , reden über die religion ( on religion ) , and his '' new year 's gift '' to the new century , the monologen ( soliloquies ) in the monologen , he revealed his ethical manifesto in which he proclaimed his ideas on the freedom and independence of the spirit and on the relationship of the mind to the sensual world , and he sketched his ideal of the future of the individual and of society from 1802 to 1804 , schleiermacher served as a pastor of a small reformed church in the pomeranian town of stolp it contends that the tests of the soundness of a moral system are the completeness of its view of the laws and ends of human life as a whole and the harmonious arrangement of its subject-matter under one fundamental principle in 1804 , schleiermacher moved as university preacher and professor of theology to the university of halle , where he remained until 1807 the 24 years of his professional career in berlin began with his short outline of theological study ( kurze darstellung des theologischen studiums , 1811 ) in which he sought to do for theology what he had done for religion in his speeches in politics , schleiermacher supported liberty and progress , and in the period of reaction that followed the overthrow of napoleon , he was charged by the prussian government with '' demagogic agitation '' in conjunction with the patriot ernst moritz arndt its fundamental principle is that the source and the basis of dogmatic theology are the religious feeling , the sense of absolute dependence on god as communicated by jesus through the church , not the creeds or the letter of scripture or the rationalistic understanding the work is therefore simply a description of the facts of religious feeling , or of the inner life of the soul in its relations to god , and the inward facts are looked at in the various stages of their development and presented in their systematic connection the aim of the work was to reform protestant theology , to put an end to the unreason and superficiality of both supernaturalism and rationalism , and to deliver religion and theology from dependence on perpetually changing systems of philosophy schleiermacher 's psychology takes as its basis the phenomenal dualism of the ego and the non-ego , and regards the life of man as the interaction of these elements with their interpenetration as its infinite destination the dualism is therefore not absolute , and , though present in man 's own constitution as composed of body and soul , is relative only even there the former fall into the two classes of feelings ( subjective ) and perceptions ( objective ) ; the latter , according as the receptive or the spontaneous element predominates , into cognition and volition both cognition and volition are functions of thought as well as forms of moral action this self-consciousness is the third special form or function of thought — which is also called feeling and immediate knowledge as the non-ego helps or hinders , enlarges or limits , our inner life , we feel pleasure or pain aesthetic , moral and religious feelings are respectively produced by the reception into consciousness of large ideas — nature , mankind and the world ; those feelings are the sense of being one with these vast objects religious feeling therefore is the highest form of thought and of life ; in it we are conscious of our unity with the world and god ; it is thus the sense of absolute dependence schleiermacher 's doctrine of knowledge accepts the fundamental principle of kant that knowledge is bounded by experience , but it seeks to remove kant 's scepticism as to knowledge of the ding an sich ( the noumenon ) or sein , as schleiermacher 's term is the idea of knowledge or scientific thought as distinguished from the passive form of thought — of aesthetics and religion — is thought which is produced by all thinkers in the same form and which corresponds to being this uniformity is not based on the sameness of either the intellectual or the organic functions alone , but on the correspondence of the forms of thought and sensation with the forms of being plato , spinoza and kant had contributed characteristic elements of their thought to this system , and directly or indirectly it was largely indebted to schelling for fundamental conceptions schleiermacher 's work has had a profound impact upon the philosophical field of hermeneutics in fact , schleiermacher is often referred to as '' the father of modern hermeneutics as a general study while schleiermacher did not publish extensively on hermeneutics during his lifetime , he lectured widely on the field duke notes , '' it was not until heinz kimmerle 's edition , based on a careful transcription of the original handwritten manuscripts , that an assured and comprehensive overview of schleiermacher 's theory of hermeneutics became possible atlanta , ga : scholars press , 1977 , 1 duke concludes that the kimmerle edition '' reproduces the full , incontestably genuine corpus of schleiermacher literature on hermeneutics though he was certainly interested in interpreting scripture , he thought one could only do so properly once one had established a system of interpretation that was applicable to all texts schleiermacher understood that reading a text was a discourse between the interpreter and the text itself ; however , he considered the text as the means by which the author is communicating thoughts previous to the creation of the text '' the hermeneutics : outline of the 1819 lectures , '' new literary history , vol.10 , no this artistic approach to interpreting texts contained within it an ebb-and-flow between what schleiermacher called the '' grammatical interpretation '' and the '' psychological ( or technical ) interpretation : cambridge university press , 228 in this way , the object to be understood stems from a thought of an author , and then is expressed through language schleiermacher , '' the hermeneutics : outline of the 1819 lectures , '' new literary history , vol the grammatical interpretation leads to the technical interpretation as the reader attempts to understand why the author selected the language s/he did to convey his/her inner thoughts '' the hermeneutics : outline of the 1819 lectures , '' new literary history , vol the interpreter can then evaluate what the effect of the work was on the author ’ s context '' understanding '' for schleiermacher is the art of experiencing the same process of thought that the author experienced understanding is made possible by the fact that author and reader , since both are human , share the reasoning ability the ontological basis of ethics is the unity of the real and the ideal , and the psychological and actual basis of the ethical process is the tendency of reason and nature to unite in the form of the complete organization of the latter by the former in his system the doctrine of duty is the description of the method of the attainment of ethical ends , the conception of duty as an imperative , or obligation , being excluded , as we have seen at various periods of his life schleiermacher used different terms to represent the character and relation of religious feeling atlanta , ga : scholars press , 1977 paperback on creeds , confessions and church union : '' that they may be one '' , tr on religion ( über die religion : reden an die gebildeten unter ihren verächtern , three editions : 1799 , 1806 , 1831 ) 1799 text tr

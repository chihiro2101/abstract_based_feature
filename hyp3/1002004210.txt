as a theology student , schleiermacher pursued an independent course of reading and neglected the study of the old testament and of oriental languages however , he attended the lectures of semler and became acquainted with the techniques of historical criticism of the new testament , and of johann augustus eberhard from whom he acquired a love of the philosophy of plato and aristotle at the same time , he studied the writings of immanuel kant and friedrich heinrich jacobi and began to apply ideas from the greek philosophers to a reconstruction of kant 's system schleiermacher developed a deep-rooted skepticism as a student and soon rejected orthodox christianity haykin , liberal protestantism , p 3 brian gerrish , a scholar of the works of schleiermacher , wrote : schleiermacher confessed : '' faith is the regalia of the godhead , you say alas ! dearest father , if you believe that without this faith no one can attain to salvation in the next world , nor to tranquility in this—and such , i know , is your belief—oh ! then pray to god to grant it to me , for to me it is now lost i can not believe that he who called himself the son of man was the true , eternal god ; i can not believe that his death was a vicarious atonement tutoring , chaplaincy and first works two years later , in 1796 , he became chaplain to the charité hospital in berlin here schleiermacher became acquainted with art , literature , science and general culture he was strongly influenced by german romanticism , as represented by his friend karl wilhelm friedrich von schlegel though his ultimate principles remained unchanged , he placed more emphasis on human emotion and the imagination he became more indebted to kant though they differed on fundamental points the literary product of that period of rapid development was his influential book , reden über die religion ( on religion ) , and his '' new year 's gift '' to the new century , the monologen ( soliloquies ) that established the programme of his subsequent theological system from 1802 to 1804 , schleiermacher served as a pastor of a small reformed church in the pomeranian town of stolp in 1804 , schleiermacher moved as university preacher and professor of theology to the university of halle , where he remained until 1807 he quickly obtained a reputation as professor and preacher and exercised a powerful influence in spite of contradictory charges , which accused him of atheism , spinozism and pietism he took a prominent part in the reorganization of the prussian church and became the most powerful advocate of the union of the lutheran and reformed divisions of german protestantism , paving the way for the prussian union of churches ( 1817 ) in politics , schleiermacher supported liberty and progress , and in the period of reaction that followed the overthrow of napoleon , he was charged by the prussian government with '' demagogic agitation '' in conjunction with the patriot ernst moritz arndt at the same time , schleiermacher prepared his chief theological work , der christliche glaube nach den grundsätzen der evangelischen kirche ( 1821–1822 ; 2nd ed , greatly altered , 1830–1831 ; 6th ed its fundamental principle is that the source and the basis of dogmatic theology are the religious feeling , the sense of absolute dependence on god as communicated by jesus through the church , not the creeds or the letter of scripture or the rationalistic understanding the aim of the work was to reform protestant theology , to put an end to the unreason and superficiality of both supernaturalism and rationalism , and to deliver religion and theology from dependence on perpetually changing systems of philosophy he felt isolated although his church and his lecture-room continued to be crowded schleiermacher 's psychology takes as its basis the phenomenal dualism of the ego and the non-ego , and regards the life of man as the interaction of these elements with their interpenetration as its infinite destination the dualism is therefore not absolute , and , though present in man 's own constitution as composed of body and soul , is relative only even there our '' organization '' or sense nature has its intellectual element , and our '' intellect '' its organic element , and there is no such thing as '' pure mind '' or '' pure body it is in those two functions that the real life of the ego is manifested , but behind them is self-consciousness permanently present , which is always both subjective and objective — consciousness of ourselves and of the non-ego in it we cognize our own inner life as affected by the non-ego as the non-ego helps or hinders , enlarges or limits , our inner life , we feel pleasure or pain aesthetic , moral and religious feelings are respectively produced by the reception into consciousness of large ideas — nature , mankind and the world ; those feelings are the sense of being one with these vast objects the idea of knowledge or scientific thought as distinguished from the passive form of thought — of aesthetics and religion — is thought which is produced by all thinkers in the same form and which corresponds to being the universal uniformity of the production of judgments presupposes the uniformity of our relations to the outward world , and the uniformity of concepts rests similarly on the likeness of our inward nature the sum of being consists of the two systems of substantial forms and interactional relations , and it reappears in the form of concept and judgment , the concept representing being and the judgment being in action plato , spinoza and kant had contributed characteristic elements of their thought to this system , and directly or indirectly it was largely indebted to schelling for fundamental conceptions in fact , schleiermacher is often referred to as '' the father of modern hermeneutics as a general study while schleiermacher did not publish extensively on hermeneutics during his lifetime , he lectured widely on the field his published and unpublished writings on hermeneutics were collected together after his death , albeit with some disagreement over ordering and placement of individual texts and lecture notes though he was certainly interested in interpreting scripture , he thought one could only do so properly once one had established a system of interpretation that was applicable to all texts this process was not a systematic or strictly philological approach , but what he called '' the art of understanding '' the hermeneutics : outline of the 1819 lectures , '' new literary history , vol.10 , no these thoughts are what ultimately cause the author to produce the text , thus the place where these '' inner thoughts '' become '' outer expression '' in language is at the moment of text creation in order to interpret a text , then , the interpreter must consider both the inner thoughts of the author and the language that s/he used in writing the text this artistic approach to interpreting texts contained within it an ebb-and-flow between what schleiermacher called the '' grammatical interpretation '' and the '' psychological ( or technical ) interpretation '' the former deals with the language of the text , the latter with the thoughts and aims of the author schleiermacher divides misunderstanding into two forms : qualitative and quantitative '' the hermeneutics : outline of the 1819 lectures , '' new literary history , vol part of the task of hermeneutics is to fully understand these thoughts through the author ’ s discourse , even better than the author him/herself next to religion and theology , schleiermacher devoted himself to the moral world , of which the phenomena of religion and theology were , in his systems , only constituent elements his religious thought found its expression most notably in the christian faith , one of the most influential works of christian theology of its time see also sämmtliche werke ( berlin , 1834ff modern editions : brief outline for the study of theology ( kurze darstellung des theologischen studiums zum behuf einleitender vorlesungen , 1830 ) atlanta , ga : scholars press , 1977 paperback on creeds , confessions and church union : '' that they may be one '' , tr

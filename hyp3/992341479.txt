when a nuclear chain reaction in a mass of fissile material is self-sustaining , the mass is said to be in a critical state in which there is no increase or decrease in power , temperature , or neutron population when k 1 , the mass is critical , and the chain reaction is self-sustaining a subcritical mass is a mass of fissile material that does not have the ability to sustain a fission chain reaction due to spontaneous fission a supercritical mass will undergo a chain reaction for example , a spherical critical mass of pure uranium-235 ( 235 u ) with a mass of about would experience around 15 & nbsp ; spontaneous fission events per second the probability that one such event will cause a chain reaction depends on how much the mass exceeds the critical mass the mass where criticality occurs may be changed by modifying certain attributes such as fuel , shape , temperature , density and the installation of a neutron-reflective substance if the perfect quantity of fuel were added to a slightly subcritical mass to create an '' exactly critical mass '' , fission would be self-sustaining for only one neutron generation ( fuel consumption then makes the assembly subcritical again ) conversely changing the shape to a less perfect sphere will decrease its reactivity and make it subcritical neglecting the very important resonances , the total neutron cross-section of every material exhibits an inverse relationship with relative neutron velocity a mass that is exactly critical at room temperature would be sub-critical in an environment anywhere above room temperature due to thermal expansion alone the density of a material at a constant temperature can be changed by varying the pressure or tension or by changing crystal structure ( see allotropes of plutonium ) an ideal mass will become subcritical if allowed to expand or conversely the same mass will become supercritical if compressed such a material is said to have a negative temperature coefficient of reactivity to indicate that its reactivity decreases when its temperature increases this can greatly increase yield , especially if even more neutrons are generated by fusing hydrogen isotopes , in a so-called boosted configuration the critical size is the minimum size of a nuclear reactor core or nuclear weapon that can be made for a specific geometrical arrangement and material composition the critical size must at least include enough fissionable material to reach critical mass if the size of the reactor core is less than a certain minimum , too many fission neutrons escape through its surface and the chain reaction is not sustained critical mass of a bare sphere the critical mass is inversely proportional to the square of the density consider only prompt neutrons , and let Î½ denote the number of prompt neutrons generated in a nuclear fission nuclear power plants operate between these two points of reactivity , while above the prompt critical point is the domain of nuclear weapons and some nuclear power accidents , such as the chernobyl disaster

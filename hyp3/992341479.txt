when a nuclear chain reaction in a mass of fissile material is self-sustaining , the mass is said to be in a critical state in which there is no increase or decrease in power , temperature , or neutron population a numerical measure of a critical mass is dependent on the effective neutron multiplication factor , the average number of neutrons released per fission event that go on to cause another fission event rather than being absorbed or leaving the material when k 1 , the mass is critical , and the chain reaction is self-sustaining a subcritical mass is a mass of fissile material that does not have the ability to sustain a fission chain reaction due to spontaneous fission a supercritical mass will undergo a chain reaction for example , a spherical critical mass of pure uranium-235 ( 235 u ) with a mass of about would experience around 15 & nbsp ; spontaneous fission events per second the probability that one such event will cause a chain reaction depends on how much the mass exceeds the critical mass the mass where criticality occurs may be changed by modifying certain attributes such as fuel , shape , temperature , density and the installation of a neutron-reflective substance it is possible for a fuel assembly to be critical at near zero power more closely refining the shape toward a perfect sphere will make the mass supercritical conversely changing the shape to a less perfect sphere will decrease its reactivity and make it subcritical a mass may be exactly critical at a particular temperature neutron cross section increase as the relative neutron velocity decreases neglecting the very important resonances , the total neutron cross-section of every material exhibits an inverse relationship with relative neutron velocity a mass that is exactly critical at room temperature would be sub-critical in an environment anywhere above room temperature due to thermal expansion alone the density of a material at a constant temperature can be changed by varying the pressure or tension or by changing crystal structure ( see allotropes of plutonium ) using such a material as fuel means fission decreases as the fuel temperature increases surrounding a spherical critical mass with a neutron reflector further reduces the mass needed for criticality most information on bare sphere masses is considered classified , since it is critical to nuclear weapons design , but some documents have been declassified consider only prompt neutrons , and let Î½ denote the number of prompt neutrons generated in a nuclear fission criticality in nuclear weapon design nuclear power plants operate between these two points of reactivity , while above the prompt critical point is the domain of nuclear weapons and some nuclear power accidents , such as the chernobyl disaster

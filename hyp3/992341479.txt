when a nuclear chain reaction in a mass of fissile material is self-sustaining , the mass is said to be in a critical state in which there is no increase or decrease in power , temperature , or neutron population when k 1 , the mass is critical , and the chain reaction is self-sustaining a subcritical mass is a mass of fissile material that does not have the ability to sustain a fission chain reaction due to spontaneous fission a supercritical mass will undergo a chain reaction for example , a spherical critical mass of pure uranium-235 ( 235 u ) with a mass of about would experience around 15 & nbsp ; spontaneous fission events per second the probability that one such event will cause a chain reaction depends on how much the mass exceeds the critical mass the mass where criticality occurs may be changed by modifying certain attributes such as fuel , shape , temperature , density and the installation of a neutron-reflective substance more closely refining the shape toward a perfect sphere will make the mass supercritical conversely changing the shape to a less perfect sphere will decrease its reactivity and make it subcritical a mass may be exactly critical at a particular temperature neglecting the very important resonances , the total neutron cross-section of every material exhibits an inverse relationship with relative neutron velocity hot fuel is always less reactive than cold fuel ( over/under moderation in lwr is a different topic ) a mass that is exactly critical at room temperature would be sub-critical in an environment anywhere above room temperature due to thermal expansion alone assuming the material expands with temperature ( enriched uranium-235 at room temperature for example ) , at an exactly critical state , it will become subcritical if warmed to lower density or become supercritical if cooled to higher density surrounding a spherical critical mass with a neutron reflector further reduces the mass needed for criticality this reduces the number of neutrons which escape the fissile material , resulting in increased reactivity in a bomb , a dense shell of material surrounding the fissile core will contain , via inertia , the expanding fissioning material if the size of the reactor core is less than a certain minimum , too many fission neutrons escape through its surface and the chain reaction is not sustained most information on bare sphere masses is considered classified , since it is critical to nuclear weapons design , but some documents have been declassified the critical mass is inversely proportional to the square of the density criticality in nuclear weapon design nuclear power plants operate between these two points of reactivity , while above the prompt critical point is the domain of nuclear weapons and some nuclear power accidents , such as the chernobyl disaster

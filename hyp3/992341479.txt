when a nuclear chain reaction in a mass of fissile material is self-sustaining , the mass is said to be in a critical state in which there is no increase or decrease in power , temperature , or neutron population a numerical measure of a critical mass is dependent on the effective neutron multiplication factor , the average number of neutrons released per fission event that go on to cause another fission event rather than being absorbed or leaving the material when k 1 , the mass is critical , and the chain reaction is self-sustaining a subcritical mass is a mass of fissile material that does not have the ability to sustain a fission chain reaction due to spontaneous fission a supercritical mass will undergo a chain reaction for example , a spherical critical mass of pure uranium-235 ( 235 u ) with a mass of about would experience around 15 & nbsp ; spontaneous fission events per second the probability that one such event will cause a chain reaction depends on how much the mass exceeds the critical mass the mass where criticality occurs may be changed by modifying certain attributes such as fuel , shape , temperature , density and the installation of a neutron-reflective substance if the perfect quantity of fuel were added to a slightly subcritical mass to create an '' exactly critical mass '' , fission would be self-sustaining for only one neutron generation ( fuel consumption then makes the assembly subcritical again ) conversely changing the shape to a less perfect sphere will decrease its reactivity and make it subcritical hot fuel is always less reactive than cold fuel ( over/under moderation in lwr is a different topic ) thermal expansion associated with temperature increase also contributes a negative coefficient of reactivity since fuel atoms are moving farther apart a mass that is exactly critical at room temperature would be sub-critical in an environment anywhere above room temperature due to thermal expansion alone the density of a material at a constant temperature can be changed by varying the pressure or tension or by changing crystal structure ( see allotropes of plutonium ) an ideal mass will become subcritical if allowed to expand or conversely the same mass will become supercritical if compressed changing the temperature may also change the density ; however , the effect on critical mass is then complicated by temperature effects ( see '' changing the temperature '' ) and by whether the material expands or contracts with increased temperature using such a material as fuel means fission decreases as the fuel temperature increases surrounding a spherical critical mass with a neutron reflector further reduces the mass needed for criticality the critical size must at least include enough fissionable material to reach critical mass most information on bare sphere masses is considered classified , since it is critical to nuclear weapons design , but some documents have been declassified consider only prompt neutrons , and let Î½ denote the number of prompt neutrons generated in a nuclear fission nuclear power plants operate between these two points of reactivity , while above the prompt critical point is the domain of nuclear weapons and some nuclear power accidents , such as the chernobyl disaster

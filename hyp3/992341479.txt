when a nuclear chain reaction in a mass of fissile material is self-sustaining , the mass is said to be in a critical state in which there is no increase or decrease in power , temperature , or neutron population when k 1 , the mass is critical , and the chain reaction is self-sustaining a subcritical mass is a mass of fissile material that does not have the ability to sustain a fission chain reaction due to spontaneous fission a supercritical mass will undergo a chain reaction for example , a spherical critical mass of pure uranium-235 ( 235 u ) with a mass of about would experience around 15 & nbsp ; spontaneous fission events per second the probability that one such event will cause a chain reaction depends on how much the mass exceeds the critical mass the mass where criticality occurs may be changed by modifying certain attributes such as fuel , shape , temperature , density and the installation of a neutron-reflective substance it is possible for a fuel assembly to be critical at near zero power more closely refining the shape toward a perfect sphere will make the mass supercritical a mass that is exactly critical at room temperature would be sub-critical in an environment anywhere above room temperature due to thermal expansion alone the higher the density , the lower the critical mass assuming the material expands with temperature ( enriched uranium-235 at room temperature for example ) , at an exactly critical state , it will become subcritical if warmed to lower density or become supercritical if cooled to higher density using such a material as fuel means fission decreases as the fuel temperature increases surrounding a spherical critical mass with a neutron reflector further reduces the mass needed for criticality in a bomb , a dense shell of material surrounding the fissile core will contain , via inertia , the expanding fissioning material this can greatly increase yield , especially if even more neutrons are generated by fusing hydrogen isotopes , in a so-called boosted configuration the critical size is the minimum size of a nuclear reactor core or nuclear weapon that can be made for a specific geometrical arrangement and material composition the critical size must at least include enough fissionable material to reach critical mass indeed , sophisticated nuclear weapons programs can make a functional device from less material than more primitive weapons programs require criticality in nuclear weapon design because of this , a reasonably sized gun-type weapon would suffer nuclear reaction ( predetonation ) before the masses of plutonium would be in a position for a full-fledged explosion to occur nuclear power plants operate between these two points of reactivity , while above the prompt critical point is the domain of nuclear weapons and some nuclear power accidents , such as the chernobyl disaster

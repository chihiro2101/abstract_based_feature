when a nuclear chain reaction in a mass of fissile material is self-sustaining , the mass is said to be in a critical state in which there is no increase or decrease in power , temperature , or neutron population when k 1 , the mass is critical , and the chain reaction is self-sustaining a subcritical mass is a mass of fissile material that does not have the ability to sustain a fission chain reaction a population of neutrons introduced to a subcritical assembly will exponentially decrease due to spontaneous fission a supercritical mass will undergo a chain reaction for example , a spherical critical mass of pure uranium-235 ( 235 u ) with a mass of about would experience around 15 & nbsp ; spontaneous fission events per second the probability that one such event will cause a chain reaction depends on how much the mass exceeds the critical mass if there is uranium-238 ( 238 u ) present , the rate of spontaneous fission will be much higher if the perfect quantity of fuel were added to a slightly subcritical mass to create an '' exactly critical mass '' , fission would be self-sustaining for only one neutron generation ( fuel consumption then makes the assembly subcritical again ) a mass may be exactly critical without being a perfect homogeneous sphere a mass may be exactly critical at a particular temperature as fuel temperature increases , neutrons of a given energy appear faster and thus fission/absorption is less likely a mass that is exactly critical at room temperature would be sub-critical in an environment anywhere above room temperature due to thermal expansion alone the density of a material at a constant temperature can be changed by varying the pressure or tension or by changing crystal structure ( see allotropes of plutonium ) an ideal mass will become subcritical if allowed to expand or conversely the same mass will become supercritical if compressed using such a material as fuel means fission decreases as the fuel temperature increases surrounding a spherical critical mass with a neutron reflector further reduces the mass needed for criticality but they do contribute to the reaction , and can decrease the critical mass by a factor of four the critical size must at least include enough fissionable material to reach critical mass if the size of the reactor core is less than a certain minimum , too many fission neutrons escape through its surface and the chain reaction is not sustained critical mass of a bare sphere in the case of a uranium bomb , this can be achieved by keeping the fuel in a number of separate pieces , each below the critical size either because they are too small or unfavorably shaped

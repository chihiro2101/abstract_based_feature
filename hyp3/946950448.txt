( his other contributions were the creation of inks that would adhere to metal type and a method of softening handmade printing paper so that it would take the impression well despite patiently trying different proportions of both metals , solving the second part of the type metal problem proved very difficult without the addition of yet a third metal , antimony alchemy had shown that when stibnite , an antimony sulfide ore , was heated with scrap iron , metallic antimony was produced the typefounder would typically introduce powdered stibnite and horseshoe nails into his crucible to melt lead , tin and antimony into type metal composition of type metal type metal is an alloy of lead , tin and antimony in different proportions depending on the application , be it individual character mechanical casting for hand setting , mechanical line casting or individual character mechanical typesetting and stereo plate casting the proportions used are in the range : lead 50‒86 % , antimony 11‒30 % and tin 3‒20 % type metal is an alloy of lead pure lead is a relatively cheap metal , is soft thus easy to work , and it is easy to cast since it melts at tin ( sn ) it promotes the fluidity of the molten alloy and makes the type tough , giving the alloy resistance to wear the actual compositions differed over time , different machines were adjusted to different alloys depending on the intended uses of the type every time type metal is remelted , tin and antimony oxidise after stirring the molten metal , grey powder forms on the surface , the dross , needing to be skimmed type metal should be easy to cast , this means : a reasonable low melting point , iron should not dissolve in the molten metal , mould and nozzles should stay clean and easy to maintain the molten metal should be clean , while molten it should give as little dross as possible , to prevent loss of tin and antimony letting this mixture cool the alloy will remain liquid even through 355 & nbsp ; °c , the melting point of pure lead once the temperature reaches 291 & nbsp ; °c , lead crystals will start to form , increasing the cohesion of the liquid alloy the 12/20 alloy contains many mixed crystals of tin and antimony , these crystals constitute the hardness of the alloy and the resistance against wear eutectic alloys are used on linotype-machines and ludlow-casters to prevent blockage of the mould and to ensure continuous trouble-free casting since a monotype composition caster can cope with a variety of different metal alloys , occasional mixing of linotype alloy with discarded typefounders alloy has proven its usefulness copper has been used for hardening type metal ; this metal easily forms mixed crystals with tin when the alloy cools down the iron was burned away in this process , reducing the antimony and at the same time removing the unwanted sulfur

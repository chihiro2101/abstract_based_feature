( his other contributions were the creation of inks that would adhere to metal type and a method of softening handmade printing paper so that it would take the impression well after much experimentation it was found that adding pewterer 's tin , obtained from cassiterite , improved the ability of the cast type to withstand the wear and tear of the printing process , making it tougher but not more brittle despite patiently trying different proportions of both metals , solving the second part of the type metal problem proved very difficult without the addition of yet a third metal , antimony alchemy had shown that when stibnite , an antimony sulfide ore , was heated with scrap iron , metallic antimony was produced the typefounder would typically introduce powdered stibnite and horseshoe nails into his crucible to melt lead , tin and antimony into type metal the addition of antimony conferred the much needed improvements in the properties of hardness , wear resistance and especially , the sharpness of reproduction of the type design , given that it has the curious property of diminishing the shrinkage of the alloy upon solidification type metal is an alloy of lead , tin and antimony in different proportions depending on the application , be it individual character mechanical casting for hand setting , mechanical line casting or individual character mechanical typesetting and stereo plate casting the proportions used are in the range : lead 50‒86 % , antimony 11‒30 % and tin 3‒20 % type metal is an alloy of lead pure lead is a relatively cheap metal , is soft thus easy to work , and it is easy to cast since it melts at tin ( sn ) it promotes the fluidity of the molten alloy and makes the type tough , giving the alloy resistance to wear typical type metal proportions the actual compositions differed over time , different machines were adjusted to different alloys depending on the intended uses of the type every time type metal is remelted , tin and antimony oxidise after stirring the molten metal , grey powder forms on the surface , the dross , needing to be skimmed type metal should produce a true and sharp cast , and reproduce the matrix in all detail type metal should be easy to cast , this means : a reasonable low melting point , iron should not dissolve in the molten metal , mould and nozzles should stay clean and easy to maintain the molten metal should be clean , while molten it should give as little dross as possible , to prevent loss of tin and antimony letting this mixture cool the alloy will remain liquid even through 355 & nbsp ; °c , the melting point of pure lead a mixture of 4 % tin , 12 % antimony , and 84 % lead solidifies at 240 & nbsp ; °c monotype machines however can utilize a wide range of different alloys ; maintaining a constant and a high production meant a strict standardization of the typemetal in the company , so as to reduce by all means any interruption of the production although care was taken to avoid mixing different types of type metal in shops with different type casting systems , in actual practice this often occurred

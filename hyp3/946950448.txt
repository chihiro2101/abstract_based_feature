( his other contributions were the creation of inks that would adhere to metal type and a method of softening handmade printing paper so that it would take the impression well cheap , plentifully available as galena and easily workable , lead has many of the ideal characteristics , but on its own it lacks the necessary hardness and does not make castings with sharp details because molten lead shrinks and sags when it cools to a solid after much experimentation it was found that adding pewterer 's tin , obtained from cassiterite , improved the ability of the cast type to withstand the wear and tear of the printing process , making it tougher but not more brittle despite patiently trying different proportions of both metals , solving the second part of the type metal problem proved very difficult without the addition of yet a third metal , antimony alchemy had shown that when stibnite , an antimony sulfide ore , was heated with scrap iron , metallic antimony was produced the typefounder would typically introduce powdered stibnite and horseshoe nails into his crucible to melt lead , tin and antimony into type metal type metal is an alloy of lead , tin and antimony in different proportions depending on the application , be it individual character mechanical casting for hand setting , mechanical line casting or individual character mechanical typesetting and stereo plate casting the proportions used are in the range : lead 50‒86 % , antimony 11‒30 % and tin 3‒20 % type metal is an alloy of lead in addition pure lead letters will quickly deform during use ; a direct result of the easy workability of lead tin ( sn ) it promotes the fluidity of the molten alloy and makes the type tough , giving the alloy resistance to wear typical type metal proportions the actual compositions differed over time , different machines were adjusted to different alloys depending on the intended uses of the type the lanston monotype corporation in the united kingdom had a whole range of alloys listed in their manuals type metal should produce a true and sharp cast , and reproduce the matrix in all detail type metal should be strong and lasting , to endure wear and pressure while printing type metal should be easy to cast , this means : a reasonable low melting point , iron should not dissolve in the molten metal , mould and nozzles should stay clean and easy to maintain the molten metal should be clean , while molten it should give as little dross as possible , to prevent loss of tin and antimony once the temperature reaches 291 & nbsp ; °c , lead crystals will start to form , increasing the cohesion of the liquid alloy a mixture of 4 % tin , 12 % antimony , and 84 % lead solidifies at 240 & nbsp ; °c copper has been used for hardening type metal ; this metal easily forms mixed crystals with tin when the alloy cools down iron is hardly dissolved into type metal , although the molten metal is always in contact with the cast iron surface of the melting pot

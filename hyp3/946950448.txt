after much experimentation it was found that adding pewterer 's tin , obtained from cassiterite , improved the ability of the cast type to withstand the wear and tear of the printing process , making it tougher but not more brittle despite patiently trying different proportions of both metals , solving the second part of the type metal problem proved very difficult without the addition of yet a third metal , antimony alchemy had shown that when stibnite , an antimony sulfide ore , was heated with scrap iron , metallic antimony was produced the typefounder would typically introduce powdered stibnite and horseshoe nails into his crucible to melt lead , tin and antimony into type metal the proportions used are in the range : lead 50‒86 % , antimony 11‒30 % and tin 3‒20 % type metal is an alloy of lead pure lead is a relatively cheap metal , is soft thus easy to work , and it is easy to cast since it melts at tin ( sn ) it promotes the fluidity of the molten alloy and makes the type tough , giving the alloy resistance to wear typical type metal proportions the actual compositions differed over time , different machines were adjusted to different alloys depending on the intended uses of the type after stirring the molten metal , grey powder forms on the surface , the dross , needing to be skimmed type metal should produce a true and sharp cast , and reproduce the matrix in all detail type metal should be strong and lasting , to endure wear and pressure while printing type metal should be easy to cast , this means : a reasonable low melting point , iron should not dissolve in the molten metal , mould and nozzles should stay clean and easy to maintain the molten metal should be clean , while molten it should give as little dross as possible , to prevent loss of tin and antimony the economics have to be taken in account too : keeping the costs down would mean : keeping the content of tin and antimony as low as possible , and maintaining a high quality of the type produced type metal should not adhere to the copper of the matrix the 12/20 alloy contains many mixed crystals of tin and antimony , these crystals constitute the hardness of the alloy and the resistance against wear copper has been used for hardening type metal ; this metal easily forms mixed crystals with tin when the alloy cools down characters cast from contaminated type metal such as this are of inferior quality , the solution being to discard and replace with fresh alloy iron is hardly dissolved into type metal , although the molten metal is always in contact with the cast iron surface of the melting pot joseph moxon , in his mechanick exercises , mentions a mix of equal amounts of '' antimony '' and iron nails

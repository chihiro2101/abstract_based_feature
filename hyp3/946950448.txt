( his other contributions were the creation of inks that would adhere to metal type and a method of softening handmade printing paper so that it would take the impression well after much experimentation it was found that adding pewterer 's tin , obtained from cassiterite , improved the ability of the cast type to withstand the wear and tear of the printing process , making it tougher but not more brittle despite patiently trying different proportions of both metals , solving the second part of the type metal problem proved very difficult without the addition of yet a third metal , antimony alchemy had shown that when stibnite , an antimony sulfide ore , was heated with scrap iron , metallic antimony was produced the typefounder would typically introduce powdered stibnite and horseshoe nails into his crucible to melt lead , tin and antimony into type metal the proportions used are in the range : lead 50‒86 % , antimony 11‒30 % and tin 3‒20 % type metal is an alloy of lead pure lead is a relatively cheap metal , is soft thus easy to work , and it is easy to cast since it melts at however , it shrinks when it solidifies making letters that are not sharp enough for printing in addition pure lead letters will quickly deform during use ; a direct result of the easy workability of lead the actual compositions differed over time , different machines were adjusted to different alloys depending on the intended uses of the type every time type metal is remelted , tin and antimony oxidise after stirring the molten metal , grey powder forms on the surface , the dross , needing to be skimmed dross must be processed at specialized companies , in order to extract the pure metals in conditions that would prevent environmental pollution and remain economically feasible type metal should be strong and lasting , to endure wear and pressure while printing once the temperature reaches 291 & nbsp ; °c , lead crystals will start to form , increasing the cohesion of the liquid alloy using a 12 % antimony , 88 % lead mixture prevents crystal formation entirely , becoming a eutectic a mixture of 4 % tin , 12 % antimony , and 84 % lead solidifies at 240 & nbsp ; °c the 12/20 alloy contains many mixed crystals of tin and antimony , these crystals constitute the hardness of the alloy and the resistance against wear copper has been used for hardening type metal ; this metal easily forms mixed crystals with tin when the alloy cools down even a tiny amount — & nbsp ; less than 1 % & nbsp ; — will form a dusty surface on the molten metal surface that is difficult to remove magnesium plates are very dangerous in molten lead , because this metal can easily burn and will ignite in the molten lead

the lungs , liver , brain , and bones are the most common metastasis locations from solid tumors retrieved on 2008-11-01 fracture of affected bones brain metastasis : neurology symptoms such as headaches , seizures , and vertigo although advanced cancer may cause pain , it is often not the first symptom the spread of metastasis may occur via the blood or the lymphatics or through both routes currently , three main theories have been proposed to explain the metastatic pathway of cancer : the epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( emt ) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition ( met ) hypothesis ( 1 ) , the cancer stem cell hypothesis ( 2 ) , and the macrophageâ€“cancer cell fusion hybrid hypothesis ( 3 ) , under the effect of particular biochemical and/or physical stressors , cancer cells can undergo nuclear expulsion with subsequent macrophage engulfment and fusion , with the formation of cancer fusion cells ( cfcs ) the natural adaptive evolution of cancer : the metastatic ability of cancer cells metastasis involves a complex series of steps in which cancer cells leave the original tumor site and migrate to other parts of the body via the bloodstream , via the lymphatic system , or by direct extension to do so , malignant cells break away from the primary tumor and attach to and degrade proteins that make up the surrounding extracellular matrix ( ecm ) , which separates the tumor from adjoining tissues the body resists metastasis by a variety of mechanisms through the actions of a class of proteins known as metastasis suppressors , of which about a dozen are known cancer cells often opportunistically switch between different kinds of motion '' rac and rho gtpases in cancer cell motility control '' 2010 all steps of the metastatic cascade involve a number of physical processes cell migration requires the generation of forces , and when cancer cells transmigrate through the vasculature , this requires physical gaps in the blood vessels to form the metastatic steps are critically regulated by various cell types , including the blood vessel cells ( endothelial cells ) , immune cells or stromal cells endothelial progenitor cells are important in tumor growth , angiogenesis and metastasis , and can be marked using the id1 ( id1 ) endothelial progenitor cells incorporated in tumor vasculature suggests that this cell type in blood-vessel development is important in a tumor setting and metastasis furthermore , ablation of the endothelial progenitor cells in the bone marrow can lead to a significant decrease in tumor growth and vasculature development the immune system is typically deregulated in cancer and affects many stages of tumor progression , including metastasis epigenetic regulation also plays an important role in the metastatic outgrowth of disseminated tumor cells recently , a series of high-profile experiments suggests that the co-option of intercellular cross-talk mediated by exosome vesicles is a critical factor involved in all steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade lymphatic spread allows the transport of tumor cells to regional lymph nodes near the primary tumor and ultimately , to other parts of the body localized spread to regional lymph nodes near the primary tumor is not normally counted as a metastasis , although this is a sign of a worse outcome it is theorized that metastasis always coincides with a primary cancer , and , as such , is a tumor that started from a cancer cell or cells in another part of the body the cells in a metastatic tumor resemble those in the primary tumor additionally , the metastatic-associated expression of these genes was also observed in some primary tumors , indicating that cells with the potential to metastasize could be identified concurrently with diagnosis of the primary tumor the identification of this metastasis-associated signature provides promise for identifying cells with metastatic potential within the primary tumor and hope for improving the prognosis of these metastatic-associated cancers current treatments are rarely able to cure metastatic cancer though some tumors , such as testicular cancer and thyroid cancer , are usually curable the existence of metastatic cancers in the absence of primary tumors also suggests that metastasis is not always caused by malignant cells that leave primary tumors

the lungs , liver , brain , and bones are the most common metastasis locations from solid tumors metastatic tumors are very common in the late stages of cancer , under the effect of particular biochemical and/or physical stressors , cancer cells can undergo nuclear expulsion with subsequent macrophage engulfment and fusion , with the formation of cancer fusion cells ( cfcs ) the natural adaptive evolution of cancer : the metastatic ability of cancer cells metastasis involves a complex series of steps in which cancer cells leave the original tumor site and migrate to other parts of the body via the bloodstream , via the lymphatic system , or by direct extension to do so , malignant cells break away from the primary tumor and attach to and degrade proteins that make up the surrounding extracellular matrix ( ecm ) , which separates the tumor from adjoining tissues by degrading these proteins , cancer cells are able to breach the ecm and escape the location of the metastases is not always random , with different types of cancer tending to spread to particular organs and tissues at a rate that is higher than expected by statistical chance alone the body resists metastasis by a variety of mechanisms through the actions of a class of proteins known as metastasis suppressors , of which about a dozen are known human cells exhibit different kinds of motion : collective motility , mesenchyme-type movement , and amoeboid movement cell migration requires the generation of forces , and when cancer cells transmigrate through the vasculature , this requires physical gaps in the blood vessels to form the metastatic steps are critically regulated by various cell types , including the blood vessel cells ( endothelial cells ) , immune cells or stromal cells the growth of a new network of blood vessels , called tumor angiogenesis , is a crucial hallmark of cancer therefore , endothelial progenitor cells are important in tumor biology and present novel therapeutic targets the immune system is typically deregulated in cancer and affects many stages of tumor progression , including metastasis epigenetic regulation also plays an important role in the metastatic outgrowth of disseminated tumor cells pkc-iota inhibition or knockdown resulted in an increase in e-cadherin and rhoa levels while decreasing total vimentin , phosphorylated vimentin ( s39 ) and par6 in metastatic melanoma cells for example , ovarian cancer can spread transperitoneally to the surface of the liver lymphatic spread allows the transport of tumor cells to regional lymph nodes near the primary tumor and ultimately , to other parts of the body it is common medical practice to test by biopsy at least one lymph node near a tumor site when carrying out surgery to examine or remove a tumor localized spread to regional lymph nodes near the primary tumor is not normally counted as a metastasis , although this is a sign of a worse outcome stomach cancer often metastasises to the ovary in women , when it is called a krukenberg tumor . metastasis and primary cancer the cells in a metastatic tumor resemble those in the primary tumor for instance , breast cancer cells look the same whether they are found in the breast or have spread to another part of the body when a second tumor is found in a patient that has been treated for cancer in the past , it is more often a metastasis than another primary tumor although metastasis is widely accepted to be the result of the tumor cells migration , there is a hypothesis saying that some metastases are the result of inflammatory processes by abnormal immune cells

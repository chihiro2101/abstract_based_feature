retrieved on 2008-11-01 fracture of affected bones brain metastasis : neurology symptoms such as headaches , seizures , and vertigo although advanced cancer may cause pain , it is often not the first symptom metastatic tumors are very common in the late stages of cancer the spread of metastasis may occur via the blood or the lymphatics or through both routes the most common sites of metastases are the lungs , liver , brain , and the bones , under the effect of particular biochemical and/or physical stressors , cancer cells can undergo nuclear expulsion with subsequent macrophage engulfment and fusion , with the formation of cancer fusion cells ( cfcs ) the natural adaptive evolution of cancer : the metastatic ability of cancer cells metastasis involves a complex series of steps in which cancer cells leave the original tumor site and migrate to other parts of the body via the bloodstream , via the lymphatic system , or by direct extension to do so , malignant cells break away from the primary tumor and attach to and degrade proteins that make up the surrounding extracellular matrix ( ecm ) , which separates the tumor from adjoining tissues breast cancer , for example , tends to metastasize to the bones and lungs human cells exhibit different kinds of motion : collective motility , mesenchyme-type movement , and amoeboid movement cancer cells often opportunistically switch between different kinds of motion some cancer researchers hope to find treatments that can stop or at least slow down the spread of cancer by somehow blocking some necessary step in one or more kinds of motion cell migration requires the generation of forces , and when cancer cells transmigrate through the vasculature , this requires physical gaps in the blood vessels to form the metastatic steps are critically regulated by various cell types , including the blood vessel cells ( endothelial cells ) , immune cells or stromal cells endothelial progenitor cells are important in tumor growth , angiogenesis and metastasis , and can be marked using the id1 ( id1 ) endothelial progenitor cells incorporated in tumor vasculature suggests that this cell type in blood-vessel development is important in a tumor setting and metastasis therefore , endothelial progenitor cells are important in tumor biology and present novel therapeutic targets epigenetic regulation also plays an important role in the metastatic outgrowth of disseminated tumor cells lymphatic spread allows the transport of tumor cells to regional lymph nodes near the primary tumor and ultimately , to other parts of the body the propensity for a metastatic cell to spread to a particular organ is termed 'organotropism ' for example , prostate cancer usually metastasizes to the bones malignant melanoma spreads to the brain , presumably because neural tissue and melanocytes arise from the same cell line in the embryo it is theorized that metastasis always coincides with a primary cancer , and , as such , is a tumor that started from a cancer cell or cells in another part of the body metastatic cancers may be found at the same time as the primary tumor , or months or years later it was previously thought that most cancer cells have a low metastatic potential and that there are rare cells that develop the ability to metastasize through the development of somatic mutations the choice of treatment depends on many factors , including the type of primary cancer , the size and location of the metastases , the patient 's age and general health , and the types of treatments used previously the existence of metastatic cancers in the absence of primary tumors also suggests that metastasis is not always caused by malignant cells that leave primary tumors

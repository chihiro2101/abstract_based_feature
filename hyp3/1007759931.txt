retrieved on 2008-11-01 fracture of affected bones brain metastasis : neurology symptoms such as headaches , seizures , and vertigo although advanced cancer may cause pain , it is often not the first symptom currently , three main theories have been proposed to explain the metastatic pathway of cancer : the epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( emt ) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition ( met ) hypothesis ( 1 ) , the cancer stem cell hypothesis ( 2 ) , and the macrophageâ€“cancer cell fusion hybrid hypothesis ( 3 ) , under the effect of particular biochemical and/or physical stressors , cancer cells can undergo nuclear expulsion with subsequent macrophage engulfment and fusion , with the formation of cancer fusion cells ( cfcs ) the natural adaptive evolution of cancer : the metastatic ability of cancer cells metastasis involves a complex series of steps in which cancer cells leave the original tumor site and migrate to other parts of the body via the bloodstream , via the lymphatic system , or by direct extension to do so , malignant cells break away from the primary tumor and attach to and degrade proteins that make up the surrounding extracellular matrix ( ecm ) , which separates the tumor from adjoining tissues by degrading these proteins , cancer cells are able to breach the ecm and escape the location of the metastases is not always random , with different types of cancer tending to spread to particular organs and tissues at a rate that is higher than expected by statistical chance alone breast cancer , for example , tends to metastasize to the bones and lungs '' rac and rho gtpases in cancer cell motility control '' 2010 all steps of the metastatic cascade involve a number of physical processes the metastatic steps are critically regulated by various cell types , including the blood vessel cells ( endothelial cells ) , immune cells or stromal cells endothelial progenitor cells have been shown to have a strong influence on metastasis and angiogenesis endothelial progenitor cells are important in tumor growth , angiogenesis and metastasis , and can be marked using the id1 ( id1 ) endothelial progenitor cells incorporated in tumor vasculature suggests that this cell type in blood-vessel development is important in a tumor setting and metastasis therefore , endothelial progenitor cells are important in tumor biology and present novel therapeutic targets the immune system is typically deregulated in cancer and affects many stages of tumor progression , including metastasis these epigenetic modifications in metastases may allow the proliferation and survival of disseminated tumor cells in distant organs pkc-iota inhibition or knockdown resulted in an increase in e-cadherin and rhoa levels while decreasing total vimentin , phosphorylated vimentin ( s39 ) and par6 in metastatic melanoma cells lymphatic spread allows the transport of tumor cells to regional lymph nodes near the primary tumor and ultimately , to other parts of the body lymphatic spread is the most common route of initial metastasis for carcinomas localized spread to regional lymph nodes near the primary tumor is not normally counted as a metastasis , although this is a sign of a worse outcome that is , hematogenous spread often follows distinct patterns depending on the location of the primary tumor however , often it remains unclear whether simultaneously diagnosed tumors of a canalicular system are one metastatic process or in fact independent tumors caused by the same agent ( field cancerization ) when a second tumor is found in a patient that has been treated for cancer in the past , it is more often a metastasis than another primary tumor metastases of breast cancer , medulloblastoma and prostate cancer all had similar expression patterns of these metastasis-associated genes the identification of this metastasis-associated signature provides promise for identifying cells with metastatic potential within the primary tumor and hope for improving the prognosis of these metastatic-associated cancers the existence of metastatic cancers in the absence of primary tumors also suggests that metastasis is not always caused by malignant cells that leave primary tumors

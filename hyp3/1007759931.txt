the lungs , liver , brain , and bones are the most common metastasis locations from solid tumors retrieved on 2008-11-01 fracture of affected bones brain metastasis : neurology symptoms such as headaches , seizures , and vertigo although advanced cancer may cause pain , it is often not the first symptom metastatic tumors are very common in the late stages of cancer the most common sites of metastases are the lungs , liver , brain , and the bones the natural adaptive evolution of cancer : the metastatic ability of cancer cells metastasis involves a complex series of steps in which cancer cells leave the original tumor site and migrate to other parts of the body via the bloodstream , via the lymphatic system , or by direct extension to do so , malignant cells break away from the primary tumor and attach to and degrade proteins that make up the surrounding extracellular matrix ( ecm ) , which separates the tumor from adjoining tissues breast cancer , for example , tends to metastasize to the bones and lungs the body resists metastasis by a variety of mechanisms through the actions of a class of proteins known as metastasis suppressors , of which about a dozen are known cancer cells often opportunistically switch between different kinds of motion '' rac and rho gtpases in cancer cell motility control '' 2010 all steps of the metastatic cascade involve a number of physical processes the metastatic steps are critically regulated by various cell types , including the blood vessel cells ( endothelial cells ) , immune cells or stromal cells endothelial progenitor cells have been shown to have a strong influence on metastasis and angiogenesis endothelial progenitor cells incorporated in tumor vasculature suggests that this cell type in blood-vessel development is important in a tumor setting and metastasis therefore , endothelial progenitor cells are important in tumor biology and present novel therapeutic targets the immune system is typically deregulated in cancer and affects many stages of tumor progression , including metastasis epigenetic regulation also plays an important role in the metastatic outgrowth of disseminated tumor cells these epigenetic modifications in metastases may allow the proliferation and survival of disseminated tumor cells in distant organs pkc-iota inhibition or knockdown resulted in an increase in e-cadherin and rhoa levels while decreasing total vimentin , phosphorylated vimentin ( s39 ) and par6 in metastatic melanoma cells lymphatic spread allows the transport of tumor cells to regional lymph nodes near the primary tumor and ultimately , to other parts of the body it is common medical practice to test by biopsy at least one lymph node near a tumor site when carrying out surgery to examine or remove a tumor localized spread to regional lymph nodes near the primary tumor is not normally counted as a metastasis , although this is a sign of a worse outcome it is theorized that metastasis always coincides with a primary cancer , and , as such , is a tumor that started from a cancer cell or cells in another part of the body so , if a tissue sample taken from a tumor in the lung contains cells that look like breast cells , the doctor determines that the lung tumor is a secondary tumor when a second tumor is found in a patient that has been treated for cancer in the past , it is more often a metastasis than another primary tumor additionally , the metastatic-associated expression of these genes was also observed in some primary tumors , indicating that cells with the potential to metastasize could be identified concurrently with diagnosis of the primary tumor the existence of metastatic cancers in the absence of primary tumors also suggests that metastasis is not always caused by malignant cells that leave primary tumors

the lungs , liver , brain , and bones are the most common metastasis locations from solid tumors the natural adaptive evolution of cancer : the metastatic ability of cancer cells metastasis involves a complex series of steps in which cancer cells leave the original tumor site and migrate to other parts of the body via the bloodstream , via the lymphatic system , or by direct extension by degrading these proteins , cancer cells are able to breach the ecm and escape the location of the metastases is not always random , with different types of cancer tending to spread to particular organs and tissues at a rate that is higher than expected by statistical chance alone cell migration requires the generation of forces , and when cancer cells transmigrate through the vasculature , this requires physical gaps in the blood vessels to form the metastatic steps are critically regulated by various cell types , including the blood vessel cells ( endothelial cells ) , immune cells or stromal cells endothelial progenitor cells have been shown to have a strong influence on metastasis and angiogenesis this novel finding meant that investigators gained the ability to track endothelial progenitor cells from the bone marrow to the blood to the tumor-stroma and even incorporated in tumor vasculature endothelial progenitor cells incorporated in tumor vasculature suggests that this cell type in blood-vessel development is important in a tumor setting and metastasis therefore , endothelial progenitor cells are important in tumor biology and present novel therapeutic targets the immune system is typically deregulated in cancer and affects many stages of tumor progression , including metastasis epigenetic regulation also plays an important role in the metastatic outgrowth of disseminated tumor cells metastases display alterations in histone modifications , such as h3k4-methylation and h3k9-methylation , when compared to matching primary tumors these results suggested that pkc-ι is involved in signaling pathways which upregulate emt in melanoma thereby directly stimulates metastasis this is called nodal involvement , positive nodes , or regional disease '' positive nodes '' is a term that would be used by medical specialists to describe regional lymph nodes that tested positive for malignancy lymphatic spread is the most common route of initial metastasis for carcinomas localized spread to regional lymph nodes near the primary tumor is not normally counted as a metastasis , although this is a sign of a worse outcome that is , hematogenous spread often follows distinct patterns depending on the location of the primary tumor these spaces include for example the bile ducts , the urinary system , the airways and the subarachnoid space stomach cancer often metastasises to the ovary in women , when it is called a krukenberg tumor the cells in a metastatic tumor resemble those in the primary tumor for instance , breast cancer cells look the same whether they are found in the breast or have spread to another part of the body current treatments are rarely able to cure metastatic cancer though some tumors , such as testicular cancer and thyroid cancer , are usually curable the existence of metastatic cancers in the absence of primary tumors also suggests that metastasis is not always caused by malignant cells that leave primary tumors metastasis is a greek word meaning '' displacement '' , from μετά , meta , '' next '' , and στάσις , stasis , '' placement '' .

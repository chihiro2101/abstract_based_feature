water for the laundry would be hand carried , heated on a fire for washing , then poured into the tub that made the warm soapy water precious ; it would be reused , first to wash the least soiled clothing , then to wash progressively dirtier laundry in 1782 , henry sidgier issued a british patent for a rotating drum washer , and in the 1790s edward beetham sold numerous '' patent washing mills '' in england one of the first innovations in washing machine technology was the use of enclosed containers or basins that had grooves , fingers , or paddles to help with the scrubbing and rubbing of the clothes the person using the washer would use a stick to press and rotate the clothes along the textured sides of the basin or container , agitating the clothes to remove dirt and mud this crude agitator technology was hand-powered , but still more effective than actually hand-washing the clothes more advancements were made to washing machine technology in the form of the rotative drum design it would not be until the 19th century when steam power would be used in washing machine designs top loaders may require less periodic maintenance , since there is no need to clean a door seal or bellows , although a plastic tub may still require a periodic '' maintenance wash '' cycle ( described below ) as with front-loading washers , clothing should not be packed tightly into a top-loading washer although wet fabric usually fits into a smaller space than dry fabric , a dense wad of fabric can restrict water circulation , resulting in poor soap distribution and incomplete rinsing extreme overloading can also push fabrics into the small gap between the underside of the agitator and the bottom of the wash basket , resulting in fabrics wrapped around the agitator shaft , possibly requiring agitator removal to unjam this motion flexes the weave of the fabric and forces water and detergent solution through the clothes load because the wash action does not require the clothing be freely suspended in water , only enough water is needed to moisten the fabric front-loaders control water usage through the surface tension of water , and the capillary action this creates in the fabric weave because it takes time for this water absorption to occur with a motionless pile of fabric , nearly all front-loaders begin the washing process by slowly tumbling the clothing under the stream of water entering and filling the drum , to rapidly saturate the clothes with water front-loading washers are mechanically simple compared to top-loaders , with the main motor ( a universal motor or variable-frequency drive motor ) normally being connected to the drum via a grooved pulley belt and large pulley wheel , without the need for a gearbox , clutch or crank this access door is locked shut with an interlock during the entire wash cycle , since opening the door with the machine in use could result in water gushing out onto the floor in most machines , the interlock is usually doubly redundant to prevent either opening with the drum full of water or being opened during the spin cycle for front-loaders without viewing windows on the door , it is possible to accidentally pinch fabric between the door and the drum , resulting in tearing and damage to the pinched clothing during tumbling and spinning retrieving lost items from between the outer tub and inner basket can require complete disassembly of the front of the washer and pulling out the entire inner wash basket the drum bearing has to support the entire weight of the drum , the laundry , and the dynamic loads created by the sloshing of the water and of the imbalance of the load during the spin cycle the drum bearing eventually wears out , and usually requires extensive dismantling of the machine to replace , which often results in the machine being write-off due to the failure of a relatively inexpensive component that is labor-intensive to renew compared to top-loading washers , clothing can be packed more tightly in a front loader , up to the full drum volume if using a cottons wash cycle this is because wet cloth usually fits into a smaller space than dry cloth , and front loaders are able to self-regulate the water needed to achieve correct washing and rinsing extreme overloading of front-loading washers pushes fabrics towards the small gap between the loading door and the front of the wash basket , potentially resulting in fabrics lost between the basket and outer tub , and in severe cases , tearing of clothing and jamming the motion of the basket they have a drum rotating around a horizontal axis , as a front-loader , but there is no front door ; instead there is a liftable lid which provides access to the drum , which has a hatch which can be latched shut they have incidental advantages : they can be loaded without bending down ; they do not require a perishable rubber bellows seal ; and instead of the drum having a single bearing on one side , it has a pair of symmetrical bearings , one on each side , avoiding asymmetrical bearing loading and potentially increasing life this type of washing machine is popular in europe , where space is limited , as a washer can be as little as 40 & nbsp ; cm wide , and a full washer and dryer installation can be as little as 80 & nbsp ; cm wide there are also combo washer dryer machines that combine washing cycles and a full drying cycle in the same drum , eliminating the need to transfer wet clothes from a washer to a dryer machine the drying process tends to use much more energy than using two separate devices , because a combo washer dryer not only must dry the clothing , but also needs to dry out the wash chamber itself true front-loaders , and top-loading machines with horizontal-axis drum as described above , can be compared with top-loaders on a number of aspects : efficient cleaning : front-loaders usually use less energy , water , and detergent compared to the best top-loaders they usually take somewhat longer ( 20â€“110 minutes ) to wash a load , but are often computer controlled with additional sensors , to adapt the wash cycle to the needs of each load high-efficiency top-loaders with a wash plate ( instead of an agitator ) can spin up to 1100 rpm , as their center of gravity is lower higher spin speeds , along with the diameter of the drum , determine the g-force , and a higher g-force removes more residual water , making clothes dry faster wear and abrasion : top-loaders require an agitator or impeller mechanism to force enough water through clothes to clean them effectively , which greatly increases mechanical wear and tear on fabrics front-loaders use paddles in the drum to repeatedly pick up and drop clothes into water for cleaning ; this gentler action causes less wear the amount of clothes wear can be roughly gauged by the amount of accumulation in a clothes dryer lint filter , since the lint largely consists of stray fibers detached from textiles during washing and drying difficult items : top-loaders may have trouble cleaning large items , such as sleeping bags or pillows , which tend to float on top of the wash water rather than circulate within it top-loaders usually need a mechanical transmission ( due to agitators , see above ) , which can generate more noise than the rubber belt or direct drive found in most front loaders a front-loading washing machine , in a fully fitted kitchen , may even be disguised as a kitchen cabinet maintenance and reliability : top-loading washers are more tolerant of maintenance neglect , and may not need a regular '' freshening '' cycle to clean door seals and bellows the earliest washing machines simply carried out a washing action when loaded with clothes and soap , filled with hot water , and started while the consumer models pump used washer water out , allowing the waste line to be located above the washer , front-loading commercial machines generally use only gravity to expel used water an industrial washer can be mounted on heavy-duty shock absorbers and attached to a concrete floor , so that it can extract water from even the most severely out-of-balance and heavy wash loads preservation and also exhibition of vintage washing machines washing machines at the canada science and technology museum washing machine museum

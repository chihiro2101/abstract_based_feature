before indoor plumbing , the maids , washerwoman ( laundress ) , or housewife also had to carry all the water used for washing , boiling , and rinsing the laundry ; according to an 1886 calculation , some women in the united states fetched water eight to ten times every day from a pump , well , or spring for these purposes water for the laundry would be hand carried , heated on a fire for washing , then poured into the tub that made the warm soapy water precious ; it would be reused , first to wash the least soiled clothing , then to wash progressively dirtier laundry removal of soap and water from the clothing after washing was a separate process after rinsing , the soaking wet clothing would be formed into a roll and twisted by hand to extract water more advancements were made to washing machine technology in the form of the rotative drum design basically , these early design patents consisted of a drum washer that was hand-cranked to make the wooden drums rotate while the technology was simple enough , it was a milestone in the history of washing machines , as it introduced the idea of '' powered '' washing drums turnbull of saint john , new brunswick patented a '' clothes washer with wringer rolls front-loaders tend to require separate pumps and plumbing to provide lint filters which are often mounted behind covers on the bottom of the machine top loaders may require less periodic maintenance , since there is no need to clean a door seal or bellows , although a plastic tub may still require a periodic '' maintenance wash '' cycle ( described below ) as with front-loading washers , clothing should not be packed tightly into a top-loading washer this layout mounts the inner basket and outer tub horizontally , and loading is through a door at the front of the machine because the wash action does not require the clothing be freely suspended in water , only enough water is needed to moisten the fabric a front-loader washer always fills to the same low water level , but a large pile of dry clothing standing in water will soak up the moisture , causing the water level to drop the washer then refills to maintain the original water level because it takes time for this water absorption to occur with a motionless pile of fabric , nearly all front-loaders begin the washing process by slowly tumbling the clothing under the stream of water entering and filling the drum , to rapidly saturate the clothes with water some models , such as those by lg , utilitize a motor directly connected to the drum , eliminating the need for a belt and pulley for example , a top loading washer keeps water inside the tub merely through the force of gravity pulling down on the water , while a front-loader must tightly seal the door shut with a gasket to prevent water dripping onto the floor during the wash cycle this access door is locked shut with an interlock during the entire wash cycle , since opening the door with the machine in use could result in water gushing out onto the floor in most machines , the interlock is usually doubly redundant to prevent either opening with the drum full of water or being opened during the spin cycle nearly all front-loader washers for the consumer market also use a folded flexible bellows assembly around the door opening , to keep clothing contained inside the basket during the tumbling wash cycle the drum bearing has to support the entire weight of the drum , the laundry , and the dynamic loads created by the sloshing of the water and of the imbalance of the load during the spin cycle compared to top-loading washers , clothing can be packed more tightly in a front loader , up to the full drum volume if using a cottons wash cycle this is because wet cloth usually fits into a smaller space than dry cloth , and front loaders are able to self-regulate the water needed to achieve correct washing and rinsing extreme overloading of front-loading washers pushes fabrics towards the small gap between the loading door and the front of the wash basket , potentially resulting in fabrics lost between the basket and outer tub , and in severe cases , tearing of clothing and jamming the motion of the basket top-loading machines in asia use impellers instead of agitators clothes are loaded , the hatch and lid are closed , and the machine operates and spins just like a front-loader this type of washing machine is popular in europe , where space is limited , as a washer can be as little as 40 & nbsp ; cm wide , and a full washer and dryer installation can be as little as 80 & nbsp ; cm wide there are also combo washer dryer machines that combine washing cycles and a full drying cycle in the same drum , eliminating the need to transfer wet clothes from a washer to a dryer machine these machines are used more where space is at a premium , such as areas of europe and japan , because they can be fit into small spaces , perform both washing and drying , and many can be operated without dedicated utility connections in these machines , the washer and dryer functions often have different capacities , with the dryer usually having the lowest capacity these machines should not be confused with a dryer on top of a washer installation , or with a laundry center , which is a one piece appliance offering a compromise between a washer-dryer combo and a full washer to the side of the dryer installation or a dryer on top of a washer installation laundry centers usually have the dryer on top of the washer , with the controls for both machines being on a single control panel true front-loaders , and top-loading machines with horizontal-axis drum as described above , can be compared with top-loaders on a number of aspects : efficient cleaning : front-loaders usually use less energy , water , and detergent compared to the best top-loaders water usage : front-loaders usually use less water than top-loading residential clothes washers estimates are that front-loaders use from one third to one half as much water as top-loaders front-loaders use paddles in the drum to repeatedly pick up and drop clothes into water for cleaning ; this gentler action causes less wear noise : front-loaders tend to operate more quietly than top-loaders because the door seal helps contain noise , and because there is less of a tendency to imbalance a front-loading washing machine , in a fully fitted kitchen , may even be disguised as a kitchen cabinet water leakage : top-loading machines are less prone to leakage , because simple gravity can reliably keep water from spilling out the loading door on top maintenance and reliability : top-loading washers are more tolerant of maintenance neglect , and may not need a regular '' freshening '' cycle to clean door seals and bellows during the spin cycle , a top-loading tub is free to move about inside the cabinet of the machine , using only a lip around the top of the inner basket and outer tub to keep the spinning water and clothing from spraying out over the edge while the consumer models pump used washer water out , allowing the waste line to be located above the washer , front-loading commercial machines generally use only gravity to expel used water some computer-controlled commercial washers offer the operator control over the various wash and rinse cycles , allowing the operator to program custom washing cycles preservation and also exhibition of vintage washing machines washing machines at the canada science and technology museum washing machine museum

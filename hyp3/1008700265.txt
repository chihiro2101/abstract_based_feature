water for the laundry would be hand carried , heated on a fire for washing , then poured into the tub that made the warm soapy water precious ; it would be reused , first to wash the least soiled clothing , then to wash progressively dirtier laundry removal of soap and water from the clothing after washing was a separate process the first english patent under the category of washing machines was issued in 1691 301 a drawing of an early washing machine appeared in the january 1752 issue of the gentleman 's magazine , a british publication in 1782 , henry sidgier issued a british patent for a rotating drum washer , and in the 1790s edward beetham sold numerous '' patent washing mills '' in england one of the first innovations in washing machine technology was the use of enclosed containers or basins that had grooves , fingers , or paddles to help with the scrubbing and rubbing of the clothes the person using the washer would use a stick to press and rotate the clothes along the textured sides of the basin or container , agitating the clothes to remove dirt and mud more advancements were made to washing machine technology in the form of the rotative drum design while the technology was simple enough , it was a milestone in the history of washing machines , as it introduced the idea of '' powered '' washing drums in 1862 , a patented '' compound rotary washing machine , with rollers for wringing or mangling '' by richard lansdale of pendleton , manchester , was shown at the 1862 london exhibition the first united states patent titled '' clothes washing '' was granted to nathaniel briggs of new hampshire in 1797 28 during the 1850s , nicholas bennett from the mount lebanon shaker society at new lebanon , new york , invented a '' wash mill '' , but in 1858 he assigned the patent to david parker of the canterbury shaker village , where it was registered as the '' improved washing machine '' front-loaders tend to require separate pumps and plumbing to provide lint filters which are often mounted behind covers on the bottom of the machine another advantage to the top loading design is the reliance on gravity to contain the water , rather than potentially trouble-prone or short-lived front door seals top loaders may require less periodic maintenance , since there is no need to clean a door seal or bellows , although a plastic tub may still require a periodic '' maintenance wash '' cycle ( described below ) although wet fabric usually fits into a smaller space than dry fabric , a dense wad of fabric can restrict water circulation , resulting in poor soap distribution and incomplete rinsing extremely overloaded top-loading washers can either jam the motion of the agitator , overloading or damaging the motor or gearbox , burning drive belts , or tearing fabrics - many whirlpool/kenmore machines even have a mechanical '' fuse '' designed to break before the expensive motor is damaged some top-loading machines use mechanisms very similar to front-loading drum machines , and are described below this motion flexes the weave of the fabric and forces water and detergent solution through the clothes load front-loaders control water usage through the surface tension of water , and the capillary action this creates in the fabric weave a front-loader washer always fills to the same low water level , but a large pile of dry clothing standing in water will soak up the moisture , causing the water level to drop front-loading washers are mechanically simple compared to top-loaders , with the main motor ( a universal motor or variable-frequency drive motor ) normally being connected to the drum via a grooved pulley belt and large pulley wheel , without the need for a gearbox , clutch or crank for front-loaders without viewing windows on the door , it is possible to accidentally pinch fabric between the door and the drum , resulting in tearing and damage to the pinched clothing during tumbling and spinning the bellows assembly around the door is a potential source of problems for the consumer front-loader the bellows has a large number of flexible folds to permit the tub to move separately from the door during the high speed extraction cycle compared to top-loading washers , clothing can be packed more tightly in a front loader , up to the full drum volume if using a cottons wash cycle clothes are loaded , the hatch and lid are closed , and the machine operates and spins just like a front-loader this type of washing machine is popular in europe , where space is limited , as a washer can be as little as 40 & nbsp ; cm wide , and a full washer and dryer installation can be as little as 80 & nbsp ; cm wide there are also combo washer dryer machines that combine washing cycles and a full drying cycle in the same drum , eliminating the need to transfer wet clothes from a washer to a dryer machine in principle , these machines are convenient for overnight cleaning ( the combined cycle is considerably longer ) , but the effective capacity for cleaning larger batches of laundry is drastically reduced the drying process tends to use much more energy than using two separate devices , because a combo washer dryer not only must dry the clothing , but also needs to dry out the wash chamber itself these machines should not be confused with a dryer on top of a washer installation , or with a laundry center , which is a one piece appliance offering a compromise between a washer-dryer combo and a full washer to the side of the dryer installation or a dryer on top of a washer installation true front-loaders , and top-loading machines with horizontal-axis drum as described above , can be compared with top-loaders on a number of aspects : efficient cleaning : front-loaders usually use less energy , water , and detergent compared to the best top-loaders high efficiency washers use 20 % to 60 % of the detergent , water and energy of standard '' washers they usually take somewhat longer ( 20â€“110 minutes ) to wash a load , but are often computer controlled with additional sensors , to adapt the wash cycle to the needs of each load water usage : front-loaders usually use less water than top-loading residential clothes washers estimates are that front-loaders use from one third to one half as much water as top-loaders cycle length : top-loaders have tended to have shorter cycle times , in part because their design has traditionally emphasized simplicity and speed of operation more than resource conservation wear and abrasion : top-loaders require an agitator or impeller mechanism to force enough water through clothes to clean them effectively , which greatly increases mechanical wear and tear on fabrics front-loaders use paddles in the drum to repeatedly pick up and drop clothes into water for cleaning ; this gentler action causes less wear difficult items : top-loaders may have trouble cleaning large items , such as sleeping bags or pillows , which tend to float on top of the wash water rather than circulate within it however , all machines for sale must have washing performance a , such that manufacturers can not compromise washing performance in order to improve the energy efficiency while the consumer models pump used washer water out , allowing the waste line to be located above the washer , front-loading commercial machines generally use only gravity to expel used water camille paglia and others argue that the washing machine led to a type of social isolation of women , '' as mulheres sufocam os homens '' the cost of repair and the expected life of the machine may make the purchase of a new machine seem like the better option

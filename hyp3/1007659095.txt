it is the largest ( by volume ) but not tallest species of tree in new zealand , standing up to 50 m tall in the emergent layer above the forest 's main canopy australis from other members of the genus are southern kauri and new zealand kauri kauri forests are among the most ancient in the world although the kauri is among the most ancient trees in the world , it has developed a unique niche in the forest because it is such a conspicuous species , forest containing kauri is generally known as kauri forest , although kauri need not be the most abundant tree kauri even act as a foundation species that modify the soil under their canopy to create unique plant communities however , as it gains in height , the lowest branches are shed , preventing vines from climbing by maturity , the top branches form an imposing crown that stands out over all other native trees , dominating the forest canopy the flaking bark of the kauri tree defends it from parasitic plants , and accumulates around the base of the trunk reed , p.60 the kauri has a habit of forming small clumps or patches scattered through mixed forests fertilisation of the seeds occurs by pollination , which may be driven by the same or another tree 's pollen agathis australis can attain heights of 40 to 50 metres and trunk diameters big enough to rival californian sequoias at over 5 metres the largest kauri trees did not attain as much height or girth at ground level but contain more timber in their cylindrical trunks than comparable sequoias with their tapering stems thames historian alastair isdale says the tree was 8.54 metres in diameter , and 26.83 metres in girth a kauri tree at mill creek , mercury bay , known as father of the forests was measured in the early 1840s as 22 metres in circumference and 24 metres to the first branches ( 1919 ) , new zealand forestry , published by the new zealand forest service and available online through google books other trees far larger than living kauri have been noted in other areas given that over 90 per cent of the area of kauri forest standing before 1000ad was destroyed by about 1900 , it is not surprising that recent records are of smaller , but still very large trees two large kauri fell during tropical storms in the 1970s another tree , kopi , in omahuta forest near the standing hokianga kauri , was the third largest with a height of 56.39 metres ( 185 ' ) and a diameter of 4.19 metres ( 13.75 ' ) like many ancient kauri both trees were partly hollow reed p.62 a 1987 study measured mean annual diameter increments ranging from 1.5 to 4.6 & nbsp ; mm per year with an overall average of 2.3 & nbsp ; mm per year the growth of kauri in planted and second-growth natural forests has been reviewed and compared during the development of growth and yield models for the species kauri in planted forests were found to have up to 12 times the volume productivity than those in natural stands at the same age reed p.61-63 trees can normally live longer than 600 years on the other hand , broadleaf trees such as māhoe derive a good fraction of their nutrition in the deeper mineral layer of the soil such a solid foundation is necessary to prevent a tree the size of a kauri from blowing over in storms and cyclones the litter left by kauri is much more acidic than most trees , and as it decays similarly acidic compounds are liberated leaf litter and other decaying parts of a kauri decompose much more slowly than those of most other species in its interactions with the soil , kauri is thus able to starve its competitors of much needed nutrients and compete with much younger lineages image : agathis australis waipua 2005 a.jpg upright right thumb a kauri at waipoua forest in terms of local topography , kauri is far from randomly dispersed in waipoua forest this is reflected in higher abundances of kauri on ridge crests , and greater concentrations of its main competitors , such as taraire are found at low elevations those species which live alongside kauri include tawari , a montane broadleaf tree which is normally found in higher altitudes , where nutrient cycling is naturally slow its southern limit stretches from the kawhia harbour in the west to the eastern kaimai range during this time when frozen ice sheets covered much of the world 's continents , kauri was able to survive only in isolated pockets , its main refuge being in the very far north kauri requires a mean temperature of 17 & nbsp ; °c or more for most of the year there is some suggestion it has receded somewhat since then , which may indicate temperatures have declined slightly heavy logging , which began around 1820 and continued for a century , has considerably decreased the number of kauri trees it is estimated that today , there is 4 per cent of uncut forest left in small pockets the importance of waipoua forest in relation to the kauri was that it remained the only kauri forest retaining its former virgin condition , and that it was extensive enough to give reasonable promise of permanent survival the department of conservation has issued guidelines to prevent the spread of the disease , including keeping to defined tracks , cleaning footwear before and after entering kauri forest areas , and staying away from kauri roots gum-digger forestry in new zealand kauri museum list of superlative trees northland temperate kauri forest

as the number of recognized saints increased during late antiquity and the first half of the middle ages , eventually every day of the year had at least one saint who was commemorated on that date to deal with this increase , some saints were moved to alternate days in some traditions or completely removed , with the result that some saints have different feast days in different calendars 89 when the 1969 reform of the catholic calendar moved him to 28 january , they were moved back to 7 march ( see general roman calendar ) both days can thus be said to be their feast day , in different traditions the roman catholic calendars of saints in their various forms , which list those saints celebrated in the entire church , contains only a selection of the saints for each of its days the earliest feast days of saints were those of martyrs , venerated as having shown for christ the greatest form of love , in accordance with the teaching : '' greater love has no one than this , that someone lay down his life for his friends the general roman calendar of 1960 omitted the common of apostles , assigning a proper mass to every feast day of an apostle this happened because the same individual may be considered differently by one church ; in extreme examples , one church 's saint may be another church 's heretic , as in the cases of nestorius , pope dioscorus i of alexandria , or archbishop flavian of constantinople

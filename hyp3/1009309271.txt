the death cap is named in latin as such in the correspondence between the english physician thomas browne and christopher merrett ' the fungi phalloides '' i found not very far from norwich , large and very fetid.i have a part of one dried still by me though the scientific name phalloides means '' phallus-shaped '' , it is unclear whether it is named for its resemblance to a literal phallus or the stinkhorn mushrooms phallus in 1821 , elias magnus fries described it as agaricus phalloides , but included all white amanitas within its description finally in 1833 , johann heinrich friedrich link settled on the name amanita phalloides , link jhf ( 1833 ) grundriss der kraeuterkunde iv amanita phalloides is the type species of amanita section phalloideae , a group that contains all of the deadly poisonous amanita species thus far identified most notable of these are the species known as destroying angels , namely amanita virosa and amanita bisporigera , as well as the fool 's mushroom ( a & nbsp ; phalloides at times , but '' death cap '' is by far the most common vernacular name used in english other common names also listed include '' stinking amanita '' and '' deadly amanita '' the true amanita verna fruits in spring and turns yellow with koh solution , whereas a the death cap has a large and imposing epigeous ( aboveground ) fruiting body ( basidiocarp ) , usually with a pileus ( cap ) from across , initially rounded and hemispherical , but flattening with age the spore print is white , a common feature of amanita the death cap is native to europe , where it is widespread poisonous mushrooms of iran & nbsp ; phalloides may also be associated with these trees or with only some species and not others & nbsp ; phalloides is associated with coast live oak , but not with the various coastal pine species , such as monterey pine & nbsp ; phalloides does occur in the united states , apparently having been introduced from europe alongside chestnuts , with populations on the west and east coasts a 2009 genetic study provided strong evidence for the introduced status of the fungus on the west coast of north america as the common name suggests , the fungus is highly toxic , and is responsible for the majority of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide death cap mushroom soup claims fourth victim its biochemistry has been researched intensively for decades , and , or half a cap , of this mushroom is estimated to be enough to kill a human in general , poisoning incidents are unintentional and result from errors in identification & nbsp ; phalloides to the edible volvariella volvacea , with east- and southeast-asian immigrants in australia and the west coast of the united states falling victim zeitlmayr , p.62 other similar species include amanita subjunquillea in eastern asia and amanita arocheae , which ranges from andes colombia north at least as far as central mexico , both of which are also poisonous the species is now known to contain two main groups of toxins , both multicyclic ( ring-shaped ) peptides , spread throughout the mushroom tissue : the amatoxins and the phallotoxins of the amatoxins , α-amanitin is the chief component and along with β-amanitin is likely responsible for the toxic effects benjamin , p.217 the rna polymerase of amanita phalloides is insensitive to the effects of amatoxins , so the mushroom does not poison itself a review of death cap poisoning throughout europe from 1971 to 1980 found the overall mortality rate to be 22.4 % ( 51.3 % in children under ten and 16.5 % in those older than ten ) in the case of clement vii , the illness that led to his death lasted five months , making the case inconsistent with amatoxin poisoning ( p following his death , many sources have attributed it to his being fed a meal of death caps instead of caesar 's mushrooms

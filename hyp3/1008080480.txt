the filter is named after hungarian émigré rudolf e kálmán , although thorvald nicolai thiele and peter swerling developed a similar algorithm earlier bucy of the johns hopkins applied physics laboratory contributed to the theory , leading to it sometimes being called the kalman–bucy filter schmidt is generally credited with developing the first implementation of a kalman filter he realized that the filter could be divided into two distinct parts , with one part for time periods between sensor outputs and another part for incorporating measurements this kalman filter was first described and partially developed in technical papers by swerling ( 1958 ) , kalman ( 1960 ) and kalman and bucy ( 1961 ) kalman filters have been vital in the implementation of the navigation systems of u.s they are also used in the guidance and navigation systems of reusable launch vehicles and the attitude control and navigation systems of spacecraft which dock at the international space station this digital filter is sometimes called the stratonovich–kalman–bucy filter because it is a special case of a more general , nonlinear filter developed somewhat earlier by the soviet mathematician ruslan stratonovich the kalman filter uses a system 's dynamic model ( e.g the kalman filter produces an estimate of the state of the system as an average of the system 's predicted state and of the new measurement using a weighted mean the relative certainty of the measurements and current state estimate is an important consideration , and it is common to discuss the response of the filter in terms of the kalman filter 's gain when performing the actual calculations for the filter ( as discussed below ) , the state estimate and covariances are coded into matrices to handle the multiple dimensions involved in a single set of calculations the kalman filter is an efficient recursive filter that estimator the internal state of a linear dynamic system from a series of noisy measurements together with the linear-quadratic regulator ( lqr ) , the kalman filter solves the linear–quadratic–gaussian control problem ( lqg ) chapter 13 , 'the kalman filter ' in order to use the kalman filter to estimate the internal state of a process given only a sequence of noisy observations one must model the process in accordance with the following framework the kalman filter model assumes the true state at time k is evolved from the state at ( k & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; 1 ) according to : \mathbf the update equations are identical to those of the discrete-time kalman filter

bucy of the johns hopkins applied physics laboratory contributed to the theory , leading to it sometimes being called the kalman–bucy filter schmidt is generally credited with developing the first implementation of a kalman filter he realized that the filter could be divided into two distinct parts , with one part for time periods between sensor outputs and another part for incorporating measurements this kalman filter was first described and partially developed in technical papers by swerling ( 1958 ) , kalman ( 1960 ) and kalman and bucy ( 1961 ) kalman filters have been vital in the implementation of the navigation systems of u.s this digital filter is sometimes called the stratonovich–kalman–bucy filter because it is a special case of a more general , nonlinear filter developed somewhat earlier by the soviet mathematician ruslan stratonovich , physical laws of motion ) , known control inputs to that system , and multiple sequential measurements ( such as from sensors ) to form an estimate of the system 's varying quantities ( its state ) that is better than the estimate obtained by using only one measurement alone noisy sensor data , approximations in the equations that describe the system evolution , and external factors that are not accounted for all place limits on how well it is possible to determine the system 's state the kalman filter produces an estimate of the state of the system as an average of the system 's predicted state and of the new measurement using a weighted mean the weights are calculated from the covariance , a measure of the estimated uncertainty of the prediction of the system 's state the result of the weighted average is a new state estimate that lies between the predicted and measured state , and has a better estimated uncertainty than either alone this means that kalman filter works recursively and requires only the last '' best guess '' , rather than the entire history , of a system 's state to calculate a new state the relative certainty of the measurements and current state estimate is an important consideration , and it is common to discuss the response of the filter in terms of the kalman filter 's gain the kalman gain is the relative weight given to the measurements and current state estimate , and can be '' tuned '' to achieve a particular performance together with the linear-quadratic regulator ( lqr ) , the kalman filter solves the linear–quadratic–gaussian control problem ( lqg ) in the dempster–shafer theory , each state equation or observation is considered a special case of a linear belief function and the kalman filter is a special case of combining linear belief functions on a join-tree or markov tree at each discrete time increment , a linear operator is applied to the state to generate the new state , with some noise mixed in , and optionally some information from the controls on the system if they are known

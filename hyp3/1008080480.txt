kálmán , although thorvald nicolai thiele and peter swerling developed a similar algorithm earlier bucy of the johns hopkins applied physics laboratory contributed to the theory , leading to it sometimes being called the kalman–bucy filter schmidt is generally credited with developing the first implementation of a kalman filter he realized that the filter could be divided into two distinct parts , with one part for time periods between sensor outputs and another part for incorporating measurements this kalman filter was first described and partially developed in technical papers by swerling ( 1958 ) , kalman ( 1960 ) and kalman and bucy ( 1961 ) kalman filters have been vital in the implementation of the navigation systems of u.s this digital filter is sometimes called the stratonovich–kalman–bucy filter because it is a special case of a more general , nonlinear filter developed somewhat earlier by the soviet mathematician ruslan stratonovich in fact , some of the special case linear filter 's equations appeared in these papers by stratonovich that were published before summer 1960 , when kalman met with stratonovich during a conference in moscow the kalman filter uses a system 's dynamic model ( e.g noisy sensor data , approximations in the equations that describe the system evolution , and external factors that are not accounted for all place limits on how well it is possible to determine the system 's state the kalman filter produces an estimate of the state of the system as an average of the system 's predicted state and of the new measurement using a weighted mean this means that kalman filter works recursively and requires only the last '' best guess '' , rather than the entire history , of a system 's state to calculate a new state in this example , the kalman filter can be thought of as operating in two distinct phases : predict and update the kalman filter is an efficient recursive filter that estimator the internal state of a linear dynamic system from a series of noisy measurements however , by combining a series of measurements , the kalman filter can estimate the entire internal state at each discrete time increment , a linear operator is applied to the state to generate the new state , with some noise mixed in , and optionally some information from the controls on the system if they are known there is a strong analogy between the equations of the kalman filter and those of the hidden markov model

bucy of the johns hopkins applied physics laboratory contributed to the theory , leading to it sometimes being called the kalman–bucy filter schmidt is generally credited with developing the first implementation of a kalman filter he realized that the filter could be divided into two distinct parts , with one part for time periods between sensor outputs and another part for incorporating measurements this kalman filter was first described and partially developed in technical papers by swerling ( 1958 ) , kalman ( 1960 ) and kalman and bucy ( 1961 ) kalman filters have been vital in the implementation of the navigation systems of u.s navy nuclear ballistic missile submarines , and in the guidance and navigation systems of cruise missiles such as the u.s they are also used in the guidance and navigation systems of reusable launch vehicles and the attitude control and navigation systems of spacecraft which dock at the international space station this digital filter is sometimes called the stratonovich–kalman–bucy filter because it is a special case of a more general , nonlinear filter developed somewhat earlier by the soviet mathematician ruslan stratonovich the kalman filter uses a system 's dynamic model ( e.g , physical laws of motion ) , known control inputs to that system , and multiple sequential measurements ( such as from sensors ) to form an estimate of the system 's varying quantities ( its state ) that is better than the estimate obtained by using only one measurement alone the result of the weighted average is a new state estimate that lies between the predicted and measured state , and has a better estimated uncertainty than either alone this means that kalman filter works recursively and requires only the last '' best guess '' , rather than the entire history , of a system 's state to calculate a new state the relative certainty of the measurements and current state estimate is an important consideration , and it is common to discuss the response of the filter in terms of the kalman filter 's gain this allows for a representation of linear relationships between different state variables ( such as position , velocity , and acceleration ) in any of the transition models or covariances the kalman filter is an efficient recursive filter that estimator the internal state of a linear dynamic system from a series of noisy measurements a wide variety of kalman filters have now been developed , from kalman 's original formulation , now called the '' simple '' kalman filter , the kalman–bucy filter , schmidt 's '' extended '' filter , the information filter , and a variety of '' square-root '' filters that were developed by bierman , thornton , and many others the kalman filter model assumes the true state at time k is evolved from the state at ( k & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; 1 ) according to : \mathbf the update equations are identical to those of the discrete-time kalman filter

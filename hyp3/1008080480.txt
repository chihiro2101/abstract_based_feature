bucy of the johns hopkins applied physics laboratory contributed to the theory , leading to it sometimes being called the kalman–bucy filter schmidt is generally credited with developing the first implementation of a kalman filter he realized that the filter could be divided into two distinct parts , with one part for time periods between sensor outputs and another part for incorporating measurements this kalman filter was first described and partially developed in technical papers by swerling ( 1958 ) , kalman ( 1960 ) and kalman and bucy ( 1961 ) kalman filters have been vital in the implementation of the navigation systems of u.s navy nuclear ballistic missile submarines , and in the guidance and navigation systems of cruise missiles such as the u.s this digital filter is sometimes called the stratonovich–kalman–bucy filter because it is a special case of a more general , nonlinear filter developed somewhat earlier by the soviet mathematician ruslan stratonovich the kalman filter uses a system 's dynamic model ( e.g the kalman filter produces an estimate of the state of the system as an average of the system 's predicted state and of the new measurement using a weighted mean the weights are calculated from the covariance , a measure of the estimated uncertainty of the prediction of the system 's state this process is repeated at every time step , with the new estimate and its covariance informing the prediction used in the following iteration this means that kalman filter works recursively and requires only the last '' best guess '' , rather than the entire history , of a system 's state to calculate a new state the kalman gain is the relative weight given to the measurements and current state estimate , and can be '' tuned '' to achieve a particular performance in the prediction phase , the truck 's old position will be modified according to the physical laws of motion ( the dynamic or '' state transition '' model ) however , by combining a series of measurements , the kalman filter can estimate the entire internal state the kalman filter model assumes the true state at time k is evolved from the state at ( k & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; 1 ) according to : \mathbf the update equations are identical to those of the discrete-time kalman filter the traditional kalman filter has also been employed for the recovery of sparse , possibly dynamic , signals from noisy observations

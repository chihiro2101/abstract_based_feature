john henry draize ( 1900â€“1992 ) obtained a bsc in chemistry then a phd in pharmacology , studying hyperthyroidism this work culminated in a report by draize , his laboratory assistant , geoffrey woodard , and division chief , herbert calvery , describing how to assess acute , intermediate , and chronic exposure to cosmetics by applying compounds to the skin , penis , and eyes of rabbits following this report , the techniques were used by the fda to evaluate the safety of substances such as insecticides and sunscreens and later adopted to screen many other compounds by draize 's retirement in 1963 , and despite never having personally attached his name to any technique , irritancy procedures were commonly known as '' the draize test '' to distinguish the target organ , the tests are now often referred to as '' the draize eye test '' and '' the draize skin test '' scientific advisory committee on alternative toxicological methods analyzed the modern draize skin test stokes , preliminary evaluation of the underprediction rate of the in vivo dermal irritation test method , u.s scientific advisory committee on alternative toxicological methods , retrieved 29 june 2009 according to the american national anti-vivisection society , solutions of products are applied directly into the animals ' eyes , which can cause '' intense burning , itching and pain '' clips are placed on the rabbits ' eyelids to hold them open during the test period , which can last several days , during which time the rabbits are placed in restraining stocks '' in the draize test for skin irritancy , the test substances are applied to skin that is shaved and abraded ( several layers of skin are removed with sticky tape ) , then covered with plastic sheeting according to the british research defence society , the draize eye test is now a '' very mild test , '' in which small amounts of substances are used and are washed out of the eye at the first sign of irritation permission to carry out the test on several animals is given only if the test has been performed on a single animal and a period of 24 hours has been allowed for injury to become evident he also reported that differences in anatomy and biochemistry between the rabbit and human eye indicate that testing substances on rabbits might not predict the effects on humans industry and regulatory bodies responsible for public health are actively assessing animal-free tests to reduce the requirement for draize testing harbell , '' ocular safety : a silent ( in vitro ) success story '' , atla 30 , supplement 2 , 69-74 , 2002 however , since 2000 oecd had validated alternative tests for corrosivity , meaning acids , bases and other corrosive substances are no longer required to be draize tested on animals animal testing on rabbits test shopsis c , borenfreund e , stark dm : validation studies on a battery of potential in vitro alternatives to the draize test leighton j , nassauer j , tchao r , verdone j : development of a procedure using the chick egg as an alternative to the draize rabbit test

john henry draize ( 1900â€“1992 ) obtained a bsc in chemistry then a phd in pharmacology , studying hyperthyroidism the following year draize joined the fda , and was soon promoted to head of the dermal and ocular toxicity branch where he was charged with developing methods for testing the side effects of cosmetic products this work culminated in a report by draize , his laboratory assistant , geoffrey woodard , and division chief , herbert calvery , describing how to assess acute , intermediate , and chronic exposure to cosmetics by applying compounds to the skin , penis , and eyes of rabbits by draize 's retirement in 1963 , and despite never having personally attached his name to any technique , irritancy procedures were commonly known as '' the draize test '' to distinguish the target organ , the tests are now often referred to as '' the draize eye test '' and '' the draize skin test '' scientific advisory committee on alternative toxicological methods analyzed the modern draize skin test stokes , preliminary evaluation of the underprediction rate of the in vivo dermal irritation test method , u.s according to the british research defence society , the draize eye test is now a '' very mild test , '' in which small amounts of substances are used and are washed out of the eye at the first sign of irritation permission to carry out the test on several animals is given only if the test has been performed on a single animal and a period of 24 hours has been allowed for injury to become evident differences between the rabbit eye and the human eyes however , he noted '' that eyes of rabbits are generally more susceptible to irritating substances than the eyes of humans '' making them a conservative model of the human eye wilhelmus concluded '' the draize eye test harbell , '' ocular safety : a silent ( in vitro ) success story '' , atla 30 , supplement 2 , 69-74 , 2002 however , since 2000 oecd had validated alternative tests for corrosivity , meaning acids , bases and other corrosive substances are no longer required to be draize tested on animals the alternative tests include a human skin equivalent model and the transepicutaneous resistance test ( ter ) a 1995 study funded by the european commission and british home office evaluated these among nine potential replacements , including the hens ' egg chorioallantoic membrane ( het-cam ) assay and an epithelial model cultivated from human corneal cells , in comparison with draize test data regulatory bodies have therefore begun to adopt a tiered testing strategy for skin and eye irritation , using alternatives to reduce draize testing of substances with the most severe effects it requires that the test solution 's '' physical and chemical properties are not such that a severe adverse reaction could be predicted '' ; therefore '' known corrosive substances or those with a high oxidation or reduction potential must not be tested the test design requires that the substance be tested on one rabbit initially , and the effect of the substance on the skin must be ascertained before it can be introduced into the eye shopsis c , borenfreund e , stark dm : validation studies on a battery of potential in vitro alternatives to the draize test

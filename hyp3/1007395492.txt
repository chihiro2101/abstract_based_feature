john henry draize ( 1900â€“1992 ) obtained a bsc in chemistry then a phd in pharmacology , studying hyperthyroidism the following year draize joined the fda , and was soon promoted to head of the dermal and ocular toxicity branch where he was charged with developing methods for testing the side effects of cosmetic products this work culminated in a report by draize , his laboratory assistant , geoffrey woodard , and division chief , herbert calvery , describing how to assess acute , intermediate , and chronic exposure to cosmetics by applying compounds to the skin , penis , and eyes of rabbits following this report , the techniques were used by the fda to evaluate the safety of substances such as insecticides and sunscreens and later adopted to screen many other compounds by draize 's retirement in 1963 , and despite never having personally attached his name to any technique , irritancy procedures were commonly known as '' the draize test '' to distinguish the target organ , the tests are now often referred to as '' the draize eye test '' and '' the draize skin test '' in 1971 , before the implementation in 1981 of the modern draize protocol , toxicology carrol weil and robert scala of carnegie mellon university distributed three test substances for comparative analysis to 24 different university and state laboratories scientific advisory committee on alternative toxicological methods analyzed the modern draize skin test stokes , preliminary evaluation of the underprediction rate of the in vivo dermal irritation test method , u.s '' clips are placed on the rabbits ' eyelids to hold them open during the test period , which can last several days , during which time the rabbits are placed in restraining stocks '' in the draize test for skin irritancy , the test substances are applied to skin that is shaved and abraded ( several layers of skin are removed with sticky tape ) , then covered with plastic sheeting according to the british research defence society , the draize eye test is now a '' very mild test , '' in which small amounts of substances are used and are washed out of the eye at the first sign of irritation kirk wilhelmus , professor in the department of ophthalmology at baylor college of medicine , conducted a comprehensive review of the draize eye test in 2001 industry and regulatory bodies responsible for public health are actively assessing animal-free tests to reduce the requirement for draize testing before 2009 the organisation for economic co-operation and development ( oecd ) had not validated any alternative methods for testing eye or skin irritation potential in addition , the use of human corneal cell line ( hce-t cells ) is also another good alternative method to test eye irritation on potential chemicals in september 2009 the oecd validated two alternatives to the draize eye test : the bovine cornea opacity test ( bcop ) and isolated chicken eye test ( ice ) regulatory bodies have therefore begun to adopt a tiered testing strategy for skin and eye irritation , using alternatives to reduce draize testing of substances with the most severe effects in tests where severe eye irritancy is considered likely , a washout should closely follow testing in the eye of the first rabbit griffith jf , freeberg fe : empirical and experimental bases for selecting the low volume eye irritation test as the validation standard for in vitro methods

he then joined the university of wyoming and investigated plants poisonous to cattle , other livestock , and people the following year draize joined the fda , and was soon promoted to head of the dermal and ocular toxicity branch where he was charged with developing methods for testing the side effects of cosmetic products by draize 's retirement in 1963 , and despite never having personally attached his name to any technique , irritancy procedures were commonly known as '' the draize test '' to distinguish the target organ , the tests are now often referred to as '' the draize eye test '' and '' the draize skin test '' in 1971 , before the implementation in 1981 of the modern draize protocol , toxicology carrol weil and robert scala of carnegie mellon university distributed three test substances for comparative analysis to 24 different university and state laboratories scientific advisory committee on alternative toxicological methods analyzed the modern draize skin test '' in the draize test for skin irritancy , the test substances are applied to skin that is shaved and abraded ( several layers of skin are removed with sticky tape ) , then covered with plastic sheeting according to the british research defence society , the draize eye test is now a '' very mild test , '' in which small amounts of substances are used and are washed out of the eye at the first sign of irritation permission to carry out the test on several animals is given only if the test has been performed on a single animal and a period of 24 hours has been allowed for injury to become evident kirk wilhelmus , professor in the department of ophthalmology at baylor college of medicine , conducted a comprehensive review of the draize eye test in 2001 however , he noted '' that eyes of rabbits are generally more susceptible to irritating substances than the eyes of humans '' making them a conservative model of the human eye wilhelmus concluded '' the draize eye test industry and regulatory bodies responsible for public health are actively assessing animal-free tests to reduce the requirement for draize testing the alternative tests include a human skin equivalent model and the transepicutaneous resistance test ( ter ) regulatory bodies have therefore begun to adopt a tiered testing strategy for skin and eye irritation , using alternatives to reduce draize testing of substances with the most severe effects in tests where severe eye irritancy is considered likely , a washout should closely follow testing in the eye of the first rabbit griffith jf , freeberg fe : empirical and experimental bases for selecting the low volume eye irritation test as the validation standard for in vitro methods shopsis c , borenfreund e , stark dm : validation studies on a battery of potential in vitro alternatives to the draize test leighton j , nassauer j , tchao r , verdone j : development of a procedure using the chick egg as an alternative to the draize rabbit test

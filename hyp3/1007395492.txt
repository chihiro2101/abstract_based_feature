john henry draize ( 1900â€“1992 ) obtained a bsc in chemistry then a phd in pharmacology , studying hyperthyroidism the following year draize joined the fda , and was soon promoted to head of the dermal and ocular toxicity branch where he was charged with developing methods for testing the side effects of cosmetic products this work culminated in a report by draize , his laboratory assistant , geoffrey woodard , and division chief , herbert calvery , describing how to assess acute , intermediate , and chronic exposure to cosmetics by applying compounds to the skin , penis , and eyes of rabbits following this report , the techniques were used by the fda to evaluate the safety of substances such as insecticides and sunscreens and later adopted to screen many other compounds by draize 's retirement in 1963 , and despite never having personally attached his name to any technique , irritancy procedures were commonly known as '' the draize test '' to distinguish the target organ , the tests are now often referred to as '' the draize eye test '' and '' the draize skin test '' in 1971 , before the implementation in 1981 of the modern draize protocol , toxicology carrol weil and robert scala of carnegie mellon university distributed three test substances for comparative analysis to 24 different university and state laboratories scientific advisory committee on alternative toxicological methods analyzed the modern draize skin test according to the british research defence society , the draize eye test is now a '' very mild test , '' in which small amounts of substances are used and are washed out of the eye at the first sign of irritation permission to carry out the test on several animals is given only if the test has been performed on a single animal and a period of 24 hours has been allowed for injury to become evident kirk wilhelmus , professor in the department of ophthalmology at baylor college of medicine , conducted a comprehensive review of the draize eye test in 2001 he also reported that differences in anatomy and biochemistry between the rabbit and human eye indicate that testing substances on rabbits might not predict the effects on humans wilhelmus concluded '' the draize eye test before 2009 the organisation for economic co-operation and development ( oecd ) had not validated any alternative methods for testing eye or skin irritation potential harbell , '' ocular safety : a silent ( in vitro ) success story '' , atla 30 , supplement 2 , 69-74 , 2002 however , since 2000 oecd had validated alternative tests for corrosivity , meaning acids , bases and other corrosive substances are no longer required to be draize tested on animals positive results from some of these tests have been accepted by regulatory bodies , such as the british health and safety executive and us department of health and human services , without testing on live animals , but negative results ( no irritation ) required further in vivo testing regulatory bodies have therefore begun to adopt a tiered testing strategy for skin and eye irritation , using alternatives to reduce draize testing of substances with the most severe effects the test design requires that the substance be tested on one rabbit initially , and the effect of the substance on the skin must be ascertained before it can be introduced into the eye in tests where severe eye irritancy is considered likely , a washout should closely follow testing in the eye of the first rabbit

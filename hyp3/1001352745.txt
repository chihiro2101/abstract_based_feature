bulimia typically involves rapid and out-of-control eating , which may stop when the person is interrupted by another person or the stomach hurts from over-extension , followed by self-induced vomiting or other forms of purging people with bulimia nervosa may also exercise to a point that excludes other activities people with bulimia exhibit several interoception deficits , in which one experiences impairment in recognizing and discriminating between internal sensations , feelings , and emotions people with bulimia may also react negatively to somatic and affective states people with bulimia are more likely than people without bulimia to have an affective spectrum , such as depression or general anxiety disorder some with anorexia nervosa exhibit episodes of bulimic tendencies through purging ( either through self-induced vomiting or laxatives ) as a way to quickly remove food in their system there may be an increased risk for diabetes mellitus type 2 as with anorexia nervosa , there is evidence of genetic predispositions contributing to the onset of this eating disorder there is evidence that sex hormones may influence appetite and eating in women , and the onset of bulimia nervosa this dysregulation of appetite is also seen in women with bulimia nervosa in humans , there is evidence that there is an association between polymorphisms in the erβ ( estrogen receptor β ) and bulimia , suggesting there is a correlation between sex hormones and bulimia nervosa media portrayals of an 'ideal ' body shape are widely considered to be a contributing factor to bulimia in a 1991 study by weltzin , hsu , pollicle , and kaye , it was stated that 19 % of bulimics undereat , 37 % of bulimics eat an average or normal amount of food , and 44 % of bulimics overeat '' bulimia nervosa '' abnormal psychology when attempting to decipher the origin of bulimia nervosa in a cognitive context , christopher fairburn et al.s cognitive behavioral model is often considered the golden standard 's model discusses the process in which an individual falls into the binge-purge cycle and thus develops bulimia in contrast , byrne and mclean 's findings differed slightly from fairburn et al.s cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa in that the drive for thinness was the major cause of purging as a way of controlling weight similarly , fairburn et al.s cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa is not necessarily applicable to every individual and is certainly reductionist in addition , the cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa is very cultural bound in that it may not be necessarily applicable to cultures outside of the western society 's model and more generally the cognitive explanation of bulimia nervosa is more descriptive than explanatory , as it does not necessarily explain how bulimia arises the reported incident rate of unwanted sexual contact is higher among those with bulimia nervosa than anorexia nervosa when exploring the etiology of bulimia through a socio-cultural perspective , the '' thin ideal internalization '' is significantly responsible kevin thompson and eric stice claim that family , peers , and most evidently media reinforce the thin ideal , which may lead to an individual accepting and '' buying into '' the thin ideal in turn , thompson and stice assert that if the thin ideal is accepted , one could begin to feel uncomfortable with their body shape or size since it may not necessarily reflect the thin ideal set out by society consequently , body dissatisfaction coupled with a drive for thinness is thought to promote dieting and negative effects , which could eventually lead to bulimic symptoms such as purging or bingeing adolescents with bulimia nervosa are more likely to have self-imposed perfectionism and compulsivity issues in eating compared to their peers many bulimics may also engage in significantly disordered eating and exercise patterns without meeting the full diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa recently , the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders was revised , which resulted in the loosening of criteria regarding the diagnoses of bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa purging often is a common characteristic of a more severe case of bulimia nervosa researchers have also reported some positive outcomes for interpersonal psychotherapy and dialectical behavior therapy according to gelder , mayou and geddes ( 2005 ) bulimia nervosa is prevalent between 1 and 2 percent of women aged 15–40 years at the turn of the century , bulimia ( overeating ) was described as a clinical symptom , but rarely in the context of weight control however , bulimia nervosa 's prevalence was still much higher than anorexia nervosa 's , which at the time occurred in about 14 people per 100,000

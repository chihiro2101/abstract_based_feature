bulimia typically involves rapid and out-of-control eating , which may stop when the person is interrupted by another person or the stomach hurts from over-extension , followed by self-induced vomiting or other forms of purging people with bulimia nervosa may also exercise to a point that excludes other activities people with bulimia exhibit several interoception deficits , in which one experiences impairment in recognizing and discriminating between internal sensations , feelings , and emotions people with bulimia may also react negatively to somatic and affective states people with bulimia are more likely than people without bulimia to have an affective spectrum , such as depression or general anxiety disorder one study found 70 % had depression at some time in their lives ( as opposed to 26 % for adult females in the general population ) , rising to 88 % for all affective disorders combined some with anorexia nervosa exhibit episodes of bulimic tendencies through purging ( either through self-induced vomiting or laxatives ) as a way to quickly remove food in their system bulimia also has negative effects on a person 's teeth due to the acid passed through the mouth from frequent vomiting causing acid erosion , mainly on the posterior dental surface abnormal levels of many hormones , notably serotonin , have been shown to be responsible for some disordered eating behaviors there is evidence that sex hormones may influence appetite and eating in women , and the onset of bulimia nervosa this dysregulation of appetite is also seen in women with bulimia nervosa in humans , there is evidence that there is an association between polymorphisms in the erβ ( estrogen receptor β ) and bulimia , suggesting there is a correlation between sex hormones and bulimia nervosa '' bulimia nervosa '' abnormal psychology when attempting to decipher the origin of bulimia nervosa in a cognitive context , christopher fairburn et al.s cognitive behavioral model is often considered the golden standard accordingly , this would lead to unrealistically restricted eating , which may consequently induce an eventual '' slip '' where the individual commits a minor infraction of the strict and inflexible dietary rules everyone differs from another , and taking such a complex behavior like bulimia and applying the same one theory to everyone would certainly be invalid in addition , the cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa is very cultural bound in that it may not be necessarily applicable to cultures outside of the western society 's model and more generally the cognitive explanation of bulimia nervosa is more descriptive than explanatory , as it does not necessarily explain how bulimia arises furthermore , it is difficult to ascertain cause and effect , because it may be that distorted eating leads to distorted cognition rather than vice versa a considerable amount of literature has identified a correlation between sexual abuse and the development of bulimia nervosa the reported incident rate of unwanted sexual contact is higher among those with bulimia nervosa than anorexia nervosa when exploring the etiology of bulimia through a socio-cultural perspective , the '' thin ideal internalization '' is significantly responsible studies have shown that young females that read fashion magazines tend to have more bulimic symptoms than those females who do not kevin thompson and eric stice claim that family , peers , and most evidently media reinforce the thin ideal , which may lead to an individual accepting and '' buying into '' the thin ideal thus , people feeling uncomfortable with their bodies may result in suffering from body dissatisfaction and may develop a certain drive for thinness papies showed that it is not the thin ideal itself , but rather the self-association with other persons of a certain weight that decide how someone with bulimia nervosa feels adolescents with bulimia nervosa are more likely to have self-imposed perfectionism and compulsivity issues in eating compared to their peers bulimia nervosa can be difficult to detect , compared to anorexia nervosa , because bulimics tend to be of average or slightly above average weight recently , the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders was revised , which resulted in the loosening of criteria regarding the diagnoses of bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa purging often is a common characteristic of a more severe case of bulimia nervosa studies on time trends in the prevalence of bulimia nervosa have also yielded inconsistent results however , while these patients may have met modern criteria for bulimia nervosa , they can not technically be diagnosed with the disorder , as it had not yet appeared in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders at the time of their treatment however , bulimia nervosa 's prevalence was still much higher than anorexia nervosa 's , which at the time occurred in about 14 people per 100,000

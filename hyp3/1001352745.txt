bulimia typically involves rapid and out-of-control eating , which may stop when the person is interrupted by another person or the stomach hurts from over-extension , followed by self-induced vomiting or other forms of purging people with bulimia nervosa may also exercise to a point that excludes other activities people with bulimia exhibit several interoception deficits , in which one experiences impairment in recognizing and discriminating between internal sensations , feelings , and emotions people with bulimia may also react negatively to somatic and affective states people with bulimia are more likely than people without bulimia to have an affective spectrum , such as depression or general anxiety disorder one study found 70 % had depression at some time in their lives ( as opposed to 26 % for adult females in the general population ) , rising to 88 % for all affective disorders combined another study by the royal children 's hospital in melbourne on a cohort of 2,000 adolescents similarly found that those meeting at least two of the dsm-iv criteria for bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa had a sixfold increase in risk of anxiety and a doubled risk for substance dependency some with anorexia nervosa exhibit episodes of bulimic tendencies through purging ( either through self-induced vomiting or laxatives ) as a way to quickly remove food in their system bulimia also has negative effects on a person 's teeth due to the acid passed through the mouth from frequent vomiting causing acid erosion , mainly on the posterior dental surface there is evidence that sex hormones may influence appetite and eating in women , and the onset of bulimia nervosa studies have shown that women with hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary syndrome have a dysregulation of appetite , along with carbohydrates and fats in humans , there is evidence that there is an association between polymorphisms in the erβ ( estrogen receptor β ) and bulimia , suggesting there is a correlation between sex hormones and bulimia nervosa however , people with bulimia nervosa may share dopamine d2 receptor-related vulnerabilities with those with substance abuse disorders in addition , the suicide rate among people with bulimia nervosa is 7.5 times higher than in the general population '' bulimia nervosa '' abnormal psychology accordingly , this would lead to unrealistically restricted eating , which may consequently induce an eventual '' slip '' where the individual commits a minor infraction of the strict and inflexible dietary rules the binge subsequently should trigger a perceived loss of control , promoting the individual to purge in hope of counteracting the binge in contrast , byrne and mclean 's findings differed slightly from fairburn et al.s cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa in that the drive for thinness was the major cause of purging as a way of controlling weight 's model and more generally the cognitive explanation of bulimia nervosa is more descriptive than explanatory , as it does not necessarily explain how bulimia arises a considerable amount of literature has identified a correlation between sexual abuse and the development of bulimia nervosa kevin thompson and eric stice claim that family , peers , and most evidently media reinforce the thin ideal , which may lead to an individual accepting and '' buying into '' the thin ideal consequently , body dissatisfaction coupled with a drive for thinness is thought to promote dieting and negative effects , which could eventually lead to bulimic symptoms such as purging or bingeing a study dedicated to investigating the thin ideal internalization as a factor of bulimia nervosa is thompson 's and stice 's research in other words , less thin ideal images portrayed by the media resulted in less thin ideal internalization papies showed that it is not the thin ideal itself , but rather the self-association with other persons of a certain weight that decide how someone with bulimia nervosa feels people that associate themselves with thin models get in a positive attitude when they see thin models and people that associate with overweight get in a negative attitude when they see thin models bulimia nervosa can be difficult to detect , compared to anorexia nervosa , because bulimics tend to be of average or slightly above average weight many bulimics may also engage in significantly disordered eating and exercise patterns without meeting the full diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa recently , the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders was revised , which resulted in the loosening of criteria regarding the diagnoses of bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa bulimia nervosa occurs more frequently in developed countries and in cities , with one study finding that bulimia is five times more prevalent in cities than in rural areas although diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa did not appear until 1979 , evidence suggests that binging and purging were popular in certain ancient cultures while the psychological disorder '' bulimia nervosa '' is relatively new , the word '' bulimia , '' signifying overeating , has been present for centuries an explanation for the increased instances of bulimic symptoms may be due to the 20th century 's new ideals of thinness

bulimia typically involves rapid and out-of-control eating , which may stop when the person is interrupted by another person or the stomach hurts from over-extension , followed by self-induced vomiting or other forms of purging people with bulimia nervosa may also exercise to a point that excludes other activities people with bulimia exhibit several interoception deficits , in which one experiences impairment in recognizing and discriminating between internal sensations , feelings , and emotions people with bulimia may also react negatively to somatic and affective states in relation to interoceptive sensitivity , hyposensitive individuals may not detect feelings of fullness in a normal and timely fashion , and therefore are prone to eating more calories people with bulimia are more likely than people without bulimia to have an affective spectrum , such as depression or general anxiety disorder some with anorexia nervosa exhibit episodes of bulimic tendencies through purging ( either through self-induced vomiting or laxatives ) as a way to quickly remove food in their system there is evidence that sex hormones may influence appetite and eating in women , and the onset of bulimia nervosa studies have shown that women with hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary syndrome have a dysregulation of appetite , along with carbohydrates and fats this dysregulation of appetite is also seen in women with bulimia nervosa in humans , there is evidence that there is an association between polymorphisms in the erβ ( estrogen receptor β ) and bulimia , suggesting there is a correlation between sex hormones and bulimia nervosa however , people with bulimia nervosa may share dopamine d2 receptor-related vulnerabilities with those with substance abuse disorders abnormal blood levels of peptides important for the regulation of appetite and energy balance are observed in individuals with bulimia nervosa , but it remains unknown if this is a state or trait media portrayals of an 'ideal ' body shape are widely considered to be a contributing factor to bulimia in a 1991 study by weltzin , hsu , pollicle , and kaye , it was stated that 19 % of bulimics undereat , 37 % of bulimics eat an average or normal amount of food , and 44 % of bulimics overeat in addition , the suicide rate among people with bulimia nervosa is 7.5 times higher than in the general population '' bulimia nervosa '' abnormal psychology 's model discusses the process in which an individual falls into the binge-purge cycle and thus develops bulimia everyone differs from another , and taking such a complex behavior like bulimia and applying the same one theory to everyone would certainly be invalid in addition , the cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa is very cultural bound in that it may not be necessarily applicable to cultures outside of the western society a considerable amount of literature has identified a correlation between sexual abuse and the development of bulimia nervosa the reported incident rate of unwanted sexual contact is higher among those with bulimia nervosa than anorexia nervosa thus , people feeling uncomfortable with their bodies may result in suffering from body dissatisfaction and may develop a certain drive for thinness p.344 bulimia nervosa may affect up to 1 % of young women and , after 10 years of diagnosis , half will recover fully , a third will recover partially , and 10–20 % will still have symptoms adolescents with bulimia nervosa are more likely to have self-imposed perfectionism and compulsivity issues in eating compared to their peers bulimia nervosa can be difficult to detect , compared to anorexia nervosa , because bulimics tend to be of average or slightly above average weight many bulimics may also engage in significantly disordered eating and exercise patterns without meeting the full diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa there are two main types of treatment given to those suffering with bulimia nervosa ; psychopharmacological and psychosocial treatments cognitive behavioral therapy ( cbt ) , which involves teaching a person to challenge automatic thoughts and engage in behavioral experiments ( for example , in session eating of '' forbidden foods '' ) has a small amount of evidence supporting its use maudsley family therapy , developed at the maudsley hospital in london for the treatment of anorexia has been shown promising results in bulimia while the psychological disorder '' bulimia nervosa '' is relatively new , the word '' bulimia , '' signifying overeating , has been present for centuries however , while these patients may have met modern criteria for bulimia nervosa , they can not technically be diagnosed with the disorder , as it had not yet appeared in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders at the time of their treatment however , bulimia nervosa 's prevalence was still much higher than anorexia nervosa 's , which at the time occurred in about 14 people per 100,000

bulimia typically involves rapid and out-of-control eating , which may stop when the person is interrupted by another person or the stomach hurts from over-extension , followed by self-induced vomiting or other forms of purging people with bulimia nervosa may also exercise to a point that excludes other activities people with bulimia exhibit several interoception deficits , in which one experiences impairment in recognizing and discriminating between internal sensations , feelings , and emotions people with bulimia may also react negatively to somatic and affective states people with bulimia are more likely than people without bulimia to have an affective spectrum , such as depression or general anxiety disorder one study found 70 % had depression at some time in their lives ( as opposed to 26 % for adult females in the general population ) , rising to 88 % for all affective disorders combined another study by the royal children 's hospital in melbourne on a cohort of 2,000 adolescents similarly found that those meeting at least two of the dsm-iv criteria for bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa had a sixfold increase in risk of anxiety and a doubled risk for substance dependency some with anorexia nervosa exhibit episodes of bulimic tendencies through purging ( either through self-induced vomiting or laxatives ) as a way to quickly remove food in their system as with anorexia nervosa , there is evidence of genetic predispositions contributing to the onset of this eating disorder there is evidence that sex hormones may influence appetite and eating in women , and the onset of bulimia nervosa this dysregulation of appetite is also seen in women with bulimia nervosa however , people with bulimia nervosa may share dopamine d2 receptor-related vulnerabilities with those with substance abuse disorders decreased tryptophan levels in the brain , and thus the synthesis of serotonin , such as via acute tryptophan depletion , increases bulimic urges in currently and formerly bulimic individuals within hours media portrayals of an 'ideal ' body shape are widely considered to be a contributing factor to bulimia in addition , the suicide rate among people with bulimia nervosa is 7.5 times higher than in the general population '' bulimia nervosa '' abnormal psychology argue that extreme concern with weight and shape coupled with low self-esteem will result in strict , rigid , and inflexible dietary rules in turn , byrne and mclean argued that this makes the individual vulnerable to binging , indicating that it is not a binge-purge cycle but rather a purge-binge cycle in that purging comes before bingeing everyone differs from another , and taking such a complex behavior like bulimia and applying the same one theory to everyone would certainly be invalid 's model and more generally the cognitive explanation of bulimia nervosa is more descriptive than explanatory , as it does not necessarily explain how bulimia arises a considerable amount of literature has identified a correlation between sexual abuse and the development of bulimia nervosa the reported incident rate of unwanted sexual contact is higher among those with bulimia nervosa than anorexia nervosa when exploring the etiology of bulimia through a socio-cultural perspective , the '' thin ideal internalization '' is significantly responsible thus , people feeling uncomfortable with their bodies may result in suffering from body dissatisfaction and may develop a certain drive for thinness the results showed that by creating more awareness of the media 's control of the societal ideal of attractiveness , the thin ideal internalization significantly dropped therefore , thompson and stice concluded that media greatly affected the thin ideal internalization papies showed that it is not the thin ideal itself , but rather the self-association with other persons of a certain weight that decide how someone with bulimia nervosa feels p.344 bulimia nervosa may affect up to 1 % of young women and , after 10 years of diagnosis , half will recover fully , a third will recover partially , and 10â€“20 % will still have symptoms people undergoing cbt who exhibit early behavioral changes are most likely to achieve the best treatment outcomes in the long run bulimia nervosa occurs more frequently in developed countries and in cities , with one study finding that bulimia is five times more prevalent in cities than in rural areas while the psychological disorder '' bulimia nervosa '' is relatively new , the word '' bulimia , '' signifying overeating , has been present for centuries however , while these patients may have met modern criteria for bulimia nervosa , they can not technically be diagnosed with the disorder , as it had not yet appeared in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders at the time of their treatment however , bulimia nervosa 's prevalence was still much higher than anorexia nervosa 's , which at the time occurred in about 14 people per 100,000

the title story of the collection , goodbye , columbus , was an irreverent look at the life of middle-class jewish americans , satirizing , according to one reviewer , their '' complacency , parochialism , and materialism the story is told by the narrator , neil klugman , who is working in a low-paying position in the newark public library one summer , neil meets and falls for brenda patimkin , a student at radcliffe college who is from a wealthy family living in the affluent suburb of short hills the title “ goodbye , columbus ” is a quote from a song that was sung by the departing seniors , including brenda 's brother , ron , at their graduation from the ohio state university at columbus ron dearly enjoys listening to a record of the song that evokes his years as a varsity athlete on a campus where sports are big by listening to the record for a few years and later having neil listen along , he is given continuing proof of the patimkins ' success at assimilation ” the flair , high-hattiness and bite of some of the lyrics—especially , the line that became the title of the novella—would have appealed to neil klugman and the very young philip roth we can safely assume that when roth decided on a title for it , he realized that the percentage of the subscribers to the paris review ( in which the novella came out in 1958 ) and the percentage of the readers of any book in which it would later be published who had heard the yiddish song—which is n't quoted or mentioned in the novella—in 1926 or later and also remembered its fourth stanza would be a very small minority of the novella ’ s audience this song 's columbus is not a campus but rather the man who induced europeans to follow him to america , and its '' goodbye '' ( unlike the one in the college song ) is neither a sentimental summation nor a grateful or admiring one the story caused consternation among jewish readers and religious groups , as recounted in chapter five of roth 's 1988 memoir the facts : a novelist 's autobiography

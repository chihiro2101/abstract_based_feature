( 59 bc & ndash ; ad 17 ) the palatine hill got its name from the arcadian settlers from pallantium , named from its founder pallas of arcadia the name of the hill is the etymology origin of the word palace and its cognates in other languages ( greek : παλάτιον , , , spanish : palacio , portuguese : palácio , , , etc from the oxford english dictionary the palatine hill is also the etymology origin ( via the latin adjective of '' palatine '' , a 16th-century english adjective that originally signified something pertaining to the caesar 's palace , or someone who is invested with the king 's authority excavations performed on the hill in 1907 and again in 1948 unearthed a collection of huts believed to have been used for funerary purposes between the 9th and 7th century bc approximating the time period when the city of rome was founded archeology 03mar2011 pallantium ( ancient greek : παλλάντιον ) was an ancient city near the tiber river on the italian peninsula in addition , dionysius of halicarnassus writes that romans say that the city was founded by greeks from pallantium of arcadia , about sixty years before the trojan war and the leader was evander virgil states that evander named the city in honor of his ancestor , pallas , although pausanias as well as dionysius of halicarnassus say that evander 's birth city was pallantium , and thus he named the new city after the one in arcadia from the start of the empire ( 27 bc ) augustus built his palace there and the hill gradually became the exclusive domain of emperors ; the ruins of the palaces of at least augustus ( 27 bc & ndash ; 14 ad ) , tiberius ( 14 & ndash ; 37 ad ) and domitian ( 81 & ndash ; 96 ad ) can still be seen at the top of the hill , between the domus flavia and the domus augustana , the villa mattei was built in the 16th century , then purchased around 1830 by the scot charles mills who turned it into an elaborate neo-gothic villa intensive archaeological excavations began in the 18th century and culminated in the late 19th century , after the proclamation of rome as the capital of the kingdom of italy the republican-era houses on the palatine were overbuilt by later palaces after the great fire of rome ( ad 64 ) , but apparently this one was not and perhaps was preserved for an important reason many others have denied its identification with the lupercal on topographic and stylistic grounds , and believe that the grotto is actually a nymphaeum or underground triclinium from neronian times

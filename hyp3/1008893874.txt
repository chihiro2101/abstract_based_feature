in the early years of competition there was no defined format with performers often completing lengthy routines and even remounting if falling off partway through gradually competitions became more codified such that by the 1950s the 10-bounce routine was the norm thereby paving the way for the first world championships which were organised by ted blake of nissen , and held in london in 1964 soon after the first world championships , an inaugural meeting of prominent trampolinists was held in frankfurt to explore the formation of an international trampoline federation in 1965 in twickenham , the federation was formally recognised as the international governing body for the sport blake also used the first wag as an opportunity to organise a world trampoline safety conference which was held in the bloomsbury hotel , london , in order to codify safety concerns there is also a world cup circuit of international competitions which involves a number of competitions every year the degree of difficulty of the routine is determined in the same way as for individual trampoline routines and the points added to the score to determine the winner a double mini-trampoline competition consists of two types of pass in the one , which is known as a mounter pass , the athlete performs one skill in the jump from the sloping end to the flat bed and a second skill as they dismount from the flat bed to the landing mat rightthe form and difficulty are judged in a similar manner as for trampolining but there are additional deductions for failing to land cleanly ( without stepping ) or landing outside a designated area on the mat the currently accepted basic format for individual trampoline competitions usually consists of two or three routines , one of which may involve a compulsory set of skills the skills consist of various combinations of somersaults , shaped bounces , body landings and twists performed in various body positions such as the tuck , pike or straight position the degree of difficulty ( dd or tariff ) is calculated by adding a factor for each half turn ( or twist ) or quarter somersault the floor matting rules are typically adopted by national bodies but not always in full ; for example in the uk the requirement for national & regional competition is still 2m but only of 20â€“25mm matting

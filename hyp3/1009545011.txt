port is produced from grapes grown and processed in the demarcated douro region the wine produced is then fortified by the mutage known as aguardente to stop the fermentation , leaving residual sugar in the wine , and to boost the alcohol the wine is then stored and aged , often in barrels stored in a lodge ( meaning '' cellar '' ) as is the case in vila nova de gaia , before being bottled the wine received its name , '' port '' , in the latter half of the 17th century from the seaport city of porto at the mouth of the douro river , where much of the product was brought to market or for export to other countries in europe the douro valley where port wine is produced was defined and established as a protected region , and the name douro thus an official appellation , in 1756 , making it the third oldest , after chianti ( 1716 ) and tokaj ( 1730 ) the reaches of the valley of the douro river in northern portugal have a microclimate that is optimal for cultivation of olives , almonds , and especially grapes important for making port wine the region is protected from the influences of the atlantic ocean by the serra do marão mountains the area is sub-divided into three official zones : the baixo ( lower ) corgo , the cima ( higher ) corgo and the douro superior robinson ( ed ) '' the oxford companion to wine '' third edition p 536 oxford university press 2006 baixo corgo – the westernmost zone located downstream from the river corgo , centred on the municipality of peso da régua the grapes grown here are used mainly for the production of inexpensive ruby and tawny ports the grapes grown in this zone are considered of higher quality , being used in bottlings of vintage , reserve , aged tawny and late bottled vintage ports this is the least cultivated region of douro , due in part to the difficulties of navigating the river past the rapids of valeira dam 93 touriga nacional is widely considered the most desirable port grape but the difficulty in growing it and the small yields cause touriga francesa to be the most widely planted grape while the grapes used to produce port made in portugal are strictly regulated by the instituto do vinho do porto , wines from outside this region which describe themselves as port may be made from other varieties traditionally , the wine was taken downriver in flat-bottom boats called 'rabelo boat ' , porter , darwin & danforth price ( 2000 ) frommer 's portugal 16th ed this process leads to the wine losing its color very slowly and produces a wine which is smoother on the palate and less tannic the latter , being matured in wooden barrels , whose permeability allows a small amount of exposure to oxygen , experience what is known as '' oxidative '' aging they also lose volume to evaporation ( angel 's share ) , leaving behind a wine that is slightly more viscous the ivdp ( instituto dos vinhos do douro e porto ) further divides port into two categories : normal ports ( standard rubies , three-year-old tawnies , and white ports ) and categorias especiais , special categories , which include everything else ruby port is the least expensive and most extensively produced type of port portwine.com ruby port the wine is usually blended to match the style of the brand to which it is to be sold the wine is fined and cold filtered before bottling and does not generally improve with age , although premium rubies are aged in wood from four to six years in 2002 the ivdp prohibited the use of the term '' vintage character '' , as reserve ruby port had neither a single vintage ( usually being a blend of several vintages of ruby ) nor the typical character of vintage port it is technically a ruby port , but fermented in a similar manner to a rosé wine , with a limited exposure to the grape skins , thus creating the rose color they are sweet or medium dry and typically consumed as a dessert wine , but can also pair with a main course above this are tawnies with an indication of age , which represent a blend of several vintages note : in some places , such as canada , tawny may also be used to describe any port-style wine that is not produced in portugal as per agreement with eu a colheita port is a single-vintage tawny port aged for at least seven years , with the vintage year on the bottle instead of a category of age ( 10 , 20 , etc colheita port should not be confused with vintage port : a vintage port will spend only about 18 months in barrels after harvest and will continue to mature in bottle , but a colheita may have spent 20 or more years in wooden barrels before being bottled and sold ordinary white ports make an excellent basis for a cocktail while those of greater age are best served chilled on their own sweet white port and tonic water is a commonly consumed drink in the porto region over time it has become two distinct styles of wine , both of them bottled between four and six years after the vintage , but one style is fined and filtered before bottling , while the other is not the oldest known vintage port still available from a shipper is the 1815 ferreira while it is by far the most renowned type of port , from a volume and revenue standpoint , vintage port accounts for only about two percent of overall port production was also in charge of regulating which port wine would be for export or internal consumption and managing the

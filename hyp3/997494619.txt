cms was originally developed as part of ibm 's cp/cms operating system at the time , the acronym meant '' cambridge monitor system '' ( but also : '' console monitor system '' ) cms first ran under cp-40 , a one-off research system using custom hardware at ibm 's cambridge scientific center the cms user interface drew heavily on experience with the influential first-generation time-sharing system ctss , some of whose developers worked on cp/cms ) later in 1967 , cp/cms became generally available on the ibm system/360 model 67 , where , although the new control program cp-67 was a substantial re-implementation of cp-40 , cms remained essentially the same ibm provided cp/cms '' as is '' & ndash ; without any support , in source code form , as part of the ibm type-iii library in 1972 , ibm released its vm/370 operating system , a re-implementation of cp/cms for the system/370 , in an announcement that also added virtual memory hardware to the system/370 series vm went through a series of versions , and is still in use today as z/vm through all its distinct versions and releases , the cms platform remained still quite recognizable as a close descendant of the original cms version running under cp-40 each cms user has control over a private virtual machine & ndash ; a simulated copy of the underlying physical computer & ndash ; in which cms runs as a stand-alone operating system cms is still in development and wide use today the 3270 's block-oriented approach was more consistent with ibm 's batch- and punched card-oriented view of computing , and was particularly important for ibm mainframes of the day dumb terminal support relied on terminal control units such as the ibm 270x ( see ibm 3705 ) or memorex 1270 vm/cms was often used as a development platform for production systems that ran under ibm 's other operating systems , such as mvs

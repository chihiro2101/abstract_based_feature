cms was originally developed as part of ibm 's cp/cms operating system at the time , the acronym meant '' cambridge monitor system '' ( but also : '' console monitor system '' ) cms first ran under cp-40 , a one-off research system using custom hardware at ibm 's cambridge scientific center ) later in 1967 , cp/cms became generally available on the ibm system/360 model 67 , where , although the new control program cp-67 was a substantial re-implementation of cp-40 , cms remained essentially the same despite this lack of support from ibm , cp/cms achieved great success as a time-sharing platform ; by 1972 , there were some 44 cp/cms systems in use , including commercial sites that resold access to cp/cms in 1972 , ibm released its vm/370 operating system , a re-implementation of cp/cms for the system/370 , in an announcement that also added virtual memory hardware to the system/370 series unlike cp/cms , vm/370 was supported by ibm vm was not one of ibm 's '' strategic '' operating systems , which were primarily the os and dos families , and it suffered from ibm political infighting over time-sharing versus batch processing goals this conflict is why cp/cms was originally released as an unsupported system , and why vm often had limited development and support resources within ibm each cms user has control over a private virtual machine & ndash ; a simulated copy of the underlying physical computer & ndash ; in which cms runs as a stand-alone operating system cms was originally built as a stand-alone operating system , capable of running on a bare machine ( though of course nobody would choose to do so ) cms provides users an environment for running applications or batch jobs , managing data files , creating and debugging applications , doing cross-platform development , and communicating with other systems or users by the late 1970s , however , most vm users were connecting via full-screen terminals & ndash ; particularly the ibm 3270 , the ubiquitous transaction processing terminal on ibm mainframes see vm ( operating system ) for vm-related sources and source citations

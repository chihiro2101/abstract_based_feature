cms was originally developed as part of ibm 's cp/cms operating system cms first ran under cp-40 , a one-off research system using custom hardware at ibm 's cambridge scientific center the cms user interface drew heavily on experience with the influential first-generation time-sharing system ctss , some of whose developers worked on cp/cms ) later in 1967 , cp/cms became generally available on the ibm system/360 model 67 , where , although the new control program cp-67 was a substantial re-implementation of cp-40 , cms remained essentially the same ibm provided cp/cms '' as is '' & ndash ; without any support , in source code form , as part of the ibm type-iii library despite this lack of support from ibm , cp/cms achieved great success as a time-sharing platform ; by 1972 , there were some 44 cp/cms systems in use , including commercial sites that resold access to cp/cms in 1972 , ibm released its vm/370 operating system , a re-implementation of cp/cms for the system/370 , in an announcement that also added virtual memory hardware to the system/370 series many key user interface decisions familiar to today 's users had already been made in 1965 , as part of the cp-40 effort vm was not one of ibm 's '' strategic '' operating systems , which were primarily the os and dos families , and it suffered from ibm political infighting over time-sharing versus batch processing goals this conflict is why cp/cms was originally released as an unsupported system , and why vm often had limited development and support resources within ibm by the late 1970s , however , most vm users were connecting via full-screen terminals & ndash ; particularly the ibm 3270 , the ubiquitous transaction processing terminal on ibm mainframes this approach , preferred by ibm , led to the development of entirely different user interface paradigms and programming strategies vm/cms consistently outperformed mvs and other ibm operating systems in terms of support for simultaneous interactive users vm/cms was often used as a development platform for production systems that ran under ibm 's other operating systems , such as mvs

cms was originally developed as part of ibm 's cp/cms operating system at the time , the acronym meant '' cambridge monitor system '' ( but also : '' console monitor system '' ) cms first ran under cp-40 , a one-off research system using custom hardware at ibm 's cambridge scientific center ) later in 1967 , cp/cms became generally available on the ibm system/360 model 67 , where , although the new control program cp-67 was a substantial re-implementation of cp-40 , cms remained essentially the same ibm provided cp/cms '' as is '' & ndash ; without any support , in source code form , as part of the ibm type-iii library in 1972 , ibm released its vm/370 operating system , a re-implementation of cp/cms for the system/370 , in an announcement that also added virtual memory hardware to the system/370 series many key user interface decisions familiar to today 's users had already been made in 1965 , as part of the cp-40 effort vm was not one of ibm 's '' strategic '' operating systems , which were primarily the os and dos families , and it suffered from ibm political infighting over time-sharing versus batch processing goals cms is an intrinsic part of the vm/cms architecture , established with cp/cms each cms user has control over a private virtual machine & ndash ; a simulated copy of the underlying physical computer & ndash ; in which cms runs as a stand-alone operating system cms was originally built as a stand-alone operating system , capable of running on a bare machine ( though of course nobody would choose to do so ) cms is still in development and wide use today ) block-oriented terminals like the 3270 made it practical to implement text editor on mainframes & ndash ; as opposed to line editor , the previous norm vm/cms was often used as a development platform for production systems that ran under ibm 's other operating systems , such as mvs

where primary elections are organized by parties , not the administration , two types of primaries can generally be distinguished : closed primary ( synonyms : internal primaries , party primaries ) in the case of closed primaries , internal primaries , or party primaries , only party members can vote all voters can take part in an open primary and may cast votes on a ballot of any party the party may require them to express their support to the party 's values and pay a small contribution to the costs of the primary in the united states , other types can be differentiated : closed primary people may vote in a party 's primary only if they are registered members of that party prior to election day note that because some political parties name themselves independent , the terms '' non-partisan '' or '' unaffiliated '' often replace '' independent '' when referring to those who are not affiliated with a political party as in closed primaries , registered party members can vote only in their own party 's primary depending on the state , independents either make their choice of party primary privately , inside the voting booth , or publicly , by registering with any party on election day a registered voter may vote in any party primary regardless of his or her own party affiliation fourteen states – alabama , arkansas , georgia , hawaii , michigan , minnesota , missouri , montana , north dakota , south carolina , texas , vermont , virginia , and wisconsin – have open primaries when voters do not register with a party before the primary , it is called a pick-a-party primary because the voter can select which party 's primary they wish to vote in on election day raiding consists of voters of one party crossing over and voting in the primary of another party , effectively allowing a party to help choose its opposition 's candidate the theory is that opposing party members vote for the weakest candidate of the opposite party in order to give their own party the advantage in the general election in many states with semi-open primaries , election officials or poll workers from their respective parties record each voter 's choice of party and provide access to this information in a semi-open primary , a public declaration in front of the election judges is made and a party-specific ballot given to the voter to cast a primary in which the ballot is not restricted to candidates from one party '' california has used a nonpartisan blanket primary since 2012 after passing proposition 14 in 2010 , and the state of washington has used a nonpartisan blanket primary since 2008 the united states is one of a handful of countries to select candidates through popular vote in a primary election system ; most other countries rely on party leaders or paid up party members to select candidates , as was previously the case in the u.s in modern politics , primary elections have been described as a significant vehicle for taking decision-making from political insiders to the voters , though this is disputed by select political science research the party decides : presidential nominations before and after reform primaries can be used in nonpartisan elections to reduce the set of candidates that go on to the general election ( qualifying primary ) , many city , county and school board elections are non-partisan if no candidate receives a majority , twice as many candidates pass the primary as can win in the general election , so a single seat election primary would allow the top two primary candidates to participate in the general election following this often has the effect of eliminating minor parties from the general election , and frequently the general election becomes a single-party election the two candidates with the most votes then advance to the general election , regardless of their party affiliation however , tactical voting is sometimes a concern in non-partisan primaries as members of the opposite party can party raiding in order to face an easier general election in california , under proposition 14 ( top two candidates open primary act ) , a voter-approved referendum , in all races except for that for u.s president and county central committee offices , all candidates running in a primary election regardless of party will appear on a single primary election ballot and voters may vote for any candidate , with the top two vote-getters overall moving on to the general election regardless of party the effect of this is that it will be possible for two republicans or two democrats to compete against each other in a general election if those candidates receive the most primary-election support oregon was the first american state in which a binding primary election was conducted entirely via the internet the election was held by the independent party of oregon in july , 2010 in the united states , iowa and new hampshire have drawn attention every four years because they hold the first caucus and primary election , respectively , and often give a candidate the momentum to win their party 's nomination since 2000 , the primary in south carolina has also become increasingly important as its the first southern state to hold a primary election in the calendar year the counterargument to this criticism , however , is that , by subjecting candidates to the scrutiny of a few early states , the parties can weed out candidates who are unfit for office unlike an election where the only participation is casting a ballot , a caucus is a gathering or '' meeting of party members designed to select candidates and propose policies '' both primaries and caucuses are used in the presidential nomination process , beginning in january or february and culminating in the late summer political party conventions as far as the electorate is concerned , the extent of participation allowed to weak partisans and independents depends almost solely on which of the aforementioned categories best describes their state 's primary system in closed primary systems , true independents are , for all practical purposes , shut out of the process this classification further affects the relationship between primary elections and election commissioners and officials the more open the system , the greater the chance of raiding , or voters voting in the other party 's primary in hopes of getting a weaker opponent chosen to run against a strong candidate in the general election perhaps the most dramatic effect this classification system has on the primary process is its influence on the candidates themselves in europe , primaries are not organized by the public administration but by parties themselves whereas closed primaries are rather common within many european countries , few political parties in europe already opted for open primaries the underlying reason for that is that most european countries are parliamentary democracies closed primaries happen in many european countries , while open primaries have so far only occurred in the socialist and social-democratic parties in greece and italy , whereas the france 's socialist party organised the first open primary in france in october 2011 rather than forming a new party , which is the habit on the right-wing , the party started to elect its nominee internally however , the primaries , as well as earlier , were not binding for the leadership of united russia : a number of winners of the primaries were withdrawn by the leadership without any explanation of reasons , and in 18 single-seat constituencies the party did not nominate any candidates as in europe , nomination meetings and leadership elections ( somewhat similar to primary elections ) in canada are not organized by the public administration but by parties themselves armenia : on 24 and 25 november 2007 , the armenian revolutionary federation political party conducted a non-binding armenia-wide

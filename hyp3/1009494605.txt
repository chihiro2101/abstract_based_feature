where primary elections are organized by parties , not the administration , two types of primaries can generally be distinguished : closed primary ( synonyms : internal primaries , party primaries ) in the case of closed primaries , internal primaries , or party primaries , only party members can vote all voters can take part in an open primary and may cast votes on a ballot of any party the party may require them to express their support to the party 's values and pay a small contribution to the costs of the primary as in closed primaries , registered party members can vote only in their own party 's primary depending on the state , independents either make their choice of party primary privately , inside the voting booth , or publicly , by registering with any party on election day massachusetts allows unenrolled voters or members of minor parties to vote in the primary of either major party , but registration or party changes must be done no fewer than 20 days prior to the primary a registered voter may vote in any party primary regardless of his or her own party affiliation when voters do not register with a party before the primary , it is called a pick-a-party primary because the voter can select which party 's primary they wish to vote in on election day because of the open nature of this system , a practice known as raiding may occur raiding consists of voters of one party crossing over and voting in the primary of another party , effectively allowing a party to help choose its opposition 's candidate the theory is that opposing party members vote for the weakest candidate of the opposite party in order to give their own party the advantage in the general election an example of this can be seen in the 1998 vermont senatorial primary with the nomination of fred tuttle as the republican candidate in the general election a registered voter need not publicly declare which political party 's primary that they will vote in before entering the voting booth in a semi-open primary , a public declaration in front of the election judges is made and a party-specific ballot given to the voter to cast certain states that use the open-primary format may print a single ballot and the voter must choose on the ballot itself which political party 's candidates they will select for a contested office a primary in which the ballot is not restricted to candidates from one party , where the top two candidates advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation the united states is one of a handful of countries to select candidates through popular vote in a primary election system ; most other countries rely on party leaders or paid up party members to select candidates , as was previously the case in the u.s primaries can be used in nonpartisan elections to reduce the set of candidates that go on to the general election ( qualifying primary ) if no candidate receives a majority , twice as many candidates pass the primary as can win in the general election , so a single seat election primary would allow the top two primary candidates to participate in the general election following when a qualifying primary is applied to a partisan election , it becomes what is generally known as a blanket or louisiana primary : typically , if no candidate wins a majority in the primary , the two candidates receiving the highest pluralities , regardless of party affiliation , go on to a general election that is in effect a run-off this often has the effect of eliminating minor parties from the general election , and frequently the general election becomes a single-party election unlike a plurality voting system , a run-off system meets the condorcet loser criterion in that the candidate that ultimately wins would not have been beaten in a two-way race with every one of the other candidates the two candidates with the most votes then advance to the general election , regardless of their party affiliation supreme court heard the grange 's appeal of the case in october 2007 in elections using electoral systems where strategic nomination is a concern , primaries can be very important in preventing '' clone '' candidates that split their constituency 's vote because of their similarities in california , under proposition 14 ( top two candidates open primary act ) , a voter-approved referendum , in all races except for that for u.s president and county central committee offices , all candidates running in a primary election regardless of party will appear on a single primary election ballot and voters may vote for any candidate , with the top two vote-getters overall moving on to the general election regardless of party the effect of this is that it will be possible for two republicans or two democrats to compete against each other in a general election if those candidates receive the most primary-election support since 2000 , the primary in south carolina has also become increasingly important as its the first southern state to hold a primary election in the calendar year the democratic national committee ( dnc ) proposed a new schedule and a new rule set for the 2008 presidential primary elections president who seek their party 's nomination participate in primary elections run by state governments , or caucuses run by the political parties while it is clear that the closed/semi-closed/semi-open/open classification commonly used by scholars studying primary systems does not fully explain the highly nuanced differences seen from state to state , still , it is very useful and has real-world implications for the electorate , election officials , and the candidates themselves as far as the electorate is concerned , the extent of participation allowed to weak partisans and independents depends almost solely on which of the aforementioned categories best describes their state 's primary system this classification further affects the relationship between primary elections and election commissioners and officials the more open the system , the greater the chance of raiding , or voters voting in the other party 's primary in hopes of getting a weaker opponent chosen to run against a strong candidate in the general election raiding has proven stressful to the relationships between political parties , who feel cheated by the system , and election officials , who try to make the system run as smoothly as possible closed primaries happen in many european countries , while open primaries have so far only occurred in the socialist and social-democratic parties in greece and italy , whereas the france 's socialist party organised the first open primary in france in october 2011 european parties that organized primaries so far were the european green party ( egp ) and the party of european socialists ( pes ) two years later , on 14 october 2007 , voters of the democratic party were called to choose the party leader among a list of six , their representatives to the constituent assembly and the local leaders in france , elections follow a two-round system in the second round , held two weeks later , the top two candidates run against each other , with the candidates from losing parties usually endorsing one of the two finalists the means by which the candidate of an established political party is selected has evolved petersburg , the local branches of the parties yabloko and the union of right forces , who before the gubernatorial election offered citizens to choose a single candidate from the democratic opposition in 2011 , united russia , together with the all-russian people 's front , held primaries for the nomination of candidates for the parlmentary election in 2016 , the primaries for the selection of candidates for parliamentary elections were held by four parties : united russia , people 's freedom party , предварительное голосование « волна перемен » парнас the party of growth and the green alliance in autumn 2011 , here was how the twenty-nine socialist , social-democratic , and labour parties member of the party of european socialists ( pes ) had designated their party leader typically , in the months before an anticipated general election , local riding associations of political parties in each electoral district will schedule and announce a nomination meeting ( similar to a nominating caucus in the united states ) not only will the party leader run for a seat in their own chosen riding , they will also become prime minister ( in a federal election ) or premier ( in a province or territory ) should their party win the most seats south africa 54th national conference of the african national congress 2020 democratic alliance federal congress republic

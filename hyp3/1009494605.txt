most other countries rely on party leaders or paid up party members to select candidates , as was previously the case in the u.s in modern politics , primary elections have been described as a significant vehicle for taking decision-making from political insiders to the voters , though this is disputed by select political science research primaries can be used in nonpartisan elections to reduce the set of candidates that go on to the general election ( qualifying primary ) if no candidate receives a majority , twice as many candidates pass the primary as can win in the general election , so a single seat election primary would allow the top two primary candidates to participate in the general election following when a qualifying primary is applied to a partisan election , it becomes what is generally known as a blanket or louisiana primary : typically , if no candidate wins a majority in the primary , the two candidates receiving the highest pluralities , regardless of party affiliation , go on to a general election that is in effect a run-off on 15 july 2005 , the initiative was found unconstitutional by the u.s president and county central committee offices , all candidates running in a primary election regardless of party will appear on a single primary election ballot and voters may vote for any candidate , with the top two vote-getters overall moving on to the general election regardless of party oregon was the first american state in which a binding primary election was conducted entirely via the internet in the united states , iowa and new hampshire have drawn attention every four years because they hold the first caucus and primary election , respectively , and often give a candidate the momentum to win their party 's nomination '' of note regarding the dnc 's proposed 2008 presidential primary election schedule is that it contrasted with the republican national committee 's ( rnc ) rules regarding presidential primary elections president who seek their party 's nomination participate in primary elections run by state governments , or caucuses run by the political parties both primaries and caucuses are used in the presidential nomination process , beginning in january or february and culminating in the late summer political party conventions candidates may earn convention delegates from each state primary or caucus while it is clear that the closed/semi-closed/semi-open/open classification commonly used by scholars studying primary systems does not fully explain the highly nuanced differences seen from state to state , still , it is very useful and has real-world implications for the electorate , election officials , and the candidates themselves as far as the electorate is concerned , the extent of participation allowed to weak partisans and independents depends almost solely on which of the aforementioned categories best describes their state 's primary system this classification further affects the relationship between primary elections and election commissioners and officials the more open the system , the greater the chance of raiding , or voters voting in the other party 's primary in hopes of getting a weaker opponent chosen to run against a strong candidate in the general election raiding has proven stressful to the relationships between political parties , who feel cheated by the system , and election officials , who try to make the system run as smoothly as possible in europe , primaries are not organized by the public administration but by parties themselves the main reason to this is that the electoral system used to form governments , be it proportional representation or two-round systems , lessens the need for an open primary governments are not involved in the process ; however , parties may need their cooperation , notably in the case of an open primary , e.g whereas closed primaries are rather common within many european countries , few political parties in europe already opted for open primaries parties generally organise primaries to nominate the party leader ( leadership election ) closed primaries happen in many european countries , while open primaries have so far only occurred in the socialist and social-democratic parties in greece and italy , whereas the france 's socialist party organised the first open primary in france in october 2011 two years later , on 14 october 2007 , voters of the democratic party were called to choose the party leader among a list of six , their representatives to the constituent assembly and the local leaders the centre-right ( see house of freedoms , the people of freedom , centre-right coalition and forza italia ) has never held a primary at the national level , but held some experiments at the very local level in practice , each candidate usually represents a political party , large or small in the second round , held two weeks later , the top two candidates run against each other , with the candidates from losing parties usually endorsing one of the two finalists on the left however , the socialist party , which helped fran√ßois mitterrand gain the presidency for 14 years , has been plagued by internal divisions since the latter departed from politics later in 2002 , although the candidacy of then-pm jospin was undisputed in his party , each of the five left-wing parties of the government he led sent a candidate , paving the way for all five to lose by the spoiler effect primaries , it was seen as a way to reinvigorate the party finally , a number of candidates were included in the party list on the proposal of the party leader dmitry medvedev from among those who did not even participate in the primaries for the 2010 general election , the conservative party used open primaries to select two candidates for member of parliament as in europe , nomination meetings and leadership elections ( somewhat similar to primary elections ) in canada are not organized by the public administration but by parties themselves typically , in the months before an anticipated general election , local riding associations of political parties in each electoral district will schedule and announce a nomination meeting ( similar to a nominating caucus in the united states ) united states democratic party ( 2020 ) republican party ( 2020 ) costa rica : the country 's three main political parties , the national liberation party , the social christian unity party , and the citizens ' action party , have all run primary elections on several different occasions the american direct primary : party institutionalization and transformation in the north ( 2002 ) , the invention of primaries around 1900

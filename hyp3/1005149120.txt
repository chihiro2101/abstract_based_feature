the transformers toy line was created from toy molds mostly produced by japanese company takara in the toy lines car-robots ( diaclone ) and micro change ( microman ) other toy molds from other companies such as bandai were used as well in 1984 , hasbro bought the distribution rights to the molds and rebranded them as the transformers for distribution in north america the designs for the original 28 figures were made by kojin ono , takashi matsuda , hideaki yoke , hiroyuki obara , and satoshi koizumi hasbro would go on to buy the entire toy line from takara , giving them sole ownership of the transformers toy-line , branding rights , and copyrights , while in exchange , takara was given the rights to produce the toys and the rights to distribute them in the japanese market the following transformers toy series were released in the united states and japan : the transformers ( 1984–1990 usa ) ( 1984–1993 , uk/canada ) ( 1985–1992 , japan ) - retroactively called '' generation one '' or '' g1 '' since then this card has information on the transformer , and will usually include the character 's name , picture , indication of allegiance ( autobot , decepticon or other ) , function , a quote , a description of the character , and numerical values of the character 's various attributes unlike the other ratings , teamwork seems to be split along faction lines , with autobots typically holding higher teamwork ratings than decepticons the values started becoming inconsistent and skewed in generation 2 and beast wars , when hasbro apparently thought no child will ever want a toy that is described as anything less than perfect thus it became rarer and rarer to see any low numbers when even more powerful versions of the optimus primal toy ( such as optimal optimus ) were introduced , hasbro even invented a '' 10+ '' rating in an attempt to keep increasing the power levels the specifications portion of the tech specs which came with earlier g1 transformers were obfuscated with interference patterns which made them difficult to read without a decoder which was included in the box for each transformer related to tech specs were marvel 's transformer universe comics , where the entry for each transformer contained an expanded bio based on the one printed on the tech specs the first transformers toys were created from two different transforming robot toy lines from takara , the car-robots and micro change , from the diaclone and microman series , respectively hasbro acquired the rights to sell them in the united states but , instead of selling them under their original names , they were rebranded as '' the transformers '' the earliest toys had some parts made of die-cast metal , which were eventually phased out the line was released as '' the transformers '' in the united states , canada and the uk in 1984 ( one year after the gobots ) but takara was still marketing diaclone at least during 1984 hence in japan '' the transformers '' did not debut under that brand till 1985 , when the line was also rolled out to the majority of the rest of the world between takara and hasbro uk transformers toys were sold in boxes identical to those of their american counterparts until around 1998/9 when the range started to have uk exclusives the autobot jetfire was repainted from a macross toy , specifically the vf-1 valkyrie , and the character was renamed skyfire in the animated television series program for copyright reasons in 1986 the transformers animated movie had been released , and during the run of the movie , through a pamphlet that came with certain figures , you could order certain transformers through the mail , such as optimus prime among other toys the toys came in a standard brown mailer box , with items , booklet , and a limited edition movie certificate and sticker many have speculated that this change might have been what signaled the beginning of the end for the transformers , as part of the novelty of the first lines was the realistic vehicles that turned into robots for the 1987 and 1988 lines , hasbro introduced even more radical ideas through new sub-groups the headmasters and targetmasters came with partners who transformed into the figure 's head or weapon , respectively powermasters , including the new version of fan favorite optimus prime , came with partners that transformed into engines pretenders consisted of a transformer contained inside an action figure shell who could '' pretend '' to be either a human or a monster complaints with this line were numerous , including the lack of articulation of the figures ( the shells could only move their arms ) , the simple transformation of the robots within , and their increasing lack of resemblance to any sort of modern recognizable vehicle also during this time , micromasters were introduced , and would become one of the last sub-groups of generation one while many of the figures had simple transformations and little detail due to their small size , the line eventually expanded to feature micromaster transports and bases , in which micromasters came with larger vehicles or bases that transformed these toys are similar in design to the generation 2 transformers , having lightpipe eyes , and pastel colors the 1993 european figures used the g2 faction symbols which hasbro uk designed because their licence on the g1 symbols had expired the term generation 1 is a retronym ; the series was simply known as '' transformers '' until the release of the generation 2 series the line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the transformers : universe line the subgroups concept was done away with for the first year , but there were no new molds or characters most of these were g1 combiner team recolors or recolors of recent figures four unreleased molds were released in the machine wars line , and four more resurfaced in the robots in disguise series with the failure of the generation 2 series , hasbro and takara decided the franchise needed an overhaul this was shown in the toy 's tech specs , and in the comic packaged with the basic optimus primal/megatron two-pack long-time transformers fans noticed the prominence of the words '' beast wars '' over '' transformers '' , the latter appearing in small type under the former the transformers ' fan base splintered into two groups as a direct result , with the one enjoying beast wars for what it was and the other refusing to accept it as official canon in the transformers mythology the line was later commemorated as sub-series of the transformers : titanium and transformers : universe lines another g1 character to get a new toy for this line was ultra magnus , who could combine with optimus prime to form omega prime the line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the transformers : universe line the mini-cons were much smaller robots ( not much larger than humans ) who were neutral in the autobot/decepticon fight , but due to their incredible power and abilities , were sought by both factions the lowest priced toys in the armada line were three-packs of mini-cons each larger price point consisted of an autobot or decepticon who came with a mini-con partner the mini-cons often mimicked features associated with generation 1 sub-groups such as the headmasters and targetmasters , transforming into weapons and , in three cases , a transformer 's head a catch-all line initially filled with mostly redecos and repackages of older toys after the successful armada toy line , hasbro/takara introduced transformers : energon also of note in the cybertron line : primus , the creator of the transformers conceived by simon furman for the uk transformers comic , received action figure treatment in the cybertron line in the '' transformers '' film , the robots had more of an alien feel to them to fit the theme of an alien invasion the few boxes that still exist are collectables , transformers cereal box wanted cerealbits ( one of which went for 349 on ebay )

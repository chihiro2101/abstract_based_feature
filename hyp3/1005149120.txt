the transformers toy line was created from toy molds mostly produced by japanese company takara in the toy lines car-robots ( diaclone ) and micro change ( microman ) in 1984 , hasbro bought the distribution rights to the molds and rebranded them as the transformers for distribution in north america they approached marvel comics to create a backstory with names and short descriptions for each character , most of which were written by bob budiansky the designs for the original 28 figures were made by kojin ono , takashi matsuda , hideaki yoke , hiroyuki obara , and satoshi koizumi hasbro would go on to buy the entire toy line from takara , giving them sole ownership of the transformers toy-line , branding rights , and copyrights , while in exchange , takara was given the rights to produce the toys and the rights to distribute them in the japanese market the following transformers toy series were released in the united states and japan : the transformers ( 1984–1990 usa ) ( 1984–1993 , uk/canada ) ( 1985–1992 , japan ) - retroactively called '' generation one '' or '' g1 '' since then the owner of the new transformer is encouraged to cut out the tech specs and save it although only the numbers can be truly deemed '' technical specifications '' , the entire card is usually referred to as the transformer 's tech specs the traditional order ( as above ) was also abandoned for the micromaster team specifications most characters ' numbers hardly ever dipped below 8 , the go-bot version of optimus prime was the first character to have all values at 10 , a trend that would repeat for most '' leader '' characters the specifications portion of the tech specs which came with earlier g1 transformers were obfuscated with interference patterns which made them difficult to read without a decoder which was included in the box for each transformer transformers : generation one ( 1984–1990 usa , 1984–1993 uk/canada ) the first transformers toys were created from two different transforming robot toy lines from takara , the car-robots and micro change , from the diaclone and microman series , respectively hasbro acquired the rights to sell them in the united states but , instead of selling them under their original names , they were rebranded as '' the transformers '' the line was released as '' the transformers '' in the united states , canada and the uk in 1984 ( one year after the gobots ) but takara was still marketing diaclone at least during 1984 hence in japan '' the transformers '' did not debut under that brand till 1985 , when the line was also rolled out to the majority of the rest of the world between takara and hasbro it is thought that hasbro europe as it now stands did not come into existence till 1985 , hence no records of transformers sales in 1984 uk transformers toys were sold in boxes identical to those of their american counterparts until around 1998/9 when the range started to have uk exclusives megatron , the decepticon leader , originally transformed into a realistic walther p38 pistol with stock and barrel extensions and scope the constructicons were the first '' gestalt '' team in the transformers line , but were different from most subsequent gestalt teams in that they consisted of six members instead of five the autobot jetfire was repainted from a macross toy , specifically the vf-1 valkyrie , and the character was renamed skyfire in the animated television series program for copyright reasons in 1986 the transformers animated movie had been released , and during the run of the movie , through a pamphlet that came with certain figures , you could order certain transformers through the mail , such as optimus prime among other toys for the 1987 and 1988 lines , hasbro introduced even more radical ideas through new sub-groups the headmasters and targetmasters came with partners who transformed into the figure 's head or weapon , respectively complaints with this line were numerous , including the lack of articulation of the figures ( the shells could only move their arms ) , the simple transformation of the robots within , and their increasing lack of resemblance to any sort of modern recognizable vehicle but many also regarded this as a time of a dearth in creativity and the lowest point in the toy line 's history the action master line was criticized for its perceived desperation for a gimmick , although it had a few defenders the 1993 european figures used the g2 faction symbols which hasbro uk designed because their licence on the g1 symbols had expired the 1993 figures were repackaged for european g2 release in 1994 , and three subgroup molds got used in the us g2 line transformers fans often are very upheld with the g1 community transformers : generation two ( 1992–1994 usa , 1994–1995 uk/canada ) the line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the transformers : universe line they went in a new direction and a new beginning while there had been transformers that change into robotic animals , the premise of the new line was that all figures would transform into animals with realistic appearances the beast wars toy line was launched in the autumn of 1995 , and mainframe entertainment produced a computer-generated imagery , or cgi , animated series program to tie in with the new toy line a fresh idea coupled with a tv series program with strong stories assured this series the success hasbro and takara needed , as this series was a giant hit in international markets as well as in takara 's home market , japan hasbro 's original plan for the beast wars was to have optimus prime , renamed optimus primal , and megatron be reformatted versions of their 1980s selves another designed feature for the 1995/1996 toys was carried over from generation 2 , transparent '' light pipe '' eyes beast wars : transformers had to be renamed in some countries , particularly canada , because of concern over the word '' war '' in the title long-time transformers fans noticed the prominence of the words '' beast wars '' over '' transformers '' , the latter appearing in small type under the former the transformers ' fan base splintered into two groups as a direct result , with the one enjoying beast wars for what it was and the other refusing to accept it as official canon in the transformers mythology like beast wars , the name transformers was used only as a secondary title while still a success , the storyline and direction borne by beast machines was questioned and criticized by the most ardent fans who knew the previous history of the transformers these were not the only toys to be re-released for this series , with many from past lines being repainted and packaged in rid boxes the line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the transformers : universe line after several lines of toys produced by one company or the other , hasbro and takara united to produce what was purported to be a single , identical line of transformers for release worldwide in tandem with this new endeavor , armada signaled a new continuity in its accompanying animated series and a new focus in both the show and the toys on mini-cons , a new faction of transformers other items of note in the armada line : the armada line featured the first commercially available figure of unicron , who is a legendary character from generation 1 , and the main villain of the transformers : the movie the line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the transformers : universe line the line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the transformers : universe line , where it had the nickname of '' classics 2.0 '' it was expected that the release of a new movie would involve the production and release of associated toys from takara and hasbro this line was later revived and merged into the transformers : crossovers toy line , many more transformers included characters from star wars : the clone wars like ahsoka tano who transforms into her jedi starfighter , and captain rex who transforms into an at-te a japanese exclusive , this is a new line of transformers toys shaped from disney characters that were first introduced in 2009

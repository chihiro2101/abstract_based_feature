the transformers toy line was created from toy molds mostly produced by japanese company takara in the toy lines car-robots ( diaclone ) and micro change ( microman ) in 1984 , hasbro bought the distribution rights to the molds and rebranded them as the transformers for distribution in north america they approached marvel comics to create a backstory with names and short descriptions for each character , most of which were written by bob budiansky hasbro would go on to buy the entire toy line from takara , giving them sole ownership of the transformers toy-line , branding rights , and copyrights , while in exchange , takara was given the rights to produce the toys and the rights to distribute them in the japanese market the following transformers toy series were released in the united states and japan : the transformers ( 1984–1990 usa ) ( 1984–1993 , uk/canada ) ( 1985–1992 , japan ) - retroactively called '' generation one '' or '' g1 '' since then the owner of the new transformer is encouraged to cut out the tech specs and save it although only the numbers can be truly deemed '' technical specifications '' , the entire card is usually referred to as the transformer 's tech specs unlike the other ratings , teamwork seems to be split along faction lines , with autobots typically holding higher teamwork ratings than decepticons when even more powerful versions of the optimus primal toy ( such as optimal optimus ) were introduced , hasbro even invented a '' 10+ '' rating in an attempt to keep increasing the power levels with the transformers : cybertron line a few characters even got '' unknown '' and '' infinity '' ratings the specifications portion of the tech specs which came with earlier g1 transformers were obfuscated with interference patterns which made them difficult to read without a decoder which was included in the box for each transformer transformers : generation one ( 1984–1990 usa , 1984–1993 uk/canada ) the first two years consisted primarily of reusing the car-robots/micro change molds the line was released as '' the transformers '' in the united states , canada and the uk in 1984 ( one year after the gobots ) but takara was still marketing diaclone at least during 1984 hence in japan '' the transformers '' did not debut under that brand till 1985 , when the line was also rolled out to the majority of the rest of the world between takara and hasbro it is thought that hasbro europe as it now stands did not come into existence till 1985 , hence no records of transformers sales in 1984 uk transformers toys were sold in boxes identical to those of their american counterparts until around 1998/9 when the range started to have uk exclusives the 1984 and 1985 toy lines contained several figures of note in 1986 the transformers animated movie had been released , and during the run of the movie , through a pamphlet that came with certain figures , you could order certain transformers through the mail , such as optimus prime among other toys the toys came in a standard brown mailer box , with items , booklet , and a limited edition movie certificate and sticker many have speculated that this change might have been what signaled the beginning of the end for the transformers , as part of the novelty of the first lines was the realistic vehicles that turned into robots the headmasters and targetmasters came with partners who transformed into the figure 's head or weapon , respectively each line would see various permutations over the two-year span , including smaller headmasters , double targetmasters , and a powermaster with two engines micromasters were tiny transformers created to compete with the micro machines , a hugely popular toy line of the time for the first time , the transformers received a new design for their title logo the year 1990 saw the last american burst with the release of more micromaster characters and the introduction of the action masters , non-transforming action figures who came with transforming companions the 1993 figures were repackaged for european g2 release in 1994 , and three subgroup molds got used in the us g2 line the term generation 1 is a retronym ; the series was simply known as '' transformers '' until the release of the generation 2 series however , the term has become semi-official , as both hasbro and takara have referred to this era as '' generation 1 '' transformers : generation two ( 1992–1994 usa , 1994–1995 uk/canada ) in 1992 , hasbro relaunched the transformers franchise with the generation 2 line , with production again largely being done by takara generation 2 re-used the molds for many of the characters from the 1984 and 1985 line , but with mostly different color schemes and finishes , as well as different weapons and accessories as noted previously , megatron 's original alternate mode , or '' transformation identity '' , was a handgun with attachments , but in generation two , this was changed to a tank due to safety and security concerns most of these were g1 combiner team recolors or recolors of recent figures while there had been transformers that change into robotic animals , the premise of the new line was that all figures would transform into animals with realistic appearances the beast wars toy line was launched in the autumn of 1995 , and mainframe entertainment produced a computer-generated imagery , or cgi , animated series program to tie in with the new toy line a fresh idea coupled with a tv series program with strong stories assured this series the success hasbro and takara needed , as this series was a giant hit in international markets as well as in takara 's home market , japan hasbro 's original plan for the beast wars was to have optimus prime , renamed optimus primal , and megatron be reformatted versions of their 1980s selves long-time transformers fans noticed the prominence of the words '' beast wars '' over '' transformers '' , the latter appearing in small type under the former the transformers ' fan base splintered into two groups as a direct result , with the one enjoying beast wars for what it was and the other refusing to accept it as official canon in the transformers mythology the success of beast wars and the change in storyline resulted in its second phase : beast machines this line was brought by hasbro to america as the robots in disguise series , and featured the autobots facing off against the predacons this series is usually regarded by most as filler while hasbro contemplated the next direction for transformers however most fans of transformers recognise that most if not all of the toys released from this line were of excellent quality ( with the optimus prime and ultra magnus figures gaining considerable praise ) , combining the ball-joint articulation with detailed , well painted alternate modes these were not the only toys to be re-released for this series , with many from past lines being repainted and packaged in rid boxes after several lines of toys produced by one company or the other , hasbro and takara united to produce what was purported to be a single , identical line of transformers for release worldwide mini-cons could be used to unlock a variety of features on each larger robot , such as firing weapons , electronic lights and sounds , or alternate modes also of note in the cybertron line : primus , the creator of the transformers conceived by simon furman for the uk transformers comic , received action figure treatment in the cybertron line it was expected that the release of a new movie would involve the production and release of associated toys from takara and hasbro similarly , fans found preliminary artwork of multiple characters , although it was not known at the time how close these were to the final designs this line features robot versions of various star wars characters star wars transformers transformers wiki this is a new line which features robot versions of various marvel comics superheroes ( and later more of the star wars transformers figures once it merged with this line )

the transformers toy line was created from toy molds mostly produced by japanese company takara in the toy lines car-robots ( diaclone ) and micro change ( microman ) in 1984 , hasbro bought the distribution rights to the molds and rebranded them as the transformers for distribution in north america the designs for the original 28 figures were made by kojin ono , takashi matsuda , hideaki yoke , hiroyuki obara , and satoshi koizumi hasbro would go on to buy the entire toy line from takara , giving them sole ownership of the transformers toy-line , branding rights , and copyrights , while in exchange , takara was given the rights to produce the toys and the rights to distribute them in the japanese market the following transformers toy series were released in the united states and japan : the transformers ( 1984–1990 usa ) ( 1984–1993 , uk/canada ) ( 1985–1992 , japan ) - retroactively called '' generation one '' or '' g1 '' since then this card has information on the transformer , and will usually include the character 's name , picture , indication of allegiance ( autobot , decepticon or other ) , function , a quote , a description of the character , and numerical values of the character 's various attributes the values started becoming inconsistent and skewed in generation 2 and beast wars , when hasbro apparently thought no child will ever want a toy that is described as anything less than perfect when even more powerful versions of the optimus primal toy ( such as optimal optimus ) were introduced , hasbro even invented a '' 10+ '' rating in an attempt to keep increasing the power levels with the transformers : cybertron line a few characters even got '' unknown '' and '' infinity '' ratings related to tech specs were marvel 's transformer universe comics , where the entry for each transformer contained an expanded bio based on the one printed on the tech specs the first transformers toys were created from two different transforming robot toy lines from takara , the car-robots and micro change , from the diaclone and microman series , respectively hasbro acquired the rights to sell them in the united states but , instead of selling them under their original names , they were rebranded as '' the transformers '' the first two years consisted primarily of reusing the car-robots/micro change molds the line was released as '' the transformers '' in the united states , canada and the uk in 1984 ( one year after the gobots ) but takara was still marketing diaclone at least during 1984 hence in japan '' the transformers '' did not debut under that brand till 1985 , when the line was also rolled out to the majority of the rest of the world between takara and hasbro it is thought that hasbro europe as it now stands did not come into existence till 1985 , hence no records of transformers sales in 1984 the autobot jetfire was repainted from a macross toy , specifically the vf-1 valkyrie , and the character was renamed skyfire in the animated television series program for copyright reasons in 1986 the transformers animated movie had been released , and during the run of the movie , through a pamphlet that came with certain figures , you could order certain transformers through the mail , such as optimus prime among other toys many have speculated that this change might have been what signaled the beginning of the end for the transformers , as part of the novelty of the first lines was the realistic vehicles that turned into robots pretenders consisted of a transformer contained inside an action figure shell who could '' pretend '' to be either a human or a monster still , despite the complaints , the pretender line continued through all but the final year of generation one , with variations such as beast pretenders , monster pretenders , classic pretenders , mega pretenders and ultra pretenders , each with variations on the theme or increasing levels of complexity also during this time , micromasters were introduced , and would become one of the last sub-groups of generation one micromasters were tiny transformers created to compete with the micro machines , a hugely popular toy line of the time but many also regarded this as a time of a dearth in creativity and the lowest point in the toy line 's history the year 1990 saw the last american burst with the release of more micromaster characters and the introduction of the action masters , non-transforming action figures who came with transforming companions the 1992 and 1993 european and canadian releases make up what is often called '' generation 1.5 '' , much to the annoyance of many uk fans these toys are similar in design to the generation 2 transformers , having lightpipe eyes , and pastel colors the 1993 figures were repackaged for european g2 release in 1994 , and three subgroup molds got used in the us g2 line the line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the transformers : universe line transformers : generation two ( 1992–1994 usa , 1994–1995 uk/canada ) in 1992 , hasbro relaunched the transformers franchise with the generation 2 line , with production again largely being done by takara unfortunately for both takara and hasbro , generation two sales dropped off quickly after two years , and hasbro abandoned it four unreleased molds were released in the machine wars line , and four more resurfaced in the robots in disguise series they went in a new direction and a new beginning the beast wars toy line was launched in the autumn of 1995 , and mainframe entertainment produced a computer-generated imagery , or cgi , animated series program to tie in with the new toy line a fresh idea coupled with a tv series program with strong stories assured this series the success hasbro and takara needed , as this series was a giant hit in international markets as well as in takara 's home market , japan hasbro 's original plan for the beast wars was to have optimus prime , renamed optimus primal , and megatron be reformatted versions of their 1980s selves another designed feature for the 1995/1996 toys was carried over from generation 2 , transparent '' light pipe '' eyes beast wars : transformers had to be renamed in some countries , particularly canada , because of concern over the word '' war '' in the title long-time transformers fans noticed the prominence of the words '' beast wars '' over '' transformers '' , the latter appearing in small type under the former while beast machines was still running in canada , japan 's takara made a bid to return to the familiar vehicle-transforming robots concept once again optimus prime and megatron were re-engineered , with prime now a fire truck and megatron a six changer , whose modes included a dragon , bat , jet , land-craft and a giant hand other combiners were created for the series too , such as landfill and rail racer bruticus , a combiner from g1 was also repaint and introduced into the series , with a coinciding toy re-release these were not the only toys to be re-released for this series , with many from past lines being repainted and packaged in rid boxes the line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the transformers : universe line in tandem with this new endeavor , armada signaled a new continuity in its accompanying animated series and a new focus in both the show and the toys on mini-cons , a new faction of transformers the mini-cons often mimicked features associated with generation 1 sub-groups such as the headmasters and targetmasters , transforming into weapons and , in three cases , a transformer 's head after the successful armada toy line , hasbro/takara introduced transformers : energon the line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the transformers : universe line it was expected that the release of a new movie would involve the production and release of associated toys from takara and hasbro this is a new line which features robot versions of various marvel comics superheroes ( and later more of the star wars transformers figures once it merged with this line ) the toy was released on february 26 , 2009 following with the black and white version a month later on march 26 , 2009

the transformers toy line was created from toy molds mostly produced by japanese company takara in the toy lines car-robots ( diaclone ) and micro change ( microman ) in 1984 , hasbro bought the distribution rights to the molds and rebranded them as the transformers for distribution in north america they approached marvel comics to create a backstory with names and short descriptions for each character , most of which were written by bob budiansky the designs for the original 28 figures were made by kojin ono , takashi matsuda , hideaki yoke , hiroyuki obara , and satoshi koizumi the following transformers toy series were released in the united states and japan : the transformers ( 1984–1990 usa ) ( 1984–1993 , uk/canada ) ( 1985–1992 , japan ) - retroactively called '' generation one '' or '' g1 '' since then the characters , however , went on to appear in convention comics and stories beginning in 2008 unlike the other ratings , teamwork seems to be split along faction lines , with autobots typically holding higher teamwork ratings than decepticons a second unique spec value , cooperation , replaced the firepower rating used on individuals ' cards with the transformers : cybertron line a few characters even got '' unknown '' and '' infinity '' ratings the specifications portion of the tech specs which came with earlier g1 transformers were obfuscated with interference patterns which made them difficult to read without a decoder which was included in the box for each transformer transformers : generation one ( 1984–1990 usa , 1984–1993 uk/canada ) the first transformers toys were created from two different transforming robot toy lines from takara , the car-robots and micro change , from the diaclone and microman series , respectively hasbro acquired the rights to sell them in the united states but , instead of selling them under their original names , they were rebranded as '' the transformers '' the line was released as '' the transformers '' in the united states , canada and the uk in 1984 ( one year after the gobots ) but takara was still marketing diaclone at least during 1984 hence in japan '' the transformers '' did not debut under that brand till 1985 , when the line was also rolled out to the majority of the rest of the world between takara and hasbro it is thought that hasbro europe as it now stands did not come into existence till 1985 , hence no records of transformers sales in 1984 uk transformers toys were sold in boxes identical to those of their american counterparts until around 1998/9 when the range started to have uk exclusives the 1984 and 1985 toy lines contained several figures of note the autobot jetfire was repainted from a macross toy , specifically the vf-1 valkyrie , and the character was renamed skyfire in the animated television series program for copyright reasons this was due to changes in the movie and television series , which leaped ahead twenty years to the year 2005 many have speculated that this change might have been what signaled the beginning of the end for the transformers , as part of the novelty of the first lines was the realistic vehicles that turned into robots for the 1987 and 1988 lines , hasbro introduced even more radical ideas through new sub-groups the headmasters and targetmasters came with partners who transformed into the figure 's head or weapon , respectively each line would see various permutations over the two-year span , including smaller headmasters , double targetmasters , and a powermaster with two engines pretenders consisted of a transformer contained inside an action figure shell who could '' pretend '' to be either a human or a monster also during this time , micromasters were introduced , and would become one of the last sub-groups of generation one micromasters were tiny transformers created to compete with the micro machines , a hugely popular toy line of the time for the first time , the transformers received a new design for their title logo larger action master sets came with transforming vehicles and bases the action master line was criticized for its perceived desperation for a gimmick , although it had a few defenders the line predictably faded and would be the last transformers output in the us until 1992 these toys are similar in design to the generation 2 transformers , having lightpipe eyes , and pastel colors the term generation 1 is a retronym ; the series was simply known as '' transformers '' until the release of the generation 2 series however , the term has become semi-official , as both hasbro and takara have referred to this era as '' generation 1 '' ) large-scale production of new characters in this line ended with the onset of generation 2 this has led to controversy among fans who consider g1 to be the only '' pure '' form of transformers the line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the transformers : universe line in 1992 , hasbro relaunched the transformers franchise with the generation 2 line , with production again largely being done by takara the subgroups concept was done away with for the first year , but there were no new molds or characters unfortunately for both takara and hasbro , generation two sales dropped off quickly after two years , and hasbro abandoned it there were toys planned that never saw release with the failure of the generation 2 series , hasbro and takara decided the franchise needed an overhaul while there had been transformers that change into robotic animals , the premise of the new line was that all figures would transform into animals with realistic appearances the beast wars toy line was launched in the autumn of 1995 , and mainframe entertainment produced a computer-generated imagery , or cgi , animated series program to tie in with the new toy line a fresh idea coupled with a tv series program with strong stories assured this series the success hasbro and takara needed , as this series was a giant hit in international markets as well as in takara 's home market , japan the line was later commemorated as sub-series of the transformers : titanium and transformers : universe lines robots in disguise was responsible for introducing a lot of concepts that would be re-used often in the next incarnations of transformers after several lines of toys produced by one company or the other , hasbro and takara united to produce what was purported to be a single , identical line of transformers for release worldwide in tandem with this new endeavor , armada signaled a new continuity in its accompanying animated series and a new focus in both the show and the toys on mini-cons , a new faction of transformers each larger price point consisted of an autobot or decepticon who came with a mini-con partner many of the repaints taken from the armada line had remolded parts retro-fitted to the original designs so their mini-con features would now use a planet key instead the line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the transformers : universe line , where it had the nickname of '' classics 2.0 '' there are more star wars characters into transformers like general grievous and obi-wan kenobi

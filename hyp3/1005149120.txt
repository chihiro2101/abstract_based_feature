the transformers toy line was created from toy molds mostly produced by japanese company takara in the toy lines car-robots ( diaclone ) and micro change ( microman ) other toy molds from other companies such as bandai were used as well in 1984 , hasbro bought the distribution rights to the molds and rebranded them as the transformers for distribution in north america they approached marvel comics to create a backstory with names and short descriptions for each character , most of which were written by bob budiansky the designs for the original 28 figures were made by kojin ono , takashi matsuda , hideaki yoke , hiroyuki obara , and satoshi koizumi the following transformers toy series were released in the united states and japan : the transformers ( 1984–1990 usa ) ( 1984–1993 , uk/canada ) ( 1985–1992 , japan ) - retroactively called '' generation one '' or '' g1 '' since then the owner of the new transformer is encouraged to cut out the tech specs and save it a second unique spec value , cooperation , replaced the firepower rating used on individuals ' cards the values started becoming inconsistent and skewed in generation 2 and beast wars , when hasbro apparently thought no child will ever want a toy that is described as anything less than perfect most characters ' numbers hardly ever dipped below 8 , the go-bot version of optimus prime was the first character to have all values at 10 , a trend that would repeat for most '' leader '' characters when even more powerful versions of the optimus primal toy ( such as optimal optimus ) were introduced , hasbro even invented a '' 10+ '' rating in an attempt to keep increasing the power levels the decoder consisted of simple red plastic which rendered the interference patterns invisible related to tech specs were marvel 's transformer universe comics , where the entry for each transformer contained an expanded bio based on the one printed on the tech specs transformers : generation one ( 1984–1990 usa , 1984–1993 uk/canada ) the first transformers toys were created from two different transforming robot toy lines from takara , the car-robots and micro change , from the diaclone and microman series , respectively the line was released as '' the transformers '' in the united states , canada and the uk in 1984 ( one year after the gobots ) but takara was still marketing diaclone at least during 1984 hence in japan '' the transformers '' did not debut under that brand till 1985 , when the line was also rolled out to the majority of the rest of the world between takara and hasbro in 1986 the transformers animated movie had been released , and during the run of the movie , through a pamphlet that came with certain figures , you could order certain transformers through the mail , such as optimus prime among other toys the toys came in a standard brown mailer box , with items , booklet , and a limited edition movie certificate and sticker many have speculated that this change might have been what signaled the beginning of the end for the transformers , as part of the novelty of the first lines was the realistic vehicles that turned into robots for the 1987 and 1988 lines , hasbro introduced even more radical ideas through new sub-groups micromasters were tiny transformers created to compete with the micro machines , a hugely popular toy line of the time for the first time , the transformers received a new design for their title logo but many also regarded this as a time of a dearth in creativity and the lowest point in the toy line 's history the line predictably faded and would be the last transformers output in the us until 1992 the uk and canada continued with new action master figures and introduced the turbo masters and predators the 1992 and 1993 european and canadian releases make up what is often called '' generation 1.5 '' , much to the annoyance of many uk fans these toys are similar in design to the generation 2 transformers , having lightpipe eyes , and pastel colors the 1993 european figures used the g2 faction symbols which hasbro uk designed because their licence on the g1 symbols had expired the 1993 figures were repackaged for european g2 release in 1994 , and three subgroup molds got used in the us g2 line however , the term has become semi-official , as both hasbro and takara have referred to this era as '' generation 1 '' the line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the transformers : universe line generation 2 re-used the molds for many of the characters from the 1984 and 1985 line , but with mostly different color schemes and finishes , as well as different weapons and accessories as noted previously , megatron 's original alternate mode , or '' transformation identity '' , was a handgun with attachments , but in generation two , this was changed to a tank due to safety and security concerns unfortunately for both takara and hasbro , generation two sales dropped off quickly after two years , and hasbro abandoned it with the failure of the generation 2 series , hasbro and takara decided the franchise needed an overhaul while there had been transformers that change into robotic animals , the premise of the new line was that all figures would transform into animals with realistic appearances a fresh idea coupled with a tv series program with strong stories assured this series the success hasbro and takara needed , as this series was a giant hit in international markets as well as in takara 's home market , japan hasbro 's original plan for the beast wars was to have optimus prime , renamed optimus primal , and megatron be reformatted versions of their 1980s selves another designed feature for the 1995/1996 toys was carried over from generation 2 , transparent '' light pipe '' eyes long-time transformers fans noticed the prominence of the words '' beast wars '' over '' transformers '' , the latter appearing in small type under the former while still a success , the storyline and direction borne by beast machines was questioned and criticized by the most ardent fans who knew the previous history of the transformers this line was brought by hasbro to america as the robots in disguise series , and featured the autobots facing off against the predacons once again optimus prime and megatron were re-engineered , with prime now a fire truck and megatron a six changer , whose modes included a dragon , bat , jet , land-craft and a giant hand the line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the transformers : universe line transformers : armada ( 2002–2003 ) in 2003 , transformers : armada launched a pivotal new era in the toy line each larger price point consisted of an autobot or decepticon who came with a mini-con partner the line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the transformers : universe line each figure came with a cyber key regardless of size , but there were several cyber keys crucial to the plot of the anime series which only came with certain figures transfomers : classics was a filler line for hasbro , to fill the gap between the end of cybertron and the 2007 movie line the robots ( stated by optimus prime ) in the film are actual sentient organisms and not just giant , mindless , and mechanical machines originally , transformers : animated was to be called '' transformers : heroes '' , but its name was changed to avoid confusion with the transformers live-action film

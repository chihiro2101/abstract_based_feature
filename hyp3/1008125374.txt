snitterfield , warwickshire in 1893 , where burt 's father opened a rural practice early in burt 's life he showed a precocious nature , so much so that his father often took the young burt with him on his medical rounds one of the elder burt 's more famous patients was darwin galton , brother of francis galton he attended king 's ( now known as warwick ) school , in the county town , from 1892 to 1895 , and later won a scholarship to christ 's hospital , then located in london , where he developed his interest in psychology mcdougall , knowing burt 's interest in galton 's work , taught him the elements of psychometrics , thus helping burt with his first steps in the development and structure of mental tests , an interest that would last the rest of his life burt was one of a group of students who worked with mcdougall , which included william brown , john flügel , and may smith , who all went on to have distinguished careers in psychology burt graduated with second-class honours in literae humaniores ( classics ) in 1906 , taking a special paper in psychology in his final examinations in 1907 , mcdougall invited burt to help with a nationwide survey of physical and mental characteristics of the british people , proposed by francis galton , in which he was to work on the standardization of psychological tests in the summer of 1908 , burt visited the university of würzburg , germany , where he first met the psychologist oswald külpe work in educational psychology in 1909 burt made use of charles spearman 's model of general intelligence to analyse his data on the performance of schoolchildren in a battery of tests this first research project was to define burt 's life 's work in quantitative intelligence testing , eugenics , and the inheritance of intelligence he notably established that girls were equal to boys in general intelligence burt was much involved in the initiation of child guidance in great britain and his 1925 publication the young delinquent led to opening of the london child guidance clinic in islington in 1927 one of his students , reuben conrad , recalled that he once arrived at the university with a chimpanzee that he had borrowed from london zoo , though conrad could not recall what point burt was trying to make burt was a consultant with the committees that developed the 11-plus examinations he was a member of the tavistock clinic council in the early 1930s henry dicks , 50 years of the tavistock clinic burt , the young delinquent , london : university of london press , 1925 '' quoted by adrian wooldridge , measuring the mind : education and psychology in england , c in 1946 he became the first british psychologist to be knighted for his contributions to psychological testing and for making educational opportunities more widely available , according to an account by j burt was a member of the london school of differential psychology , and of the british eugenics society it is his research in behaviour genetics , most notably in studying the heritability of intelligence ( as measured in iq tests ) using twin study , that has created the most controversy , frequently referred to as '' the burt affair '' this was due in large part to research by oliver gillie ( 1976 ) and leon kamin ( 1974 ) the 2007 encyclopædia britannica noted that it is widely acknowledged that his later work was flawed and many academics agree that data were falsified , though his earlier work is generally accepted as valid '' burt , cyril lodowic leslie hearnshaw , a close friend of burt and his official biographer , concluded after examining the criticisms that most of burt 's data from after world war ii were unreliable or fraudulent rushton ( 1997 ) wrote that five different studies on twins reared apart by independent researchers corroborated cyril burt 's findings and had given almost the same heritability estimate ( average estimate 0.75 vs no-one with these names was registered as a member of staff or student at university college between 1914 and 1976 , or in any other institution within the university of london , and its psychology department could not trace either of them between 1952 and 1959 , burt lived in london and had two associates , charlotte banks and gertrude keir , neither of who ever met howard or conway although they suggested to gillie that burt may have corresponded with the two , there was no trace of any such correspondence in burt 's papers based on his investigation , gillie considered it likely that neither howard nor conway existed , but were a fantasy of the ageing burt himself however , he does not address the central issue , that burt wrote scientific papers and published them as editor of a journal under false names and without the consent of the supposed authors further , he instanced two other example of what he terms burt 's deviousness ignored by fletcher finally , hernshaw claimed that burt 's failings in his years of retirement went far beyond carelessness however joynson accepted that burt frequently used assumed names to publish ( in the journal burt edited , the journal of statistical psychology ) papers that burt had written himself : the names he used included those of howard and conway '' burt , cyril l liverpool university special collection and archives holds burt 's personal papers ( ref : d191 ) ,

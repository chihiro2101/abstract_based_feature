cyril burt scandal shortly after burt died it became known that all of his notes and records had been burnt , and he was accused of falsifying research data from the late 1970s , it has been generally accepted that '' he had fabricated some of the data , though some of his earlier work remained unaffected by this revelation '' this was due in large part to research by oliver gillie ( 1976 ) and leon kamin ( 1974 ) the 2007 encyclopædia britannica noted that it is widely acknowledged that his later work was flawed and many academics agree that data were falsified , though his earlier work is generally accepted as valid leslie hearnshaw , a close friend of burt and his official biographer , concluded after examining the criticisms that most of burt 's data from after world war ii were unreliable or fraudulent jensen has also argued that '' no one with any statistical sophistication , and burt had plenty , would report exactly the same correlation , 0.77 , three times in succession if he were trying to fake the data hunt , it may never be found out whether burt was intentionally fraudulent or merely careless the multifactorial theory of inheritance and its application to intelligence the papers in the names of howard or conway were published after burt 's retirement from university college although their affiliations were said to be with university college , howard 's specifically with its psychology department burt 's housekeeper from 1950 recalled to gillie that she had questioned burt on why he had written papers in the names of howard and conway ; his response was that they had done the research and should be credited he added that testing separated twins was expensive : burt had no research funds to pay research workers and his own finances were too stretched to pay for it himself the first was burt 's falsification of the early history of factorial analysis and his untruthful claim to have been the first to use that technique finally , hernshaw claimed that burt 's failings in his years of retirement went far beyond carelessness works by cyril burt , at jstor works by cyril burt , at eugenics review concise summary of cyril burt '' sir cyril

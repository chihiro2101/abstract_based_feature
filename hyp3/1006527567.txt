the idea that ancient shrines might have been constructed in alignment with one another was proposed in 1846 by the reverend edward duke , who observed that some prehistoric monuments and medieval churches aligned with each other in germany , the idea was referred to as heilige linien ( 'holy lines ' ) , an idea adopted by some proponents of nazism the idea of '' leys '' as paths traversing the british landscape was developed by alfred watkins , a wealthy businessman and antiquarian who lived in hereford he subsequently began drawing lines across his ordnance survey maps , developing the view that ancient british people had tended to travel in straight lines , using '' mark points '' along the landscape to guide them he put forward his idea of ley lines in the 1922 book early british trackways and then again , in greater depth , in the 1925 book the old straight track the term ley derived from the old english term for a cleared space , with watkins adopting it for his lines because he found it to be part of the place-names of various settlements that were along the lines he traced his ideas were rejected by most experts on british prehistory at the time , including both the small number of recognised archaeological scholars and local enthusiasts in 1926 , advocates of watkins ' beliefs established the straight track club to assist this growing body of enthusiasts who were looking for their own ley lines in the landscape , in 1927 , watkins published the ley hunter 's manual he refused to publish an advert for the old straight track in antiquity , at which watkins became very bitter towards him the archaeoastronomy clive ruggles noted that after the 1920s , '' ley lines soon faded into obscurity '' it was in the latter decade of this period that a belief in ley lines was taken up by members of the counterculture , where—in the words of the archaeologist matthew johnson—they were attributed with '' sacred significance or mystical power '' ruggles noted that in this period , ley lines came to be conceived as '' lines of power , the paths of some form of spiritual force or energy accessible to our ancient ancestors but now lost to narrow-minded twentieth-century scientific thought '' in his 1961 book skyways and landmarks , tony wedd published his idea that watkins ' leys were both real and served as ancient markers to guide alien spacecraft that were visiting earth wedd 's ideas were taken up by the writer john michell , who promoted them to a wider audience in his 1967 book the flying saucer vision he proposed that an advanced ancient society that had once covered much of the world had established ley lines across the landscape to harness this lung mei energy michell invented various claims about archaeological evidence to suit his purpose he presented this as a challenge to archaeologists , urging them to examine his ideas in detail and stating that he would donate a large sum of money to charity if they could disprove them michell 's publication was followed by an upsurge in ley hunting as enthusiasts travelled around the british landscape seeking to identify what they believed to be ley lines connecting various historic structures one ley lines enthusiast , philip heselton , established the ley hunter magazine , which launched in 1965 it was later edited by paul screeton , who also wrote the book quicksilver heritage , in which he argued that the neolithic period had seen an idyllic society devoted to spirituality but that this was brought to an end through the introduction of metal technologies in the bronze age ley hunters often differed on how they understood the ley lines ; some believed that leys only marked a pre-existing energy current , whereas others thought that the leys helped to control and direct this energy ley hunters nevertheless often took an interest in the work of archaeoastronomy like alexander thom and euan mackie , being attracted to their arguments about the existence of sophisticated astronomer-priests in british prehistory he was more concerned than many other ley hunters with finding objective evidence for the idea that unusual forms of energy could be measured at places where prehistoric communities had erected structures the overall message of williamson and bellamy 's book was that the idea of leys , as it was being presented by earth mysteries proponents , had no basis in empirical reality it laid aside ideas of leys representing channels for earth energy , noting that this was beyond the realm of scientific verification , and instead focused on trying to build a case for ley lines that archaeologists could engage with one criticism of watkins ' ley line theory states that given the high density of historic and prehistoric sites in britain and other parts of europe , finding straight lines that '' connect '' sites is trivial and ascribable to coincidence

the idea of '' leys '' as paths traversing the british landscape was developed by alfred watkins , a wealthy businessman and antiquarian who lived in hereford according to his account , he was driving across the hills near blackwardine , herefordshire , when he looked across the landscape and observed the way that several features lined up together he subsequently began drawing lines across his ordnance survey maps , developing the view that ancient british people had tended to travel in straight lines , using '' mark points '' along the landscape to guide them he put forward his idea of ley lines in the 1922 book early british trackways and then again , in greater depth , in the 1925 book the old straight track in his view , these straight tracks were ancient trade routes watkins referred to these lines as '' leys '' although had reservations about doing so the term ley derived from the old english term for a cleared space , with watkins adopting it for his lines because he found it to be part of the place-names of various settlements that were along the lines he traced some of watkins ' other ideas , such as his belief that widespread forest clearance took place in prehistory rather than later , would nevertheless later be recognised by archaeologists part of archaeologists ' objections was their belief that prehistoric britons would not have been sophisticated enough to produce such accurate measurements across the landscape british archaeologists were then overwhelmingly committed to ideas of cultural diffusionism , and thus unwelcoming to ideas about ley lines being an independent british development to assist this growing body of enthusiasts who were looking for their own ley lines in the landscape , in 1927 , watkins published the ley hunter 's manual the archaeoastronomy clive ruggles noted that after the 1920s , '' ley lines soon faded into obscurity '' it was in the latter decade of this period that a belief in ley lines was taken up by members of the counterculture , where—in the words of the archaeologist matthew johnson—they were attributed with '' sacred significance or mystical power '' ruggles noted that in this period , ley lines came to be conceived as '' lines of power , the paths of some form of spiritual force or energy accessible to our ancient ancestors but now lost to narrow-minded twentieth-century scientific thought '' he came to this conclusion after comparing watkins ' ideas with those of the french ufology aimé michel , who argued for the existence of '' orthotenies '' , lines along which alien spacecraft travelled wedd suggested that either spacecraft were following the prehistoric landmarks for guidance or that both the leys and the spacecraft were following a '' magnetic current '' flowing across the earth wedd 's ideas were taken up by the writer john michell , who promoted them to a wider audience in his 1967 book the flying saucer vision here he interpreted ley lines by reference to the chinese concept of lung mei energy lines he proposed that an advanced ancient society that had once covered much of the world had established ley lines across the landscape to harness this lung mei energy the ley hunting community michell 's publication was followed by an upsurge in ley hunting as enthusiasts travelled around the british landscape seeking to identify what they believed to be ley lines connecting various historic structures one ley lines enthusiast , philip heselton , established the ley hunter magazine , which launched in 1965 the ley hunting movement often blended their activities with other esoteric practices , such as numerology and dowsing he was more concerned than many other ley hunters with finding objective evidence for the idea that unusual forms of energy could be measured at places where prehistoric communities had erected structures some maintained that even if the presence of earth energies running through ley lines could not be demonstrated with empirical evidence and rational argumentation , this did not matter ; for them , a belief in ley lines was an act of faith , and in their view archaeologists were too narrow-minded to comprehend this reality however , belief in ley lines persists among various esoteric groups , having become an '' enduring feature of some brands of esotericism '' one criticism of watkins ' ley line theory states that given the high density of historic and prehistoric sites in britain and other parts of europe , finding straight lines that '' connect '' sites is trivial and ascribable to coincidence

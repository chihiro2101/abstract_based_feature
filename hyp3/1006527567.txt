the idea that ancient shrines might have been constructed in alignment with one another was proposed in 1846 by the reverend edward duke , who observed that some prehistoric monuments and medieval churches aligned with each other there , wilhelm teudt had argued for the presence of linear alignments connecting various sites but suggested that they had a religious and astronomical function the idea of '' leys '' as paths traversing the british landscape was developed by alfred watkins , a wealthy businessman and antiquarian who lived in hereford according to his account , he was driving across the hills near blackwardine , herefordshire , when he looked across the landscape and observed the way that several features lined up together he subsequently began drawing lines across his ordnance survey maps , developing the view that ancient british people had tended to travel in straight lines , using '' mark points '' along the landscape to guide them he put forward his idea of ley lines in the 1922 book early british trackways and then again , in greater depth , in the 1925 book the old straight track watkins referred to these lines as '' leys '' although had reservations about doing so the term ley derived from the old english term for a cleared space , with watkins adopting it for his lines because he found it to be part of the place-names of various settlements that were along the lines he traced he also observed the recurrence of '' cole '' and '' dod '' in english place-names , thus suggesting that the individuals who established these lines were referred to as a '' coleman '' or '' dodman '' british archaeologists were then overwhelmingly committed to ideas of cultural diffusionism , and thus unwelcoming to ideas about ley lines being an independent british development the historian ronald hutton similarly noted that there had been a '' virtual demise '' in the idea by the 1950s , in part due to '' a natural weariness with a spent enthusiasm '' from the 1940s through to the 1960s , the archaeological establishment blossomed in britain due to the formation of various university courses on the subject ruggles noted that in this period , ley lines came to be conceived as '' lines of power , the paths of some form of spiritual force or energy accessible to our ancient ancestors but now lost to narrow-minded twentieth-century scientific thought '' wedd suggested that either spacecraft were following the prehistoric landmarks for guidance or that both the leys and the spacecraft were following a '' magnetic current '' flowing across the earth wedd 's ideas were taken up by the writer john michell , who promoted them to a wider audience in his 1967 book the flying saucer vision in this book , michell promoted the ancient astronaut belief that extraterrestrials had assisted humanity during prehistory , when humans had worshipped these entities as gods , but that the aliens left when humanity became too materialistic and technology-focused here he interpreted ley lines by reference to the chinese concept of lung mei energy lines he proposed that an advanced ancient society that had once covered much of the world had established ley lines across the landscape to harness this lung mei energy in the mid-1970s , michell then published a detailed case study of the west penwith district of cornwall , laying out what he believed to be the ley lines in that area michell 's publication was followed by an upsurge in ley hunting as enthusiasts travelled around the british landscape seeking to identify what they believed to be ley lines connecting various historic structures another key book produced among the ley hunting community was mysterious britain , written by janet and colin bord in this work , williamson and bellamy considered and tackled the evidence that ley lines exponents had amassed in support of their beliefs however , belief in ley lines persists among various esoteric groups , having become an '' enduring feature of some brands of esotericism '' as hutton observed , a belief in '' ancient earth energies have passed so far into the religious experience of the 'new age ' counter-culture of europe and america that it is unlikely that any tests of evidence would bring about an end to belief in them '' he cited williamson and bellamy 's work in demonstrating this , noting that their research showed how '' the density of archaeological sites in the british landscape is so great that a line drawn through virtually anywhere will 'clip ' a number of sites the sample distribution from the standing stones was compared with the theoretical distribution to show that the occurrence of straight lines was no more than average he was an intensely rational person with an active intellect , and i think he would be a bit disappointed with some of the fringe aspects of ley lines today

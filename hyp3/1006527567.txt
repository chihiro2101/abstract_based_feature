the idea that ancient shrines might have been constructed in alignment with one another was proposed in 1846 by the reverend edward duke , who observed that some prehistoric monuments and medieval churches aligned with each other in germany , the idea was referred to as heilige linien ( 'holy lines ' ) , an idea adopted by some proponents of nazism the idea of '' leys '' as paths traversing the british landscape was developed by alfred watkins , a wealthy businessman and antiquarian who lived in hereford he subsequently began drawing lines across his ordnance survey maps , developing the view that ancient british people had tended to travel in straight lines , using '' mark points '' along the landscape to guide them he put forward his idea of ley lines in the 1922 book early british trackways and then again , in greater depth , in the 1925 book the old straight track he proposed the existence of a network of completely straight roads that cut through a range of prehistoric , roman , and medieval structures watkins had drawn upon earlier research ; he cited the work of the english astronomer norman lockyer , who had argued that ancient alignments might be oriented to sunrise and sunset at solstices watkins referred to these lines as '' leys '' although had reservations about doing so the term ley derived from the old english term for a cleared space , with watkins adopting it for his lines because he found it to be part of the place-names of various settlements that were along the lines he traced his ideas were rejected by most experts on british prehistory at the time , including both the small number of recognised archaeological scholars and local enthusiasts his critics noted that the straight lines he proposed would have been highly impractical means of crossing hilly or mountainous terrain , and that many of the sites he selected as evidence for the leys were of disparate historical origins some of watkins ' other ideas , such as his belief that widespread forest clearance took place in prehistory rather than later , would nevertheless later be recognised by archaeologists ruggles noted that in this period , ley lines came to be conceived as '' lines of power , the paths of some form of spiritual force or energy accessible to our ancient ancestors but now lost to narrow-minded twentieth-century scientific thought '' he came to this conclusion after comparing watkins ' ideas with those of the french ufology aim√© michel , who argued for the existence of '' orthotenies '' , lines along which alien spacecraft travelled wedd 's ideas were taken up by the writer john michell , who promoted them to a wider audience in his 1967 book the flying saucer vision he also argued that humanity 's materialism was driving it to self-destruction , but that this could be prevented by re-activating the ancient centres which would facilitate renewed contact with the aliens here he interpreted ley lines by reference to the chinese concept of lung mei energy lines he proposed that an advanced ancient society that had once covered much of the world had established ley lines across the landscape to harness this lung mei energy in the mid-1970s , michell then published a detailed case study of the west penwith district of cornwall , laying out what he believed to be the ley lines in that area he presented this as a challenge to archaeologists , urging them to examine his ideas in detail and stating that he would donate a large sum of money to charity if they could disprove them one ley lines enthusiast , philip heselton , established the ley hunter magazine , which launched in 1965 the ley hunting movement often blended their activities with other esoteric practices , such as numerology and dowsing in suggesting that prehistoric britons were far more advanced in mathematics and astronomy than archaeologists had previously accepted , thom 's work was seen as giving additional credibility to the beliefs of ley hunters in this work , williamson and bellamy considered and tackled the evidence that ley lines exponents had amassed in support of their beliefs some maintained that even if the presence of earth energies running through ley lines could not be demonstrated with empirical evidence and rational argumentation , this did not matter ; for them , a belief in ley lines was an act of faith , and in their view archaeologists were too narrow-minded to comprehend this reality city of seattle , a dowsing organisation called the geo group plotted what they believed were the ley lines across the city one criticism of watkins ' ley line theory states that given the high density of historic and prehistoric sites in britain and other parts of europe , finding straight lines that '' connect '' sites is trivial and ascribable to coincidence

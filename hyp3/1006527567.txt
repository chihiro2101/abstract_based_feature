there , wilhelm teudt had argued for the presence of linear alignments connecting various sites but suggested that they had a religious and astronomical function in germany , the idea was referred to as heilige linien ( 'holy lines ' ) , an idea adopted by some proponents of nazism the idea of '' leys '' as paths traversing the british landscape was developed by alfred watkins , a wealthy businessman and antiquarian who lived in hereford he subsequently began drawing lines across his ordnance survey maps , developing the view that ancient british people had tended to travel in straight lines , using '' mark points '' along the landscape to guide them he put forward his idea of ley lines in the 1922 book early british trackways and then again , in greater depth , in the 1925 book the old straight track he proposed the existence of a network of completely straight roads that cut through a range of prehistoric , roman , and medieval structures watkins had drawn upon earlier research ; he cited the work of the english astronomer norman lockyer , who had argued that ancient alignments might be oriented to sunrise and sunset at solstices watkins referred to these lines as '' leys '' although had reservations about doing so his critics noted that the straight lines he proposed would have been highly impractical means of crossing hilly or mountainous terrain , and that many of the sites he selected as evidence for the leys were of disparate historical origins some of watkins ' other ideas , such as his belief that widespread forest clearance took place in prehistory rather than later , would nevertheless later be recognised by archaeologists british archaeologists were then overwhelmingly committed to ideas of cultural diffusionism , and thus unwelcoming to ideas about ley lines being an independent british development to assist this growing body of enthusiasts who were looking for their own ley lines in the landscape , in 1927 , watkins published the ley hunter 's manual it was in the latter decade of this period that a belief in ley lines was taken up by members of the counterculture , where—in the words of the archaeologist matthew johnson—they were attributed with '' sacred significance or mystical power '' ruggles noted that in this period , ley lines came to be conceived as '' lines of power , the paths of some form of spiritual force or energy accessible to our ancient ancestors but now lost to narrow-minded twentieth-century scientific thought '' in his 1961 book skyways and landmarks , tony wedd published his idea that watkins ' leys were both real and served as ancient markers to guide alien spacecraft that were visiting earth he came to this conclusion after comparing watkins ' ideas with those of the french ufology aimé michel , who argued for the existence of '' orthotenies '' , lines along which alien spacecraft travelled wedd suggested that either spacecraft were following the prehistoric landmarks for guidance or that both the leys and the spacecraft were following a '' magnetic current '' flowing across the earth he proposed that an advanced ancient society that had once covered much of the world had established ley lines across the landscape to harness this lung mei energy in the mid-1970s , michell then published a detailed case study of the west penwith district of cornwall , laying out what he believed to be the ley lines in that area he presented this as a challenge to archaeologists , urging them to examine his ideas in detail and stating that he would donate a large sum of money to charity if they could disprove them the ley hunting community michell 's publication was followed by an upsurge in ley hunting as enthusiasts travelled around the british landscape seeking to identify what they believed to be ley lines connecting various historic structures parish churches were particularly favoured by the ley hunters , who often worked on the assumption that such churches had almost always been built atop pre-christian sacred sites some maintained that even if the presence of earth energies running through ley lines could not be demonstrated with empirical evidence and rational argumentation , this did not matter ; for them , a belief in ley lines was an act of faith , and in their view archaeologists were too narrow-minded to comprehend this reality however , belief in ley lines persists among various esoteric groups , having become an '' enduring feature of some brands of esotericism '' city of seattle , a dowsing organisation called the geo group plotted what they believed were the ley lines across the city he was an intensely rational person with an active intellect , and i think he would be a bit disappointed with some of the fringe aspects of ley lines today

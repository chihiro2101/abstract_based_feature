the idea that ancient shrines might have been constructed in alignment with one another was proposed in 1846 by the reverend edward duke , who observed that some prehistoric monuments and medieval churches aligned with each other in germany , the idea was referred to as heilige linien ( 'holy lines ' ) , an idea adopted by some proponents of nazism the idea of '' leys '' as paths traversing the british landscape was developed by alfred watkins , a wealthy businessman and antiquarian who lived in hereford he subsequently began drawing lines across his ordnance survey maps , developing the view that ancient british people had tended to travel in straight lines , using '' mark points '' along the landscape to guide them he put forward his idea of ley lines in the 1922 book early british trackways and then again , in greater depth , in the 1925 book the old straight track watkins had drawn upon earlier research ; he cited the work of the english astronomer norman lockyer , who had argued that ancient alignments might be oriented to sunrise and sunset at solstices the term ley derived from the old english term for a cleared space , with watkins adopting it for his lines because he found it to be part of the place-names of various settlements that were along the lines he traced he also observed the recurrence of '' cole '' and '' dod '' in english place-names , thus suggesting that the individuals who established these lines were referred to as a '' coleman '' or '' dodman '' his critics noted that the straight lines he proposed would have been highly impractical means of crossing hilly or mountainous terrain , and that many of the sites he selected as evidence for the leys were of disparate historical origins british archaeologists were then overwhelmingly committed to ideas of cultural diffusionism , and thus unwelcoming to ideas about ley lines being an independent british development to assist this growing body of enthusiasts who were looking for their own ley lines in the landscape , in 1927 , watkins published the ley hunter 's manual the archaeoastronomy clive ruggles noted that after the 1920s , '' ley lines soon faded into obscurity '' ruggles noted that in this period , ley lines came to be conceived as '' lines of power , the paths of some form of spiritual force or energy accessible to our ancient ancestors but now lost to narrow-minded twentieth-century scientific thought '' in his 1961 book skyways and landmarks , tony wedd published his idea that watkins ' leys were both real and served as ancient markers to guide alien spacecraft that were visiting earth wedd suggested that either spacecraft were following the prehistoric landmarks for guidance or that both the leys and the spacecraft were following a '' magnetic current '' flowing across the earth in this book , michell promoted the ancient astronaut belief that extraterrestrials had assisted humanity during prehistory , when humans had worshipped these entities as gods , but that the aliens left when humanity became too materialistic and technology-focused here he interpreted ley lines by reference to the chinese concept of lung mei energy lines he proposed that an advanced ancient society that had once covered much of the world had established ley lines across the landscape to harness this lung mei energy in the mid-1970s , michell then published a detailed case study of the west penwith district of cornwall , laying out what he believed to be the ley lines in that area hutton noted that it represented '' the finest piece of surveying work '' then undertaken by a pseudo-archaeologists in britain ; however , michell had included natural rock outcrops as well as medieval crosses in his list of neolithic and bronze age monuments the 1970s and 1980s also saw the increase in publications on the topic of ley lines for many ley hunters , this neolithic period was seen as a golden age in which britons lived in harmony with the natural environment in this work , williamson and bellamy considered and tackled the evidence that ley lines exponents had amassed in support of their beliefs the other approach was to further engage archaeologists by seeking out new data and arguments to bolster their beliefs in ley lines one criticism of watkins ' ley line theory states that given the high density of historic and prehistoric sites in britain and other parts of europe , finding straight lines that '' connect '' sites is trivial and ascribable to coincidence '' he cited williamson and bellamy 's work in demonstrating this , noting that their research showed how '' the density of archaeological sites in the british landscape is so great that a line drawn through virtually anywhere will 'clip ' a number of sites list of topics characterized as pseudoscience alignments of random points apophenia archaeoastronomy cursus monument earth mysteries geoglyphs geopathology huacas and ceques ley tunnel mandala pareidolia pattern recognition psychogeography songlines telluric currents

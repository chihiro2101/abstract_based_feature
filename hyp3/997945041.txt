there are two basic types of transmembrane proteins : alpha-helix and beta-barrels alpha-helical proteins in outer membranes include stannin and certain lipoproteins , and others this is the major category of transmembrane proteins in humans , 27 % of all proteins have been estimated to be alpha-helical membrane proteins types i , ii , iii and iv are bitopic protein membrane protein structures can be determined by x-ray crystallography , electron microscopy or nmr spectroscopy the most common tertiary structures of these proteins are transmembrane helix bundle and beta barrel '' general principle of membrane protein folding and stability '' membrane proteins which have hydrophobic surfaces , are relatively flexible and are expressed at relatively low levels as of january 2013 less than 0.1 % of protein structures determined were membrane proteins despite being 20â€“30 % of the total proteome the unfolded state of membrane proteins in detergent micelles is different from that in the thermal denaturation experiments membrane protein membrane topology transmembrane domain transmembrane receptors

alpha-helical proteins are present in the inner membranes of bacterial cells or the plasma membrane of eukaryotes , and sometimes in the outer membranes alpha-helical proteins in outer membranes include stannin and certain lipoproteins , and others this is the major category of transmembrane proteins in humans , 27 % of all proteins have been estimated to be alpha-helical membrane proteins beta-barrel proteins are so far found only in outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria , cell walls of gram-positive bacteria , outer membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts , or can be secreted as pore-forming toxins a transmembrane polyproline helix has not been reported in natural proteins type i transmembrane proteins are anchored to the lipid membrane with a stop-transfer anchor sequence and have their n-terminal domains targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) lumen during synthesis ( and the extracellular space , if mature forms are located on cell membranes ) type ii and iii are anchored with a signal-anchor sequence , with type ii being targeted to the er lumen with its c-terminal domain , while type iii have their n-terminal domains targeted to the er lumen the portion of the membrane proteins that are attached to the lipid bilayer ( see annular lipid shell ) consist mostly of hydrophobic amino acids as of january 2013 less than 0.1 % of protein structures determined were membrane proteins despite being 20–30 % of the total proteome for example , the '' unfolded '' bacteriorhodopsin in sds micelles has four transmembrane α-helices folded , while the rest of the protein is situated at the micelle-water interface and can adopt different types of non-native amphiphilic structures membrane protein membrane topology transmembrane domain transmembrane receptors

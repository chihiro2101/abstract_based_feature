alpha-helical proteins are present in the inner membranes of bacterial cells or the plasma membrane of eukaryotes , and sometimes in the outer membranes alpha-helical proteins in outer membranes include stannin and certain lipoproteins , and others this is the major category of transmembrane proteins in humans , 27 % of all proteins have been estimated to be alpha-helical membrane proteins in addition to the protein domains , there are unusual transmembrane elements formed by peptides typical example is gramicidin a , a peptide that forms a dimeric transmembrane β-helix types i , ii , iii and iv are bitopic protein membrane protein structures can be determined by x-ray crystallography , electron microscopy or nmr spectroscopy the most common tertiary structures of these proteins are transmembrane helix bundle and beta barrel as of january 2013 less than 0.1 % of protein structures determined were membrane proteins despite being 20–30 % of the total proteome stability of α-helical transmembrane proteins membrane protein membrane topology transmembrane domain transmembrane receptors

alpha-helical proteins are present in the inner membranes of bacterial cells or the plasma membrane of eukaryotes , and sometimes in the outer membranes alpha-helical proteins in outer membranes include stannin and certain lipoproteins , and others this is the major category of transmembrane proteins in humans , 27 % of all proteins have been estimated to be alpha-helical membrane proteins beta-barrel proteins are so far found only in outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria , cell walls of gram-positive bacteria , outer membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts , or can be secreted as pore-forming toxins all beta-barrel transmembrane proteins have simplest up-and-down topology , which may reflect their common evolutionary origin and similar folding mechanism the most common tertiary structures of these proteins are transmembrane helix bundle and beta barrel the portion of the membrane proteins that are attached to the lipid bilayer ( see annular lipid shell ) consist mostly of hydrophobic amino acids '' general principle of membrane protein folding and stability '' hence , despite the significant functional importance of membrane proteins , determining atomic resolution structures for these proteins is more difficult than globular proteins the unfolded state of membrane proteins in detergent micelles is different from that in the thermal denaturation experiments membrane protein membrane topology transmembrane domain transmembrane receptors

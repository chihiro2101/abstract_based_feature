there are two basic types of transmembrane proteins : alpha-helix and beta-barrels alpha-helical proteins are present in the inner membranes of bacterial cells or the plasma membrane of eukaryotes , and sometimes in the outer membranes alpha-helical proteins in outer membranes include stannin and certain lipoproteins , and others this is the major category of transmembrane proteins in humans , 27 % of all proteins have been estimated to be alpha-helical membrane proteins all beta-barrel transmembrane proteins have simplest up-and-down topology , which may reflect their common evolutionary origin and similar folding mechanism in addition to the protein domains , there are unusual transmembrane elements formed by peptides the portion of the membrane proteins that are attached to the lipid bilayer ( see annular lipid shell ) consist mostly of hydrophobic amino acids '' general principle of membrane protein folding and stability '' hence , despite the significant functional importance of membrane proteins , determining atomic resolution structures for these proteins is more difficult than globular proteins as of january 2013 less than 0.1 % of protein structures determined were membrane proteins despite being 20â€“30 % of the total proteome membrane protein membrane topology transmembrane domain transmembrane receptors

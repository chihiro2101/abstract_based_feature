there are two basic types of transmembrane proteins : alpha-helix and beta-barrels alpha-helical proteins are present in the inner membranes of bacterial cells or the plasma membrane of eukaryotes , and sometimes in the outer membranes alpha-helical proteins in outer membranes include stannin and certain lipoproteins , and others this is the major category of transmembrane proteins in humans , 27 % of all proteins have been estimated to be alpha-helical membrane proteins in addition to the protein domains , there are unusual transmembrane elements formed by peptides the most common tertiary structures of these proteins are transmembrane helix bundle and beta barrel '' general principle of membrane protein folding and stability '' membrane proteins which have hydrophobic surfaces , are relatively flexible and are expressed at relatively low levels hence , despite the significant functional importance of membrane proteins , determining atomic resolution structures for these proteins is more difficult than globular proteins as of january 2013 less than 0.1 % of protein structures determined were membrane proteins despite being 20â€“30 % of the total proteome the unfolded state of membrane proteins in detergent micelles is different from that in the thermal denaturation experiments

in medieval astrology , certain aspects , like certain planets , were considered to be either favorable ( benefic ) or unfavorable ( malefic ) the more modern approach to astrological aspects is exemplified by research on astrological harmonic , of which john addey was a major proponent , and which johannes kepler earlier advocated in his book harmonice mundi in 1619 but even in modern times , aspects are considered either hard ( the 90° square , the 180° opposition ) or easy ( the 120° trine , the 60° sextile ) the conjunction aspect ( essentially 0° , discounting orb ) can be in either category , depending on which two planets it is that are conjunct a list of aspects below presents their angular values and a recommended orb for each aspect the traditional major aspects are sometimes called ptolemaic aspects since they were defined and used by ptolemy in the 1st century , ad these aspects are the conjunction ( 0° ) , sextile ( 60° ) , square ( 90° ) , trine ( 120° ) , and opposition ( 180° ) an orb of approximately 10° is usually considered a conjunction , but if neither the sun nor moon is involved , some consider the conjunction to have a maximum orb of only about 8° conjunctions are said to be the most powerful aspect , mutually intensifying the effects of the planets involved ; they are major point in an individual 's chart whether the conjunction in question is regarded as beneficial or detrimental depends on the specific planets involved in particular , conjunctions involving the sun , venus , and/or jupiter , in any of the three possible conjunction combinations , are considered highly favourable , while conjunctions involving the moon , mars , and/or saturn , again in any of the three possible conjunction combinations , are considered highly unfavourable if either of two planets involved in a conjunction is also under tension from one or more hard aspects with one or more other planets , then the added presence of the conjunction aspect will further intensify the tension of that hard aspect a planet in very close conjunction to the sun ( within 17 minutes of arc , or only about 0.28° ) is said to be cazimi , an ancient astrological term meaning '' in the heart '' ( of the sun ) for example , '' venus cazimi '' means venus is in conjunction with the sun with an orb of less than ≈ ⁠0.28° a related term is combust , applicable when the planet in conjunction with the sun is only moderately close to the sun burnett , leiden , 2000 as successive great conjunctions occur nearly 120° apart , their appearances form a triangular pattern if and designate the periods of jupiter and saturn then the return takes 1/ ( 5/s-2/j ) which comes to 883.15 years , but to be a whole number of conjunction intervals it must be sometimes 913 years and sometimes 854 94 , p.174 even greater importance was attributed to the beginning of a new cycle after all fours trigons had been visited , something which happens in about 900 years if a cycle is defined by when the conjunctions return to the same right ascension rather than to the same constellation , then because of axial precession the cycle is only about 800 years its effect is most obvious when there is a triangulating aspect of a 3rd planet in any major aspect to the 2 planets which are quincunx it is an important minor aspect and indicates a stimulating or challenging energy like that of a square but less intense and more internal astrological symbols hard aspect ( astrology ) soft aspect ( astrology ) applying aspect ( astrology ) conjunction opposition cosmobiology hamburg school of astrology quadrature ( astronomy ) the classical origin & traditional use of aspects deborah houlding online ephemeris from khaldea.com—600bc to 2400ad—calculated for midnight gmt ; also with an aspectarian included for years 1900 to 2005

in medieval astrology , certain aspects , like certain planets , were considered to be either favorable ( benefic ) or unfavorable ( malefic ) the more modern approach to astrological aspects is exemplified by research on astrological harmonic , of which john addey was a major proponent , and which johannes kepler earlier advocated in his book harmonice mundi in 1619 but even in modern times , aspects are considered either hard ( the 90° square , the 180° opposition ) or easy ( the 120° trine , the 60° sextile ) the conjunction aspect ( essentially 0° , discounting orb ) can be in either category , depending on which two planets it is that are conjunct a list of aspects below presents their angular values and a recommended orb for each aspect these aspects are the conjunction ( 0° ) , sextile ( 60° ) , square ( 90° ) , trine ( 120° ) , and opposition ( 180° ) it is important to note that different astrologers and separate astrological systems/traditional utilize differing orbs ( the degree of separation between exactitude ) when calculating and using the aspects , though almost all use a larger orb for a conjunction when compared to the other aspects an orb of approximately 10° is usually considered a conjunction , but if neither the sun nor moon is involved , some consider the conjunction to have a maximum orb of only about 8° conjunctions are said to be the most powerful aspect , mutually intensifying the effects of the planets involved ; they are major point in an individual 's chart exceptionally , the sun , venus , and jupiter were in a 3-way ( beneficial ) conjunction on november & nbsp ; 9 & ndash ; 10 , 1970 , while on march & nbsp ; 10 of that same year , the moon , mars , and saturn were in 3-way ( detrimental ) conjunction if either of two planets involved in a conjunction is also under tension from one or more hard aspects with one or more other planets , then the added presence of the conjunction aspect will further intensify the tension of that hard aspect a planet in very close conjunction to the sun ( within 17 minutes of arc , or only about 0.28° ) is said to be cazimi , an ancient astrological term meaning '' in the heart '' ( of the sun ) for example , '' venus cazimi '' means venus is in conjunction with the sun with an orb of less than ≈ ⁠0.28° a related term is combust , applicable when the planet in conjunction with the sun is only moderately close to the sun in the case of combust , specific orb limit will depend on the particular planet in conjunction with the sun great conjunctions ( between the two slowest classical planets ) have attracted considerable attention in the past as celestial omens these returns are observed to be shifted by some 8° relative to the fixed stars , so no more than four of them occur in the same zodiacal sign if and designate the periods of jupiter and saturn then the return takes 1/ ( 5/s-2/j ) which comes to 883.15 years , but to be a whole number of conjunction intervals it must be sometimes 913 years and sometimes 854 tri ) is an angle of 120° ( 1/3 of the 360° ecliptic ) , an orb of somewhere between 5° and 10° depending on the planets involved any major aspect transit to a given planetary position will also involve the other planet that is in semi-sextile aspect to it it is an important minor aspect and indicates a stimulating or challenging energy like that of a square but less intense and more internal it indicates an energy of perfection and/or idealization astrological symbols hard aspect ( astrology ) soft aspect ( astrology ) applying aspect ( astrology ) conjunction opposition cosmobiology hamburg school of astrology quadrature ( astronomy )

in medieval astrology , certain aspects , like certain planets , were considered to be either favorable ( benefic ) or unfavorable ( malefic ) the more modern approach to astrological aspects is exemplified by research on astrological harmonic , of which john addey was a major proponent , and which johannes kepler earlier advocated in his book harmonice mundi in 1619 but even in modern times , aspects are considered either hard ( the 90° square , the 180° opposition ) or easy ( the 120° trine , the 60° sextile ) the conjunction aspect ( essentially 0° , discounting orb ) can be in either category , depending on which two planets it is that are conjunct a list of aspects below presents their angular values and a recommended orb for each aspect the traditional major aspects are sometimes called ptolemaic aspects since they were defined and used by ptolemy in the 1st century , ad these aspects are the conjunction ( 0° ) , sextile ( 60° ) , square ( 90° ) , trine ( 120° ) , and opposition ( 180° ) an orb of approximately 10° is usually considered a conjunction , but if neither the sun nor moon is involved , some consider the conjunction to have a maximum orb of only about 8° conjunctions are said to be the most powerful aspect , mutually intensifying the effects of the planets involved ; they are major point in an individual 's chart whether the conjunction in question is regarded as beneficial or detrimental depends on the specific planets involved in particular , conjunctions involving the sun , venus , and/or jupiter , in any of the three possible conjunction combinations , are considered highly favourable , while conjunctions involving the moon , mars , and/or saturn , again in any of the three possible conjunction combinations , are considered highly unfavourable exceptionally , the sun , venus , and jupiter were in a 3-way ( beneficial ) conjunction on november & nbsp ; 9 & ndash ; 10 , 1970 , while on march & nbsp ; 10 of that same year , the moon , mars , and saturn were in 3-way ( detrimental ) conjunction if either of two planets involved in a conjunction is also under tension from one or more hard aspects with one or more other planets , then the added presence of the conjunction aspect will further intensify the tension of that hard aspect a planet in very close conjunction to the sun ( within 17 minutes of arc , or only about 0.28° ) is said to be cazimi , an ancient astrological term meaning '' in the heart '' ( of the sun ) in the case of combust , specific orb limit will depend on the particular planet in conjunction with the sun the sun and moon experience a conjunction every single month of the year ⁠— ⁠during the new moon if and designate the periods of jupiter and saturn then the return takes 1/ ( 5/s-2/j ) which comes to 883.15 years , but to be a whole number of conjunction intervals it must be sometimes 913 years and sometimes 854 particular importance has been accorded to the occurrence of a great conjunction in a new trigon , which is bound to happen after some 240 years at most medieval astrologers usually gave 960 as the length of the full cycle , apparently because in some cases it took 240 years to pass from one trigon to the next its effect is most obvious when there is a triangulating aspect of a 3rd planet in any major aspect to the 2 planets which are quincunx any major aspect transit to a given planetary position will also involve the other planet that is in semi-sextile aspect to it it is a mystical aspect that indicates a hidden flow of energy between the planets involved , often involving spiritual or energetic sensitivity and an awareness of inner and more subtle , hidden levels of reality involving the planets in septile aspect astrological symbols hard aspect ( astrology ) soft aspect ( astrology ) applying aspect ( astrology ) conjunction opposition cosmobiology hamburg school of astrology quadrature ( astronomy )

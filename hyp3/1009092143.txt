in intaglio printmaking techniques such as engraving and etching , the artist makes marks into the surface of the plate ( in the case of aquatint , a copper or zinc plate ) that are capable of holding ink the plate is passed through a printing press together with a sheet of paper , and strong pressure applied pushing the paper into the marks , so that a transfer of the ink to the paper occurs like etching , aquatint uses the application of a mordant ( acid ) to etch into the metal plate where etching uses a needle to scratch through an acid-proof resist and make lines , aquatint uses powdered rosin ( resin ) to create a tonal effect the rosin is acid resistant and typically adhered to the plate by controlled heating ; where the grains are will print white , with black areas around griffiths , 89–90 another tonal technique , mezzotint , begins with a plate surface that is evenly indented and roughened so that it will print as an even and fairly dark tone of ink the mezzotint plate is then smoothed and polished to make areas carry less ink and thus print a lighter shade experimentation by several artists with somewhat different techniques reached a peak after about 1750 , and as they were initially very secretive , the history of the emergence of the standard technique remains unclear delafosse in 1766 , working with the amateur jean-claude richard ( often rather misleadingly known as the abbé de saint-non ) in 1766 , and jean-baptiste le prince in 1768–69 it was taken up by the watercolourist paul sandby , who also seems to have introduced technical refinements as well as inventing the name '' aquatint '' in all these areas , a print with etching and aquatint gave very satisfactory results when watercolour was added by relatively low-skilled painters copying a model , with a flat wash of colour on top of the varied tones of the aquatint mayor , 374–376 over the same period in france there was sustained interest in techniques for true colour printing using multiple plates , which used multiple printmaking techniques which often included aquatint ( or mezzotint ) for tone griffiths , 118–119 goya , maker of incontestably the greatest prints using aquatint , probably learned of the technique through giovanni david from genoa , the first significant italian to use it griffiths , 94 in 1891 , mary cassatt , based in paris , exhibited a series of highly original coloured drypoint and aquatint prints , including woman bathing and the coiffure , inspired by an exhibition of japanese woodblock prints shown there the year before an aquatint requires a metal plate , an acid , and something to resist the acid also , aquatints , like mezzotints , provide ease in creating large areas of tone without laborious cross-hatching ; but aquatint plates , it is noted , are generally more durable than mezzotint plates master engraver robert havell used aquatint for john james audubon 's birds of america ( 1826–38 ) la belle assemblée , a british women 's magazine published from 1806 to 1837 had many aquatint colored plates

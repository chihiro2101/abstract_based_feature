in intaglio printmaking techniques such as engraving and etching , the artist makes marks into the surface of the plate ( in the case of aquatint , a copper or zinc plate ) that are capable of holding ink the plate is passed through a printing press together with a sheet of paper , and strong pressure applied pushing the paper into the marks , so that a transfer of the ink to the paper occurs like etching , aquatint uses the application of a mordant ( acid ) to etch into the metal plate where etching uses a needle to scratch through an acid-proof resist and make lines , aquatint uses powdered rosin ( resin ) to create a tonal effect the rosin is acid resistant and typically adhered to the plate by controlled heating ; where the grains are will print white , with black areas around the tonal variation is controlled by the level of mordant exposure over large areas , and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time griffiths , 89–90 another tonal technique , mezzotint , begins with a plate surface that is evenly indented and roughened so that it will print as an even and fairly dark tone of ink the mezzotint plate is then smoothed and polished to make areas carry less ink and thus print a lighter shade occasionally the two techniques of aquatint and mezzotint are combined a variety of early experiments aimed to add tonal effects to etching included the first use of a resin dust ground by the painter and printmaker jan van de velde iv in amsterdam , around 1650 mayor , 374–376 over the same period in france there was sustained interest in techniques for true colour printing using multiple plates , which used multiple printmaking techniques which often included aquatint ( or mezzotint ) for tone goya used it , normally with etching and often burnishing and other techniques , in his great print series los caprichos ( 1799 ) , los desastres de la guerra ( 1810–19 ) , la tauromaquia ( 1816 ) and los disparates ( ca griffiths , 94 in 1891 , mary cassatt , based in paris , exhibited a series of highly original coloured drypoint and aquatint prints , including woman bathing and the coiffure , inspired by an exhibition of japanese woodblock prints shown there the year before now the plate is dipped in acid , producing an even and fine level of corrosion ( the '' bite '' ) sufficient to hold ink this means that , were the plate printed with no further biting , the paper would display a gray color more or less directly in between white ( no ink ) and black ( full ink ) to produce a printing surface using sugar-lift , the artist makes a solution of india ink and sugar by melting sugar into heated ink when the ink/sugar mixture is dry the plate is coated with asphaltum ( liquid ground ) ; the plate is then submerged in warm water which dissolves the sugar so that the image '' lifts off '' the plate francisco goya famously took great advantage of aquatint printmaking , in his los caprichos series ( 1799 ) ; los desastres de la guerra ( 1810–19 ) ; la tauromaquia ( 1816 ) ; and los disparates ( ca

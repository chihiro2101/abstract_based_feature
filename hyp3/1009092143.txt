in intaglio printmaking techniques such as engraving and etching , the artist makes marks into the surface of the plate ( in the case of aquatint , a copper or zinc plate ) that are capable of holding ink like etching , aquatint uses the application of a mordant ( acid ) to etch into the metal plate where etching uses a needle to scratch through an acid-proof resist and make lines , aquatint uses powdered rosin ( resin ) to create a tonal effect the rosin is acid resistant and typically adhered to the plate by controlled heating ; where the grains are will print white , with black areas around the tonal variation is controlled by the level of mordant exposure over large areas , and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time griffiths , 89–90 another tonal technique , mezzotint , begins with a plate surface that is evenly indented and roughened so that it will print as an even and fairly dark tone of ink the mezzotint plate is then smoothed and polished to make areas carry less ink and thus print a lighter shade occasionally the two techniques of aquatint and mezzotint are combined in all these areas , a print with etching and aquatint gave very satisfactory results when watercolour was added by relatively low-skilled painters copying a model , with a flat wash of colour on top of the varied tones of the aquatint mayor , 374–376 over the same period in france there was sustained interest in techniques for true colour printing using multiple plates , which used multiple printmaking techniques which often included aquatint ( or mezzotint ) for tone griffiths , 119 another branch of this french movement mostly used mezzotint for tone and came to specialize in illustrating medical textbooks goya used it , normally with etching and often burnishing and other techniques , in his great print series los caprichos ( 1799 ) , los desastres de la guerra ( 1810–19 ) , la tauromaquia ( 1816 ) and los disparates ( ca griffiths , 94 in 1891 , mary cassatt , based in paris , exhibited a series of highly original coloured drypoint and aquatint prints , including woman bathing and the coiffure , inspired by an exhibition of japanese woodblock prints shown there the year before in her interpretation , she used primarily light , delicate pastel colours and avoided black ( a '' forbidden '' colour among the impressionists ) this means that , were the plate printed with no further biting , the paper would display a gray color more or less directly in between white ( no ink ) and black ( full ink ) also , aquatints , like mezzotints , provide ease in creating large areas of tone without laborious cross-hatching ; but aquatint plates , it is noted , are generally more durable than mezzotint plates etching for many hours ( up to 24 ) will be as dark as etching for one hour , but the deep etch would produce raised ink on the paper master engraver robert havell used aquatint for john james audubon 's birds of america ( 1826–38 )

in intaglio printmaking techniques such as engraving and etching , the artist makes marks into the surface of the plate ( in the case of aquatint , a copper or zinc plate ) that are capable of holding ink where etching uses a needle to scratch through an acid-proof resist and make lines , aquatint uses powdered rosin ( resin ) to create a tonal effect the rosin is acid resistant and typically adhered to the plate by controlled heating ; where the grains are will print white , with black areas around griffiths , 89–90 another tonal technique , mezzotint , begins with a plate surface that is evenly indented and roughened so that it will print as an even and fairly dark tone of ink the mezzotint plate is then smoothed and polished to make areas carry less ink and thus print a lighter shade experimentation by several artists with somewhat different techniques reached a peak after about 1750 , and as they were initially very secretive , the history of the emergence of the standard technique remains unclear griffiths , 94 ; ives ( mma ) though england was to become one of the countries using the technique most , the earliest english aquatints were not exhibited until 1772 , by the cartographer peter perez burdett in england artists such as sandby and thomas gainsborough were attracted by the suitability of etched outlines with aquatint for reproducing the popular english landscape watercolours , which at this period usually also had been given an initial outline drawing in ink publishers of prints and illustrations for expensive books , both important british markets at the time , also adopted the technique griffiths , 94 after the french revolution , one of the most successful publishers in london , the german rudolf ackermann , had numbers of french refugees working on the floor above his shop in the strand in london , each brushing a single colour and then passing the sheet down a long table mayor , 374–376 over the same period in france there was sustained interest in techniques for true colour printing using multiple plates , which used multiple printmaking techniques which often included aquatint ( or mezzotint ) for tone griffiths , 119 another branch of this french movement mostly used mezzotint for tone and came to specialize in illustrating medical textbooks griffiths , 118–119 goya , maker of incontestably the greatest prints using aquatint , probably learned of the technique through giovanni david from genoa , the first significant italian to use it after a period of several decades in the central 19th century when the technique was little used , and definitively superseded for commercial uses , mayor , 612–614 it was revived near the end of the century in france , by édouard manet , félicien rops , degas , pissarro , jacques villon and other artists griffiths , 94 in 1891 , mary cassatt , based in paris , exhibited a series of highly original coloured drypoint and aquatint prints , including woman bathing and the coiffure , inspired by an exhibition of japanese woodblock prints shown there the year before also , aquatints , like mezzotints , provide ease in creating large areas of tone without laborious cross-hatching ; but aquatint plates , it is noted , are generally more durable than mezzotint plates master engraver robert havell used aquatint for john james audubon 's birds of america ( 1826–38 ) david hockney , known for his many paintings of the los angeles lifestyle in the 1960s , has created a number of aquatints and etchings used with color in his '' the blue guitar '' series of prints

gorlois conducts the war from the castle of dimilioc but places his wife in safety in tintagel castle geoffrey does not say , and later accounts disagree , as to whether gorlois died before or after arthur was begotten ( something that might be important in determining whether or not a child could be made legitimate by a later marriage to its true father ) according to geoffrey , igraine also bore a daughter , anna , to uther pendragon , and this anna later becoming the mother of gawain and mordred yet geoffrey also refers to king hoel of brittany as arthur 's nephew and presents a prophecy that to uther 's daughter will be born a line of seven kings , something true if hoel is anna 's son , but not true if only gawain or mordred are anna 's sons in robert de boron 's poem merlin , igraine 's previous husband is an unnamed duke of tintagel and it is by him that she becomes the mother of two unnamed daughters a second daughter , also unnamed in some variants but in some named morgaine , is married to king nentres of garlot , who is identified with budic ii of brittany a third illegitimate daughter of the duke of tintagel is sent to a school and there learns so much she becomes the great sorceress morgan le fay ( no other medieval accounts state that morgan is illegitimate and therefore , as in this version , arthur 's stepsister ) in other accounts ywain is not arthur 's nephew , although sometimes he is gawain 's cousin when their respective fathers are presented as brothers le morte d'arthur names the first daughter morgause , the second elayne and the third morgan ( with no mention of morgan 's illegitimacy ) in chr√©tien de troyes ' perceval , the story of the grail she and her daughter gawain 's mother are discovered by gawain in an enchanted castle named the castle of marvels , after he had thought both his mother and grandmother to be long dead

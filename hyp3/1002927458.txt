a cryptic story in the babylonian talmud states , mystics assert that the biblical patriarch abraham used the same method to create the calf prepared for the three angels who foretold sarah 's pregnancy in the biblical account at genesis 18:7 all the miraculous creations attributed to other rabbis of the talmudic era are ascribed by rabbinic commentators to the use of the same book sefer yetzirahs appendix ( 6:15 ) declares that abraham was the recipient of the divine revelation of mystic lore ; so that the rabbis of the classical rabbinic era see hai gaon in the responsum cited in '' kerem ḥemed , '' viii 57 and philosophers as saadia gaon , shabbethai donnolo , and judah halevi kuzari , never doubted that abraham was the author of the book jewish encyclopedia bibliography : editions and translations : editio princeps : mantua , 1562 ;

and although there is a marked difference between the later kabbalah and the sefer yetzirah ( for instance , the sefirot of the kabbalists do not correspond to those of the sefer yetzirah ) , the system laid down in the latter is the first visible link in the development of kabbalistic ideas the book describes how god used the 10 sefirot and the 22 hebrew letters in various combinations , and finally ( as described in the closing section of the book ) , how he revealed this secret to abraham as a covenant with him 1 ) besides these three letters , which are called '' mothers , '' a distinction is also drawn between the seven '' double '' letters , which have two different sounds according to inflection , and the twelve '' simple '' letters , the remaining characters of the alphabet which represent only one sound each the three seasons of the year , winter , summer , and the rainy season , correspond to water , fire , and ruach in the same way as man consists of a head ( corresponding to fire ) , torso ( represented by ruach ) , and the other parts of the body ( equivalent to water ) to harmonize the biblical statement of the creation '' ex nihilo '' with the doctrine of the primordial elements , the sefer yetzirah assumes a double creation , one ideal and the other real again , as the numbers from two to ten are derived from the number one , so the ten sefirot are derived from one '' their end is fixed in their beginning , as the flame is bound to the coal '' ( i as the sefer yetzirah divides the hebrew alphabet into three groups , so the gnostic marcus divided the greek letters into three classes , regarded by him as the symbolic emanations of the three powers which include the whole number of the upper elements the remaining six sefirot , or the limitations of space by the three dimensions in a twofold direction , are also found in the clementina , where god is described as the boundary of the universe and as the source of the six infinite dimensions the quran speaks of a holy book by the name of the scrolls of abraham , although most muslims believe this book to have long perished

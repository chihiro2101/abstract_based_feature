all the miraculous creations attributed to other rabbis of the talmudic era are ascribed by rabbinic commentators to the use of the same book sefer yetzirahs appendix ( 6:15 ) declares that abraham was the recipient of the divine revelation of mystic lore ; so that the rabbis of the classical rabbinic era see hai gaon in the responsum cited in '' kerem á¸¥emed , '' viii 57 and philosophers as saadia gaon , shabbethai donnolo , and judah halevi kuzari , never doubted that abraham was the author of the book kritisch redigirter text , frankfort-on-the-main , 1894 ( the edition , however , by no means represents a critical text ) jewish lore attributes it to adam , and that '' from adam it passed over to noah , and then to abraham , the friend of god '' in a manuscript in the british museum , the sefer yetzirah is called the hilkot yetzirah and declared to be esoteric lore not accessible to anyone but the really pious see margoliouth , '' catalogue of the hebrew and samaritan manuscripts of the british museum , '' part ii some scholars believe it might have an early medieval origin , while others emphasize earlier traditions appearing in the book ( 1997 ) sefer yetzirah ; the book of creation in theory and practice , san francisco , weiser books seven doubled letters bgd kfrt : on the doubled reish and on the background of sefer yetzirah , yehudah liebes , footnote 9 and associated text benton , the hebrew grammatical form places its origin closer to the period of the mishnah , around the 2nd century ce the division of the letters into the three classes of vowels , mutes , and sonants also appears in hellenic texts the editio princeps ( mantua , 1562 ) contains two recensions , which were used in the main by the commentators of the book as early as the middle of the 10th century the sefer yetzirah is devoted to speculations concerning god 's creation of the world the ascription of its authorship to the biblical patriarch abraham shows the high esteem which it enjoyed for centuries hence there is a wide divergence of opinion regarding the age , origin , contents , and value of the book the history of the study of the sefer yetzirah is one of the most interesting in the records of jewish literature instead of the immediate creation ex nihilo , both works postulate a series of emanations of mediums between god and the universe ; and both consider god as the first cause only , and not as the immediate efficient cause of the world a book of the same name was circulated among the ashkenazi hasidim between the 11th and 13th centuries , for whom it became a source of practical kabbalah the book describes how god used the 10 sefirot and the 22 hebrew letters in various combinations , and finally ( as described in the closing section of the book ) , how he revealed this secret to abraham as a covenant with him hence the formation of the letters is described as follows : with the tip of the tongue and the throat between the lips and the tip of the tongue in the middle of the tongue by the tip of the tongue by the tongue , which lies flat and stretched , and by the teeth ( ii 1 ) besides these three letters , which are called '' mothers , '' a distinction is also drawn between the seven '' double '' letters , which have two different sounds according to inflection , and the twelve '' simple '' letters , the remaining characters of the alphabet which represent only one sound each the linguistic theories of the author of the sefer yetzirah are an integral component of its philosophy , its other parts being astrological and gnostic cosmogony the three letters aleph , mem , shin , are not only the three '' mothers '' from which the other letters of the alphabet are formed , but they are also symbolical figures for the three primordial elements , the substances which underlie all existence in the beginning , however , these three substances had only a potential existence , and came into actual being only by means of the three letters aleph , mem , shin ; and as these are the principal parts of speech , so those three substances are the elements from which the cosmos has been formed the cosmos consists of three parts , the world , the year ( or time ) , and man , which are combined in such a way that the three primordial elements are contained in each of the three categories in addition to the doctrine of the sefirot and the letters , the theory of contrasts in nature , or of the syzygies ( '' pairs '' ) , as they are called by the gnostics , occupies a prominent place in the sefer yetzirah as the sefer yetzirah divides the hebrew alphabet into three groups , so the gnostic marcus divided the greek letters into three classes , regarded by him as the symbolic emanations of the three powers which include the whole number of the upper elements

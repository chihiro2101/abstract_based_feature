a cryptic story in the babylonian talmud states , mystics assert that the biblical patriarch abraham used the same method to create the calf prepared for the three angels who foretold sarah 's pregnancy in the biblical account at genesis 18:7 all the miraculous creations attributed to other rabbis of the talmudic era are ascribed by rabbinic commentators to the use of the same book sefer yetzirahs appendix ( 6:15 ) declares that abraham was the recipient of the divine revelation of mystic lore ; so that the rabbis of the classical rabbinic era see hai gaon in the responsum cited in '' kerem ḥemed , '' viii 57 and philosophers as saadia gaon , shabbethai donnolo , and judah halevi kuzari , never doubted that abraham was the author of the book kritisch redigirter text , frankfort-on-the-main , 1894 ( the edition , however , by no means represents a critical text ) translations : latin : postell , abraham patriarchœ liber iezirah , paris , 1552 ; pistor , liber de creatione , in ars cabalistica , basel , 1587 ; rittangel in the amsterdam edition of 1642 ; german : johann f see margoliouth , '' catalogue of the hebrew and samaritan manuscripts of the british museum , '' part ii according to modern historians , the origin of the text is unknown , and hotly debated ( 1997 ) sefer yetzirah ; the book of creation in theory and practice , san francisco , weiser books seven doubled letters bgd kfrt : on the doubled reish and on the background of sefer yetzirah , yehudah liebes , footnote 9 and associated text the historical origin of the sefer yetzirah was placed by richard august reitzenstein in the 2nd century bce the division of the letters into the three classes of vowels , mutes , and sonants also appears in hellenic texts the date and origin of the book can not be definitely determined so long as there is no critical text of it the editio princeps ( mantua , 1562 ) contains two recensions , which were used in the main by the commentators of the book as early as the middle of the 10th century ) was annotated by dunash ibn tamim or by jacob ben nissim , while saadia gaon and shabbethai donnolo wrote commentaries on the longer recension ( mantua ii the short version comprises about 1300 words while the long version about twice that in the 10th century , saadia gaon wrote his commentary based on a manuscript which was a reorganized copy of the longer version , now called the '' saadia version '' the sefer yetzirah is devoted to speculations concerning god 's creation of the world it may even be said that this work had a greater influence on the development of the jewish mind than almost any other book after the completion of the talmud the difficulty is rendered still greater by the lack of a critical edition , the present text being much interpolated and altered the history of the study of the sefer yetzirah is one of the most interesting in the records of jewish literature a book of the same name was circulated among the ashkenazi hasidim between the 11th and 13th centuries , for whom it became a source of practical kabbalah the book describes how god used the 10 sefirot and the 22 hebrew letters in various combinations , and finally ( as described in the closing section of the book ) , how he revealed this secret to abraham as a covenant with him the three letters aleph , mem , shin , are not only the three '' mothers '' from which the other letters of the alphabet are formed , but they are also symbolical figures for the three primordial elements , the substances which underlie all existence to harmonize the biblical statement of the creation '' ex nihilo '' with the doctrine of the primordial elements , the sefer yetzirah assumes a double creation , one ideal and the other real the sefer yetzirah shows how the sephirot are a creation of god and the will of god in its varied manifestations the explanation on this point is obscure since the relation of the twenty-two letters to the ten sefirot is not clearly defined the quran speaks of a holy book by the name of the scrolls of abraham , although most muslims believe this book to have long perished

the english word '' chitin '' comes from the french word chitine , which was derived in 1821 from the greek word χιτών ( khitōn ) meaning covering chitin is a modified polysaccharide that contains nitrogen ; it is synthesized from units of n-acetylglucosamine ( to be precise , 2- ( acetylamino ) -2-deoxy- d -glucose ) combined with calcium carbonate , as in the shells of crustaceans and molluscs , chitin produces a much stronger composite in butterfly wing scales , chitin is organized into stacks of gyroids constructed of chitin photonic crystals that produce various iridescent colors serving phenotype signaling and communication for mating and foraging chitosan is produced commercially by deacetylation of chitin ; chitosan is soluble in water , while chitin is not chitin is sensed mostly in the lungs or gastrointestinal tract where it can activate the innate immune system through eosinophils or macrophages , as well as an adaptive immune response through t helper cells keratinocytes in skin can also react to chitin or chitin fragments the immune response can sometimes clear the chitin and its associated organism , but sometimes the immune response is pathological and becomes an allergy ; allergy to house dust mites is thought to be driven by a response to chitin plants also have receptors that can cause a response to chitin , namely chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 and chitin elicitor-binding protein chitin and chitosan have been explored as a vaccine adjuvant due to its ability to stimulate an immune response in 2020 , chitin was proposed for use in building structures , tools , and other solid objects from a composite material of chitin combined with martian soil

the structure of chitin was determined by albert hofmann in 1929 chitin is a modified polysaccharide that contains nitrogen ; it is synthesized from units of n-acetylglucosamine ( to be precise , 2- ( acetylamino ) -2-deoxy- d -glucose ) these units form covalent β- ( 1→4 ) -linkages ( like the linkages between glucose units forming cellulose ) therefore , chitin may be described as cellulose with one hydroxyl group on each monomer replaced with an acetyl amine group combined with calcium carbonate , as in the shells of crustaceans and molluscs , chitin produces a much stronger composite this composite material is much harder and stiffer than pure chitin , and is tougher and less brittle than pure calcium carbonate chitosan is produced commercially by deacetylation of chitin ; chitosan is soluble in water , while chitin is not humans and other mammals have chitinase and chi3l1 that can degrade chitin ; they also possess several immune receptors that can recognize chitin and its degradation products in a pathogen-associated molecular pattern , initiating an immune response plants also have receptors that can cause a response to chitin , namely chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 and chitin elicitor-binding protein in 2020 , chitin was proposed for use in building structures , tools , and other solid objects from a composite material of chitin combined with martian soil in this scenario , the biopolymers in the chitin act as the binder for the regolith aggregate to form a concrete-like composite material

the english word '' chitin '' comes from the french word chitine , which was derived in 1821 from the greek word χιτών ( khitōn ) meaning covering chitin is a modified polysaccharide that contains nitrogen ; it is synthesized from units of n-acetylglucosamine ( to be precise , 2- ( acetylamino ) -2-deoxy- d -glucose ) these units form covalent β- ( 1→4 ) -linkages ( like the linkages between glucose units forming cellulose ) image : lyristes plebejus.jpg thumb right a cicada emerges from its chitinous larval exoskeleton combined with calcium carbonate , as in the shells of crustaceans and molluscs , chitin produces a much stronger composite chitosan is produced commercially by deacetylation of chitin ; chitosan is soluble in water , while chitin is not humans and other mammals have chitinase and chi3l1 that can degrade chitin ; they also possess several immune receptors that can recognize chitin and its degradation products in a pathogen-associated molecular pattern , initiating an immune response the immune response can sometimes clear the chitin and its associated organism , but sometimes the immune response is pathological and becomes an allergy ; allergy to house dust mites is thought to be driven by a response to chitin plants also have receptors that can cause a response to chitin , namely chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 and chitin elicitor-binding protein chitin and chitosan have been explored as a vaccine adjuvant due to its ability to stimulate an immune response in 2020 , chitin was proposed for use in building structures , tools , and other solid objects from a composite material of chitin combined with martian soil

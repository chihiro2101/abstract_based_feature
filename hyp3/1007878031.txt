the english word '' chitin '' comes from the french word chitine , which was derived in 1821 from the greek word χιτών ( khitōn ) meaning covering the structure of chitin was determined by albert hofmann in 1929 chitin is a modified polysaccharide that contains nitrogen ; it is synthesized from units of n-acetylglucosamine ( to be precise , 2- ( acetylamino ) -2-deoxy- d -glucose ) these units form covalent β- ( 1→4 ) -linkages ( like the linkages between glucose units forming cellulose ) therefore , chitin may be described as cellulose with one hydroxyl group on each monomer replaced with an acetyl amine group image : lyristes plebejus.jpg thumb right a cicada emerges from its chitinous larval exoskeleton in its pure , unmodified form , chitin is translucent , pliable , resilient , and quite tough combined with calcium carbonate , as in the shells of crustaceans and molluscs , chitin produces a much stronger composite chitosan is produced commercially by deacetylation of chitin ; chitosan is soluble in water , while chitin is not keratinocytes in skin can also react to chitin or chitin fragments scales from fish , exoskeletons from crustaceans and insects , etc

the english word '' chitin '' comes from the french word chitine , which was derived in 1821 from the greek word χιτών ( khitōn ) meaning covering the structure of chitin was determined by albert hofmann in 1929 hofmann hydrolyzed chitin using a crude preparation of the enzyme chitinase , which he obtained from the snail helix pomatia chitin is a modified polysaccharide that contains nitrogen ; it is synthesized from units of n-acetylglucosamine ( to be precise , 2- ( acetylamino ) -2-deoxy- d -glucose ) these units form covalent β- ( 1→4 ) -linkages ( like the linkages between glucose units forming cellulose ) this composite material is much harder and stiffer than pure chitin , and is tougher and less brittle than pure calcium carbonate chitosan is produced commercially by deacetylation of chitin ; chitosan is soluble in water , while chitin is not keratinocytes in skin can also react to chitin or chitin fragments according to in vitro studies , chitin is sensed by receptors , such as fibcd1 , klrb1 , reg3g , toll-like receptor 2 , clec7a , and mannose receptors plants also have receptors that can cause a response to chitin , namely chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 and chitin elicitor-binding protein in 2020 , chitin was proposed for use in building structures , tools , and other solid objects from a composite material of chitin combined with martian soil

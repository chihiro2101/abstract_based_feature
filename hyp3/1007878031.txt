the structure of chitin was determined by albert hofmann in 1929 chitin is a modified polysaccharide that contains nitrogen ; it is synthesized from units of n-acetylglucosamine ( to be precise , 2- ( acetylamino ) -2-deoxy- d -glucose ) these units form covalent β- ( 1→4 ) -linkages ( like the linkages between glucose units forming cellulose ) in its pure , unmodified form , chitin is translucent , pliable , resilient , and quite tough combined with calcium carbonate , as in the shells of crustaceans and molluscs , chitin produces a much stronger composite this composite material is much harder and stiffer than pure chitin , and is tougher and less brittle than pure calcium carbonate keratinocytes in skin can also react to chitin or chitin fragments plants also have receptors that can cause a response to chitin , namely chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 and chitin elicitor-binding protein chitin is a good inducer of plant defense mechanisms for controlling diseases chitin and chitosan have been explored as a vaccine adjuvant due to its ability to stimulate an immune response in 2020 , chitin was proposed for use in building structures , tools , and other solid objects from a composite material of chitin combined with martian soil

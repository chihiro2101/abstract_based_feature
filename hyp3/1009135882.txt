complex technical drawings were made in renaissance times , such as the drawings of leonardo da vinci modern engineering drawing , with its precise conventions of orthographic projection and scale , arose in france at a time when the industrial revolution was in its infancy says of his father , marc isambard brunel , that '' it seems fairly certain that marc 's drawings of his portsmouth block mills ( in 1799 ) made a contribution to british engineering technique much greater than the machines they represented for it is safe to assume that he had mastered the art of presenting three-dimensional objects in a two-dimensional plane which we now call mechanical drawing engineering drawings specify requirements of a component or assembly which can be complicated standardization also aids internationalization , because people from different countries who speak different languages can read the same engineering drawing , and interpret it the same way one major set of engineering drawing standards is asme y14.5 and y14.5m ( most recently revised in 2009 ) in 2011 , a new revision of iso 8015 ( geometrical product specifications ( gps ) — fundamentals — concepts , principles and rules ) was published containing the invocation principle '' it also goes on to state that marking a drawing '' tolerancing iso 8015 '' is optional the implication of this is that any drawing using iso symbols can only be interpreted to iso gps rules for centuries , until the post-world war ii era , all engineering drawing was done manually by using pencil and pen on paper or other substrate ( e.g since the advent of computer-aided design ( cad ) , engineering drawing has been done more and more in the electronic medium with each passing decade today most engineering drawing is done with cad , but pencil and paper have not entirely disappeared some of the technical drawing tools include pencils , pens and their ink , straightedges , t-squares , french curves , triangles , rulers , protractors , dividers , compasses , scales , erasers , and tacks or push pins the english idiom '' to go back to the drawing board '' , which is a figurative phrase meaning to rethink something altogether , was inspired by the literal act of discovering design errors during production and returning to a drawing board to revise the engineering drawing the simplest dimensioning system just specifies distances between points ( such as an object 's length or width , or hole center locations ) since the advent of well-developed interchangeable parts , these distances have been accompanied by tolerances of the plus-or-minus or min-and-max-limit types , rectangular-only tolerance zones , tolerance stacking ) to allow the most logical tolerancing of both geometry and dimensions ( that is , both form shapes/locations and sizes ) drawings convey the following critical information : geometry – the shape of the object ; represented as views ; how the object will look when it is viewed from various angles , such as front , top , side , etc center – are alternately long- and short-dashed lines that may be used to represent the axes of circular features section – are thin lines in a pattern ( pattern determined by the material being '' cut '' or '' sectioned '' ) used to indicate surfaces in section views resulting from '' cutting '' section lines are commonly referred to as '' cross-hatching '' phantom – ( not shown ) are alternately long- and double short-dashed thin lines used to represent a feature or component that is not part of the specified part or assembly billet ends that may be used for testing , or the machined product that is the focus of a tooling drawing type a lines show the outline of the feature of an object type b lines are dimension lines and are used for dimensioning , projecting , extending , or leaders 2h pencil type d lines are similar to type c , except these are zigzagged and only for longer breaks 2h pencil type f lines are type e lines , except these are used for drawings in electrotechnology these are dotted lines , but a long line of 10–20 & nbsp ; mm , then a 1 & nbsp ; mm gap , then a small line of 2 & nbsp ; mm these are drawn with a long line of 10–20 & nbsp ; mm , then a small gap , then a small line of 2 & nbsp ; mm , then a gap , then another small line a multiview projection is a type of orthographic projection that shows the object as it looks from the front , right , left , top , bottom , or back ( e.g the primary views ) , and is typically positioned relative to each other according to the rules of either multiview projection the origin and vector direction of the projectors ( also called projection lines ) differs , as explained below the views of the 3d object are like the panels of a box that envelopes the object , and the panels pivot as they open up flat into the plane of the drawing generally only as many views are used as are necessary to convey all needed information clearly and economically in addition to the six principal views ( front , back , top , bottom , right side , left side ) , any auxiliary views or sections may be included as serve the purposes of part definition and its communication sometimes a note tells the reader in which zone ( s ) of the drawing to find the view or section 2009 these views are typically used when an object contains some sort of inclined plane auxiliary views tend to make use of axonometric projection an isometric projection shows the object from angles in which the scales along each axis of the object are equal in both oblique projection and orthographic projection , parallel lines of the source object produce parallel lines in the projected image and yet , on the other hand , there is another general principle of engineering drawing that nearly diametrically opposes all this effort and intent—that is , the principle that users are not to scale the drawing to infer a dimension not labeled technical lettering is the process of forming letters , numerals , and other characters in technical drawing an engineering drawing is a legal document ( that is , a legal instrument ) , because it communicates all the needed information about '' what is wanted '' to the people who will expend resources turning the idea into a reality thus today it is often the case that the information travels from the mind of the designer into the manufactured component without having ever been codified by an engineering drawing

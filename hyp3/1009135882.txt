technical drawing has existed since ancient times modern engineering drawing , with its precise conventions of orthographic projection and scale , arose in france at a time when the industrial revolution was in its infancy rolt 's biography of isambard kingdom brunel for it is safe to assume that he had mastered the art of presenting three-dimensional objects in a two-dimensional plane which we now call mechanical drawing engineering drawings specify requirements of a component or assembly which can be complicated standardization also aids internationalization , because people from different countries who speak different languages can read the same engineering drawing , and interpret it the same way one major set of engineering drawing standards is asme y14.5 and y14.5m ( most recently revised in 2009 ) these apply widely in the united states , although iso 8015 ( geometrical product specifications ( gps ) — fundamentals — concepts , principles and rules ) is now also important '' it also goes on to state that marking a drawing '' tolerancing iso 8015 '' is optional the implication of this is that any drawing using iso symbols can only be interpreted to iso gps rules for centuries , until the post-world war ii era , all engineering drawing was done manually by using pencil and pen on paper or other substrate ( e.g since the advent of computer-aided design ( cad ) , engineering drawing has been done more and more in the electronic medium with each passing decade today most engineering drawing is done with cad , but pencil and paper have not entirely disappeared some of the technical drawing tools include pencils , pens and their ink , straightedges , t-squares , french curves , triangles , rulers , protractors , dividers , compasses , scales , erasers , and tacks or push pins ( slide rules used to number among the supplies , too , but nowadays even manual drafting , when it occurs , benefits from a pocket calculator or its onscreen equivalent drafting machines are devices that aid manual drafting by combining drawing boards , straightedges , pantographs , and other tools into one integrated drawing environment producing drawings usually involves creating an original that is then reproduced , generating multiple copies to be distributed to the shop floor , vendors , company archives , and so on to mean any paper copy of an engineering drawing almost all engineering drawings ( except perhaps reference-only views or initial sketches ) communicate not only geometry ( shape and location ) but also dimensions and tolerances for those characteristics the simplest dimensioning system just specifies distances between points ( such as an object 's length or width , or hole center locations ) , rectangular-only tolerance zones , tolerance stacking ) to allow the most logical tolerancing of both geometry and dimensions ( that is , both form shapes/locations and sizes ) drawings convey the following critical information : geometry – the shape of the object ; represented as views ; how the object will look when it is viewed from various angles , such as front , top , side , etc a variety of line styles graphically represent physical objects types of lines include the following : visible – are continuous lines used to depict edges directly visible from a particular angle hidden – are short-dashed lines that may be used to represent edges that are not directly visible billet ends that may be used for testing , or the machined product that is the focus of a tooling drawing lines can also be classified by a letter classification in which each line is given a letter type a lines show the outline of the feature of an object they are the thickest lines on a drawing and done with a pencil softer than hb type b lines are dimension lines and are used for dimensioning , projecting , extending , or leaders type c lines are used for breaks when the whole object is not shown 2h pencil type d lines are similar to type c , except these are zigzagged and only for longer breaks 2h pencil type f lines are type e lines , except these are used for drawings in electrotechnology 2h pencil type k lines indicate the alternate positions of an object and the line taken by that object these are drawn with a long line of 10–20 & nbsp ; mm , then a small gap , then a small line of 2 & nbsp ; mm , then a gap , then another small line in most cases , a single view is not sufficient to show all necessary features , and several views are used the 3d object is projected into 2d '' paper '' space as if you were looking at a radiograph of the object : the top view is under the front view , the right view is at the left of the front view the views of the 3d object are like the panels of a box that envelopes the object , and the panels pivot as they open up flat into the plane of the drawing third-angle projection is primarily used in the united states and canada , where it is the default projection system according to asme standard asme y14.3m circa world war i , british practice was frequently mixing the use of both projection methods the true size and shape of any feature in an engineering drawing can only be known when the line of sight ( los ) is perpendicular to the plane being referenced engineering drawings use a sans-serif script , formed by a series of short strokes the field of the drawing ( f/d , fd ) is the main body or main area of the drawing , excluding the title block , rev block , p/l and so on here is an example of an engineering drawing ( an isometric view of the same object is shown above ) for centuries , engineering drawing was the sole method of transferring information from design into manufacture

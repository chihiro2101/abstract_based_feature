technical drawing has existed since ancient times complex technical drawings were made in renaissance times , such as the drawings of leonardo da vinci modern engineering drawing , with its precise conventions of orthographic projection and scale , arose in france at a time when the industrial revolution was in its infancy for it is safe to assume that he had mastered the art of presenting three-dimensional objects in a two-dimensional plane which we now call mechanical drawing engineering drawings specify requirements of a component or assembly which can be complicated standardization also aids internationalization , because people from different countries who speak different languages can read the same engineering drawing , and interpret it the same way one major set of engineering drawing standards is asme y14.5 and y14.5m ( most recently revised in 2009 ) these apply widely in the united states , although iso 8015 ( geometrical product specifications ( gps ) — fundamentals — concepts , principles and rules ) is now also important in 2011 , a new revision of iso 8015 ( geometrical product specifications ( gps ) — fundamentals — concepts , principles and rules ) was published containing the invocation principle this states that , '' once a portion of the iso geometric product specification ( gps ) system is invoked in a mechanical engineering product documentation , the entire iso gps system is invoked '' it also goes on to state that marking a drawing '' tolerancing iso 8015 '' is optional the implication of this is that any drawing using iso symbols can only be interpreted to iso gps rules for centuries , until the post-world war ii era , all engineering drawing was done manually by using pencil and pen on paper or other substrate ( e.g since the advent of computer-aided design ( cad ) , engineering drawing has been done more and more in the electronic medium with each passing decade today most engineering drawing is done with cad , but pencil and paper have not entirely disappeared drafting machines are devices that aid manual drafting by combining drawing boards , straightedges , pantographs , and other tools into one integrated drawing environment almost all engineering drawings ( except perhaps reference-only views or initial sketches ) communicate not only geometry ( shape and location ) but also dimensions and tolerances for those characteristics drawings convey the following critical information : geometry – the shape of the object ; represented as views ; how the object will look when it is viewed from various angles , such as front , top , side , etc dimensions – the size of the object is captured in accepted units for example , a mass-marketed product usually requires a much higher surface quality than , say , a component that goes inside industrial machinery types of lines include the following : visible – are continuous lines used to depict edges directly visible from a particular angle center – are alternately long- and short-dashed lines that may be used to represent the axes of circular features lines can also be classified by a letter classification in which each line is given a letter type a lines show the outline of the feature of an object they are the thickest lines on a drawing and done with a pencil softer than hb type c lines are used for breaks when the whole object is not shown 2h pencil type e lines indicate hidden outlines of internal features of an object 2h pencil type g lines are used for centre lines these are drawn with a long line of 10–20 & nbsp ; mm , then a small gap , then a small line of 2 & nbsp ; mm , then a gap , then another small line in most cases , a single view is not sufficient to show all necessary features , and several views are used the primary views ) , and is typically positioned relative to each other according to the rules of either multiview projection in first-angle projection , the parallel projectors originate as if radiated from behind the viewer and pass through the 3d object to project a 2d image onto the orthogonal plane behind it in third-angle projection , the parallel projectors originate as if radiated from the far side of the object and pass through the 3d object to project a 2d image onto the orthogonal plane in front of it thus the left view is placed on the left and the top view on the top ; and the features closest to the front of the 3d object will appear closest to the front view in the drawing but any combination of views may be used depending on the needs of the particular design view lines or section lines ( lines with arrows marked '' a-a '' , '' b-b '' , etc sometimes a note tells the reader in which zone ( s ) of the drawing to find the view or section using the auxiliary view allows for that inclined plane ( and any other significant features ) to be projected in their true size and shape the true size and shape of any feature in an engineering drawing can only be known when the line of sight ( los ) is perpendicular to the plane being referenced projected views ( either auxiliary or multiview ) which show a cross section of the source object along the specified cut plane plans are usually '' scale drawings '' , meaning that the plans are drawn at specific ratio relative to the actual size of the place or object it is used to describe , or provide detailed specifications for an object as in many technical fields , a wide array of abbreviations and symbols have been developed in engineering drawing during the 20th and 21st centuries here is an example of an engineering drawing ( an isometric view of the same object is shown above ) these workers often use drawings in the course of their work that have been produced from the mbd dataset

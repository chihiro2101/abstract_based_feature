technical drawing has existed since ancient times complex technical drawings were made in renaissance times , such as the drawings of leonardo da vinci modern engineering drawing , with its precise conventions of orthographic projection and scale , arose in france at a time when the industrial revolution was in its infancy for it is safe to assume that he had mastered the art of presenting three-dimensional objects in a two-dimensional plane which we now call mechanical drawing engineering drawings specify requirements of a component or assembly which can be complicated standardization also aids internationalization , because people from different countries who speak different languages can read the same engineering drawing , and interpret it the same way one major set of engineering drawing standards is asme y14.5 and y14.5m ( most recently revised in 2009 ) the implication of this is that any drawing using iso symbols can only be interpreted to iso gps rules britain , bs 8888 ( technical product specification ) has undergone important updates in the 2010s since the advent of computer-aided design ( cad ) , engineering drawing has been done more and more in the electronic medium with each passing decade today most engineering drawing is done with cad , but pencil and paper have not entirely disappeared ( slide rules used to number among the supplies , too , but nowadays even manual drafting , when it occurs , benefits from a pocket calculator or its onscreen equivalent ) and of course the tools also include drawing boards ( drafting boards ) or tables producing drawings usually involves creating an original that is then reproduced , generating multiple copies to be distributed to the shop floor , vendors , company archives , and so on in the case of cad drawings , the original is the cad file , and the printouts of that file are the '' prints '' coordinate dimensioning involves defining all points , lines , planes , and profiles in terms of cartesian coordinates , with a common origin , rectangular-only tolerance zones , tolerance stacking ) to allow the most logical tolerancing of both geometry and dimensions ( that is , both form shapes/locations and sizes ) dimensions – the size of the object is captured in accepted units types of lines include the following : visible – are continuous lines used to depict edges directly visible from a particular angle hidden – are short-dashed lines that may be used to represent edges that are not directly visible center – are alternately long- and short-dashed lines that may be used to represent the axes of circular features cutting plane – are thin , medium-dashed lines , or thick alternately long- and double short-dashed that may be used to define sections for section views section lines are commonly referred to as '' cross-hatching '' phantom – ( not shown ) are alternately long- and double short-dashed thin lines used to represent a feature or component that is not part of the specified part or assembly billet ends that may be used for testing , or the machined product that is the focus of a tooling drawing lines can also be classified by a letter classification in which each line is given a letter they are the thickest lines on a drawing and done with a pencil softer than hb type b lines are dimension lines and are used for dimensioning , projecting , extending , or leaders type c lines are used for breaks when the whole object is not shown in most cases , a single view is not sufficient to show all necessary features , and several views are used a multiview projection is a type of orthographic projection that shows the object as it looks from the front , right , left , top , bottom , or back ( e.g the primary views ) , and is typically positioned relative to each other according to the rules of either multiview projection the origin and vector direction of the projectors ( also called projection lines ) differs , as explained below the 3d object is projected into 2d '' paper '' space as if you were looking at a radiograph of the object : the top view is under the front view , the right view is at the left of the front view first-angle projection is the iso 128 and is primarily used in europe thus the left view is placed on the left and the top view on the top ; and the features closest to the front of the 3d object will appear closest to the front view in the drawing but circa the 1890s , third-angle projection spread throughout the north american engineering and manufacturing communities to the point of becoming a widely followed convention , and it was an asa standard by the 1950s as shown above , the determination of what surface constitutes the front , back , top , and bottom varies depending on the projection method used generally only as many views are used as are necessary to convey all needed information clearly and economically but any combination of views may be used depending on the needs of the particular design '' the service of this goal is what creates a drawing that one even could scale and get an accurate dimension thereby and the metric technical pens were chosen in sizes so that one could add detail or drafting changes with a pen width changing by approximately a factor of the square root of 2 the field of the drawing ( f/d , fd ) is the main body or main area of the drawing , excluding the title block , rev block , p/l and so on here is an example of an engineering drawing ( an isometric view of the same object is shown above ) thus today it is often the case that the information travels from the mind of the designer into the manufactured component without having ever been codified by an engineering drawing

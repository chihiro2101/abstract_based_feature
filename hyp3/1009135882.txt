technical drawing has existed since ancient times complex technical drawings were made in renaissance times , such as the drawings of leonardo da vinci modern engineering drawing , with its precise conventions of orthographic projection and scale , arose in france at a time when the industrial revolution was in its infancy for it is safe to assume that he had mastered the art of presenting three-dimensional objects in a two-dimensional plane which we now call mechanical drawing engineering drawings specify requirements of a component or assembly which can be complicated standardization also aids internationalization , because people from different countries who speak different languages can read the same engineering drawing , and interpret it the same way one major set of engineering drawing standards is asme y14.5 and y14.5m ( most recently revised in 2009 ) this states that , '' once a portion of the iso geometric product specification ( gps ) system is invoked in a mechanical engineering product documentation , the entire iso gps system is invoked the implication of this is that any drawing using iso symbols can only be interpreted to iso gps rules britain , bs 8888 ( technical product specification ) has undergone important updates in the 2010s since the advent of computer-aided design ( cad ) , engineering drawing has been done more and more in the electronic medium with each passing decade today most engineering drawing is done with cad , but pencil and paper have not entirely disappeared drafting machines are devices that aid manual drafting by combining drawing boards , straightedges , pantographs , and other tools into one integrated drawing environment to mean any paper copy of an engineering drawing in the case of cad drawings , the original is the cad file , and the printouts of that file are the '' prints '' almost all engineering drawings ( except perhaps reference-only views or initial sketches ) communicate not only geometry ( shape and location ) but also dimensions and tolerances for those characteristics drawings convey the following critical information : geometry – the shape of the object ; represented as views ; how the object will look when it is viewed from various angles , such as front , top , side , etc for example , a mass-marketed product usually requires a much higher surface quality than , say , a component that goes inside industrial machinery hidden – are short-dashed lines that may be used to represent edges that are not directly visible phantom – ( not shown ) are alternately long- and double short-dashed thin lines used to represent a feature or component that is not part of the specified part or assembly type b lines are dimension lines and are used for dimensioning , projecting , extending , or leaders 2h pencil type d lines are similar to type c , except these are zigzagged and only for longer breaks 2h pencil type e lines indicate hidden outlines of internal features of an object 2h pencil type f lines are type e lines , except these are used for drawings in electrotechnology these are dotted lines , but a long line of 10–20 & nbsp ; mm , then a 1 & nbsp ; mm gap , then a small line of 2 & nbsp ; mm 2h pencil type h lines are the same as type g , except that every second long line is thicker 2h pencil type k lines indicate the alternate positions of an object and the line taken by that object these are drawn with a long line of 10–20 & nbsp ; mm , then a small gap , then a small line of 2 & nbsp ; mm , then a gap , then another small line in most cases , a single view is not sufficient to show all necessary features , and several views are used a multiview projection is a type of orthographic projection that shows the object as it looks from the front , right , left , top , bottom , or back ( e.g the primary views ) , and is typically positioned relative to each other according to the rules of either multiview projection the origin and vector direction of the projectors ( also called projection lines ) differs , as explained below the 3d object is projected into 2d '' paper '' space as if you were looking at a radiograph of the object : the top view is under the front view , the right view is at the left of the front view the views of the 3d object are like the panels of a box that envelopes the object , and the panels pivot as they open up flat into the plane of the drawing thus the left view is placed on the left and the top view on the top ; and the features closest to the front of the 3d object will appear closest to the front view in the drawing third-angle projection is primarily used in the united states and canada , where it is the default projection system according to asme standard asme y14.3m until the late 19th century , first-angle projection was the norm in north america as well as europe ; , p but circa the 1890s , third-angle projection spread throughout the north american engineering and manufacturing communities to the point of becoming a widely followed convention , and it was an asa standard by the 1950s as shown above , the determination of what surface constitutes the front , back , top , and bottom varies depending on the projection method used one of the things that makes isometric drawings so attractive is the ease with which 60° angles can be constructed with only a compass and straightedge for example , a floor plan may be drawn at 1:50 ( 1:48 or ″ 1′ 0″ ) whereas a detailed view may be drawn at 1:25 ( 1:24 or ″ 1′ 0″ ) on one hand , it is a general principle of engineering drawings that they are projected using standardized , mathematically certain projection methods and rules and yet , on the other hand , there is another general principle of engineering drawing that nearly diametrically opposes all this effort and intent—that is , the principle that users are not to scale the drawing to infer a dimension not labeled all iso paper sizes have the same aspect ratio , one to the square root of 2 , meaning that a document designed for any given size can be enlarged or reduced to any other size and will fit perfectly here is an example of an engineering drawing ( an isometric view of the same object is shown above )

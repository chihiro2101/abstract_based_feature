technical drawing has existed since ancient times complex technical drawings were made in renaissance times , such as the drawings of leonardo da vinci modern engineering drawing , with its precise conventions of orthographic projection and scale , arose in france at a time when the industrial revolution was in its infancy standardization also aids internationalization , because people from different countries who speak different languages can read the same engineering drawing , and interpret it the same way these apply widely in the united states , although iso 8015 ( geometrical product specifications ( gps ) — fundamentals — concepts , principles and rules ) is now also important this states that , '' once a portion of the iso geometric product specification ( gps ) system is invoked in a mechanical engineering product documentation , the entire iso gps system is invoked the implication of this is that any drawing using iso symbols can only be interpreted to iso gps rules for centuries , until the post-world war ii era , all engineering drawing was done manually by using pencil and pen on paper or other substrate ( e.g since the advent of computer-aided design ( cad ) , engineering drawing has been done more and more in the electronic medium with each passing decade today most engineering drawing is done with cad , but pencil and paper have not entirely disappeared ( slide rules used to number among the supplies , too , but nowadays even manual drafting , when it occurs , benefits from a pocket calculator or its onscreen equivalent ) and of course the tools also include drawing boards ( drafting boards ) or tables drafting machines are devices that aid manual drafting by combining drawing boards , straightedges , pantographs , and other tools into one integrated drawing environment producing drawings usually involves creating an original that is then reproduced , generating multiple copies to be distributed to the shop floor , vendors , company archives , and so on to mean any paper copy of an engineering drawing in the case of cad drawings , the original is the cad file , and the printouts of that file are the '' prints '' almost all engineering drawings ( except perhaps reference-only views or initial sketches ) communicate not only geometry ( shape and location ) but also dimensions and tolerances for those characteristics a variety of line styles graphically represent physical objects types of lines include the following : visible – are continuous lines used to depict edges directly visible from a particular angle hidden – are short-dashed lines that may be used to represent edges that are not directly visible center – are alternately long- and short-dashed lines that may be used to represent the axes of circular features phantom – ( not shown ) are alternately long- and double short-dashed thin lines used to represent a feature or component that is not part of the specified part or assembly billet ends that may be used for testing , or the machined product that is the focus of a tooling drawing lines can also be classified by a letter classification in which each line is given a letter type c lines are used for breaks when the whole object is not shown 2h pencil type d lines are similar to type c , except these are zigzagged and only for longer breaks 2h pencil type f lines are type e lines , except these are used for drawings in electrotechnology 2h pencil type g lines are used for centre lines 2h pencil type k lines indicate the alternate positions of an object and the line taken by that object in most cases , a single view is not sufficient to show all necessary features , and several views are used the 3d object is projected into 2d '' paper '' space as if you were looking at a radiograph of the object : the top view is under the front view , the right view is at the left of the front view first-angle projection is the iso 128 and is primarily used in europe the views of the 3d object are like the panels of a box that envelopes the object , and the panels pivot as they open up flat into the plane of the drawing until the late 19th century , first-angle projection was the norm in north america as well as europe ; , p generally only as many views are used as are necessary to convey all needed information clearly and economically but any combination of views may be used depending on the needs of the particular design view lines or section lines ( lines with arrows marked '' a-a '' , '' b-b '' , etc sometimes a note tells the reader in which zone ( s ) of the drawing to find the view or section the true size and shape of any feature in an engineering drawing can only be known when the line of sight ( los ) is perpendicular to the plane being referenced isometric projection is a type of axonometric projection plans are usually '' scale drawings '' , meaning that the plans are drawn at specific ratio relative to the actual size of the place or object this stern admonition is often repeated on drawings , via a boilerplate note in the title block telling the user , '' do not scale drawing as in many technical fields , a wide array of abbreviations and symbols have been developed in engineering drawing during the 20th and 21st centuries here is an example of an engineering drawing ( an isometric view of the same object is shown above ) thus today it is often the case that the information travels from the mind of the designer into the manufactured component without having ever been codified by an engineering drawing

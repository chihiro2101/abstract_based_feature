the contemporary christian music industry has roots in the late 1960s and early 1970s jesus movement and its jesus music artists the encyclopedia of contemporary christian music points out three reasons that the christian music industry developed as a parallel structure to the general music industry first , the jesus movement produced a large number of bands in a very short period , which the general market was unable and/or unwilling to absorb petra , for instance , struggled to find an audience for their hard rock sound , partially due to limited distribution to christian bookstores even so , the 1970s saw established corporations become involved in the christian music market other music industry giants also got involved , cbs started a short-lived christian label , priority records , and mca also fielded a label , songbird records , for a time while the jesus movement had ended by the 1980s , the christian music industry was maturing and transforming into a multimillion-dollar enterprise smith also gained influence within christian music , each playing significant roles in the development of the industry harder forms of christian music , such as metal music , also began to gain acceptance and 1972 's only visiting this planet became one of the most revered albums of all time in christian music '' the problem , as summed by one critic , was that the music was too religious for secular audience , while simultaneously too aggressive for religious audiences one critic describes the situation , stating that for a band '' to be taken seriously outside the christian scene , a band must stay far , far away from that scene the band had been placed in the christian market by their record label largely because their lead singer , paul meany , was previously with the band earthsuit , whose kaleidoscope superior was released on sparrow records this caused the band to not get taken seriously by music critics , and by the release of mutemath ( album ) the band began expressing discontent with their situation we 're not trying to preach through our music ; we do n't have some kind of evangelistic agenda with what we 're doing '' sometimes '' crossing over '' creates ambiguity over whether an artist is christian ( a '' christian band '' ) , or the artist is composed of christians and produces music that appeals to christian music fans but does n't cater to the christian market ( '' christians in a band '' ) however , the band is not generally considered to be a '' christian band '' today another artist , brian welch , whose solo debut was released to christian markets , found their album pulled from some christian bookstores after the music video for '' flush '' was released industry organizations christian music trade association christian songwriter 's network other steve camp 's 107 thesis is christian music dying ?

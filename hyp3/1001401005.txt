prior to the sabre , napier had been working on large aero engines for some time their most famous was the lion , which had been a very successful engine between the world wars and in modified form had powered several of the supermarine schneider trophy competitors in 1923 and 1927 , as well as several land speed record cars the h-block has a compact layout , consisting of two horizontally opposed engines , lying one atop or beside another since the cylinders are opposed , the motion in one is balanced by the motion on the opposing side , leading to no first order vibration or second order vibration in these new designs , napier chose air cooling but in service , the rear cylinders proved to be impossible to cool properly , which made the engines unreliable during the 1930s , studies showed the need for engines capable of developing one horsepower per cubic inch of displacement ( about 45 & nbsp ; kw/litre ) this power output was needed to propel aircraft large enough to carry large fuel loads , for long range flights a typical large engine of the era , the pratt & whitney r-1830 twin wasp , developed about 1,200 & nbsp ; hp ( 895 & nbsp ; kw ) from 1,830 cubic inches ( 30 litres ) , so an advance of some 50 percent would be needed in it , he wrote that traditional poppet valve engines would be unlikely to produce much more than 1,500 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,100 & nbsp ; kw ) , a figure that many companies were eyeing for next generation engines to pass this limit , the sleeve valve would have to be used , to increase volumetric efficiency , as well as to decrease the engine 's sensitivity to detonation , which was prevalent with the poor quality fuels in use at the time engines and enterprise : the life and work of sir harry ricardo , john reynolds,1999 , p.187 the napier company decided first to develop a large 24 cylinder liquidâ€“cooled engine , capable of producing at least 2,000 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,491 & nbsp ; kw ) in late 1935 all of the accessories were grouped conveniently above and below the cylinder blocks , rather than being at the front and rear of the engine , as in most contemporary designs industry and air power the expansion of british aircraft production 1935-1941 , sebastian ritchie 2007 , routledge taylor and francis group , , p.140 the first sabre engines were ready for testing in january 1938 , although they were limited to 1,350 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,000 & nbsp ; kw ) by march , they were passing tests at 2,050 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,500 & nbsp ; kw ) and by june 1940 , when the sabre passed the air ministry 's 100-hour test , the first production versions were delivering 2,200 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,640 & nbsp ; kw ) from their 2,238 cubic inch ( 37 litre ) displacements by the end of the year , they were producing 2,400 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,800 & nbsp ; kw ) prototype engines had been hand-assembled by napier craftsmen and it proved to be difficult to adapt it to assembly-line production techniques the sleeves often failed due to the way they were manufactured from chrome-molybdenum steel , leading to seized cylinders , which caused the loss of the sole prototype martin-baker mb 3 the ministry of aircraft production was responsible for the development of the engine and arranged for sleeves to be machined by the bristol aeroplane company from their taurus engine forgings in 1942 , it started a series of projects to improve its high-altitude performance , with the addition of a three-speed , two-stage supercharger , when the basic engine was still not running reliably without the advanced supercharger , the engine 's performance over fell off rapidly and pilots flying sabre-powered aircraft , were generally instructed to enter combat only below this altitude development continued and the later sabre vii delivered 3,500 & nbsp ; hp ( 2,600 & nbsp ; kw ) with a new supercharger the final test engines delivered 5,500 & nbsp ; hp setright p.134 ( 4,100 & nbsp ; kw ) at 45 & nbsp ; lb/in 2 boost by the end of world war ii , there were several engines in the same power class ; sabre ii : ( 1940 ) 2,300 horsepower ( 1,715 kw ) mk va with rotol cooling fan : used in 2 hawker tempest vs modified to use napier designed annular radiators ; also in experimental vickers warwick ; sabre e.122 : ( 1946 ) 3,500 horsepower allied aircraft piston engines of world war ii : history and development of frontline aircraft piston engines produced by great britain and the united states during world war ii

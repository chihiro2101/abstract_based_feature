prior to the sabre , napier had been working on large aero engines for some time their most famous was the lion , which had been a very successful engine between the world wars and in modified form had powered several of the supermarine schneider trophy competitors in 1923 and 1927 , as well as several land speed record cars napier followed the lion with two new h-block designs : the h-16 ( rapier ) and the h-24 ( dagger ) the h-block has a compact layout , consisting of two horizontally opposed engines , lying one atop or beside another in these new designs , napier chose air cooling but in service , the rear cylinders proved to be impossible to cool properly , which made the engines unreliable during the 1930s , studies showed the need for engines capable of developing one horsepower per cubic inch of displacement ( about 45 & nbsp ; kw/litre ) this power output was needed to propel aircraft large enough to carry large fuel loads , for long range flights a typical large engine of the era , the pratt & whitney r-1830 twin wasp , developed about 1,200 & nbsp ; hp ( 895 & nbsp ; kw ) from 1,830 cubic inches ( 30 litres ) , so an advance of some 50 percent would be needed this called for radical changes and while many companies tried to build such an engine , none succeeded in it , he wrote that traditional poppet valve engines would be unlikely to produce much more than 1,500 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,100 & nbsp ; kw ) , a figure that many companies were eyeing for next generation engines to pass this limit , the sleeve valve would have to be used , to increase volumetric efficiency , as well as to decrease the engine 's sensitivity to detonation , which was prevalent with the poor quality fuels in use at the time napier sabre '' flight , p all of the accessories were grouped conveniently above and below the cylinder blocks , rather than being at the front and rear of the engine , as in most contemporary designs the contemporary 1940 rolls-royce merlin ii was generating just over 1,000 & nbsp ; hp ( 750 & nbsp ; kw ) from a 1,647 cubic inch ( 27 litre ) displacement the sleeves often failed due to the way they were manufactured from chrome-molybdenum steel , leading to seized cylinders , which caused the loss of the sole prototype martin-baker mb 3 air filters had to be fitted when a new sleeve problem appeared in 1944 when aircraft were operating from normandy soil with its abrasive , gritty dust banks 1978 , airlife publications , , p.133 quality control proved to be inadequate , engines were often delivered with improperly cleaned castings , broken piston rings and machine cuttings left inside the engine napier sabre retrieved on 17 july 2009 in 1942 , it started a series of projects to improve its high-altitude performance , with the addition of a three-speed , two-stage supercharger , when the basic engine was still not running reliably in december 1942 , the company was purchased by the english electric , which ended the supercharger project immediately and devoted the whole company to solving the production problems , which was achieved quickly this was the last version to enter service , being used in the hawker typhoon and its derivative , the hawker tempest without the advanced supercharger , the engine 's performance over fell off rapidly and pilots flying sabre-powered aircraft , were generally instructed to enter combat only below this altitude as air superiority over continental europe was slowly gained , typhoons were increasingly used as fighter-bombers , notably by the raf second tactical air force by the end of world war ii , there were several engines in the same power class reduction gear ratio 0.274:1 : mainly used in early hawker typhoons british piston engines and their aircraft allied aircraft piston engines of world war ii : history and development of frontline aircraft piston engines produced by great britain and the united states during world war ii

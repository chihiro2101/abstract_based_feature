prior to the sabre , napier had been working on large aero engines for some time their most famous was the lion , which had been a very successful engine between the world wars and in modified form had powered several of the supermarine schneider trophy competitors in 1923 and 1927 , as well as several land speed record cars napier followed the lion with two new h-block designs : the h-16 ( rapier ) and the h-24 ( dagger ) the h-block has a compact layout , consisting of two horizontally opposed engines , lying one atop or beside another since the cylinders are opposed , the motion in one is balanced by the motion on the opposing side , leading to no first order vibration or second order vibration in these new designs , napier chose air cooling but in service , the rear cylinders proved to be impossible to cool properly , which made the engines unreliable during the 1930s , studies showed the need for engines capable of developing one horsepower per cubic inch of displacement ( about 45 & nbsp ; kw/litre ) a typical large engine of the era , the pratt & whitney r-1830 twin wasp , developed about 1,200 & nbsp ; hp ( 895 & nbsp ; kw ) from 1,830 cubic inches ( 30 litres ) , so an advance of some 50 percent would be needed in 1927 , harry ricardo published a study on the concept of the sleeve valve engine in it , he wrote that traditional poppet valve engines would be unlikely to produce much more than 1,500 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,100 & nbsp ; kw ) , a figure that many companies were eyeing for next generation engines engines and enterprise : the life and work of sir harry ricardo , john reynolds,1999 , p.187 the napier company decided first to develop a large 24 cylinder liquidâ€“cooled engine , capable of producing at least 2,000 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,491 & nbsp ; kw ) in late 1935 all of the accessories were grouped conveniently above and below the cylinder blocks , rather than being at the front and rear of the engine , as in most contemporary designs the air ministry supported the sabre programme with a development order in 1937 for two reasons : to provide an alternative engine if the rolls-royce vulture and the bristol centaurus failed as the next generation of high power engines and to keep napier in the aero-engine industry by march , they were passing tests at 2,050 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,500 & nbsp ; kw ) and by june 1940 , when the sabre passed the air ministry 's 100-hour test , the first production versions were delivering 2,200 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,640 & nbsp ; kw ) from their 2,238 cubic inch ( 37 litre ) displacements the contemporary 1940 rolls-royce merlin ii was generating just over 1,000 & nbsp ; hp ( 750 & nbsp ; kw ) from a 1,647 cubic inch ( 27 litre ) displacement banks 1978 , airlife publications , , p.133 quality control proved to be inadequate , engines were often delivered with improperly cleaned castings , broken piston rings and machine cuttings left inside the engine to make matters worse , mechanics and pilots unfamiliar with the different nature of the engine , tended to blame the sabre for problems that were caused by not following correct procedures in 1942 , it started a series of projects to improve its high-altitude performance , with the addition of a three-speed , two-stage supercharger , when the basic engine was still not running reliably in december 1942 , the company was purchased by the english electric , which ended the supercharger project immediately and devoted the whole company to solving the production problems , which was achieved quickly by 1944 , the sabre v was delivering 2,400 horsepower ( 1,800 & nbsp ; kw ) consistently and the reputation of the engine started to improve as air superiority over continental europe was slowly gained , typhoons were increasingly used as fighter-bombers , notably by the raf second tactical air force development continued and the later sabre vii delivered 3,500 & nbsp ; hp ( 2,600 & nbsp ; kw ) with a new supercharger the final test engines delivered 5,500 & nbsp ; hp setright p.134 ( 4,100 & nbsp ; kw ) at 45 & nbsp ; lb/in 2 boost ; sabre iib :2,400 horsepower ( 1,790 kw ) as mk va with hobson fuel injection : preliminary flight development engine for sabre v series ; sabre viii :3,000 horsepower ( 2,240 kw ) allied aircraft piston engines of world war ii : history and development of frontline aircraft piston engines produced by great britain and the united states during world war ii

prior to the sabre , napier had been working on large aero engines for some time their most famous was the lion , which had been a very successful engine between the world wars and in modified form had powered several of the supermarine schneider trophy competitors in 1923 and 1927 , as well as several land speed record cars napier followed the lion with two new h-block designs : the h-16 ( rapier ) and the h-24 ( dagger ) since the cylinders are opposed , the motion in one is balanced by the motion on the opposing side , leading to no first order vibration or second order vibration in these new designs , napier chose air cooling but in service , the rear cylinders proved to be impossible to cool properly , which made the engines unreliable during the 1930s , studies showed the need for engines capable of developing one horsepower per cubic inch of displacement ( about 45 & nbsp ; kw/litre ) a typical large engine of the era , the pratt & whitney r-1830 twin wasp , developed about 1,200 & nbsp ; hp ( 895 & nbsp ; kw ) from 1,830 cubic inches ( 30 litres ) , so an advance of some 50 percent would be needed in it , he wrote that traditional poppet valve engines would be unlikely to produce much more than 1,500 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,100 & nbsp ; kw ) , a figure that many companies were eyeing for next generation engines to pass this limit , the sleeve valve would have to be used , to increase volumetric efficiency , as well as to decrease the engine 's sensitivity to detonation , which was prevalent with the poor quality fuels in use at the time napier sabre '' flight , p industry and air power the expansion of british aircraft production 1935-1941 , sebastian ritchie 2007 , routledge taylor and francis group , , p.140 the first sabre engines were ready for testing in january 1938 , although they were limited to 1,350 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,000 & nbsp ; kw ) the contemporary 1940 rolls-royce merlin ii was generating just over 1,000 & nbsp ; hp ( 750 & nbsp ; kw ) from a 1,647 cubic inch ( 27 litre ) displacement the ministry of aircraft production was responsible for the development of the engine and arranged for sleeves to be machined by the bristol aeroplane company from their taurus engine forgings these nitrided austenitic steel sleeves were the result of many years of intensive sleeve development , experience that napier did not have banks 1978 , airlife publications , , p.133 quality control proved to be inadequate , engines were often delivered with improperly cleaned castings , broken piston rings and machine cuttings left inside the engine in 1944 , rolls-royce produced a similar design prototype called the eagle in 1942 , it started a series of projects to improve its high-altitude performance , with the addition of a three-speed , two-stage supercharger , when the basic engine was still not running reliably in december 1942 , the company was purchased by the english electric , which ended the supercharger project immediately and devoted the whole company to solving the production problems , which was achieved quickly by 1944 , the sabre v was delivering 2,400 horsepower ( 1,800 & nbsp ; kw ) consistently and the reputation of the engine started to improve this was the last version to enter service , being used in the hawker typhoon and its derivative , the hawker tempest the tempest became the principal destroyer of the v-1 flying bomb ( fieseler fi 103 ) , since it was the fastest of all the allied fighters at low levels development continued and the later sabre vii delivered 3,500 & nbsp ; hp ( 2,600 & nbsp ; kw ) with a new supercharger the final test engines delivered 5,500 & nbsp ; hp setright p.134 ( 4,100 & nbsp ; kw ) at 45 & nbsp ; lb/in 2 boost note : ; sabre i ( e.107 ) : ( 1939 ) 2,000 horsepower ( 1,490 kw ) as mk va with hobson fuel injection : preliminary flight development engine for sabre v series ; sabre e.118 : ( 1941 ) three-speed , two-stage supercharger , contra-rotating propeller ; test flown in fo.108 allied aircraft piston engines of world war ii : history and development of frontline aircraft piston engines produced by great britain and the united states during world war ii

prior to the sabre , napier had been working on large aero engines for some time their most famous was the lion , which had been a very successful engine between the world wars and in modified form had powered several of the supermarine schneider trophy competitors in 1923 and 1927 , as well as several land speed record cars the h-block has a compact layout , consisting of two horizontally opposed engines , lying one atop or beside another since the cylinders are opposed , the motion in one is balanced by the motion on the opposing side , leading to no first order vibration or second order vibration in these new designs , napier chose air cooling but in service , the rear cylinders proved to be impossible to cool properly , which made the engines unreliable during the 1930s , studies showed the need for engines capable of developing one horsepower per cubic inch of displacement ( about 45 & nbsp ; kw/litre ) a typical large engine of the era , the pratt & whitney r-1830 twin wasp , developed about 1,200 & nbsp ; hp ( 895 & nbsp ; kw ) from 1,830 cubic inches ( 30 litres ) , so an advance of some 50 percent would be needed in it , he wrote that traditional poppet valve engines would be unlikely to produce much more than 1,500 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,100 & nbsp ; kw ) , a figure that many companies were eyeing for next generation engines to pass this limit , the sleeve valve would have to be used , to increase volumetric efficiency , as well as to decrease the engine 's sensitivity to detonation , which was prevalent with the poor quality fuels in use at the time engines and enterprise : the life and work of sir harry ricardo , john reynolds,1999 , p.187 the napier company decided first to develop a large 24 cylinder liquidâ€“cooled engine , capable of producing at least 2,000 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,491 & nbsp ; kw ) in late 1935 although the company continued with the opposed h layout of the dagger , this new design positioned the cylinder blocks horizontally and it was to use sleeve valves napier sabre '' flight , p the air ministry supported the sabre programme with a development order in 1937 for two reasons : to provide an alternative engine if the rolls-royce vulture and the bristol centaurus failed as the next generation of high power engines and to keep napier in the aero-engine industry industry and air power the expansion of british aircraft production 1935-1941 , sebastian ritchie 2007 , routledge taylor and francis group , , p.140 the first sabre engines were ready for testing in january 1938 , although they were limited to 1,350 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,000 & nbsp ; kw ) the contemporary 1940 rolls-royce merlin ii was generating just over 1,000 & nbsp ; hp ( 750 & nbsp ; kw ) from a 1,647 cubic inch ( 27 litre ) displacement prototype engines had been hand-assembled by napier craftsmen and it proved to be difficult to adapt it to assembly-line production techniques the ministry of aircraft production was responsible for the development of the engine and arranged for sleeves to be machined by the bristol aeroplane company from their taurus engine forgings i kept no diary-60 years with marine diesels , automobile and aero engines , f.r banks 1978 , airlife publications , , p.133 quality control proved to be inadequate , engines were often delivered with improperly cleaned castings , broken piston rings and machine cuttings left inside the engine to make matters worse , mechanics and pilots unfamiliar with the different nature of the engine , tended to blame the sabre for problems that were caused by not following correct procedures by 1944 , the sabre v was delivering 2,400 horsepower ( 1,800 & nbsp ; kw ) consistently and the reputation of the engine started to improve without the advanced supercharger , the engine 's performance over fell off rapidly and pilots flying sabre-powered aircraft , were generally instructed to enter combat only below this altitude development continued and the later sabre vii delivered 3,500 & nbsp ; hp ( 2,600 & nbsp ; kw ) with a new supercharger the final test engines delivered 5,500 & nbsp ; hp setright p.134 ( 4,100 & nbsp ; kw ) at 45 & nbsp ; lb/in 2 boost mk va with rotol cooling fan : used in 2 hawker tempest vs modified to use napier designed annular radiators ; also in experimental vickers warwick pilot 's notes for typhoon marks ia and ib ; sabre ii or iia engine ( 2nd edition ) british piston engines and their aircraft

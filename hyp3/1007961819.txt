these jewish traditions implying a divine dualism were most frequently associated with enoch among the pseudepigrapha 1 enoch : book of parables presents two figures : the son of man and enoch the book of daniel displays two similar characters : the ancient of days and the one like a man the identification of metatron with the gnostic 3 & nbsp ; enoch , where the name first appears , is not explicitly made in the talmud although it does refer to a prince of the world who was young but now is old the former may be the transformed enoch , prince of the countenance within the divine palace ; the latter , the primordial metatron , an sefirot of the '' cause of causes '' , specifically the tenth and last sefirot , identified with the earthly shekhinah furthermore , the merkabah text re ' uyot yehezkel identifies the ancient of days from the book of daniel as metatron many scholars see a discontinuity between how enoch is portrayed in the early enoch literature and how metatron is portrayed scholars commonly see the character of metatron as being based on an amalgam of jewish literature , in addition to enoch , michael , melchizedek , and jehoel among others are seen as influences gershom scholem argues metatron 's character was influenced by two streams of thought one of which linked metatron with enoch , while the second was a fusing of different obscure entities and mythic motifs scholem argues that this second tradition was originally separate but later became fused with the enoch tradition he points to texts where this second metatron is a primordial angel and referred to as metatron rabbah scholem theorizes that the two hebrew spellings of metatron 's name are representative of these two separate traditions in his view the second metatron is linked to yahoel in 2 & nbsp ; enoch , enoch is assigned titles commonly used by metatron such as '' the youth , the prince of the presence and the prince of the world in 3 & nbsp ; enoch , metatron is called the lesser yhwh this raises a problem since the name metatron does not seem to be directly related to the name of god yhwh in maaseh merkabah the text reasons that metatron is called the lesser yhwh because in hebrew gematria metatron is numerically equivalent to another name of god shaddai in 3 & nbsp ; enoch 48d1 metatron is called both yahoel yah and yahoel in addition to being one of the seventy names of metatron from 3 & nbsp ; enoch 48d hagigah 15a describes elisha ben abuyah in paradise seeing metatron sitting down ( an action that is not done in the presence of god ) the talmud states , it was proved to elisha that metatron could not be a second deity by the fact that metatron received 60 '' pulsa dinura '' to demonstrate that metatron was not a god , but an angel , and could be punished in sanhedrin 38b one of the minim tells rabbi idith that metatron should be worshiped because he has a name like his master furthermore , as an angel metatron has no power to pardon transgressions nor was he to be received even as a messenger of forgiveness '' gershom scholem suggests that the name was deliberately omitted from later copies of the talmud metatron also appears in the pseudepigrapha including shi'ur qomah , and most prominently in the hebrew merkabah book of enoch , also called 3 enoch or sefer hekhalot ( book of the heavenly palaces ) the book describes the link between enoch , son of jared ( great grandfather of noah ) and his transformation into the angel metatron ) the narrator of this book , supposedly rabbi ishmael , tells how metatron guided him through heaven and explained its wonders it identifies him as the angel that led the people of israel through the wilderness after their exodus from egypt ( again referring to exodus 23:21 , see above ) , and describes him as a heavenly priest wasserstrom between muslim and jew : the problem of symbiosis under early islam princeton university press 2014 p wasserstrom between muslim and jew : the problem of symbiosis under early islam princeton university press 2014 p metatron appears as an angel and the spokesperson of god in the book good omens and the 2019 tv series by the same name , played in the series by derek jacobi

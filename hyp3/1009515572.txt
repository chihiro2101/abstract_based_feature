studies suggest that approximately 10 % of people are left-handed cross-dominance or mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand handedness may be measured behaviourally ( performance measures ) or through questionnaires ( preference measures ) the edinburgh handedness inventory has been used since 1971 but contains many dated questions and is hard to score more recently , the flinders handedness survey ( flanders ) has been developed the theory implies that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor verbal processing in right-handed people occurs mostly in the left hemisphere , whereas visuospatial processing is done mostly in the right left-handed people have a heterogeneous brain organization where the hemispheres are either organized as in right-handers , but with hemispheres reversed ; or such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing two theoretical single-gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness , by marian annett of the university of leicester , and by chris mcmanus of ucl however , growing evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness can not be explained by a single genetic locus now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to the trait four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol ( a synthetic estrogen based medication used between 1940 and 1971 ) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group previc , after reviewing a large number of studies , found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby 's subsequent birth position can affect handedness another theory is that ultrasound may sometimes affect the brains of unborn children , causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers receive ultrasound during pregnancy children of 18–36 months showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than with simple grasping and australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one iq point , which is not noteworthy left-handers ' brains are structured differently from right-handers ' in ways that can allow them to process language , spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways a study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers , even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers , such as violins similarly , studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population what they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of their right or left hand during infancy ( such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in , or grasping random objects with the left hand ) , they were more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler , when they were toddlers ) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores in two studies , diana deutsch found that left-handers , particularly those with mixed hand preference , performed significantly better than right-handers in musical memory tasks left-handed women have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater in post-menopausal women one systematic review concluded : '' left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system '' however , on average , left-handers have been found to have an advantage in fighting and competitive , interactive sports , which could have increased their reproductive success in ancestral populations study , researchers from lafayette college and johns hopkins university concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population , but among college-educated people , left-handers earned 10 to 15 % more than their right-handed counterparts interactive sports such as table tennis , badminton and cricket have an overrepresentation of left-handedness , while non-interactive sports such as swimming show no overrepresentation other , sports-specific factors may confounding the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations : in cricket , the overall advantage of a bowler 's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone : even disregarding the experience factor ( i.e , even for a batsman whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals his experience against right-handed bowlers ) , a left-handed bowler challenges the average ( i.e , right-handed ) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does , because the angle of a bowler 's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman ( see wasim akram ) in baseball , a right-handed pitcher 's curve ball will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers , left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers “ i can sympathise with all those left-handed cricketers who have gone to an early grave trying desperately to shoot straight with a right-handed lee enfield until very recently in taiwan ( and still in mainland china , japan and korea ) , left-handed people were forced to switch to being right-handed , or at least switch to writing with the right hand in the soviet union , all left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand in the soviet school system international left-handers day is , according to the club , '' an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality ( left-handedness ) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed

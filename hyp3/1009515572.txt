right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands studies suggest that approximately 90 % of people are right-handed studies suggest that approximately 10 % of people are left-handed cross-dominance or mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand occurrences during prenatal development may be important ; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth in a 2013 study , 39 % of infants ( 6 to 14 months ) and 97 % of toddlers ( 18 to 24 months ) demonstrated a hand preference in most people , the left side of the brain controls speaking the theory implies that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor left-handed people have a heterogeneous brain organization where the hemispheres are either organized as in right-handers , but with hemispheres reversed ; or such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern however , growing evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness can not be explained by a single genetic locus performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in handedness performed a genome-wide association study and found that handedness was significantly associated with four loci , three of them in genes encoding proteins involved in brain development twin study indicate that genetic factors explain 25 % of the variance in handedness , and environmental factors the remaining 75 % ( 2017 ) found that asymmetric methylation of cpg sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries related to handedness four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol ( a synthetic estrogen based medication used between 1940 and 1971 ) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group previc , after reviewing a large number of studies , found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby 's subsequent birth position can affect handedness about two-thirds of fetuses present with their left occiput ( back of the head ) at birth in fact , every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay , and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness children of 18â€“36 months showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than with simple grasping scharoun and bryden noted that right-handed preference increases with age up to the teenage years he says that left-handers ' brains are structured in a way that increases their range of abilities , and that the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the brain 's language centers and australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one iq point , which is not noteworthy also , a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math the researchers used bayley scales of infant and toddler development to assess all the subjects left-handed people are much more likely to have several specific physical and mental disorders and health problems another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women , but the effect is unknown for men at this point at least one study maintains that left-handers are more likely to suffer from heart disease , and are more likely to have reduced longevity from cardiovascular causes one systematic review concluded : '' left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system '' the term southpaw is sometimes used to refer to a left-handed individual , especially in baseball and boxing in baseball , a right-handed pitcher 's curve ball will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people , often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed moreover , apart from inconvenience , left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority until very recently in taiwan ( and still in mainland china , japan and korea ) , left-handed people were forced to switch to being right-handed , or at least switch to writing with the right hand in the soviet union , all left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand in the soviet school system red-necked ( bennett 's ) wallabies ( macropus rufogriseus ) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation , but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength

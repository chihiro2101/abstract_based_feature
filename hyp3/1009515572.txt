right-handedness is by far the most common type right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands studies suggest that approximately 90 % of people are right-handed left-handedness is far less common than right-handedness studies suggest that approximately 10 % of people are left-handed cross-dominance or mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand in a 2013 study , 39 % of infants ( 6 to 14 months ) and 97 % of toddlers ( 18 to 24 months ) demonstrated a hand preference one common handedness theory is the brain hemisphere division of labor in most people , the left side of the brain controls speaking verbal processing in right-handed people occurs mostly in the left hemisphere , whereas visuospatial processing is done mostly in the right left-handed people have a heterogeneous brain organization where the hemispheres are either organized as in right-handers , but with hemispheres reversed ; or such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to the trait performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in handedness nodal signaling and ciliogenesis ) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry ( handedness being a reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function ) performed a genome-wide association study and found that handedness was significantly associated with four loci , three of them in genes encoding proteins involved in brain development twin study indicate that genetic factors explain 25 % of the variance in handedness , and environmental factors the remaining 75 % another theory is that ultrasound may sometimes affect the brains of unborn children , causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers receive ultrasound during pregnancy research suggests there may be a weak association between ultrasound screening ( sonography used to check the healthy development of the fetus and mother ) and left-handedness between 36 and 48 months , there is a significant decline in variability between handedness in one-handed grasping ; it can be seen earlier in two-handed manipulation children of 18â€“36 months showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than with simple grasping scharoun and bryden noted that right-handed preference increases with age up to the teenage years in his book right-hand , left-hand , chris mcmanus of university college london argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing , and that an above-average quota of high achievers have been left-handed he says that left-handers ' brains are structured in a way that increases their range of abilities , and that the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the brain 's language centers and australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one iq point , which is not noteworthy similarly , studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population left-handed drivers are usually on the right side of the field , because they can get better angles to pass the ball or shoot for goal ice hockey typically uses a strategy in which a defence pairing includes one left-handed and one right-handed defender in bowling , the oil pattern used on the bowling lane breaks down faster the more times a ball is rolled down the lane a left-handed bowler competes on the opposite side of the lane from the right-handed bowler and therefore deals with less breakdown of the original oil placement this means left-handed bowlers have to adjust their shot less frequently than right-handed bowlers in team events or qualifying rounds where there are possibly 4-10 people per set of two lanes according to a meta-analysis of 144 studies , totaling 1,787,629 participants , the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23 , indicating 23 % more men are left-handed a number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness , though findings are mixed a 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found '' elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness '' a '' left-handed compliment '' is one that has two meanings , one of which is unflattering to the recipient in the soviet union , all left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand in the soviet school system thousands of left-handed people in today 's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects

studies suggest that approximately 10 % of people are left-handed handedness may be measured behaviourally ( performance measures ) or through questionnaires ( preference measures ) the longer waterloo handedness questionnaire is not widely accessible occurrences during prenatal development may be important ; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth in a 2013 study , 39 % of infants ( 6 to 14 months ) and 97 % of toddlers ( 18 to 24 months ) demonstrated a hand preference verbal processing in right-handed people occurs mostly in the left hemisphere , whereas visuospatial processing is done mostly in the right left-handed people have a heterogeneous brain organization where the hemispheres are either organized as in right-handers , but with hemispheres reversed ; or such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing however , growing evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness can not be explained by a single genetic locus now conclude that handedness is polygenic and estimate that at least 40 loci contribute to the trait nodal signaling and ciliogenesis ) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry ( handedness being a reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function ) performed a genome-wide association study and found that handedness was significantly associated with four loci , three of them in genes encoding proteins involved in brain development ( 2017 ) found that asymmetric methylation of cpg sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries related to handedness diethylstilbestrol animal studies '' suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain , including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance '' in fact , every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay , and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness between 36 and 48 months , there is a significant decline in variability between handedness in one-handed grasping ; it can be seen earlier in two-handed manipulation the decrease in handedness variability in children of 36â€“48 months may be attributable to preschool or kindergarten attendance due to increased single-hand activities such as writing and coloring and australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one iq point , which is not noteworthy also , a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math a study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers , even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers , such as violins similarly , studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population conversely , joshua goodman found that evidence for left-handers was overrepresented amongst those with higher cognitive skills , such as mensa members and higher-performing takers of sat and mcat tests , due to methodological and sampling issues in studies , when they were toddlers ) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women , but the effect is unknown for men at this point one systematic review concluded : '' left-handers showed no systematic tendency to suffer from disorders of the immune system '' however , on average , left-handers have been found to have an advantage in fighting and competitive , interactive sports , which could have increased their reproductive success in ancestral populations however , more recently , in a 2014 study published by the national bureau of economic research , harvard economist joshua goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people interactive sports such as table tennis , badminton and cricket have an overrepresentation of left-handedness , while non-interactive sports such as swimming show no overrepresentation the term southpaw is sometimes used to refer to a left-handed individual , especially in baseball and boxing , even for a batsman whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals his experience against right-handed bowlers ) , a left-handed bowler challenges the average ( i.e while studies of handedness show that only 10 % of the general population is left-handed , the proportion of left-handed mlb players is closer to 39 % of hitters and 28 % of pitchers , according to 2012 data because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers , left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers historically , there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base , especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate a 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found '' elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness '' throughout history , being left-handed was considered negative , or evil ; even into the 20th century , left-handed children were beaten by schoolteachers for writing with their left hand usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand , since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one 's own may not be straightforward in the soviet union , all left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand in the soviet school system thousands of left-handed people in today 's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects

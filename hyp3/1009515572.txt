right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands studies suggest that approximately 90 % of people are right-handed studies suggest that approximately 10 % of people are left-handed cross-dominance or mixed-handedness is the change of hand preference between tasks occurrences during prenatal development may be important ; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth in a 2013 study , 39 % of infants ( 6 to 14 months ) and 97 % of toddlers ( 18 to 24 months ) demonstrated a hand preference verbal processing in right-handed people occurs mostly in the left hemisphere , whereas visuospatial processing is done mostly in the right left-handed people have a heterogeneous brain organization where the hemispheres are either organized as in right-handers , but with hemispheres reversed ; or such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing for example , if both parents of a child are left-handed , there is a 26 % chance of that child being left-handed however , growing evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness can not be explained by a single genetic locus performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in handedness ( 2017 ) found that asymmetric methylation of cpg sites plays a key role for gene expression asymmetries related to handedness diethylstilbestrol animal studies '' suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain , including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance '' previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system , which is involved in the development of handedness another theory is that ultrasound may sometimes affect the brains of unborn children , causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers receive ultrasound during pregnancy research suggests there may be a weak association between ultrasound screening ( sonography used to check the healthy development of the fetus and mother ) and left-handedness infants have been observed to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks , especially in one- versus two-handed grasping between 36 and 48 months , there is a significant decline in variability between handedness in one-handed grasping ; it can be seen earlier in two-handed manipulation scharoun and bryden noted that right-handed preference increases with age up to the teenage years he says that left-handers ' brains are structured in a way that increases their range of abilities , and that the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the brain 's language centers left-handers ' brains are structured differently from right-handers ' in ways that can allow them to process language , spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways also , a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math a study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers , even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers , such as violins similarly , studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population he also found that left-handers were overrepresented among those with lower cognitive skills and mental impairments , with those with intellectual disability ( id ) being roughly twice as likely to be left-handed , as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children what they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of their right or left hand during infancy ( such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in , or grasping random objects with the left hand ) , they were more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler in two studies , diana deutsch found that left-handers , particularly those with mixed hand preference , performed significantly better than right-handers in musical memory tasks for example : lower-birth-weight and complications at birth are positively correlated with left-handedness a 2012 study showed that nearly 40 % of children with cerebral palsy were left-handed , while another study demonstrated that left-handedness was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of parkinson 's disease in women , but not in men another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women , but the effect is unknown for men at this point left-handed women have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater in post-menopausal women while studies of handedness show that only 10 % of the general population is left-handed , the proportion of left-handed mlb players is closer to 39 % of hitters and 28 % of pitchers , according to 2012 data with the ball in the glove on the right hand , a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people , often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed throughout history , being left-handed was considered negative , or evil ; even into the 20th century , left-handed children were beaten by schoolteachers for writing with their left hand in the soviet union , all left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand in the soviet school system studies of dogs , horses , and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed , while males tend to be left-handed .

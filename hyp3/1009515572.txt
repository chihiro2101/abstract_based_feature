right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands studies suggest that approximately 90 % of people are right-handed studies suggest that approximately 10 % of people are left-handed handedness may be measured behaviourally ( performance measures ) or through questionnaires ( preference measures ) occurrences during prenatal development may be important ; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth one common handedness theory is the brain hemisphere division of labor the theory implies that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor verbal processing in right-handed people occurs mostly in the left hemisphere , whereas visuospatial processing is done mostly in the right handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern for example , if both parents of a child are left-handed , there is a 26 % chance of that child being left-handed a large study of twins from 25,732 families by medland et al two theoretical single-gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness , by marian annett of the university of leicester , and by chris mcmanus of ucl however , growing evidence from linkage and genome-wide association studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness can not be explained by a single genetic locus performed a genome-wide association study for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in handedness nodal signaling and ciliogenesis ) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry ( handedness being a reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function ) performed a genome-wide association study and found that handedness was significantly associated with four loci , three of them in genes encoding proteins involved in brain development while the molecular basis of handedness epigenetics is largely unclear , ocklenburg et al four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol ( a synthetic estrogen based medication used between 1940 and 1971 ) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group diethylstilbestrol animal studies '' suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain , including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance '' previc , after reviewing a large number of studies , found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby 's subsequent birth position can affect handedness infants have been observed to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks , especially in one- versus two-handed grasping between 36 and 48 months , there is a significant decline in variability between handedness in one-handed grasping ; it can be seen earlier in two-handed manipulation scharoun and bryden noted that right-handed preference increases with age up to the teenage years in a systematic review and meta-analysis , ntolka and papadatou-pastou found that right-handers had higher iq scores , but that difference was negligible ( about 1.5 points ) what they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of their right or left hand during infancy ( such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in , or grasping random objects with the left hand ) , they were more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler left-handed people are much more likely to have several specific physical and mental disorders and health problems left-handed women have a higher risk of breast cancer than right-handed women and the effect is greater in post-menopausal women however , on average , left-handers have been found to have an advantage in fighting and competitive , interactive sports , which could have increased their reproductive success in ancestral populations , right-handed ) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does , because the angle of a bowler 's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman ( see wasim akram ) while studies of handedness show that only 10 % of the general population is left-handed , the proportion of left-handed mlb players is closer to 39 % of hitters and 28 % of pitchers , according to 2012 data because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers , left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in major league baseball history have been posted by left-handed batters historically , there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base , especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate this means left-handed bowlers have to adjust their shot less frequently than right-handed bowlers in team events or qualifying rounds where there are possibly 4-10 people per set of two lanes moreover , apart from inconvenience , left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand , since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one 's own may not be straightforward thousands of left-handed people in today 's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects

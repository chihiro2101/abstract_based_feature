the term '' biological control '' was first used by harry scott smith at the 1919 meeting of the pacific slope branch of the american association of economic entomologists , in riverside , california the first report of the use of an insect species to control an insect pest comes from '' nanfang caomu zhuang '' ( 南方草木狀 plants of the southern regions ) ( c biological control techniques as we know them today started to emerge in the 1870s lebaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests riley in 1873 , shipping to france the predatory mites tyroglyphus phylloxera to help fight the grapevine phylloxera ( phylloxera ) that was destroying grapevines in france the first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the united states was that of the braconid cotesia glomerata in 1883–1884 , imported from europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly , pieris rapae in 1888–1889 the vedalia beetle , rodolia cardinalis , a lady beetle , was introduced from australia to california to control the cottony cushion scale , icerya purchasi this had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in california , but by the end of 1889 , the cottony cushion scale population had already declined as a result , nine parasitoids ( solitary wasps ) of the gypsy moth , seven of brown-tail moth , and two predators of both moths became established in the us although the gypsy moth was not fully controlled by these natural enemies , the frequency , duration , and severity of its outbreaks were reduced and the program was regarded as successful two control agents were introduced to help control the spread of the plant , the cactus moth cactoblastis cactorum , and the scale insect dactylopius between 1884 and 1908 , the first dominion entomologist , james fletcher , continued introductions of other parasitoids and pathogens for the control of pests in canada there are three basic biological pest control strategies : importation ( classical biological control ) , augmentation and conservation importation or classical biological control involves the introduction of a pest 's natural enemies to a new locale where they do not occur naturally to be most effective at controlling a pest , a biological control agent requires a colonizing ability which allows it to keep pace with changes to the habitat in space and time other successful cases include the control of antonina graminis in texas by neodusmetia sangwani in the 1960s damage from hypera postica , the alfalfa weevil , a serious introduced pest of forage , was substantially reduced by the introduction of natural enemies image : alternanthera philoxeroides nrcs-1.jpg thumb the invasive species alternanthera philoxeroides ( alligator weed ) was controlled in florida ( u.s the agasicles hygrophila and two other biological controls were released in florida , greatly reducing the amount of land covered by the plant small commercially reared parasitoidal wasps , trichogramma ostriniae , provide limited and erratic control of the european corn borer ( ostrinia nubilalis ) , a serious pest the population of levuana iridescens , the levuana moth , a serious coconut pest in fiji , was brought under control by a classical biological control program in the 1920s augmentation involves the supplemental release of natural enemies that occur in a particular area , boosting the naturally occurring populations there in inundative release , in contrast , large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population , correcting a problem that has already arisen recommended release rates for trichogramma in vegetable or field crops range from 5,000 to 200,000 per acre ( 1 to 50 per square metre ) per week according to the level of pest infestation similarly , nematodes that kill insects ( that are entomopathogenic ) are released at rates of millions and even billions per acre for control of certain soil-dwelling insect pests the conservation of existing natural enemies in an environment is the third method of biological pest control these provide nectar to support parasitoids and predators of planthopper pests and have been demonstrated to be so effective ( reducing pest densities by 10- or even 100-fold ) that farmers sprayed 70 % less insecticides and enjoyed yields boosted by 5 % predators of aphids were similarly found to be present in tussock grasses by field boundary hedges in england , but they spread too slowly to reach the centers of fields cropping systems can be modified to favor natural enemies , a practice sometimes referred to as habitat manipulation in california , prune trees are sometimes planted in grape vineyards to provide an improved overwintering habitat or refuge for a key grape pest parasitoid for example , earwigs are natural predators that can be encouraged in gardens by hanging upside-down flowerpots filled with straw or wood wool such predators or parasitoids can control pests not affected by the bt protein reduced prey quality and abundance associated increased control from bt cotton can also indirectly decrease natural enemy populations in some cases , but the percentage of pests eaten or parasitized in bt and non-bt cotton are often similar the spotted lady beetle ( coleomegilla maculata ) is also able to feed on the eggs and larvae of the colorado potato beetle ( leptinotarsa decemlineata ) the running crab spider philodromus cespitum also prey heavily on aphids , and act as a biological control agent in european fruit orchards michalko , radek ; dvoryankina , viktoriya ( 1 june 2019 ) species used to control spider mites include the predatory mites phytoseiulus persimilis , neoseilus californicus , and amblyseius cucumeris , the predatory midge feltiella acarisuga , and a ladybird stethorus punctillum predators including cactoblastis cactorum ( mentioned above ) can also be used to destroy invasive plant species as another example , the poison hemlock moth ( agonopterix alstroemeriana ) can be used to control poison hemlock ( conium maculatum ) for rodent pests , cats are effective biological control when used in conjunction with reduction of refuge ( ecology ) locations barn owls are also sometimes used as biological rodent control parasitoids lay their eggs on or in the body of an insect host , which is then used as a food for developing larvae in cases of massive and severe infection of invasive pests , techniques of pest control are often used in combination lloyd stated that '' biological population control is well beyond present capabilities '' a potential obstacle to the adoption of biological pest control measures is that growers may prefer to stay with the familiar use of pesticides biological control of pests

the term '' biological control '' was first used by harry scott smith at the 1919 meeting of the pacific slope branch of the american association of economic entomologists , in riverside , california debach ( 1914–1993 ) who worked on citrus crop pests throughout his life the first report of the use of an insect species to control an insect pest comes from '' nanfang caomu zhuang '' ( 南方草木狀 plants of the southern regions ) ( c the ants used are known as huang gan ( huang yellow , gan citrus ) ants ( oecophylla smaragdina ) lebaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests the first international shipment of an insect as a biological control agent was made by charles v the united states department of agriculture ( usda ) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the division of entomology in 1881 , with c 110 years of biological control research and development in the united states department of agriculture : 1883–1993 department of agriculture , agricultural research service although the gypsy moth was not fully controlled by these natural enemies , the frequency , duration , and severity of its outbreaks were reduced and the program was regarded as successful this program also led to the development of many concepts , principles , and procedures for the implementation of biological control programs opuntia were introduced into queensland , australia as ornamental plants , starting in 1788 two control agents were introduced to help control the spread of the plant , the cactus moth cactoblastis cactorum , and the scale insect dactylopius between 1926 and 1931 , tens of millions of cactus moth eggs were distributed around queensland with great success , and by 1932 , most areas of prickly pear had been destroyed the first reported case of a classical biological control attempt in canada involves the parasitoidal wasp trichogramma minutum . types of biological pest control there are three basic biological pest control strategies : importation ( classical biological control ) , augmentation and conservation importation or classical biological control involves the introduction of a pest 's natural enemies to a new locale where they do not occur naturally early instances were often unofficial and not based on research , and some introduced species became serious pests themselves one of the earliest successes was in controlling icerya purchasi ( cottony cushion scale ) in australia , using a predatory insect rodolia cardinalis ( the vedalia beetle ) this success was repeated in california using the beetle and a parasitoidal fly , cryptochaetum iceryae damage from hypera postica , the alfalfa weevil , a serious introduced pest of forage , was substantially reduced by the introduction of natural enemies alligator weed was introduced to the united states from south america another aquatic weed , the giant salvinia ( salvinia molesta ) is a serious pest , covering waterways , reducing water flow and harming native species control with the salvinia weevil ( cyrtobagous salviniae ) and the salvinia stem-borer moth ( samea multiplicalis ) is effective in warm climates , and in zimbabwe , a 99 % control of the weed was obtained over a two-year period small commercially reared parasitoidal wasps , trichogramma ostriniae , provide limited and erratic control of the european corn borer ( ostrinia nubilalis ) , a serious pest in inoculative release , small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals to allow them to reproduce , in the hope of setting up longer-term control and thus keeping the pest down to a low level , constituting prevention rather than cure in inundative release , in contrast , large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population , correcting a problem that has already arisen similarly , bacillus thuringiensis and other microbial insecticides are used in large enough quantities for a rapid effect similarly , nematodes that kill insects ( that are entomopathogenic ) are released at rates of millions and even billions per acre for control of certain soil-dwelling insect pests the conservation of existing natural enemies in an environment is the third method of biological pest control natural enemies are already adapted to the habitat and to the target pest , and their conservation can be simple and cost-effective , as when nectar-producing crop plants are grown in the borders of rice fields control was improved by planting a meter-wide strip of tussock grasses in field centers , enabling aphid predators to overwinter there providing a suitable habitat , such as a windbreak , hedgerow , or beetle bank where beneficial insects such as parasitoidal wasps can live and reproduce , can help ensure the survival of populations of natural enemies such predators or parasitoids can control pests not affected by the bt protein given that many major crop pests are insects , many of the predators used in biological control are insectivorous species the spotted lady beetle ( coleomegilla maculata ) is also able to feed on the eggs and larvae of the colorado potato beetle ( leptinotarsa decemlineata ) the larvae of many hoverfly species principally feed upon aphids , one larva devouring up to 400 in its lifetime the type of soil they are applied to may also limit their effectiveness as another example , the poison hemlock moth ( agonopterix alstroemeriana ) can be used to control poison hemlock ( conium maculatum ) although there are no quantitative studies of the effectiveness of barn owls for this purpose , they are known rodent predators that can be used in addition to or instead of cats ; they can be encouraged into an area with nest boxes bacillus thuringiensis , a soil-dwelling bacterium , is the most widely applied species of bacteria used for biological control , with at least four sub-species used against lepidopteran ( moth , butterfly ) , coleopteran ( beetle ) and dipteran ( true fly ) insect pests unfortunately , it is susceptible to many chemicals used in mosquito abatement programmes biological control can affect biodiversity through predation , parasitism , pathogenicity , competition , or other attacks on non-target species related to biological pest control is the technique of introducing sterile individuals into the native population of some organism biological control of pests

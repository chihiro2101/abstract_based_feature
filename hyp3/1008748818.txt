the term '' biological control '' was first used by harry scott smith at the 1919 meeting of the pacific slope branch of the american association of economic entomologists , in riverside , california the first report of the use of an insect species to control an insect pest comes from '' nanfang caomu zhuang '' ( 南方草木狀 plants of the southern regions ) ( c 304 ad ) , attributed to western jin dynasty botanist ji han ( 嵇含 , 263–307 ) , in which it is mentioned that '' jiaozhi people sell ants and their nests attached to twigs looking like thin cotton envelopes , the reddish-yellow ant being larger than normal biological control techniques as we know them today started to emerge in the 1870s the first international shipment of an insect as a biological control agent was made by charles v the united states department of agriculture ( usda ) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the division of entomology in 1881 , with c the first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the united states was that of the braconid cotesia glomerata in 1883–1884 , imported from europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly , pieris rapae 110 years of biological control research and development in the united states department of agriculture : 1883–1993 pages 3–11 in 1905 the usda initiated its first large-scale biological control program , sending entomologists to europe and japan to look for natural enemies of the gypsy moth , lymantria dispar dispar , and brown-tail moth , brown-tail , invasive pests of trees and shrubs as a result , nine parasitoids ( solitary wasps ) of the gypsy moth , seven of brown-tail moth , and two predators of both moths became established in the us although the gypsy moth was not fully controlled by these natural enemies , the frequency , duration , and severity of its outbreaks were reduced and the program was regarded as successful this program also led to the development of many concepts , principles , and procedures for the implementation of biological control programs two control agents were introduced to help control the spread of the plant , the cactus moth cactoblastis cactorum , and the scale insect dactylopius . types of biological pest control there are three basic biological pest control strategies : importation ( classical biological control ) , augmentation and conservation importation or classical biological control involves the introduction of a pest 's natural enemies to a new locale where they do not occur naturally early instances were often unofficial and not based on research , and some introduced species became serious pests themselves to be most effective at controlling a pest , a biological control agent requires a colonizing ability which allows it to keep pace with changes to the habitat in space and time damage from hypera postica , the alfalfa weevil , a serious introduced pest of forage , was substantially reduced by the introduction of natural enemies the agasicles hygrophila and two other biological controls were released in florida , greatly reducing the amount of land covered by the plant another aquatic weed , the giant salvinia ( salvinia molesta ) is a serious pest , covering waterways , reducing water flow and harming native species control with the salvinia weevil ( cyrtobagous salviniae ) and the salvinia stem-borer moth ( samea multiplicalis ) is effective in warm climates , and in zimbabwe , a 99 % control of the weed was obtained over a two-year period small commercially reared parasitoidal wasps , trichogramma ostriniae , provide limited and erratic control of the european corn borer ( ostrinia nubilalis ) , a serious pest the population of levuana iridescens , the levuana moth , a serious coconut pest in fiji , was brought under control by a classical biological control program in the 1920s augmentation can be effective , but is not guaranteed to work , and depends on the precise details of the interactions between each pest and control agent the egg parasite trichogramma is frequently released inundatively to control harmful moths recommended release rates for trichogramma in vegetable or field crops range from 5,000 to 200,000 per acre ( 1 to 50 per square metre ) per week according to the level of pest infestation the conservation of existing natural enemies in an environment is the third method of biological pest control these provide nectar to support parasitoids and predators of planthopper pests and have been demonstrated to be so effective ( reducing pest densities by 10- or even 100-fold ) that farmers sprayed 70 % less insecticides and enjoyed yields boosted by 5 % predators of aphids were similarly found to be present in tussock grasses by field boundary hedges in england , but they spread too slowly to reach the centers of fields not removing dead annuals and non-hardy plants in the autumn allow insects to make use of their hollow stems during winter the providing of artificial shelters in the form of wooden caskets , boxes or flowerpots is also sometimes undertaken , particularly in gardens , to make a cropped area more attractive to natural enemies birdhouses enable insectivorous birds to nest ; the most useful birds can be attracted by choosing an opening just large enough for the desired species given that many major crop pests are insects , many of the predators used in biological control are insectivorous species ladybugs , and in particular their larvae which are active between may and july in the northern hemisphere , are voracious predators of aphids , and also consume mites , scale insects and small caterpillars the spotted lady beetle ( coleomegilla maculata ) is also able to feed on the eggs and larvae of the colorado potato beetle ( leptinotarsa decemlineata ) the running crab spider philodromus cespitum also prey heavily on aphids , and act as a biological control agent in european fruit orchards '' intraspecific phenotypic variation in functional traits of a generalist predator in an agricultural landscape '' several species of entomopathogenic nematode are important predators of insect and other invertebrate pests entomopathogenic nematodes have a limited shelf life because of their limited resistance to high temperature and dry conditions predators including cactoblastis cactorum ( mentioned above ) can also be used to destroy invasive plant species although there are no quantitative studies of the effectiveness of barn owls for this purpose , they are known rodent predators that can be used in addition to or instead of cats ; they can be encouraged into an area with nest boxes baculoviridae are specific to individual insect host species and have been shown to be useful in biological pest control biological control can affect biodiversity through predation , parasitism , pathogenicity , competition , or other attacks on non-target species biological control

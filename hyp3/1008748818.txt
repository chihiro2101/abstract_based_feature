the term '' biological control '' was first used by harry scott smith at the 1919 meeting of the pacific slope branch of the american association of economic entomologists , in riverside , california the first report of the use of an insect species to control an insect pest comes from '' nanfang caomu zhuang '' ( 南方草木狀 plants of the southern regions ) ( c the ants used are known as huang gan ( huang yellow , gan citrus ) ants ( oecophylla smaragdina ) biological control techniques as we know them today started to emerge in the 1870s lebaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests the first international shipment of an insect as a biological control agent was made by charles v the united states department of agriculture ( usda ) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the division of entomology in 1881 , with c the first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the united states was that of the braconid cotesia glomerata in 1883–1884 , imported from europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly , pieris rapae in 1888–1889 the vedalia beetle , rodolia cardinalis , a lady beetle , was introduced from australia to california to control the cottony cushion scale , icerya purchasi this had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in california , but by the end of 1889 , the cottony cushion scale population had already declined 110 years of biological control research and development in the united states department of agriculture : 1883–1993 pages 3–11 in 1905 the usda initiated its first large-scale biological control program , sending entomologists to europe and japan to look for natural enemies of the gypsy moth , lymantria dispar dispar , and brown-tail moth , brown-tail , invasive pests of trees and shrubs although the gypsy moth was not fully controlled by these natural enemies , the frequency , duration , and severity of its outbreaks were reduced and the program was regarded as successful this program also led to the development of many concepts , principles , and procedures for the implementation of biological control programs they quickly spread to cover over 25 & nbsp ; million hectares of australia by 1920 , increasing by 1 & nbsp ; million hectares per year two control agents were introduced to help control the spread of the plant , the cactus moth cactoblastis cactorum , and the scale insect dactylopius the first reported case of a classical biological control attempt in canada involves the parasitoidal wasp trichogramma minutum individuals were caught in new york state and released in ontario gardens in 1882 by william saunders , a trained chemist and first director of the dominion experimental farms , for controlling the invasive currantworm nematus ribesii between 1884 and 1908 , the first dominion entomologist , james fletcher , continued introductions of other parasitoids and pathogens for the control of pests in canada . types of biological pest control there are three basic biological pest control strategies : importation ( classical biological control ) , augmentation and conservation importation or classical biological control involves the introduction of a pest 's natural enemies to a new locale where they do not occur naturally early instances were often unofficial and not based on research , and some introduced species became serious pests themselves control is greatest if the agent has temporal persistence so that it can maintain its population even in the temporary absence of the target species , and if it is an opportunistic forager , enabling it to rapidly exploit a pest population damage from hypera postica , the alfalfa weevil , a serious introduced pest of forage , was substantially reduced by the introduction of natural enemies another aquatic weed , the giant salvinia ( salvinia molesta ) is a serious pest , covering waterways , reducing water flow and harming native species the population of levuana iridescens , the levuana moth , a serious coconut pest in fiji , was brought under control by a classical biological control program in the 1920s in inoculative release , small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals to allow them to reproduce , in the hope of setting up longer-term control and thus keeping the pest down to a low level , constituting prevention rather than cure in inundative release , in contrast , large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population , correcting a problem that has already arisen periodic releases of the parasitoidal wasp , encarsia formosa , are used to control greenhouse whitefly , while the predatory mite phytoseiulus persimilis is used for control of the two-spotted spider mite the conservation of existing natural enemies in an environment is the third method of biological pest control control was improved by planting a meter-wide strip of tussock grasses in field centers , enabling aphid predators to overwinter there providing a suitable habitat , such as a windbreak , hedgerow , or beetle bank where beneficial insects such as parasitoidal wasps can live and reproduce , can help ensure the survival of populations of natural enemies birdhouses enable insectivorous birds to nest ; the most useful birds can be attracted by choosing an opening just large enough for the desired species predators are mainly free-living species that directly consume a large number of prey during their whole lifetime given that many major crop pests are insects , many of the predators used in biological control are insectivorous species the running crab spider philodromus cespitum also prey heavily on aphids , and act as a biological control agent in european fruit orchards several species of entomopathogenic nematode are important predators of insect and other invertebrate pests its complex life cycle includes a free-living , infective stage in the soil where it becomes associated with a pathogenic bacteria such as moraxella osloensis during its larval stage , the moth strictly consumes its host plant , poison hemlock , and can exist at hundreds of larvae per individual host plant , destroying large swathes of the hemlock for rodent pests , cats are effective biological control when used in conjunction with reduction of refuge ( ecology ) locations gonatocerus ashmeadi ( hymenoptera : mymaridae ) has been introduced to control the glassy-winged sharpshooter homalodisca vitripennis ( hemiptera : cicadellidae ) in french polynesia and has successfully controlled ~95 % of the pest density baculoviridae are specific to individual insect host species and have been shown to be useful in biological pest control these have been introduced and released into the united states as a possible biological control of the emerald ash borer nature and scope of biological control association of natural biocontrol producers international organization for biological control

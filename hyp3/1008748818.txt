the term '' biological control '' was first used by harry scott smith at the 1919 meeting of the pacific slope branch of the american association of economic entomologists , in riverside , california however , the practice has previously been used for centuries the first report of the use of an insect species to control an insect pest comes from '' nanfang caomu zhuang '' ( 南方草木狀 plants of the southern regions ) ( c the ants used are known as huang gan ( huang yellow , gan citrus ) ants ( oecophylla smaragdina ) biological control techniques as we know them today started to emerge in the 1870s riley in 1873 , shipping to france the predatory mites tyroglyphus phylloxera to help fight the grapevine phylloxera ( phylloxera ) that was destroying grapevines in france the united states department of agriculture ( usda ) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the division of entomology in 1881 , with c the first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the united states was that of the braconid cotesia glomerata in 1883–1884 , imported from europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly , pieris rapae in 1888–1889 the vedalia beetle , rodolia cardinalis , a lady beetle , was introduced from australia to california to control the cottony cushion scale , icerya purchasi 110 years of biological control research and development in the united states department of agriculture : 1883–1993 pages 3–11 in 1905 the usda initiated its first large-scale biological control program , sending entomologists to europe and japan to look for natural enemies of the gypsy moth , lymantria dispar dispar , and brown-tail moth , brown-tail , invasive pests of trees and shrubs as a result , nine parasitoids ( solitary wasps ) of the gypsy moth , seven of brown-tail moth , and two predators of both moths became established in the us they quickly spread to cover over 25 & nbsp ; million hectares of australia by 1920 , increasing by 1 & nbsp ; million hectares per year two control agents were introduced to help control the spread of the plant , the cactus moth cactoblastis cactorum , and the scale insect dactylopius the first reported case of a classical biological control attempt in canada involves the parasitoidal wasp trichogramma minutum . types of biological pest control there are three basic biological pest control strategies : importation ( classical biological control ) , augmentation and conservation importation or classical biological control involves the introduction of a pest 's natural enemies to a new locale where they do not occur naturally to be most effective at controlling a pest , a biological control agent requires a colonizing ability which allows it to keep pace with changes to the habitat in space and time damage from hypera postica , the alfalfa weevil , a serious introduced pest of forage , was substantially reduced by the introduction of natural enemies 20 years after their introduction the population of weevils in the alfalfa area treated for alfalfa weevil in the northeastern united states remained 75 percent down image : alternanthera philoxeroides nrcs-1.jpg thumb the invasive species alternanthera philoxeroides ( alligator weed ) was controlled in florida ( u.s it takes root in shallow water , interfering with navigation , irrigation , and flood control the agasicles hygrophila and two other biological controls were released in florida , greatly reducing the amount of land covered by the plant small commercially reared parasitoidal wasps , trichogramma ostriniae , provide limited and erratic control of the european corn borer ( ostrinia nubilalis ) , a serious pest in inoculative release , small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals to allow them to reproduce , in the hope of setting up longer-term control and thus keeping the pest down to a low level , constituting prevention rather than cure in inundative release , in contrast , large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population , correcting a problem that has already arisen augmentation can be effective , but is not guaranteed to work , and depends on the precise details of the interactions between each pest and control agent periodic releases of the parasitoidal wasp , encarsia formosa , are used to control greenhouse whitefly , while the predatory mite phytoseiulus persimilis is used for control of the two-spotted spider mite the egg parasite trichogramma is frequently released inundatively to control harmful moths similarly , nematodes that kill insects ( that are entomopathogenic ) are released at rates of millions and even billions per acre for control of certain soil-dwelling insect pests the conservation of existing natural enemies in an environment is the third method of biological pest control these provide nectar to support parasitoids and predators of planthopper pests and have been demonstrated to be so effective ( reducing pest densities by 10- or even 100-fold ) that farmers sprayed 70 % less insecticides and enjoyed yields boosted by 5 % in california , prune trees are sometimes planted in grape vineyards to provide an improved overwintering habitat or refuge for a key grape pest parasitoid for example , earwigs are natural predators that can be encouraged in gardens by hanging upside-down flowerpots filled with straw or wood wool birdhouses enable insectivorous birds to nest ; the most useful birds can be attracted by choosing an opening just large enough for the desired species such predators or parasitoids can control pests not affected by the bt protein given that many major crop pests are insects , many of the predators used in biological control are insectivorous species the spotted lady beetle ( coleomegilla maculata ) is also able to feed on the eggs and larvae of the colorado potato beetle ( leptinotarsa decemlineata ) the larvae of many hoverfly species principally feed upon aphids , one larva devouring up to 400 in its lifetime the running crab spider philodromus cespitum also prey heavily on aphids , and act as a biological control agent in european fruit orchards for rodent pests , cats are effective biological control when used in conjunction with reduction of refuge ( ecology ) locations these have been introduced and released into the united states as a possible biological control of the emerald ash borer for example , the cane toad ( rhinella marina ) was intentionally introduced to australia to control the cane beetle ( dermolepida albohirtum ) , and other pests of sugar cane it was later discovered that the toads could not jump very high and so were unable to eat the cane beetles which stayed on the upper stalks of the cane plants biological control : a guide to natural enemies in north america

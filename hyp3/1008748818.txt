the term '' biological control '' was first used by harry scott smith at the 1919 meeting of the pacific slope branch of the american association of economic entomologists , in riverside , california the first report of the use of an insect species to control an insect pest comes from '' nanfang caomu zhuang '' ( 南方草木狀 plants of the southern regions ) ( c the ants used are known as huang gan ( huang yellow , gan citrus ) ants ( oecophylla smaragdina ) biological control techniques as we know them today started to emerge in the 1870s the first international shipment of an insect as a biological control agent was made by charles v the united states department of agriculture ( usda ) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the division of entomology in 1881 , with c the first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the united states was that of the braconid cotesia glomerata in 1883–1884 , imported from europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly , pieris rapae this had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in california , but by the end of 1889 , the cottony cushion scale population had already declined 110 years of biological control research and development in the united states department of agriculture : 1883–1993 as a result , nine parasitoids ( solitary wasps ) of the gypsy moth , seven of brown-tail moth , and two predators of both moths became established in the us although the gypsy moth was not fully controlled by these natural enemies , the frequency , duration , and severity of its outbreaks were reduced and the program was regarded as successful they quickly spread to cover over 25 & nbsp ; million hectares of australia by 1920 , increasing by 1 & nbsp ; million hectares per year between 1926 and 1931 , tens of millions of cactus moth eggs were distributed around queensland with great success , and by 1932 , most areas of prickly pear had been destroyed . types of biological pest control there are three basic biological pest control strategies : importation ( classical biological control ) , augmentation and conservation importation or classical biological control involves the introduction of a pest 's natural enemies to a new locale where they do not occur naturally early instances were often unofficial and not based on research , and some introduced species became serious pests themselves control is greatest if the agent has temporal persistence so that it can maintain its population even in the temporary absence of the target species , and if it is an opportunistic forager , enabling it to rapidly exploit a pest population one of the earliest successes was in controlling icerya purchasi ( cottony cushion scale ) in australia , using a predatory insect rodolia cardinalis ( the vedalia beetle ) damage from hypera postica , the alfalfa weevil , a serious introduced pest of forage , was substantially reduced by the introduction of natural enemies 20 years after their introduction the population of weevils in the alfalfa area treated for alfalfa weevil in the northeastern united states remained 75 percent down it takes root in shallow water , interfering with navigation , irrigation , and flood control the agasicles hygrophila and two other biological controls were released in florida , greatly reducing the amount of land covered by the plant careful formulations of the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis are more effective in inoculative release , small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals to allow them to reproduce , in the hope of setting up longer-term control and thus keeping the pest down to a low level , constituting prevention rather than cure in inundative release , in contrast , large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population , correcting a problem that has already arisen augmentation can be effective , but is not guaranteed to work , and depends on the precise details of the interactions between each pest and control agent periodic releases of the parasitoidal wasp , encarsia formosa , are used to control greenhouse whitefly , while the predatory mite phytoseiulus persimilis is used for control of the two-spotted spider mite the egg parasite trichogramma is frequently released inundatively to control harmful moths similarly , bacillus thuringiensis and other microbial insecticides are used in large enough quantities for a rapid effect recommended release rates for trichogramma in vegetable or field crops range from 5,000 to 200,000 per acre ( 1 to 50 per square metre ) per week according to the level of pest infestation the conservation of existing natural enemies in an environment is the third method of biological pest control these provide nectar to support parasitoids and predators of planthopper pests and have been demonstrated to be so effective ( reducing pest densities by 10- or even 100-fold ) that farmers sprayed 70 % less insecticides and enjoyed yields boosted by 5 % providing a suitable habitat , such as a windbreak , hedgerow , or beetle bank where beneficial insects such as parasitoidal wasps can live and reproduce , can help ensure the survival of populations of natural enemies long grass and ponds support amphibians not removing dead annuals and non-hardy plants in the autumn allow insects to make use of their hollow stems during winter for example , earwigs are natural predators that can be encouraged in gardens by hanging upside-down flowerpots filled with straw or wood wool such predators or parasitoids can control pests not affected by the bt protein given that many major crop pests are insects , many of the predators used in biological control are insectivorous species the larvae of many hoverfly species principally feed upon aphids , one larva devouring up to 400 in its lifetime the running crab spider philodromus cespitum also prey heavily on aphids , and act as a biological control agent in european fruit orchards the nematode is available commercially in europe and is applied by watering onto moist soil for rodent pests , cats are effective biological control when used in conjunction with reduction of refuge ( ecology ) locations bacteria used for biological control infect insects via their digestive tracts , so they offer only limited options for controlling insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects several members of chytridiomycota and blastocladiomycota have been explored as agents of biological control biological control of pests

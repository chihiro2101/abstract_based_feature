the water-based ink smeared easily , leading the device to be known as '' bibby 's folly '' in the early 1900s , other european presses using rubber printing plates and aniline oil-based ink were developed this led to the process being called '' aniline printing '' by the 1920s , most presses were made in germany , where the process was called '' gummidruck '' , or rubber printing individual firms tried using new names for the process , such as '' lustro printing '' and '' transglo printing '' , but met with limited success labels requiring high quality have generally been printed using the offset process until recently since 1990 , great advances have been made to the quality of flexographic printing presses , printing plates , ink systems and printing inks the greatest advances in flexographic printing have been in the area of photopolymer printing plates , including improvements to the plate material and the method of plate creation laser-etched ceramic anilox rolls along with chambered ink systems , have also played a part in the improvement of print quality platemaking printers ' national environmental assistance center : the first method of plate development uses light-sensitive polymer brushes scrub the plate to facilitate the '' washout '' process the plate to be washed out is fixed in the orbital washout unit on a sticky base plate : the second method uses a computer-guided laser to etch the image onto the printing plate such a direct laser engraving process is called digital platemaking mounting for every colour to be printed , a plate is made and eventually put on a cylinder which is placed in the printing press special machinery is made for mounting these plates on the printing cylinders to maintain registration harley invented and patent the opti-chek mounting and proofing machine enabling the operator to check the registration before going to the press precision mounting is critical for producing good quality print which is in the register and has a direct impact on minimizing waste there are two key areas to achieve effective plate mounting , positioning the plate correctly and achieving a good bond a variety of marks can be used , register crosses and micro dots accurate positioning is essential or the images of each colour will not be superimposed correctly , they will be out of register since they are so small they do n't have to be in waste areas as they are not easily seen it is also recommended to have two more pairs , one at either end so a simple rotation and check under the cameras confirms the plate has not twisted when it was laid/stuck down register mark mounting the most common form of mounting is register mark - also known as video mounting each print sleeve is transferred to the mounting system in turn the cameras provide an enlarged visual display indicating whether or not the register marks are correctly positioned in line with crosshair targets in recent years higher quality demands from customers , shorter and more frequent job runs result in an increasing relative cost of the prepress department the substrate is finally sandwiched between the plate and the impression cylinder to transfer the image the anilox roller transfers a uniform thickness of ink to a flexible printing plate the ink is controlled in the flexographic printing process by the ink system this system is best used for high quality , intricate print designs , like those found in the label industry flexo printing is widely used in the converting industry for printing plastic materials for packaging and other end uses

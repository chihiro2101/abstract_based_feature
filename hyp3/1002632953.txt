the water-based ink smeared easily , leading the device to be known as '' bibby 's folly '' in the early 1900s , other european presses using rubber printing plates and aniline oil-based ink were developed by the 1920s , most presses were made in germany , where the process was called '' gummidruck '' , or rubber printing during the early part of the 20th century , the technique was used extensively in food packaging in the united states however , in the 1940s , the food and drug administration classified aniline dyes as unsuitable for food packaging individual firms tried using new names for the process , such as '' lustro printing '' and '' transglo printing '' , but met with limited success in 1951 franklin moss , then the president of the mosstype corporation , conducted a poll among the readers of his journal the mosstyper to submit new names for the printing process originally , flexographic printing was rudimentary in quality since 1990 , great advances have been made to the quality of flexographic printing presses , printing plates , ink systems and printing inks the greatest advances in flexographic printing have been in the area of photopolymer printing plates , including improvements to the plate material and the method of plate creation companies like dupont , kodak and esko have pioneered the latest technologies , with advances in fast washout and the latest screening technology laser-etched ceramic anilox rolls along with chambered ink systems , have also played a part in the improvement of print quality full-color picture printing is now possible , and some of the finer presses available today , in combination with a skilled operator , allow quality that rivals the lithography process the plate to be washed out is fixed in the orbital washout unit on a sticky base plate : the second method uses a computer-guided laser to etch the image onto the printing plate companies such as av flexologic , glunz & jensen , xeikon , esko , kodak , polymount , screen and spgprints from the netherlands are market leaders in manufacturing this type of equipment the first step is to create a metal plate out of the negative of our initial image through an exposition process ( followed by an acid bath ) once cooled , this master mold will press the rubber or plastic compound ( under both controlled temperature and pressure ) through a second molding process to create the printing plate or cliche mounting for every colour to be printed , a plate is made and eventually put on a cylinder which is placed in the printing press to make a complete picture , regardless of printing on flexible film or corrugated paper , the image transferred from each plate has to register exactly with the images transferred from the other colors these mounting marks can be microdots ( down to 0.3 & nbsp ; mm ) and/or crosses harley invented and patent the opti-chek mounting and proofing machine enabling the operator to check the registration before going to the press precision mounting is critical for producing good quality print which is in the register and has a direct impact on minimizing waste generally plates are mounted directly onto the print sleeve but for corrugated operations , plates are mounted onto a carrier sheet that is fixed to the print sleeve in the press when required , it is removed and kept in storage between print runs there are two key areas to achieve effective plate mounting , positioning the plate correctly and achieving a good bond a variety of marks can be used , register crosses and micro dots on most mounting machines the dots or crosses on the plates are lined up using magnifying cameras , the higher the magnification the greater the accuracy to align the plates accurately a mounting system using video cameras is required the doctor blade removes excess ink from the anilox roller before inking the printing plate these rollers are responsible for transferring inks to the flexible printing plates mounted on the plate cylinders this system is best used for low to mid quality print work - usually found in corrugated box printing flexo printing is widely used in the converting industry for printing plastic materials for packaging and other end uses

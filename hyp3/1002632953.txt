in the early 1900s , other european presses using rubber printing plates and aniline oil-based ink were developed this led to the process being called '' aniline printing '' by the 1920s , most presses were made in germany , where the process was called '' gummidruck '' , or rubber printing during the early part of the 20th century , the technique was used extensively in food packaging in the united states however , in the 1940s , the food and drug administration classified aniline dyes as unsuitable for food packaging individual firms tried using new names for the process , such as '' lustro printing '' and '' transglo printing '' , but met with limited success worried about the image of the industry , packaging representatives decided the process needed to be renamed over 200 names were submitted , and a subcommittee of the packaging institute 's printed packaging committee narrowed the selection to three possibilities : '' permatone process '' , '' rotopake process '' , and '' flexographic process '' postal ballots from readers of the mosstyper overwhelmingly chose the last of these , and '' flexographic process '' was chosen since 1990 , great advances have been made to the quality of flexographic printing presses , printing plates , ink systems and printing inks the greatest advances in flexographic printing have been in the area of photopolymer printing plates , including improvements to the plate material and the method of plate creation platemaking printers ' national environmental assistance center : the first method of plate development uses light-sensitive polymer brushes scrub the plate to facilitate the '' washout '' process the process can differ depending on whether solid sheets of photopolymer or liquid photopolymer are used , but the principle is still the same in the early days the metal used was zinc , leading to the name 'zincos ' mounting for every colour to be printed , a plate is made and eventually put on a cylinder which is placed in the printing press for simplicity we 'll refer to print sleeves throughout this module but you can substitute cylinders if these are used in your operation there are two key areas to achieve effective plate mounting , positioning the plate correctly and achieving a good bond positioning is achieved by correctly lining up register marks that are common to each plate in the set a good bond is achieved by means of special mounting tape since they are so small they do n't have to be in waste areas as they are not easily seen to align the plates accurately a mounting system using video cameras is required each print sleeve is transferred to the mounting system in turn the next sleeve is loaded and the plate mounted in position by positioning the register marks on the plate based on the previously fixed camera positions the plate is carefully positioned over tape , usually by hand so that the register marks are seen directly below the cameras the rest of the tape liner is then removed or a plate support table is moved so that the remainder of the plate can be laid onto the sleeve printing a flexographic print is made by creating a positive mirrored master of the required image as a 3d relief in a rubber or polymer material the ink is controlled in the flexographic printing process by the ink system ; central impression press all color stations are located in a circle around the impression cylinder flexographic inks , like those used in gravure and unlike those used in lithography , generally have a low viscosity flexo printing is widely used in the converting industry for printing plastic materials for packaging and other end uses for maximum efficiency , the flexo presses produce large rolls of material that are then slit down to their finished size on slitting machines

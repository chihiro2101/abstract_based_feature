in 1890 , the first such patented press was built in liverpool , england by bibby , baron and sons in the early 1900s , other european presses using rubber printing plates and aniline oil-based ink were developed this led to the process being called '' aniline printing '' by the 1920s , most presses were made in germany , where the process was called '' gummidruck '' , or rubber printing during the early part of the 20th century , the technique was used extensively in food packaging in the united states however , in the 1940s , the food and drug administration classified aniline dyes as unsuitable for food packaging individual firms tried using new names for the process , such as '' lustro printing '' and '' transglo printing '' , but met with limited success in 1951 franklin moss , then the president of the mosstype corporation , conducted a poll among the readers of his journal the mosstyper to submit new names for the printing process postal ballots from readers of the mosstyper overwhelmingly chose the last of these , and '' flexographic process '' was chosen since 1990 , great advances have been made to the quality of flexographic printing presses , printing plates , ink systems and printing inks the greatest advances in flexographic printing have been in the area of photopolymer printing plates , including improvements to the plate material and the method of plate creation digital direct to plate systems have seen a good improvement in the industry recently laser-etched ceramic anilox rolls along with chambered ink systems , have also played a part in the improvement of print quality full-color picture printing is now possible , and some of the finer presses available today , in combination with a skilled operator , allow quality that rivals the lithography process one ongoing improvement has been the increasing ability to reproduce highlight tonal values , thereby providing a workaround for the very high dot gain associated with flexographic printing after addition of absorb gelatine for example , the photopolymer residue can be disposed of as standard solid waste together with household refuse : the second method uses a computer-guided laser to etch the image onto the printing plate the third method is to go through a molding process the first step is to create a metal plate out of the negative of our initial image through an exposition process ( followed by an acid bath ) in the early days the metal used was zinc , leading to the name 'zincos ' this metal plate in relief is then used in the second step to create the mold that could be in bakelite board or even glass or plastic , through a first molding process once cooled , this master mold will press the rubber or plastic compound ( under both controlled temperature and pressure ) through a second molding process to create the printing plate or cliche to make a complete picture , regardless of printing on flexible film or corrugated paper , the image transferred from each plate has to register exactly with the images transferred from the other colors special machinery is made for mounting these plates on the printing cylinders to maintain registration register mark mounting the most common form of mounting is register mark - also known as video mounting to align the plates accurately a mounting system using video cameras is required the rest of the tape liner is then removed or a plate support table is moved so that the remainder of the plate can be laid onto the sleeve plate cylinder the plate cylinder holds the printing plate , which is made from a soft flexible rubber-like material the nature and demands of the printing process and the application of the printed product determine the fundamental properties required of flexographic inks flexographic printing inks are primarily formulated to remain compatible with the wide variety of substrates used in the process this system is best used for low to mid quality print work - usually found in corrugated box printing for maximum efficiency , the flexo presses produce large rolls of material that are then slit down to their finished size on slitting machines

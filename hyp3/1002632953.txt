in the early 1900s , other european presses using rubber printing plates and aniline oil-based ink were developed this led to the process being called '' aniline printing '' by the 1920s , most presses were made in germany , where the process was called '' gummidruck '' , or rubber printing during the early part of the 20th century , the technique was used extensively in food packaging in the united states however , in the 1940s , the food and drug administration classified aniline dyes as unsuitable for food packaging individual firms tried using new names for the process , such as '' lustro printing '' and '' transglo printing '' , but met with limited success even after the food and drug administration approved the aniline process in 1949 using new , safe inks , sales continued to decline as some food manufacturers still refused to consider aniline printing in 1951 franklin moss , then the president of the mosstype corporation , conducted a poll among the readers of his journal the mosstyper to submit new names for the printing process originally , flexographic printing was rudimentary in quality labels requiring high quality have generally been printed using the offset process until recently since 1990 , great advances have been made to the quality of flexographic printing presses , printing plates , ink systems and printing inks the greatest advances in flexographic printing have been in the area of photopolymer printing plates , including improvements to the plate material and the method of plate creation full-color picture printing is now possible , and some of the finer presses available today , in combination with a skilled operator , allow quality that rivals the lithography process the process can differ depending on whether solid sheets of photopolymer or liquid photopolymer are used , but the principle is still the same the plate to be washed out is fixed in the orbital washout unit on a sticky base plate the plate is washed out in a mixture of water and 1 % dishwasher soap , at a temperature of approximately 40 & nbsp ; °c : the second method uses a computer-guided laser to etch the image onto the printing plate the first step is to create a metal plate out of the negative of our initial image through an exposition process ( followed by an acid bath ) mounting for every colour to be printed , a plate is made and eventually put on a cylinder which is placed in the printing press to make a complete picture , regardless of printing on flexible film or corrugated paper , the image transferred from each plate has to register exactly with the images transferred from the other colors special machinery is made for mounting these plates on the printing cylinders to maintain registration the mounting process needs to deliver the same accurate result each time a job is mounted , consistent accuracy is the target there are two key areas to achieve effective plate mounting , positioning the plate correctly and achieving a good bond it is also recommended to have two more pairs , one at either end so a simple rotation and check under the cameras confirms the plate has not twisted when it was laid/stuck down the register marks on the plate are lined up using magnifying cameras each sleeve is fixed in the mounter by a clamping system and mounting tape is then applied to the sleeve the rest of the tape liner is then removed or a plate support table is moved so that the remainder of the plate can be laid onto the sleeve printing section – single color station including the fountain or ink chamber , anilox , plate and impression rolls tape , magnets , tension straps and/or ratchets hold the printing plate against the plate cylinder flexographic printing inks are primarily formulated to remain compatible with the wide variety of substrates used in the process this system is best used for low to mid quality print work - usually found in corrugated box printing flexo printing is widely used in the converting industry for printing plastic materials for packaging and other end uses

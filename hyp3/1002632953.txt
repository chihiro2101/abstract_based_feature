in 1890 , the first such patented press was built in liverpool , england by bibby , baron and sons in the early 1900s , other european presses using rubber printing plates and aniline oil-based ink were developed this led to the process being called '' aniline printing '' by the 1920s , most presses were made in germany , where the process was called '' gummidruck '' , or rubber printing during the early part of the 20th century , the technique was used extensively in food packaging in the united states however , in the 1940s , the food and drug administration classified aniline dyes as unsuitable for food packaging individual firms tried using new names for the process , such as '' lustro printing '' and '' transglo printing '' , but met with limited success originally , flexographic printing was rudimentary in quality labels requiring high quality have generally been printed using the offset process until recently since 1990 , great advances have been made to the quality of flexographic printing presses , printing plates , ink systems and printing inks the greatest advances in flexographic printing have been in the area of photopolymer printing plates , including improvements to the plate material and the method of plate creation full-color picture printing is now possible , and some of the finer presses available today , in combination with a skilled operator , allow quality that rivals the lithography process the plate to be washed out is fixed in the orbital washout unit on a sticky base plate mounting for every colour to be printed , a plate is made and eventually put on a cylinder which is placed in the printing press special machinery is made for mounting these plates on the printing cylinders to maintain registration for simplicity we 'll refer to print sleeves throughout this module but you can substitute cylinders if these are used in your operation positioning is achieved by correctly lining up register marks that are common to each plate in the set a variety of marks can be used , register crosses and micro dots accurate positioning is essential or the images of each colour will not be superimposed correctly , they will be out of register register crosses are more common in label and corrugated printing where waste and hidden folds are normal , the microdot is common in flexible packaging where waste is kept to a minimum and no un-required marks are to be seen on the packaging ( example meat , dairy and hygiene ) it is also recommended to have two more pairs , one at either end so a simple rotation and check under the cameras confirms the plate has not twisted when it was laid/stuck down the register marks on the plate are lined up using magnifying cameras each print sleeve is transferred to the mounting system in turn the plate is then adhered to the sleeve using a mounting tape ( see item 5 ) and the complete unit removed from the mounting machine the plate is carefully positioned over tape , usually by hand so that the register marks are seen directly below the cameras once the plate is accurately aligned , it 's pressed onto the strip of exposed mounting tape this is done with each sleeve in turn so that all the plates register correctly flexo plate mounting equipment includes many options to increase efficiency these rollers are responsible for transferring inks to the flexible printing plates mounted on the plate cylinders the ink is controlled in the flexographic printing process by the ink system the doctor blade system can either be an open single blade system or an enclosed dual blade system flexo printing is widely used in the converting industry for printing plastic materials for packaging and other end uses

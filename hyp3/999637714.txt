they can be as small as 1-5mm in diameter , but can also grow or spread into large masses in the genital or anal area in most cases , there are no symptoms of hpv infection other than the warts themselves sometimes warts may cause itching , redness , or discomfort , especially when they occur around the anus although they are usually without other physical symptoms , an outbreak of genital warts may cause psychological distress , such as anxiety , in some people other studies suggest that condoms are not effective at preventing transmission of the low-risk hpv variants that cause genital warts the effect of condoms on hpv transmission may also be sex-dependent ; there is some evidence that condoms are more effective at preventing infection of males than of females the types of hpv that cause warts are highly transmissible other studies of partner concordance suggest that the presence of visible warts may be an indicator of increased infectivity ; hpv concordance rates are higher in couples where one partner has visible warts latent hpv , even with no outward symptoms , is still transmissible to a sexual partner it has also been reported from sharing of swimsuits , underwear , or bath towels , and from non-sexual touching during routine care such as diapering genital warts in children are less likely to be caused by hpv subtypes 6 and 11 than adults , and more likely to be caused by hpv types that cause warts elsewhere on the body ( '' cutaneous types '' ) the diagnosis of genital warts is most often made visually , but may require confirmation by biopsy in some cases dna tests are available for diagnosis of high-risk hpv infections because genital warts are caused by low-risk hpv types , dna tests can not be used for diagnosis of genital warts or other low-risk hpv infections types 6 and 11 cause genital warts , while 16 and 18 cause cervical cancer there is no evidence to suggest that removing visible warts reduces transmission of the underlying hpv infection as many as 80 % of people with hpv will clear the infection within 18 months one study testing genital skin for subclinical hpv using pcr found a prevalence of 10 %

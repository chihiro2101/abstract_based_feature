rta has rrna n-glycosylase activity that is responsible for the cleavage of a glycosidic bond within the large rrna of the 60s subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes rta specifically and irreversibly hydrolyses the n-glycosidic bond of the adenine residue at position 4324 ( a4324 ) within the 28s rrna , but leaves the phosphodiester backbone of the rna intact the ricin targets a4324 that is contained in a highly conserved sequence of 12 nucleotides universally found in eukaryotic ribosomes the sequence , 5 ’ -aguacgagagga-3 ’ , termed the sarcin-ricin loop , is important in binding elongation factors during protein synthesis within the active site of rta , there exist several invariant amino acid residues involved in the depurination of ribosomal rna in particular , arg180 and glu177 have been shown to be involved in the catalytic mechanism , and not substrate binding , with enzyme kinetic studies involving rta mutants depurination of adenine results in a neutral ribose on an intact phosphodiester rna backbone ricin is very toxic if inhaled , injected , or ingested by ingestion , the pathology of ricin is largely restricted to the gastrointestinal tract , where it may cause mucosal injuries because the symptoms are caused by failure to make protein , they may take anywhere from hours to days to appear , depending on the route of exposure and the dose within two to five days of exposure to ricin , effects of ricin on the central nervous system , adrenal glands , kidneys , and liver appear ingestion of ricin causes pain , inflammation , and hemorrhage in the mucosal membranes of the gastrointestinal system another antidote developed by the us military has been shown to be safe and effective in lab mice injected with antibody-rich blood mixed with ricin , and has had some human testing symptomatic and supportive treatments are available for ricin poisoning if the ricin has been ingested recently , the stomach can be flushed by ingesting activated charcoal or by performing gastric lavage ricin causes severe diarrhea and vomiting , and victims can die of circulatory shock or organ failure ; inhaled ricin can cause fatal pulmonary edema or respiratory failure this vaccination is effective for several months due to the body 's production of antibodies to the foreign protein in 1978 bulgarian defector vladimir kostov survived a ricin attack similar to the one on georgi markov , probably due to his body 's production of antibodies as ricin is not oil-soluble , little is found in the extracted castor oil the extracted oil is also heated to more than to denature any ricin that may be present swallowing castor beans rarely proves to be fatal unless the bean is thoroughly chewed victims often manifest nausea , diarrhea , tachycardia , hypotension , and seizures persisting for up to a week blood , plasma , or urine ricin or ricinine concentrations may be measured to confirm diagnosis although no approved therapeutics are currently based on ricin , it does have the potential to be used in the chemotherapy , as a '' magic bullet '' to destroy targeted cells however , bacterial toxins , such as diphtheria toxin , which is used in denileukin diftitox , an fda-approved treatment for leukemia and lymphoma , have proven to be more practical a promising approach for ricin is to use the non-toxic b subunit ( a lectin ) as a vehicle for delivering antigens into cells , thus greatly increasing their immunogenicity a letter containing ricin was also alleged to have been sent to american president barack obama at the same time zeman also confused ricin with castor oil and claimed that ricin is a non-poisonous laxative mohammed ali from liverpool , england was convicted after attempting to purchase 500 & nbsp ; mg of ricin over the dark web from an undercover fbi agent

rta has rrna n-glycosylase activity that is responsible for the cleavage of a glycosidic bond within the large rrna of the 60s subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes rta specifically and irreversibly hydrolyses the n-glycosidic bond of the adenine residue at position 4324 ( a4324 ) within the 28s rrna , but leaves the phosphodiester backbone of the rna intact the ricin targets a4324 that is contained in a highly conserved sequence of 12 nucleotides universally found in eukaryotic ribosomes the sequence , 5 ’ -aguacgagagga-3 ’ , termed the sarcin-ricin loop , is important in binding elongation factors during protein synthesis the depurination event rapidly and completely inactivates the ribosome , resulting in toxicity from inhibited protein synthesis a single rta molecule in the cytosol is capable of depurinating approximately 1500 ribosomes per minute within the active site of rta , there exist several invariant amino acid residues involved in the depurination of ribosomal rna in particular , arg180 and glu177 have been shown to be involved in the catalytic mechanism , and not substrate binding , with enzyme kinetic studies involving rta mutants arg180 is positioned such that it can protonate n-3 of adenine and break the bond between n-9 of the adenine ring and c-1 ’ of the ribose bond cleavage results in an oxycarbonium ion on the ribose , stabilized by glu177 it acts as a toxin by inhibiting protein synthesis by ingestion , the pathology of ricin is largely restricted to the gastrointestinal tract , where it may cause mucosal injuries ingestion of ricin causes pain , inflammation , and hemorrhage in the mucosal membranes of the gastrointestinal system gastrointestinal symptoms quickly progress to severe nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and difficulty swallowing ( dysphagia ) haemorrhage causes bloody feces ( melena ) and vomiting blood ( hematemesis ) an antidote has been developed by the uk military , although it has not yet been tested on humans possible treatments include intravenous fluids or electrolytes , airway management , assisted ventilation , or giving medications to remedy seizures and low blood pressure if the ricin has been ingested recently , the stomach can be flushed by ingesting activated charcoal or by performing gastric lavage survivors often develop long-term organ damage death typically occurs within 3–5 days of exposure this vaccination is effective for several months due to the body 's production of antibodies to the foreign protein the seeds of ricinus communis are commonly crushed to extract castor oil the remaining spent crushed seeds , called variously the '' cake '' , '' oil cake '' , and '' press cake '' , can contain up to 5 % ricin swallowing castor beans rarely proves to be fatal unless the bean is thoroughly chewed the laboratory testing usually involves immunoassay or liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry a promising approach for ricin is to use the non-toxic b subunit ( a lectin ) as a vehicle for delivering antigens into cells , thus greatly increasing their immunogenicity however , it was believed at the time that bulgaria would not have been able to produce the pellet , and it was also believed that the kgb had supplied it the kgb denied any involvement , although high-profile kgb defectors oleg kalugin and oleg gordievsky have since confirmed the kgb 's involvement later , the czech president miloš zeman claimed that the police protection of zdeněk hřib is a publicity stunt

rta has rrna n-glycosylase activity that is responsible for the cleavage of a glycosidic bond within the large rrna of the 60s subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes rta specifically and irreversibly hydrolyses the n-glycosidic bond of the adenine residue at position 4324 ( a4324 ) within the 28s rrna , but leaves the phosphodiester backbone of the rna intact the ricin targets a4324 that is contained in a highly conserved sequence of 12 nucleotides universally found in eukaryotic ribosomes the depurination event rapidly and completely inactivates the ribosome , resulting in toxicity from inhibited protein synthesis a single rta molecule in the cytosol is capable of depurinating approximately 1500 ribosomes per minute in particular , arg180 and glu177 have been shown to be involved in the catalytic mechanism , and not substrate binding , with enzyme kinetic studies involving rta mutants the model proposed by mozingo and robertus , based on x-ray structures , is as follows : sarcin-ricin loop substrate binds rta active site with target adenine stacking against tyr80 and tyr123 arg180 is positioned such that it can protonate n-3 of adenine and break the bond between n-9 of the adenine ring and c-1 â€™ of the ribose bond cleavage results in an oxycarbonium ion on the ribose , stabilized by glu177 depurination of adenine results in a neutral ribose on an intact phosphodiester rna backbone by ingestion , the pathology of ricin is largely restricted to the gastrointestinal tract , where it may cause mucosal injuries because the symptoms are caused by failure to make protein , they may take anywhere from hours to days to appear , depending on the route of exposure and the dose within two to five days of exposure to ricin , effects of ricin on the central nervous system , adrenal glands , kidneys , and liver appear the low blood volume ( hypovolemia ) caused by gastrointestinal fluid loss can lead to organ failure in the pancreas , kidney , liver , and gi tract and progress to shock shock and organ failure are indicated by disorientation , stupor , weakness , drowsiness , excessive thirst ( polydipsia ) , low urine production ( oliguria ) , and bloody urine ( hematuria ) symptoms of ricin inhalation are different from those caused by ingestion an antidote has been developed by the uk military , although it has not yet been tested on humans symptomatic and supportive treatments are available for ricin poisoning if the ricin has been ingested recently , the stomach can be flushed by ingesting activated charcoal or by performing gastric lavage ricin causes severe diarrhea and vomiting , and victims can die of circulatory shock or organ failure ; inhaled ricin can cause fatal pulmonary edema or respiratory failure this vaccination is effective for several months due to the body 's production of antibodies to the foreign protein in 1978 bulgarian defector vladimir kostov survived a ricin attack similar to the one on georgi markov , probably due to his body 's production of antibodies for this reason only small amounts of ricin had leaked out of the pellet , producing some symptoms but allowing his body to develop immunity to further poisoning as ricin is not oil-soluble , little is found in the extracted castor oil the extracted oil is also heated to more than to denature any ricin that may be present the remaining spent crushed seeds , called variously the '' cake '' , '' oil cake '' , and '' press cake '' , can contain up to 5 % ricin ricin is easy to produce , but is not as practical or likely to cause as many casualties as other agents the ricin vaccine candidate was granted orphan drug status in the us and the eec and , as of 2019 , was in clinical trials in the us zeman also confused ricin with castor oil and claimed that ricin is a non-poisonous laxative

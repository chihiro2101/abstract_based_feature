rta has rrna n-glycosylase activity that is responsible for the cleavage of a glycosidic bond within the large rrna of the 60s subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes rta specifically and irreversibly hydrolyses the n-glycosidic bond of the adenine residue at position 4324 ( a4324 ) within the 28s rrna , but leaves the phosphodiester backbone of the rna intact the ricin targets a4324 that is contained in a highly conserved sequence of 12 nucleotides universally found in eukaryotic ribosomes the sequence , 5 ’ -aguacgagagga-3 ’ , termed the sarcin-ricin loop , is important in binding elongation factors during protein synthesis the depurination event rapidly and completely inactivates the ribosome , resulting in toxicity from inhibited protein synthesis a single rta molecule in the cytosol is capable of depurinating approximately 1500 ribosomes per minute within the active site of rta , there exist several invariant amino acid residues involved in the depurination of ribosomal rna n-3 protonation of adenine by arg180 allows deprotonation of a nearby water molecule depurination of adenine results in a neutral ribose on an intact phosphodiester rna backbone by ingestion , the pathology of ricin is largely restricted to the gastrointestinal tract , where it may cause mucosal injuries when ingested , gastrointestinal symptoms can manifest within six hours ; these symptoms do not always become apparent within two to five days of exposure to ricin , effects of ricin on the central nervous system , adrenal glands , kidneys , and liver appear shock and organ failure are indicated by disorientation , stupor , weakness , drowsiness , excessive thirst ( polydipsia ) , low urine production ( oliguria ) , and bloody urine ( hematuria ) symptoms of ricin inhalation are different from those caused by ingestion when skin or inhalation exposure occur , ricin can cause an allergy to develop an antidote has been developed by the uk military , although it has not yet been tested on humans another antidote developed by the us military has been shown to be safe and effective in lab mice injected with antibody-rich blood mixed with ricin , and has had some human testing if the ricin has been ingested recently , the stomach can be flushed by ingesting activated charcoal or by performing gastric lavage ricin causes severe diarrhea and vomiting , and victims can die of circulatory shock or organ failure ; inhaled ricin can cause fatal pulmonary edema or respiratory failure in 1978 bulgarian defector vladimir kostov survived a ricin attack similar to the one on georgi markov , probably due to his body 's production of antibodies for this reason only small amounts of ricin had leaked out of the pellet , producing some symptoms but allowing his body to develop immunity to further poisoning as ricin is not oil-soluble , little is found in the extracted castor oil in 2013 a 37-year-old woman in the united states survived after ingesting 30 beans victims often manifest nausea , diarrhea , tachycardia , hypotension , and seizures persisting for up to a week the major problem with ricin is that its native endocytosis sequences are distributed throughout the protein in the us , ricin appears on the select agents list of the department of health and human services , and scientists must register with hhs to use ricin in their research several terrorists and terrorist groups have experimented with ricin and caused several incidents of the poisons being mailed to us politicians zeman also confused ricin with castor oil and claimed that ricin is a non-poisonous laxative the popularity of breaking bad inspired several real-life criminal cases involving ricin or similar substances

rta has rrna n-glycosylase activity that is responsible for the cleavage of a glycosidic bond within the large rrna of the 60s subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes rta specifically and irreversibly hydrolyses the n-glycosidic bond of the adenine residue at position 4324 ( a4324 ) within the 28s rrna , but leaves the phosphodiester backbone of the rna intact the ricin targets a4324 that is contained in a highly conserved sequence of 12 nucleotides universally found in eukaryotic ribosomes the sequence , 5 ’ -aguacgagagga-3 ’ , termed the sarcin-ricin loop , is important in binding elongation factors during protein synthesis a single rta molecule in the cytosol is capable of depurinating approximately 1500 ribosomes per minute within the active site of rta , there exist several invariant amino acid residues involved in the depurination of ribosomal rna in particular , arg180 and glu177 have been shown to be involved in the catalytic mechanism , and not substrate binding , with enzyme kinetic studies involving rta mutants the model proposed by mozingo and robertus , based on x-ray structures , is as follows : sarcin-ricin loop substrate binds rta active site with target adenine stacking against tyr80 and tyr123 by ingestion , the pathology of ricin is largely restricted to the gastrointestinal tract , where it may cause mucosal injuries because the symptoms are caused by failure to make protein , they may take anywhere from hours to days to appear , depending on the route of exposure and the dose within two to five days of exposure to ricin , effects of ricin on the central nervous system , adrenal glands , kidneys , and liver appear ingestion of ricin causes pain , inflammation , and hemorrhage in the mucosal membranes of the gastrointestinal system when skin or inhalation exposure occur , ricin can cause an allergy to develop ricin causes severe diarrhea and vomiting , and victims can die of circulatory shock or organ failure ; inhaled ricin can cause fatal pulmonary edema or respiratory failure this vaccination is effective for several months due to the body 's production of antibodies to the foreign protein in 1978 bulgarian defector vladimir kostov survived a ricin attack similar to the one on georgi markov , probably due to his body 's production of antibodies when a ricin-laced pellet was removed from the small of his back it was found that some of the original wax coating was still attached for this reason only small amounts of ricin had leaked out of the pellet , producing some symptoms but allowing his body to develop immunity to further poisoning the remaining spent crushed seeds , called variously the '' cake '' , '' oil cake '' , and '' press cake '' , can contain up to 5 % ricin accidental ingestion of ricinus communis cake intended for fertilizer has been reported to be responsible for fatal ricin poisoning in animals deaths from ingesting castor plant seeds are rare , partly because of their indigestible seed coat , and because some of the ricin is deactivated in the stomach blood , plasma , or urine ricin or ricinine concentrations may be measured to confirm diagnosis because ricin is a protein , it can be linked to a monoclonal antibody to target malignant cells recognized by the antibody in the us , ricin appears on the select agents list of the department of health and human services , and scientists must register with hhs to use ricin in their research ricin is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the united states as defined in section 302 of the us emergency planning and community right-to-know act ( 42 u.s.c the kgb developed weapons using ricin which were used outside the soviet bloc , most famously in the markov assassination despite this , more than of castor beans are processed each year , and approximately 5 % of the total is rendered into a waste containing negligible concentrations of undenatured ricin toxin the ricin vaccine candidate was granted orphan drug status in the us and the eec and , as of 2019 , was in clinical trials in the us zeman also confused ricin with castor oil and claimed that ricin is a non-poisonous laxative

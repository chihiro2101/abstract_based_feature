rta has rrna n-glycosylase activity that is responsible for the cleavage of a glycosidic bond within the large rrna of the 60s subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes rta specifically and irreversibly hydrolyses the n-glycosidic bond of the adenine residue at position 4324 ( a4324 ) within the 28s rrna , but leaves the phosphodiester backbone of the rna intact the ricin targets a4324 that is contained in a highly conserved sequence of 12 nucleotides universally found in eukaryotic ribosomes the depurination event rapidly and completely inactivates the ribosome , resulting in toxicity from inhibited protein synthesis a single rta molecule in the cytosol is capable of depurinating approximately 1500 ribosomes per minute within the active site of rta , there exist several invariant amino acid residues involved in the depurination of ribosomal rna in particular , arg180 and glu177 have been shown to be involved in the catalytic mechanism , and not substrate binding , with enzyme kinetic studies involving rta mutants the model proposed by mozingo and robertus , based on x-ray structures , is as follows : sarcin-ricin loop substrate binds rta active site with target adenine stacking against tyr80 and tyr123 arg180 is positioned such that it can protonate n-3 of adenine and break the bond between n-9 of the adenine ring and c-1 ’ of the ribose bond cleavage results in an oxycarbonium ion on the ribose , stabilized by glu177 by ingestion , the pathology of ricin is largely restricted to the gastrointestinal tract , where it may cause mucosal injuries because the symptoms are caused by failure to make protein , they may take anywhere from hours to days to appear , depending on the route of exposure and the dose within two to five days of exposure to ricin , effects of ricin on the central nervous system , adrenal glands , kidneys , and liver appear ingestion of ricin causes pain , inflammation , and hemorrhage in the mucosal membranes of the gastrointestinal system haemorrhage causes bloody feces ( melena ) and vomiting blood ( hematemesis ) shock and organ failure are indicated by disorientation , stupor , weakness , drowsiness , excessive thirst ( polydipsia ) , low urine production ( oliguria ) , and bloody urine ( hematuria ) when skin or inhalation exposure occur , ricin can cause an allergy to develop another antidote developed by the us military has been shown to be safe and effective in lab mice injected with antibody-rich blood mixed with ricin , and has had some human testing in 1978 bulgarian defector vladimir kostov survived a ricin attack similar to the one on georgi markov , probably due to his body 's production of antibodies the extracted oil is also heated to more than to denature any ricin that may be present accidental ingestion of ricinus communis cake intended for fertilizer has been reported to be responsible for fatal ricin poisoning in animals deaths from ingesting castor plant seeds are rare , partly because of their indigestible seed coat , and because some of the ricin is deactivated in the stomach most acute poisoning episodes in humans are the result of oral ingestion of castor beans , 5–20 of which could prove fatal to an adult because ricin is a protein , it can be linked to a monoclonal antibody to target malignant cells recognized by the antibody a promising approach for ricin is to use the non-toxic b subunit ( a lectin ) as a vehicle for delivering antigens into cells , thus greatly increasing their immunogenicity the united states investigated ricin for its military potential during world war i world war i ended before the united states weaponized ricin zeman also confused ricin with castor oil and claimed that ricin is a non-poisonous laxative daniel milzman , a 19-year-old former georgetown university student , was charged with manufacturing ricin in his dorm room , as well as the intent of '' using the ricin on another undergraduate student with whom he had a relationship ''

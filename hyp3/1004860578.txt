a mixing console is also known as an audio mixer , audio console , mixing desk , sound mixer , soundboard , or simply as board or mixer the channel input strips are usually a bank of identical monaural or stereo input channels arranged in columns a mixer intended for a live venue or a recording studio typically has a range of input jacks , such as xlr connectors for microphones and the outputs from di boxes , and 1/4 '' jacks for line level sources a dj mixer typically has rca connector inputs for pre-recorded music being played back on turntables or cd players , and a single mic input depending on the mixer , a channel may have buttons which enable the audio engineer to reroute the signal to a different output for monitoring purposes , turn on an attenuator pad ( often reducing the signal by 15 or 20 & nbsp ; db to prevent audio clipping ) , or activate other features , such as a high-pass filter some higher-priced mixers have a parametric equalizer or a semi-parametric equalizer for one or more of the equalizer frequency bands , often the middle range for each channel input , a mixer provides one or more input jacks depending on the specific mixer , each channel is stereo or monaural on most mixers , each channel has an xlr input , and many have rca or quarter-inch trs phone connector line inputs the first knob at the top of an input strip is typically a trim or gain control the input/preamp conditions the signal from the external device and this controls the amount of amplification or attenuation that is applied to the input signal to bring it to a nominal level for processing balanced inputs and connectors , such as xlr or phone connectors that have been specifically wired as balanced lines , reduce interference problems a microphone plugged directly into a power amplifier would not produce an adequate signal level to drive loudspeakers , because the microphone 's signal is too weak ; the microphone signal needs a preamplifier to strengthen the signal so that it is strong enough for the power amplifier for some very strong line level signals , the signal that is plugged into the mixer may be too strong , and cause audio clipping for signals that are too strong , a 15 & nbsp ; db or 20 & nbsp ; db pad can be used to attenuate the signal audio engineers typically aim at achieving a good gain structure for each channel to obtain a good gain structure , engineers usually raise the gain as high as they can before audio clipping results ; this helps to provide the best signal to noise ratio a mixing console may provide insert points after the input gain stage auxiliary sends can send the signal to an external processor such as a reverb , with the return signal routed through another channel or designated auxiliary return pre-fade auxiliary sends can provide a monitor mix to musicians on stage ( which they hear through monitor speakers pointing at the performers or in-ear monitors ) ; this mix is thus independent of the main mix produced by the faders most live radio broadcasting sound boards send audio through program channels another program channel may be used to send audio to the talent 's headset if they are broadcasting from a remote area many high-end mixing consoles have parametric equalizer on each channel the cue system allows the operator to listen to one or more selected signals without affecting the console 's main outputs a sound engineer can use the cue feature to , for instance , get a sound recording they wish to play soon cued up to the start point of a song , without the listeners hearing these actions consoles with a cue feature have a dedicated button on each channel , typically labeled cue , afl , pfl , solo , or listen it typically is controlled by the cue button , but unlike cue , sip affects the output mix ; it mutes everything except the channel or channels being soloed the signals are summed to create the main mix , or combined on a bus as a submix , a group of channels that are then added as a whole to the final mix for instance , many drum mics could be grouped into a bus , and then the proportion of drums in the final mix can be controlled with one bus fader some higher-end consoles use voltage-controlled amplifier ( vca ) vcas function somewhat like a submix but let the operator control the level of multiple input channels with a single fader the audio signals from the assigned channels remain routed independently of vca assignments since no sub-mix is created , it is not possible to insert processing such as compressors into a vca/dca group in addition , on most vca-equipped consoles , post-fader auxiliary send levels are affected by the vca master the master control section on a large live venue or sound recording mixer typically has sub-group faders , master faders , master auxiliary mixing bus level controls and auxiliary return level controls subgroup and main output fader controls are often found together on the right hand side of the mixer or , on larger consoles , in a center section flanked by banks of input channels for recorded sound , the mixing process can be performed on screen , using computer software and associated input , output and recording hardware compared with other mixers that are used in sound recording and live sound , dj mixers have far fewer inputs noise music musicians may create feedback loops within mixers , creating an instrument known as a no-input mixer

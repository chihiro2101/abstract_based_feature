a mixing console is also known as an audio mixer , audio console , mixing desk , sound mixer , soundboard , or simply as board or mixer the types of inputs that can be plugged into a mixer depend on the intended purpose of the mixer a mixer intended for a live venue or a recording studio typically has a range of input jacks , such as xlr connectors for microphones and the outputs from di boxes , and 1/4 '' jacks for line level sources a dj mixer typically has rca connector inputs for pre-recorded music being played back on turntables or cd players , and a single mic input some higher-priced mixers have a parametric equalizer or a semi-parametric equalizer for one or more of the equalizer frequency bands , often the middle range the channel strips are typically numbered so that the audio engineer can identify the different channels for each channel input , a mixer provides one or more input jacks on mid- to- large-sized live venue and sound recording consoles , these input jacks are numbered as well and consolidated in a patch bay on smaller mixers , the input jacks may be mounted on the top panel of the mixer to facilitate the connection and disconnection of inputs during the use of the mixer , a singer 's vocal mic , the signal from an electric bass amp 's di box , etc on most mixers , each channel has an xlr input , and many have rca or quarter-inch trs phone connector line inputs the smallest , least expensive mixers may only have one xlr input with the other inputs being line inputs for some very strong line level signals , the signal that is plugged into the mixer may be too strong , and cause audio clipping these provide a send and return connection for external processors that only affect an individual channel 's signal the auxiliary send routes a split of the incoming signal to an auxiliary bus , which can then be routed to external devices post-fader sends are normally used in this case most live radio broadcasting sound boards send audio through program channels most mid-range and higher-priced mixers have bass , midrange , and treble , or even additional mid-range controls ( e.g the cue system allows the operator to listen to one or more selected signals without affecting the console 's main outputs the signal from the cue system is fed to the console 's headphone amp and may also be available as a line-level output that is intended to drive a monitor speaker system the terms afl ( after-fader listen ) and pfl ( pre-fader listen ) are used to describe respectively whether or not the level of the cue signal for an input is controlled by the corresponding fader when cue is enabled on multiple channels , a mix of these signals is heard through the cue system for example , if an audio engineer is having problems with clipping on an input , they may use sip to solely hear that channel , so that the problem can be diagnosed and addressed sip is potentially disastrous if engaged accidentally during a performance , as it will mute all the channels except one , so most consoles require the operator to take very deliberate actions to engage sip these are usually sliders near the front of the mixing board , although some smaller mixers use rotary controls to save space the signals are summed to create the main mix , or combined on a bus as a submix , a group of channels that are then added as a whole to the final mix mixed signals - studying the basics of a mixer 's signal flow since no sub-mix is created , it is not possible to insert processing such as compressors into a vca/dca group in addition , on most vca-equipped consoles , post-fader auxiliary send levels are affected by the vca master this is usually desirable , as post-fader auxiliary sends are commonly used for effects such as reverb , and sends to these effects should track changes in the channel signal level the master control section is used to adjust the levels of the overall output of the mixer subgroup and main output fader controls are often found together on the right hand side of the mixer or , on larger consoles , in a center section flanked by banks of input channels there are usually one or more vu or peak meters to indicate the levels for each channel , for the master outputs and to indicate whether the console levels are clipping the signal the sound engineer typically adjusts the gain of the input signals to get the strongest signal that can be obtained without causing clipping the meters may be above the input and master sections or they may be integrated into the input and master sections themselves public address systems in schools , hospitals and other institutions use a mixing console to set microphones to an appropriate level and can add in recorded sounds such as music into the mix most rock and pop bands use a mixing console to combine musical instruments and vocals so that the mix can be amplified through a nightclub 's pa system aux-send board mix console automation dj mixer electronic mixer pan law vision mixervideo version of a mixing console

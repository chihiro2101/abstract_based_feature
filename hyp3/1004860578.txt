a mixing console is also known as an audio mixer , audio console , mixing desk , sound mixer , soundboard , or simply as board or mixer the channel input strips are usually a bank of identical monaural or stereo input channels arranged in columns the types of inputs that can be plugged into a mixer depend on the intended purpose of the mixer a mixer intended for a live venue or a recording studio typically has a range of input jacks , such as xlr connectors for microphones and the outputs from di boxes , and 1/4 '' jacks for line level sources a dj mixer typically has rca connector inputs for pre-recorded music being played back on turntables or cd players , and a single mic input the channel strips are typically numbered so that the audio engineer can identify the different channels for each channel input , a mixer provides one or more input jacks on mid- to- large-sized live venue and sound recording consoles , these input jacks are numbered as well and consolidated in a patch bay the input strip is usually separated into sections : input jacks microphone preamplifiers equalization dynamics processing ( e.g depending on the specific mixer , each channel is stereo or monaural on most mixers , each channel has an xlr input , and many have rca or quarter-inch trs phone connector line inputs the smallest , least expensive mixers may only have one xlr input with the other inputs being line inputs the auxiliary send routes a split of the incoming signal to an auxiliary bus , which can then be routed to external devices most live radio broadcasting sound boards send audio through program channels other program channels may feed one or more computers used for editing or sound playback another program channel may be used to send audio to the talent 's headset if they are broadcasting from a remote area further channel controls affect the equalization of the signal by separately attenuating or boosting a range of frequency many high-end mixing consoles have parametric equalizer on each channel the cue system allows the operator to listen to one or more selected signals without affecting the console 's main outputs a sound engineer can use the cue feature to , for instance , get a sound recording they wish to play soon cued up to the start point of a song , without the listeners hearing these actions the signal from the cue system is fed to the console 's headphone amp and may also be available as a line-level output that is intended to drive a monitor speaker system when cue is enabled on multiple channels , a mix of these signals is heard through the cue system it typically is controlled by the cue button , but unlike cue , sip affects the output mix ; it mutes everything except the channel or channels being soloed sip is useful for setup of a mixing board and troubleshooting , in that it allows the operator to quickly mute everything but the signal being adjusted each channel on a mixer has a volume control ( fader ) that allows adjustment of the level of that channel these are usually sliders near the front of the mixing board , although some smaller mixers use rotary controls to save space the signals are summed to create the main mix , or combined on a bus as a submix , a group of channels that are then added as a whole to the final mix for instance , many drum mics could be grouped into a bus , and then the proportion of drums in the final mix can be controlled with one bus fader mixed signals - studying the basics of a mixer 's signal flow a bus can often be processed just like an individual input channel , allowing the engineer to process a whole group of signals at once some higher-end consoles use voltage-controlled amplifier ( vca ) vcas function somewhat like a submix but let the operator control the level of multiple input channels with a single fader the audio signals from the assigned channels remain routed independently of vca assignments talkback controls allow conversation with the artist through their monitors , headphones or in-ear monitor most , but not all , audio mixers can use monaural signals to produce simulated stereo sound through panning some mixing consoles , particularly those designed for broadcast and live sound , include facilities for mirroring two consoles , making both consoles exact copies of each other with the same inputs and outputs , the same settings , and the same audio mix on the other hand , many digital mixers allow for extremely easy building of a mix from saved data compared with other mixers that are used in sound recording and live sound , dj mixers have far fewer inputs aux-send board mix console automation dj mixer electronic mixer pan law vision mixervideo version of a mixing console

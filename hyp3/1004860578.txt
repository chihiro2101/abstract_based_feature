a mixing console is also known as an audio mixer , audio console , mixing desk , sound mixer , soundboard , or simply as board or mixer the channel input strips are usually a bank of identical monaural or stereo input channels arranged in columns a mixer intended for a live venue or a recording studio typically has a range of input jacks , such as xlr connectors for microphones and the outputs from di boxes , and 1/4 '' jacks for line level sources some higher-priced mixers have a parametric equalizer or a semi-parametric equalizer for one or more of the equalizer frequency bands , often the middle range for each channel input , a mixer provides one or more input jacks on mid- to- large-sized live venue and sound recording consoles , these input jacks are numbered as well and consolidated in a patch bay on smaller mixers , the input jacks may be mounted on the top panel of the mixer to facilitate the connection and disconnection of inputs during the use of the mixer the input strip is usually separated into sections : input jacks microphone preamplifiers equalization dynamics processing ( e.g , a singer 's vocal mic , the signal from an electric bass amp 's di box , etc the first knob at the top of an input strip is typically a trim or gain control the input/preamp conditions the signal from the external device and this controls the amount of amplification or attenuation that is applied to the input signal to bring it to a nominal level for processing for some very strong line level signals , the signal that is plugged into the mixer may be too strong , and cause audio clipping audio engineers typically aim at achieving a good gain structure for each channel to obtain a good gain structure , engineers usually raise the gain as high as they can before audio clipping results ; this helps to provide the best signal to noise ratio a mixing console may provide insert points after the input gain stage the auxiliary send routes a split of the incoming signal to an auxiliary bus , which can then be routed to external devices auxiliary sends can either be pre-fader or post-fader , in that the level of a pre-fader send is set by the auxiliary send control , whereas post-fade sends depend on the position of the channel fader as well pre-fade auxiliary sends can provide a monitor mix to musicians on stage ( which they hear through monitor speakers pointing at the performers or in-ear monitors ) ; this mix is thus independent of the main mix produced by the faders another program channel may be used to send audio to the talent 's headset if they are broadcasting from a remote area some mixers have a general equalization control ( either graphic or parametric ) at the output , for controlling the tone of the overall mix the cue system allows the operator to listen to one or more selected signals without affecting the console 's main outputs the signal from the cue system is fed to the console 's headphone amp and may also be available as a line-level output that is intended to drive a monitor speaker system the terms afl ( after-fader listen ) and pfl ( pre-fader listen ) are used to describe respectively whether or not the level of the cue signal for an input is controlled by the corresponding fader it typically is controlled by the cue button , but unlike cue , sip affects the output mix ; it mutes everything except the channel or channels being soloed sip is potentially disastrous if engaged accidentally during a performance , as it will mute all the channels except one , so most consoles require the operator to take very deliberate actions to engage sip each channel on a mixer has a volume control ( fader ) that allows adjustment of the level of that channel these are usually sliders near the front of the mixing board , although some smaller mixers use rotary controls to save space mixed signals - studying the basics of a mixer 's signal flow a bus can often be processed just like an individual input channel , allowing the engineer to process a whole group of signals at once some higher-end consoles use voltage-controlled amplifier ( vca ) vcas function somewhat like a submix but let the operator control the level of multiple input channels with a single fader since no sub-mix is created , it is not possible to insert processing such as compressors into a vca/dca group this is usually desirable , as post-fader auxiliary sends are commonly used for effects such as reverb , and sends to these effects should track changes in the channel signal level the master control section is used to adjust the levels of the overall output of the mixer the master control section on a large live venue or sound recording mixer typically has sub-group faders , master faders , master auxiliary mixing bus level controls and auxiliary return level controls matrix routing is often contained in this master section , as are headphone and local loudspeaker monitoring controls most , but not all , audio mixers can use monaural signals to produce simulated stereo sound through panning both digital and analog mixers rely on analog microphone preamplifiers , a high-gain circuit that increases the low signal level from a microphone to a level that is better matched to the console 's internal operating level the tones generated from a no-input mixer are created by connecting an output of the mixer into an input channel and manipulating the pitch with the mixer 's dials

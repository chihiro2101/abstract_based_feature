a mixing console is also known as an audio mixer , audio console , mixing desk , sound mixer , soundboard , or simply as board or mixer typically , each channel 's column contains a number of rotary potentiometer knobs , buttons , and faders for controlling the gain of the input preamplifier , adjusting the equalization of the signal on each channel , controlling routing of the input signal to other functional sections , and adjusting the channel 's contribution to the overall mix being produced the types of inputs that can be plugged into a mixer depend on the intended purpose of the mixer a mixer intended for a live venue or a recording studio typically has a range of input jacks , such as xlr connectors for microphones and the outputs from di boxes , and 1/4 '' jacks for line level sources some higher-priced mixers have a parametric equalizer or a semi-parametric equalizer for one or more of the equalizer frequency bands , often the middle range for each channel input , a mixer provides one or more input jacks on mid- to- large-sized live venue and sound recording consoles , these input jacks are numbered as well and consolidated in a patch bay on smaller mixers , the input jacks may be mounted on the top panel of the mixer to facilitate the connection and disconnection of inputs during the use of the mixer , a singer 's vocal mic , the signal from an electric bass amp 's di box , etc on most mixers , each channel has an xlr input , and many have rca or quarter-inch trs phone connector line inputs the smallest , least expensive mixers may only have one xlr input with the other inputs being line inputs the first knob at the top of an input strip is typically a trim or gain control the input/preamp conditions the signal from the external device and this controls the amount of amplification or attenuation that is applied to the input signal to bring it to a nominal level for processing for some very strong line level signals , the signal that is plugged into the mixer may be too strong , and cause audio clipping a mixing console may provide insert points after the input gain stage auxiliary sends can either be pre-fader or post-fader , in that the level of a pre-fader send is set by the auxiliary send control , whereas post-fade sends depend on the position of the channel fader as well auxiliary sends can send the signal to an external processor such as a reverb , with the return signal routed through another channel or designated auxiliary return when a given channel button is selected , the audio will be sent to that device or transmitter other program channels may feed one or more computers used for editing or sound playback another program channel may be used to send audio to the talent 's headset if they are broadcasting from a remote area most mid-range and higher-priced mixers have bass , midrange , and treble , or even additional mid-range controls ( e.g some mixers have a general equalization control ( either graphic or parametric ) at the output , for controlling the tone of the overall mix the cue system allows the operator to listen to one or more selected signals without affecting the console 's main outputs a sound engineer can use the cue feature to , for instance , get a sound recording they wish to play soon cued up to the start point of a song , without the listeners hearing these actions the signal from the cue system is fed to the console 's headphone amp and may also be available as a line-level output that is intended to drive a monitor speaker system for instance , many drum mics could be grouped into a bus , and then the proportion of drums in the final mix can be controlled with one bus fader once again using the drum kit example , the use of bus-processing can enable the sound engineer to run all of the drum kit through an audio compressor effect to reduce unwanted signal peaks , rather than having to route all of the 10 or more mic signals on the drum kit individually the master control section is used to adjust the levels of the overall output of the mixer the master control section on a large live venue or sound recording mixer typically has sub-group faders , master faders , master auxiliary mixing bus level controls and auxiliary return level controls the sound engineer typically adjusts the gain of the input signals to get the strongest signal that can be obtained without causing clipping on meters using leds , there may be different colored leds to indicate when there is signal present in the channel 's input ; the audio level of the channel , typically by lighting up more leds ; and clipping , which may be indicated using a different colored led as the human ear experiences audio level in a logarithmic fashion , mixing console controls and displays are almost always labeled in decibels , a logarithmic measurement system in live sound , the cables from the onstage microphones and instrument outputs are not typically plugged directly into the mixer , because this would require a large number of individual cables to go from the stage to the mixer in addition , digital consoles often include processing capabilities such as compression , gating , reverb , automatic feedback suppression and delay for recorded sound , the mixing process can be performed on screen , using computer software and associated input , output and recording hardware public address systems in schools , hospitals and other institutions use a mixing console to set microphones to an appropriate level and can add in recorded sounds such as music into the mix compared with other mixers that are used in sound recording and live sound , dj mixers have far fewer inputs aux-send board mix console automation dj mixer electronic mixer pan law vision mixervideo version of a mixing console

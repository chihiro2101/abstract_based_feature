a mixing console is also known as an audio mixer , audio console , mixing desk , sound mixer , soundboard , or simply as board or mixer the channel input strips are usually a bank of identical monaural or stereo input channels arranged in columns a mixer intended for a live venue or a recording studio typically has a range of input jacks , such as xlr connectors for microphones and the outputs from di boxes , and 1/4 '' jacks for line level sources some higher-priced mixers have a parametric equalizer or a semi-parametric equalizer for one or more of the equalizer frequency bands , often the middle range for each channel input , a mixer provides one or more input jacks on smaller mixers , the input jacks may be mounted on the top panel of the mixer to facilitate the connection and disconnection of inputs during the use of the mixer , a singer 's vocal mic , the signal from an electric bass amp 's di box , etc ) that is plugged into the mixer has its own channel on most mixers , each channel has an xlr input , and many have rca or quarter-inch trs phone connector line inputs the smallest , least expensive mixers may only have one xlr input with the other inputs being line inputs balanced inputs and connectors , such as xlr or phone connectors that have been specifically wired as balanced lines , reduce interference problems for signals that are too strong , a 15 & nbsp ; db or 20 & nbsp ; db pad can be used to attenuate the signal audio engineers typically aim at achieving a good gain structure for each channel a mixing console may provide insert points after the input gain stage auxiliary sends can either be pre-fader or post-fader , in that the level of a pre-fader send is set by the auxiliary send control , whereas post-fade sends depend on the position of the channel fader as well pre-fade auxiliary sends can provide a monitor mix to musicians on stage ( which they hear through monitor speakers pointing at the performers or in-ear monitors ) ; this mix is thus independent of the main mix produced by the faders program 1 is typically the on-air live feed , or what those listening to the broadcast will hear other program channels may feed one or more computers used for editing or sound playback another program channel may be used to send audio to the talent 's headset if they are broadcasting from a remote area the smallest , least expensive mixers may only have bass and treble controls some mixers have a general equalization control ( either graphic or parametric ) at the output , for controlling the tone of the overall mix the signal from the cue system is fed to the console 's headphone amp and may also be available as a line-level output that is intended to drive a monitor speaker system when cue is enabled on multiple channels , a mix of these signals is heard through the cue system it typically is controlled by the cue button , but unlike cue , sip affects the output mix ; it mutes everything except the channel or channels being soloed these are usually sliders near the front of the mixing board , although some smaller mixers use rotary controls to save space mixed signals - studying the basics of a mixer 's signal flow subgroup and main output fader controls are often found together on the right hand side of the mixer or , on larger consoles , in a center section flanked by banks of input channels matrix routing is often contained in this master section , as are headphone and local loudspeaker monitoring controls a test tone generator might be located in the master output section aux returns such as those signals returning from external processors are often in the master section these are either individual bus outputs or auxiliary outputs , used , for instance , to output a different mix to onstage monitors the meters may be above the input and master sections or they may be integrated into the input and master sections themselves as the human ear experiences audio level in a logarithmic fashion , mixing console controls and displays are almost always labeled in decibels , a logarithmic measurement system patch bays are more common in recording mixers than live sound mixers some mixers can add onboard external effect units ( reverb , echo , delay ) digital mixers have an unavoidable amount of latency , ranging from less than 1 & nbsp ; ms to as much as 10 & nbsp ; ms , depending on the model of digital mixer and what functions are engaged compared with other mixers that are used in sound recording and live sound , dj mixers have far fewer inputs aux-send board mix console automation dj mixer electronic mixer pan law vision mixervideo version of a mixing console

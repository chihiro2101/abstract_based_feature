thumb the first cyrix product for the personal computer market was a x87 compatible fpu coprocessor cyrix fasmath 82s87 , a 80287-compatible chip , was developed from the cyrix 83d87 and has been available since 1991 cyrix would later release the cyrix 486srx2 and 486drx2 , which were essentially clock-doubled versions of the slc and dlc , marketed exclusively to consumers as 386-to-486 upgrades eventually , cyrix was able to release the cyrix cx486s and later cyrix cx486dx that was pin-compatible with its intel 486 counterparts however , the chips were later to market than amd 's 486s and benchmarked slightly slower than amd and intel counterparts , which relegated them to the budget and upgrade market while amd had been able to sell some of its 486s to large oems , notably acer and compaq , cyrix had not the cyrix chips did gain some following with upgraders , as their 50- , 66- , and 80 & nbsp ; mhz 486 cpus ran at 5 & nbsp ; v , rather than the 3.3 & nbsp ; v used by amd , making the cyrix chips usable as upgrades in early 486 motherboards like intel 's pentium overdrive , the cyrix 5x86 used a 32-bit external data bus this processor continued the cyrix tradition of making faster replacements for intel designed sockets however , the 6x86 was the star performer in the range , giving a claimed performance boost over the intel '' equivalent '' 6x86 processors were given names such as p166+ indicating a performance better than a pentium 166 & nbsp ; mhz processor while the 6x86 quickly gained a following among computer enthusiasts and independent computer shops , unlike amd , its chips had yet to be used by a major oem customer this potential speed boost would have benefited not just cyrix 's users , but also users of amd 's k5 and especially of the 486 it was due to begin production in q4 & nbsp ; 1999 and launch in the year 2000 on a 0.18 & nbsp ; micron process with a die size of 110â€“120 & nbsp ; mm 2 since a 6x86 running at 133 & nbsp ; mhz generally benchmarked slightly faster than a pentium running at 166 & nbsp ; mhz , the 133 & nbsp ; mhz 6x86 was marketed as the 6x86-p166+ legal action from intel , who objected to the use of the strings '' p166 '' and '' p200 '' in non-pentium products , led to cyrix adding the letter '' r '' to its names although amd also used the pr numbers for its early k5 chips , it soon abandoned that nomenclature with the introduction of the k6 thumb cyrix had always been a fabless company : cyrix designed and sold their own chips , but contracted the actual semiconductor manufacturing to an outside foundry in 1994 , following a series of disagreements with ti , and production difficulties at sgs thomson , cyrix turned to ibm microelectronics , whose production technology rivaled that of intel ibm instead sold its 6x86 chips on the open market , competing directly against cyrix and sometimes undercutting cyrix 's prices unlike amd , cyrix had never manufactured or sold intel designs under a negotiated license in cyrix 's first product , the 8087 math co-processor , cyrix used hardware math multipliers rather than the cordic algorithm , which allowed the chip to be faster and more accurate than intel 's co-processor with the mii 's 83 & nbsp ; mhz bus , this resulted in the pci bus running alarmingly out-of-spec at 41.5 & nbsp ; mhz some motherboards supported a 1/3 divider , which resulted in the cyrix pci bus running at 27.7 & nbsp ; mhz via used the cyrix name on a chip designed by centaur technology , since via believed cyrix had better name recognition than centaur , or possibly even via additionally , the acquisition of cyrix 's intellectual property and agreements would be used by via technologies to defend itself from its own legal troubles with intel , even after via stopped using the cyrix name

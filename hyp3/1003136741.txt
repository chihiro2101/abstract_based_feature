thumb the first cyrix product for the personal computer market was a x87 compatible fpu coprocessor cyrix fasmath 82s87 , a 80287-compatible chip , was developed from the cyrix 83d87 and has been available since 1991 cyrix would later release the cyrix 486srx2 and 486drx2 , which were essentially clock-doubled versions of the slc and dlc , marketed exclusively to consumers as 386-to-486 upgrades unlike the slc/dlc , these chips contained internal cache coherency circuitry which made the chips compatible with older 386 motherboards that did not have extra circuitry or bios routines to keep the cache current eventually , cyrix was able to release the cyrix cx486s and later cyrix cx486dx that was pin-compatible with its intel 486 counterparts the cyrix chips did gain some following with upgraders , as their 50- , 66- , and 80 & nbsp ; mhz 486 cpus ran at 5 & nbsp ; v , rather than the 3.3 & nbsp ; v used by amd , making the cyrix chips usable as upgrades in early 486 motherboards in 1995 , with its pentium clone not yet ready to ship , cyrix repeated its own history and released the cyrix cx5x86 ( m1sc ) , which plugged into a 3.3v 486 socket , ran at 80 , 100 , 120 , or 133 & nbsp ; mhz , and yielded performance comparable to that of a pentium running at 75 & nbsp ; mhz like intel 's pentium overdrive , the cyrix 5x86 used a 32-bit external data bus later in 1995 , cyrix released its best-known chip , the cyrix 6x86 ( m1 ) this processor continued the cyrix tradition of making faster replacements for intel designed sockets 6x86 processors were given names such as p166+ indicating a performance better than a pentium 166 & nbsp ; mhz processor this potential speed boost would have benefited not just cyrix 's users , but also users of amd 's k5 and especially of the 486 the cyrix mii , based on the 6x86mx design , was little more than a name change intended to help the chip compete better with the pentium ii the media gxi implementation was released in february 1997 ; intended for the mobile computing market , it had clock speeds of 120 & nbsp ; mhz to 180 & nbsp ; mhz , and had integrated graphics and audio controllers , making it useful for compact notebook computers later that year , cyrix was acquired by national semiconductor the design 's initial clock speed target was 600-800 & nbsp ; mhz with headroom to scale to 1 & nbsp ; ghz and beyond via did , however , continue producing late-generation cyrix chips for a while , such as the via cyrix iii ( also known as cyrix 3 or via c3 ) , a 600 & nbsp ; mhz cpu with a 100 & nbsp ; mhz bus since a 6x86 running at 133 & nbsp ; mhz generally benchmarked slightly faster than a pentium running at 166 & nbsp ; mhz , the 133 & nbsp ; mhz 6x86 was marketed as the 6x86-p166+ additionally , since the 6x86 's price encouraged its use in budget systems , performance could drop even further when compared with pentium systems that were using faster hard drives , video cards , sound cards , and modems although amd also used the pr numbers for its early k5 chips , it soon abandoned that nomenclature with the introduction of the k6 however , it would use a similar concept in marketing its later cpus , starting again with the athlon xp thumb cyrix had always been a fabless company : cyrix designed and sold their own chips , but contracted the actual semiconductor manufacturing to an outside foundry whether national semiconductor doubted cyrix 's ability to produce high-performance chips or feared competing with intel at the high end of the market is open to debate cyrix , whose processors had been considered a performance product in 1996 , had fallen to the mid-range , then to the entry level , and then to the fringe of the entry level , and was in danger of completely losing its market by the time national semiconductor sold cyrix to via technologies , the design team was no more and the market for the mii had disappeared additionally , the acquisition of cyrix 's intellectual property and agreements would be used by via technologies to defend itself from its own legal troubles with intel , even after via stopped using the cyrix name

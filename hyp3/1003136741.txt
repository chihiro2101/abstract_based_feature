thumb the first cyrix product for the personal computer market was a x87 compatible fpu coprocessor cyrix fasmath 82s87 , a 80287-compatible chip , was developed from the cyrix 83d87 and has been available since 1991 the chips were mostly used as upgrades by end users looking to improve performance of an aging 386 and especially by dealers , who by changing the cpu could turn slow-selling 386 boards into budget 486 boards cyrix would later release the cyrix 486srx2 and 486drx2 , which were essentially clock-doubled versions of the slc and dlc , marketed exclusively to consumers as 386-to-486 upgrades eventually , cyrix was able to release the cyrix cx486s and later cyrix cx486dx that was pin-compatible with its intel 486 counterparts however , the chips were later to market than amd 's 486s and benchmarked slightly slower than amd and intel counterparts , which relegated them to the budget and upgrade market the cyrix chips did gain some following with upgraders , as their 50- , 66- , and 80 & nbsp ; mhz 486 cpus ran at 5 & nbsp ; v , rather than the 3.3 & nbsp ; v used by amd , making the cyrix chips usable as upgrades in early 486 motherboards in 1995 , with its pentium clone not yet ready to ship , cyrix repeated its own history and released the cyrix cx5x86 ( m1sc ) , which plugged into a 3.3v 486 socket , ran at 80 , 100 , 120 , or 133 & nbsp ; mhz , and yielded performance comparable to that of a pentium running at 75 & nbsp ; mhz like intel 's pentium overdrive , the cyrix 5x86 used a 32-bit external data bus while amd 's am5x86 was little more than a clock-quadrupled 486 with a new name , cyrix 's 5x86 implemented some pentium-like features later in 1995 , cyrix released its best-known chip , the cyrix 6x86 ( m1 ) this processor continued the cyrix tradition of making faster replacements for intel designed sockets 6x86 processors were given names such as p166+ indicating a performance better than a pentium 166 & nbsp ; mhz processor unlike previous 3d games , quake used the pipelined pentium fpu to do perspective correction calculations in the background while texture mapping , effectively doing two tasks at once the jalapeño design facilitated close integration between the core and the advanced 3d graphics engine , which was one of the first graphics subsystems to utilize a dual-issue fpu it was due to begin production in q4 & nbsp ; 1999 and launch in the year 2000 on a 0.18 & nbsp ; micron process with a die size of 110–120 & nbsp ; mm 2 it is unclear how advanced development on this core was when cyrix was acquired from national semiconductor by via technologies and the project discontinued via did , however , continue producing late-generation cyrix chips for a while , such as the via cyrix iii ( also known as cyrix 3 or via c3 ) , a 600 & nbsp ; mhz cpu with a 100 & nbsp ; mhz bus legal action from intel , who objected to the use of the strings '' p166 '' and '' p200 '' in non-pentium products , led to cyrix adding the letter '' r '' to its names as part of the manufacturing agreement between the two companies , ibm received the right to build and sell cyrix-designed cpus under the ibm name ibm instead sold its 6x86 chips on the open market , competing directly against cyrix and sometimes undercutting cyrix 's prices in cyrix 's first product , the 8087 math co-processor , cyrix used hardware math multipliers rather than the cordic algorithm , which allowed the chip to be faster and more accurate than intel 's co-processor thus , while amd 's 386s and even 486s had some intel-written microcode software , cyrix 's designs were completely independent national semiconductor ran into financial trouble soon after the cyrix merger , and these problems hurt cyrix as well by 1999 , amd and intel were leapfrogging one another in clock speeds , reaching 450 & nbsp ; mhz and beyond , while cyrix took almost a year to push the mii from pr-300 to pr-333 some motherboards supported a 1/3 divider , which resulted in the cyrix pci bus running at 27.7 & nbsp ; mhz

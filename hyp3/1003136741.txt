thumb the first cyrix product for the personal computer market was a x87 compatible fpu coprocessor cyrix fasmath 82s87 , a 80287-compatible chip , was developed from the cyrix 83d87 and has been available since 1991 the chips were widely criticized in product reviews for not offering the performance suggested by their names , and for the confusion caused by their naming similarity with intel 's sl line and ibm 's slc line of cpus , neither of which was related to cyrix 's slc cyrix would later release the cyrix 486srx2 and 486drx2 , which were essentially clock-doubled versions of the slc and dlc , marketed exclusively to consumers as 386-to-486 upgrades eventually , cyrix was able to release the cyrix cx486s and later cyrix cx486dx that was pin-compatible with its intel 486 counterparts however , the chips were later to market than amd 's 486s and benchmarked slightly slower than amd and intel counterparts , which relegated them to the budget and upgrade market the cyrix chips did gain some following with upgraders , as their 50- , 66- , and 80 & nbsp ; mhz 486 cpus ran at 5 & nbsp ; v , rather than the 3.3 & nbsp ; v used by amd , making the cyrix chips usable as upgrades in early 486 motherboards like intel 's pentium overdrive , the cyrix 5x86 used a 32-bit external data bus this processor continued the cyrix tradition of making faster replacements for intel designed sockets 6x86 processors were given names such as p166+ indicating a performance better than a pentium 166 & nbsp ; mhz processor this potential speed boost would have benefited not just cyrix 's users , but also users of amd 's k5 and especially of the 486 the cyrix mii , based on the 6x86mx design , was little more than a name change intended to help the chip compete better with the pentium ii in 1996 , cyrix released the mediagx cpu , which integrated all of the major discrete components of a pc , including sound and video , onto one chip initially based on the old 5x86 technology and running at 120 or 133 & nbsp ; mhz , its performance was widely criticized but its low price made it successful later that year , cyrix was acquired by national semiconductor the design 's initial clock speed target was 600-800 & nbsp ; mhz with headroom to scale to 1 & nbsp ; ghz and beyond it is unclear how advanced development on this core was when cyrix was acquired from national semiconductor by via technologies and the project discontinued via did , however , continue producing late-generation cyrix chips for a while , such as the via cyrix iii ( also known as cyrix 3 or via c3 ) , a 600 & nbsp ; mhz cpu with a 100 & nbsp ; mhz bus additionally , since the 6x86 's price encouraged its use in budget systems , performance could drop even further when compared with pentium systems that were using faster hard drives , video cards , sound cards , and modems thumb cyrix had always been a fabless company : cyrix designed and sold their own chips , but contracted the actual semiconductor manufacturing to an outside foundry in the early days , cyrix mostly used texas instruments production facilities and sgs thomson ( now stmicroelectronics ) intel lost the cyrix case , which included multiple lawsuits in both federal and state courts in texas the settlement did n't say whether the pentium pro violated cyrix patents or not ; it simply allowed intel to carry on making products under a license from cyrix national semiconductor ran into financial trouble soon after the cyrix merger , and these problems hurt cyrix as well left thumb the last cyrix-badged microprocessor was the cyrix mii-433gp which ran at 300 & nbsp ; mhz ( 100 & nbsp ; Ã— & nbsp ; 3 ) and performed faster than an amd & nbsp ; k6/2-300 on fpu calculations ( as benched with dr by the time national semiconductor sold cyrix to via technologies , the design team was no more and the market for the mii had disappeared

thumb the first cyrix product for the personal computer market was a x87 compatible fpu coprocessor cyrix fasmath 82s87 , a 80287-compatible chip , was developed from the cyrix 83d87 and has been available since 1991 cyrix would later release the cyrix 486srx2 and 486drx2 , which were essentially clock-doubled versions of the slc and dlc , marketed exclusively to consumers as 386-to-486 upgrades unlike the slc/dlc , these chips contained internal cache coherency circuitry which made the chips compatible with older 386 motherboards that did not have extra circuitry or bios routines to keep the cache current eventually , cyrix was able to release the cyrix cx486s and later cyrix cx486dx that was pin-compatible with its intel 486 counterparts the cyrix chips did gain some following with upgraders , as their 50- , 66- , and 80 & nbsp ; mhz 486 cpus ran at 5 & nbsp ; v , rather than the 3.3 & nbsp ; v used by amd , making the cyrix chips usable as upgrades in early 486 motherboards later in 1995 , cyrix released its best-known chip , the cyrix 6x86 ( m1 ) however , the 6x86 was the star performer in the range , giving a claimed performance boost over the intel '' equivalent '' initially , cyrix tried to charge a premium for the cyrix-claimed extra performance , but the 6x86 's math coprocessor was not as fast as that in the intel pentium the main difference was not one of actual computing performance on the coprocessor , but a lack of instruction pipelining unlike previous 3d games , quake used the pipelined pentium fpu to do perspective correction calculations in the background while texture mapping , effectively doing two tasks at once quake also lacked the option to disable perspective correction , thus eliminating that potential speed boost for fpu-weak cpus this potential speed boost would have benefited not just cyrix 's users , but also users of amd 's k5 and especially of the 486 the cyrix mii , based on the 6x86mx design , was little more than a name change intended to help the chip compete better with the pentium ii in 1996 , cyrix released the mediagx cpu , which integrated all of the major discrete components of a pc , including sound and video , onto one chip later versions of the mediagx ran at speeds of up to 333 & nbsp ; mhz and added mmx support later that year , cyrix was acquired by national semiconductor the jalape√±o design facilitated close integration between the core and the advanced 3d graphics engine , which was one of the first graphics subsystems to utilize a dual-issue fpu via did , however , continue producing late-generation cyrix chips for a while , such as the via cyrix iii ( also known as cyrix 3 or via c3 ) , a 600 & nbsp ; mhz cpu with a 100 & nbsp ; mhz bus although amd also used the pr numbers for its early k5 chips , it soon abandoned that nomenclature with the introduction of the k6 in the early days , cyrix mostly used texas instruments production facilities and sgs thomson ( now stmicroelectronics ) in 1994 , following a series of disagreements with ti , and production difficulties at sgs thomson , cyrix turned to ibm microelectronics , whose production technology rivaled that of intel whether national semiconductor doubted cyrix 's ability to produce high-performance chips or feared competing with intel at the high end of the market is open to debate national semiconductor ran into financial trouble soon after the cyrix merger , and these problems hurt cyrix as well some motherboards supported a 1/3 divider , which resulted in the cyrix pci bus running at 27.7 & nbsp ; mhz by the time national semiconductor sold cyrix to via technologies , the design team was no more and the market for the mii had disappeared

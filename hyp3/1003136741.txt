cyrix fasmath 82s87 , a 80287-compatible chip , was developed from the cyrix 83d87 and has been available since 1991 the chips were mostly used as upgrades by end users looking to improve performance of an aging 386 and especially by dealers , who by changing the cpu could turn slow-selling 386 boards into budget 486 boards cyrix would later release the cyrix 486srx2 and 486drx2 , which were essentially clock-doubled versions of the slc and dlc , marketed exclusively to consumers as 386-to-486 upgrades eventually , cyrix was able to release the cyrix cx486s and later cyrix cx486dx that was pin-compatible with its intel 486 counterparts the cyrix chips did gain some following with upgraders , as their 50- , 66- , and 80 & nbsp ; mhz 486 cpus ran at 5 & nbsp ; v , rather than the 3.3 & nbsp ; v used by amd , making the cyrix chips usable as upgrades in early 486 motherboards in 1995 , with its pentium clone not yet ready to ship , cyrix repeated its own history and released the cyrix cx5x86 ( m1sc ) , which plugged into a 3.3v 486 socket , ran at 80 , 100 , 120 , or 133 & nbsp ; mhz , and yielded performance comparable to that of a pentium running at 75 & nbsp ; mhz while amd 's am5x86 was little more than a clock-quadrupled 486 with a new name , cyrix 's 5x86 implemented some pentium-like features later in 1995 , cyrix released its best-known chip , the cyrix 6x86 ( m1 ) initially , cyrix tried to charge a premium for the cyrix-claimed extra performance , but the 6x86 's math coprocessor was not as fast as that in the intel pentium quake also lacked the option to disable perspective correction , thus eliminating that potential speed boost for fpu-weak cpus this potential speed boost would have benefited not just cyrix 's users , but also users of amd 's k5 and especially of the 486 the mediagx led to cyrix 's first big win , with compaq using it in its lowest-priced presario 2100 and 2200 computers this led to further mediagx sales to packard bell and also seemed to give cyrix legitimacy , with 6x86 sales to both packard bell and emachines following the jalape√±o design facilitated close integration between the core and the advanced 3d graphics engine , which was one of the first graphics subsystems to utilize a dual-issue fpu it is unclear how advanced development on this core was when cyrix was acquired from national semiconductor by via technologies and the project discontinued legal action from intel , who objected to the use of the strings '' p166 '' and '' p200 '' in non-pentium products , led to cyrix adding the letter '' r '' to its names thumb cyrix had always been a fabless company : cyrix designed and sold their own chips , but contracted the actual semiconductor manufacturing to an outside foundry in the early days , cyrix mostly used texas instruments production facilities and sgs thomson ( now stmicroelectronics ) unlike amd , cyrix had never manufactured or sold intel designs under a negotiated license in cyrix 's first product , the 8087 math co-processor , cyrix used hardware math multipliers rather than the cordic algorithm , which allowed the chip to be faster and more accurate than intel 's co-processor focused on removing potential competitors , intel spent many years in legal battles with cyrix , consuming cyrix financial resources , claiming that the cyrix 486 violated intel 's patents , when in reality the design was proven independent cyrix was free to have their products manufactured by any manufacturer that had a cross-license with intel , which included sgs thomson , ibm , and others in august 1997 , while the litigation was still in progress , cyrix merged with national semiconductor ( who also already held an intel cross-license ) by the time national semiconductor sold cyrix to via technologies , the design team was no more and the market for the mii had disappeared additionally , the acquisition of cyrix 's intellectual property and agreements would be used by via technologies to defend itself from its own legal troubles with intel , even after via stopped using the cyrix name in the machinima series freeman 's mind , ross scott as gordon freeman ( of the half-life video game franchise ) curses cyrix processors as a computer breaks in episode 3 .

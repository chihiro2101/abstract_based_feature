the book of the dead developed from a tradition of funerary manuscripts dating back to the egyptian old kingdom the first funerary texts were the pyramid texts , first used in the pyramid of king unas of the 5th dynasty , around 2400 bce the pyramid texts were written in an unusual hieroglyphic style ; many of the hieroglyphs representing humans or animals were left incomplete or drawn mutilated , most likely to prevent them causing any harm to the dead pharaoh 54 the purpose of the pyramid texts was to help the dead king take his place amongst the gods , in particular to reunite him with his divine father ra ; at this period the afterlife was seen as being in the sky , rather than the underworld described in the book of the dead in the middle kingdom , a new funerary text emerged , the coffin texts the coffin texts used a newer version of the language , new spells , and included illustrations for the first time the coffin texts were most commonly written on the inner surfaces of coffins , though they are occasionally found on tomb walls or on papyri the coffin texts were available to wealthy private individuals , vastly increasing the number of people who could expect to participate in the afterlife ; a process which has been described as the '' democratization of the afterlife '' the earliest known occurrence of the spells included in the book of the dead is from the coffin of queen mentuhotep , of the 13th dynasty , where the new spells were included amongst older texts known from the pyramid texts and coffin texts taylor 2010 , p.34 by the 17th dynasty , the book of the dead had become widespread not only for members of the royal family , but courtiers and other officials as well at this stage , the spells were typically inscribed on linen shrouds wrapped around the dead , though occasionally they are found written on coffins or on papyrus the famous spell 125 , the 'weighing of the heart ' , is first known from the reign of hatshepsut and thutmose iii , c.1475 bce from this period onward the book of the dead was typically written on a papyrus scroll , and the text illustrated with vignettes taylor 2010 , p.35 & ndash ; 7 in the third intermediate period , the book of the dead started to appear in hieratic script , as well as in the traditional hieroglyphics taylor 2010 , p.57 & ndash ; 8 during the 25th and 26th dynasty , the book of the dead was updated , revised and standardised this standardised version is known today as the 'saite recension ' , after the saite ( 26th ) dynasty the book of the dead is made up of a number of individual texts and their accompanying illustrations this ambiguity reflects the similarity in egyptian thought between ritual speech and magical power faulkner 1994 , p.145 ; taylor 2010 , p.29 in the context of the book of the dead , it is typically translated as either chapter or spell some are intended to give the deceased mystical knowledge in the afterlife , or perhaps to identify them with the gods : for instance , spell 17 is an obscure and lengthy description of the god atum taylor 2010 , p.51 , 56 others are incantations to ensure the different elements of the dead person 's being were preserved and reunited , and to give the deceased control over the world around him famously , two spells also deal with the judgement of the deceased in the weighing of the heart ritual the texts and images of the book of the dead were magical as well as religious faulkner 1994 , p.145 the concept of magic ( heka ) was also intimately linked with the spoken and written word this was even true when the text was abbreviated or omitted , as often occurred in later book of the dead scrolls , particularly if the accompanying images were present a number of spells are for magical amulets , which would protect the deceased from harm in addition to being represented on a book of the dead papyrus , these spells appeared on amulets wound into the wrappings of a mummy pinch 1994 , p.104 & ndash ; 5 a number of spells also refer to egyptian beliefs about the magical healing power of saliva almost every book of the dead was unique , containing a different mixture of spells drawn from the corpus of texts available in the evening , the deceased travels to the underworld to appear before osiris the spells in the book of the dead depict egyptian beliefs about the nature of death and the afterlife the book of the dead is a vital source of information about egyptian beliefs in this area in case priests or relatives failed to provide these offerings , spell 105 ensured the ka was satisfied taylor 2010 , p.163-4 the name of the dead person , which constituted their individuality and was required for their continued existence , was written in many places throughout the book , and spell 25 ensured the deceased would remember their own name taylor 2010 , p.163 the ba was a free-ranging spirit aspect of the deceased taylor 2010 , p.17 , 164 finally , the shut , or shadow of the deceased , was preserved by spells 91 , 92 and 188 taylor 2010 , p.164 if all these aspects of the person could be variously preserved , remembered , and satiated , then the dead person would live on in the form of an akh an akh was a blessed spirit with magical powers who would dwell among the gods taylor 2010 , p.17 the nature of the afterlife which the dead people enjoyed is difficult to define , because of the differing traditions within ancient egyptian religion in the book of the dead , the dead were taken into the presence of the god osiris , who was confined to the subterranean duat taylor 2010 , p.239 & ndash ; 241 as well as joining the gods , the book of the dead also depicts the dead living on in the 'field of reeds ' , a paradisiac likeness of the real world they were expensive items ; one source gives the price of a book of the dead scroll as one deben of silver , taylor 2010 , p & nbsp ;

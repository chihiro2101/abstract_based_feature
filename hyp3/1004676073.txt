the book of the dead developed from a tradition of funerary manuscripts dating back to the egyptian old kingdom the first funerary texts were the pyramid texts , first used in the pyramid of king unas of the 5th dynasty , around 2400 bce 54 these texts were written on the walls of the burial chambers within pyramids , and were exclusively for the use of the pharaoh ( and , from the 6th dynasty , the queen ) towards the end of the old kingdom , the pyramid texts ceased to be an exclusively royal privilege , and were adopted by regional governors and other high-ranking officials the coffin texts used a newer version of the language , new spells , and included illustrations for the first time the coffin texts were most commonly written on the inner surfaces of coffins , though they are occasionally found on tomb walls or on papyri the coffin texts were available to wealthy private individuals , vastly increasing the number of people who could expect to participate in the afterlife ; a process which has been described as the '' democratization of the afterlife '' d'auria et al p.187 the book of the dead first developed in thebes toward the beginning of the second intermediate period , around 1700 bce at this stage , the spells were typically inscribed on linen shrouds wrapped around the dead , though occasionally they are found written on coffins or on papyrus 55 the new kingdom saw the book of the dead develop and spread further from this period onward the book of the dead was typically written on a papyrus scroll , and the text illustrated with vignettes at the same time , many burials used additional funerary texts , for instance the amduat in the late period and ptolemaic period , the book of the dead continued to be based on the saite recension , though increasingly abbreviated towards the end of the ptolemaic period new funerary texts appeared , including the book of breathing and book of traversing eternity the book of the dead is made up of a number of individual texts and their accompanying illustrations this ambiguity reflects the similarity in egyptian thought between ritual speech and magical power faulkner 1994 , p.145 ; taylor 2010 , p.29 in the context of the book of the dead , it is typically translated as either chapter or spell at present , some 192 spells are known , faulkner 1994 , p.18 though no single manuscript contains them all some are intended to give the deceased mystical knowledge in the afterlife , or perhaps to identify them with the gods : for instance , spell 17 is an obscure and lengthy description of the god atum taylor 2010 , p.51 , 56 others are incantations to ensure the different elements of the dead person 's being were preserved and reunited , and to give the deceased control over the world around him famously , two spells also deal with the judgement of the deceased in the weighing of the heart ritual such spells as 26–30 , and sometimes spells 6 and 126 , relate to the heart and were inscribed on scarabs the texts and images of the book of the dead were magical as well as religious written words conveyed the full force of a spell this was even true when the text was abbreviated or omitted , as often occurred in later book of the dead scrolls , particularly if the accompanying images were present taylor 2010 , p.32 & ndash ;

1 the spells of the book of the dead made use of several magical techniques which can also be seen in other areas of egyptian life a number of spells are for magical amulets , which would protect the deceased from harm in addition to being represented on a book of the dead papyrus , these spells appeared on amulets wound into the wrappings of a mummy pinch 1994 , p.104 & ndash ; 5 a number of spells also refer to egyptian beliefs about the magical healing power of saliva almost every book of the dead was unique , containing a different mixture of spells drawn from the corpus of texts available faulkner 1994 , p.141 it is only from the saite period ( 26th dynasty ) onwards that there is a defined order . egyptian concepts of death and afterlife the spells in the book of the dead depict egyptian beliefs about the nature of death and the afterlife the book of the dead is a vital source of information about egyptian beliefs in this area the ka , or life-force , remained in the tomb with the dead body , and required sustenance from offerings of food , water and incense taylor 2010 , p.164 if all these aspects of the person could be variously preserved , remembered , and satiated , then the dead person would live on in the form of an akh the nature of the afterlife which the dead people enjoyed is difficult to define , because of the differing traditions within ancient egyptian religion in the book of the dead , the dead were taken into the presence of the god osiris , who was confined to the subterranean duat taylor 2010 , p.239 & ndash ; 241 as well as joining the gods , the book of the dead also depicts the dead living on in the 'field of reeds ' , a paradisiac likeness of the real world for this reason burials included a number of statuettes named shabti , or later ushabti thumb the path to the afterlife as laid out in the book of the dead was a difficult one the deceased was required to pass a series of gates , caverns and mounds guarded by supernatural creatures there , the dead person swore that he had not committed any sin from a list of 42 sins , taylor 2010 , p hornung 1999 , p.15 & ndash ;

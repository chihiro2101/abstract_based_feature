the book of the dead developed from a tradition of funerary manuscripts dating back to the egyptian old kingdom the first funerary texts were the pyramid texts , first used in the pyramid of king unas of the 5th dynasty , around 2400 bce 54 these texts were written on the walls of the burial chambers within pyramids , and were exclusively for the use of the pharaoh ( and , from the 6th dynasty , the queen ) towards the end of the old kingdom , the pyramid texts ceased to be an exclusively royal privilege , and were adopted by regional governors and other high-ranking officials in the middle kingdom , a new funerary text emerged , the coffin texts the coffin texts used a newer version of the language , new spells , and included illustrations for the first time the coffin texts were most commonly written on the inner surfaces of coffins , though they are occasionally found on tomb walls or on papyri d'auria et al p.187 the book of the dead first developed in thebes toward the beginning of the second intermediate period , around 1700 bce the earliest known occurrence of the spells included in the book of the dead is from the coffin of queen mentuhotep , of the 13th dynasty , where the new spells were included amongst older texts known from the pyramid texts and coffin texts taylor 2010 , p.34 by the 17th dynasty , the book of the dead had become widespread not only for members of the royal family , but courtiers and other officials as well at this stage , the spells were typically inscribed on linen shrouds wrapped around the dead , though occasionally they are found written on coffins or on papyrus 55 the new kingdom saw the book of the dead develop and spread further from this period onward the book of the dead was typically written on a papyrus scroll , and the text illustrated with vignettes the hieratic scrolls were a cheaper version , lacking illustration apart from a single vignette at the beginning , and were produced on smaller papyri new funerary texts appeared , including the book of breathing and book of traversing eternity the book of the dead is made up of a number of individual texts and their accompanying illustrations most sub-texts begin with the word ro , which can mean '' mouth '' , '' speech '' , '' spell '' , '' utterance '' , '' incantation '' , or '' chapter of a book '' some are intended to give the deceased mystical knowledge in the afterlife , or perhaps to identify them with the gods : for instance , spell 17 is an obscure and lengthy description of the god atum taylor 2010 , p.51 , 56 others are incantations to ensure the different elements of the dead person 's being were preserved and reunited , and to give the deceased control over the world around him still others protect the deceased from various hostile forces or guide him through the underworld past various obstacles such spells as 26–30 , and sometimes spells 6 and 126 , relate to the heart and were inscribed on scarabs the act of speaking a ritual formula was an act of creation ; taylor 2010 , p.30 there is a sense in which action and speech were one and the same thing this was even true when the text was abbreviated or omitted , as often occurred in later book of the dead scrolls , particularly if the accompanying images were present taylor 2010 , p.32 & ndash ; 3 ; faulkner 1994 , p.148 the egyptians also believed that knowing the name of something gave power over it ; thus , the book of the dead equips its owner with the mystical names of many of the entities he would encounter in the afterlife , giving him power over them taylor 2010 , p.30 & ndash ; 1 the spells of the book of the dead made use of several magical techniques which can also be seen in other areas of egyptian life in addition to being represented on a book of the dead papyrus , these spells appeared on amulets wound into the wrappings of a mummy almost every book of the dead was unique , containing a different mixture of spells drawn from the corpus of texts available the spells in the book of the dead depict egyptian beliefs about the nature of death and the afterlife the book of the dead is a vital source of information about egyptian beliefs in this area taylor 2010 , p.16-17 funerary rituals served to re-integrate these different aspects of being mummification served to preserve and transform the physical body into sah , an idealised form with divine aspects ; taylor 2010 , p.17 & 20 the book of the dead contained spells aimed at preserving the body of the deceased , which may have been recited during the process of mummification it was the ba , depicted as a human-headed bird , which could '' go forth by day '' from the tomb into the world ; spells 61 and 89 acted to preserve it taylor 2010 , p.164 if all these aspects of the person could be variously preserved , remembered , and satiated , then the dead person would live on in the form of an akh the nature of the afterlife which the dead people enjoyed is difficult to define , because of the differing traditions within ancient egyptian religion taylor 2010 , p.239 & ndash ; 241 as well as joining the gods , the book of the dead also depicts the dead living on in the 'field of reeds ' , a paradisiac likeness of the real world taylor 2010 , p.238 & ndash ; 240 the field of reeds is depicted as a lush , plentiful version of the egyptian way of living taylor 2010 , p.242 & ndash ; 245 it is also clear that the dead not only went to a place where the gods lived , but that they acquired divine characteristics themselves in many occasions , the deceased is mentioned as '' the osiris – name '' in the book of the dead the deceased was required to pass a series of gates , caverns and mounds guarded by supernatural creatures taylor 2010 , p.136 & ndash ; 7 another breed of supernatural creatures was 'slaughterers ' who killed the unrighteous on behalf of osiris ; the book of the dead equipped its owner to escape their attentions there , the dead person swore that he had not committed any sin from a list of 42 sins , taylor 2010 , p taylor 2010 , p.209 at this point , there was a risk that the deceased 's heart would bear witness , owning up to sins committed in life ; spell 30b guarded against this eventuality taylor 2010 , p.212 this scene is remarkable not only for its vividness but as one of the few parts of the book of the dead with any explicit moral content today the book of the dead project , as it is called , maintains a database of documentation and photography covering 80 % of extant copies and fragments from the corpus of book of the dead texts , and provides current services to egyptologists aaru bardo thodol ( tibetan book of the dead ) book of the dead of amen-em-hat book of the dead of qenna ghosts in ancient egyptian culture necronomicon ( h allen , middle egyptian – an introduction to the language and culture of hieroglyphs , first edition , cambridge university press , 2000 faulkner , raymond o ( translator ) ;

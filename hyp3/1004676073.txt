many of the hieroglyphs representing humans or animals were left incomplete or drawn mutilated , most likely to prevent them causing any harm to the dead pharaoh 54 the purpose of the pyramid texts was to help the dead king take his place amongst the gods , in particular to reunite him with his divine father ra ;

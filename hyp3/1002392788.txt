a film score may also be called a background score , background music , film soundtrack , film music , screen composition , screen music , or incidental music the director and composer will watch the entire film , taking note of which scenes require original music during this process , the composer will take precise timing notes so that he or she knows how long each cue needs to last , where it begins , where it ends , and of particular moments during a scene with which the music may need to coincide in a specific way occasionally , a filmmaker will actually edit his or her film to fit the flow of music , rather than have the composer edit their score to the final cut the extra-terrestrial was edited to match the music of his long-time collaborator john williams : as recounted in a companion documentary on the dvd , spielberg gave williams complete freedom with the music and asked him to record the cue without picture ; spielberg then re-edited the scene later to match the music composer hans zimmer was asked to write music in this way in 2010 for director christopher nolan 's film inception ; composer gustavo santaolalla did the same thing when he wrote his oscar-winning score for brokeback mountain when writing music for film , one goal is to sync dramatic events happening on screen with musical events in the score using a technique called free timing , a conductor will use either ( a ) a stopwatch or studio size stop clock , or ( b ) watch the film on a screen or video monitor while conducting the musicians to predetermined timings in both instances , the timings on the clock or lines scribed on the film have corresponding timings which are also at specific points ( beats ) in the composer/conductor score a written click track is a method of writing bars of music in consistent time values ( i.e a composer would use a written click if they planned to conduct live performers once the spotting session has been completed and the precise timings of each cue determined , the composer will then work on writing the score the length of time a composer has to write the score varies from project to project ; depending on the post-production schedule , a composer may have as little as two weeks or as much as three months to write the score in normal circumstances , the actual writing process usually lasts around six weeks from beginning to end a film score can encompass literally thousands of different combinations of instruments , ranging from full symphony orchestral ensembles to single solo instruments to rock bands to jazz combos , along with a multitude of ethnic and world music influences , soloists , vocalists , choirs and electronic textures the style of the music being written also varies massively from project to project , and can be influenced by the time period in which the film is set , the geographic location of the film 's action , and even the musical tastes of the characters as part of their preparations for writing the score the composer will often research different musical techniques and genres as appropriate for that specific project ; as such , it is not uncommon for established film composers to be proficient at writing music in dozens of different styles once the music has been written , it must then be arranged or orchestrated in order for the ensemble to be able to perform it the nature and level of orchestration varies from project to project and composer to composer , but in its basic form the orchestrator 's job is to take the single-line music written by the composer and '' flesh it out '' into instrument-specific sheet music for each member of the orchestra to perform in many cases , time constraints determined by the film 's post-production schedule dictate whether composers orchestrate their own scores , as it is often impossible for the composer to complete all the required tasks within the time frame allowed examples of enduring composer-orchestrator relationships include jerry goldsmith with arthur morton and alexander courage ; john williams with herbert w spencer ; alan menken with danny troob and michael starobin ; carter burwell with sonny kompanek ; graeme revell and michael giacchino with tim simonec ; alan silvestri with james b when the music has been composed and orchestrated , the orchestra or ensemble then performs it , often with the composer conducting other performing ensembles that are often employed include the london symphony orchestra ( performing film music since 1935 ) london symphony orchestra and film music lso in some instances , film composers have been asked by the director to imitate a specific composer or style present in the temp track george burt , the art of film music , northeastern university press on other occasions , directors have become so attached to the temp score that they decide to use it and reject the original score written by the film composer the themes for specific characters or locations are known as a motif where the rest of the track is usually centred around the particular motif and the track develops in line with the motif one prominent example is john williams ' score for the star wars saga , and the numerous themes in star wars music associated with individual characters such as darth vader , luke skywalker , and princess leia similarly , the music of the lord of the rings film series featured recurring themes for many main characters and places '' source music '' ( or a '' source cue '' ) comes from an on screen source that can actually be seen or that can be inferred ( in academic film theory such music is called '' diegesis '' music , as it emanates from the '' diegesis '' or '' story world '' ) composers of film scores typically can produce about three or four per year '' even so , considering they are often the most popular modern compositions of classical music known to the general public , major orchestras sometimes perform film music concerts , as do pops orchestras in 1983 , a non-profit organization , the the film music society , was formed to preserve the '' byproducts '' of creating a film score , including the music manuscripts ( written music ) and other documents and studio recordings generated in the process of composing and recording scores which , in some instances , have been discarded by movie studios the written music must be kept to perform the music on concert programs and to make new recordings of it according to kurt london , film music '' began not as a result of any artistic urge , but from a dire need of something which would drown the noise made by the projector the first production music library was set up by de wolfe music in 1927 with the advent of sound in film , the company originally scored music for use in silent film film in concert : film scores and their relation to classical concert music

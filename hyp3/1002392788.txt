a film score may also be called a background score , background music , film soundtrack , film music , screen composition , screen music , or incidental music the composer usually enters the creative process towards the end of filming at around the same time as the film is being edited , although on some occasions the composer is on hand during the entire film shoot , especially when actors are required to perform with or be aware of original diegetic music the composer is shown an unpolished '' rough cut '' of the film before the editing is completed and talks to the director or producer about what sort of music is required for the film in terms of style and tone the director and composer will watch the entire film , taking note of which scenes require original music during this process , the composer will take precise timing notes so that he or she knows how long each cue needs to last , where it begins , where it ends , and of particular moments during a scene with which the music may need to coincide in a specific way occasionally , a filmmaker will actually edit his or her film to fit the flow of music , rather than have the composer edit their score to the final cut director godfrey reggio edited his films koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi based on composer philip glass 's music the extra-terrestrial was edited to match the music of his long-time collaborator john williams : as recounted in a companion documentary on the dvd , spielberg gave williams complete freedom with the music and asked him to record the cue without picture ; spielberg then re-edited the scene later to match the music in some circumstances , a composer will be asked to write music based on his or her impressions of the script or storyboards without seeing the film itself and is given more freedom to create music without the need to adhere to specific cue lengths or mirror the emotional arc of a particular scene this approach is usually taken by a director who does not wish to have the music comment specifically on a particular scene or nuance of a film and which can instead be inserted into the film at any point the director wishes during the post-production process composer hans zimmer was asked to write music in this way in 2010 for director christopher nolan 's film inception ; composer gustavo santaolalla did the same thing when he wrote his oscar-winning score for brokeback mountain when writing music for film , one goal is to sync dramatic events happening on screen with musical events in the score using a technique called free timing , a conductor will use either ( a ) a stopwatch or studio size stop clock , or ( b ) watch the film on a screen or video monitor while conducting the musicians to predetermined timings in both instances , the timings on the clock or lines scribed on the film have corresponding timings which are also at specific points ( beats ) in the composer/conductor score one can convert a standard bpm value to a written click where x represents the number of beats per bar , and w represents time in seconds , by using the following equation : \frac+1 b from score to screen : sequencers , scores and second thoughts : the new film scoring process working with software allows composers to create midi-based demos of cues , called midi mockups , for review by the filmmaker prior to the final orchestral recording the actual musical content of a film score is wholly dependent on the type of film being scored , and the emotions the director wishes the music to convey as part of their preparations for writing the score the composer will often research different musical techniques and genres as appropriate for that specific project ; as such , it is not uncommon for established film composers to be proficient at writing music in dozens of different styles some composers , notably ennio morricone , orchestrate their own scores themselves , without using an additional orchestrator examples of enduring composer-orchestrator relationships include jerry goldsmith with arthur morton and alexander courage ; john williams with herbert w when the music has been composed and orchestrated , the orchestra or ensemble then performs it , often with the composer conducting other performing ensembles that are often employed include the london symphony orchestra ( performing film music since 1935 ) london symphony orchestra and film music lso the orchestra performs in front of a large screen depicting the film , the conductor and musicians habitually wear headphones that sound a series of clicks called a '' click-track '' that changes with meter and tempo , assisting to synchronize the music with the film sometimes the director will have edited the film using '' temp ( temporary ) music '' : already published pieces with a character that the director believes to fit specific scenes however , some films have very little or no music ; others may feature a score that plays almost continuously throughout in some instances , film composers have been asked by the director to imitate a specific composer or style present in the temp track these may be played in different variations depending on the situation they represent , scattered amongst incidental music this common technique may often pass unnoticed by casual moviegoers , but has become well known among genre enthusiasts similarly , the music of the lord of the rings film series featured recurring themes for many main characters and places alfred hitchcock 's 1963 thriller the birds is an example of a hollywood film with no non-diegetic music whatsoever some consider film music to be a defining genre of classical music in the late 20th century , if only because it is the brand of classical music heard more often than any other '' even so , considering they are often the most popular modern compositions of classical music known to the general public , major orchestras sometimes perform film music concerts , as do pops orchestras in 1983 , a non-profit organization , the the film music society , was formed to preserve the '' byproducts '' of creating a film score , including the music manuscripts ( written music ) and other documents and studio recordings generated in the process of composing and recording scores which , in some instances , have been discarded by movie studios film music : a history by james eugene wierzbicki , p.20 in 1914 , the oz film manufacturing company sent full-length scores by louis f sometimes called library music , the music is owned by production music libraries and licensed to customers for use in film , television , radio and other media film in concert : film scores and their relation to classical concert music

a film score may also be called a background score , background music , film soundtrack , film music , screen composition , screen music , or incidental music the composer usually enters the creative process towards the end of filming at around the same time as the film is being edited , although on some occasions the composer is on hand during the entire film shoot , especially when actors are required to perform with or be aware of original diegetic music the composer is shown an unpolished '' rough cut '' of the film before the editing is completed and talks to the director or producer about what sort of music is required for the film in terms of style and tone the director and composer will watch the entire film , taking note of which scenes require original music during this process , the composer will take precise timing notes so that he or she knows how long each cue needs to last , where it begins , where it ends , and of particular moments during a scene with which the music may need to coincide in a specific way occasionally , a filmmaker will actually edit his or her film to fit the flow of music , rather than have the composer edit their score to the final cut similarly , the relationship between director sergio leone and composer ennio morricone was such that the finale of the good , the bad and the ugly and the films once upon a time in the west and once upon a time in america were edited to morricone 's score as the composer had prepared it months before the film 's production ended the extra-terrestrial was edited to match the music of his long-time collaborator john williams : as recounted in a companion documentary on the dvd , spielberg gave williams complete freedom with the music and asked him to record the cue without picture ; spielberg then re-edited the scene later to match the music in some circumstances , a composer will be asked to write music based on his or her impressions of the script or storyboards without seeing the film itself and is given more freedom to create music without the need to adhere to specific cue lengths or mirror the emotional arc of a particular scene this approach is usually taken by a director who does not wish to have the music comment specifically on a particular scene or nuance of a film and which can instead be inserted into the film at any point the director wishes during the post-production process composer hans zimmer was asked to write music in this way in 2010 for director christopher nolan 's film inception ; composer gustavo santaolalla did the same thing when he wrote his oscar-winning score for brokeback mountain when writing music for film , one goal is to sync dramatic events happening on screen with musical events in the score a written click track is a method of writing bars of music in consistent time values ( i.e one can convert a standard bpm value to a written click where x represents the number of beats per bar , and w represents time in seconds , by using the following equation : \frac+1 b the length of time a composer has to write the score varies from project to project ; depending on the post-production schedule , a composer may have as little as two weeks or as much as three months to write the score the style of the music being written also varies massively from project to project , and can be influenced by the time period in which the film is set , the geographic location of the film 's action , and even the musical tastes of the characters as part of their preparations for writing the score the composer will often research different musical techniques and genres as appropriate for that specific project ; as such , it is not uncommon for established film composers to be proficient at writing music in dozens of different styles the nature and level of orchestration varies from project to project and composer to composer , but in its basic form the orchestrator 's job is to take the single-line music written by the composer and '' flesh it out '' into instrument-specific sheet music for each member of the orchestra to perform some composers provide intricate details in how they want this to be accomplished and will provide the orchestrator with copious notes outlining which instruments are being asked to perform which notes , giving the orchestrator no personal creative input whatsoever beyond re-notating the music on different sheets of paper as appropriate in many cases , time constraints determined by the film 's post-production schedule dictate whether composers orchestrate their own scores , as it is often impossible for the composer to complete all the required tasks within the time frame allowed spencer ; alan menken with danny troob and michael starobin ; carter burwell with sonny kompanek ; graeme revell and michael giacchino with tim simonec ; alan silvestri with james b once the orchestration process has been completed , the sheet music is physically printed onto paper by one or more music copyists and is ready for performance other performing ensembles that are often employed include the london symphony orchestra ( performing film music since 1935 ) london symphony orchestra and film music lso the orchestra performs in front of a large screen depicting the film , the conductor and musicians habitually wear headphones that sound a series of clicks called a '' click-track '' that changes with meter and tempo , assisting to synchronize the music with the film sometimes the director will have edited the film using '' temp ( temporary ) music '' : already published pieces with a character that the director believes to fit specific scenes george burt , the art of film music , northeastern university press on other occasions , directors have become so attached to the temp score that they decide to use it and reject the original score written by the film composer one of the most famous cases is stanley kubrick 's 2001 : a space odyssey , where kubrick opted for existing recordings of classical works , including pieces by composer gy√∂rgy ligeti rather than the score by alex north , although kubrick had also hired frank cordell to do a score other examples include torn curtain ( bernard herrmann ) , troy ( gabriel yared ) , pirates of the caribbean : the curse of the black pearl ( alan silvestri ) , peter jackson 's king kong ( howard shore ) , and the bourne identity ( carter burwell ) these may be played in different variations depending on the situation they represent , scattered amongst incidental music one prominent example is john williams ' score for the star wars saga , and the numerous themes in star wars music associated with individual characters such as darth vader , luke skywalker , and princess leia another notable example is jerry goldsmith 's klingon theme from star trek : the motion picture ( 1979 ) , which later composers in the star trek film series quoted in their klingon motifs , and which was included on numerous occasions as a theme for worf , the franchise 's most prominent klingon character his orchestral soundtrack for the television series lost also depended heavily on character and situation-specific themes '' source music '' ( or a '' source cue '' ) comes from an on screen source that can actually be seen or that can be inferred ( in academic film theory such music is called '' diegesis '' music , as it emanates from the '' diegesis '' or '' story world '' ) the written music must be kept to perform the music on concert programs and to make new recordings of it film music , p.28 the first production music library was set up by de wolfe music in 1927 with the advent of sound in film , the company originally scored music for use in silent film ;

a film score may also be called a background score , background music , film soundtrack , film music , screen composition , screen music , or incidental music the composer usually enters the creative process towards the end of filming at around the same time as the film is being edited , although on some occasions the composer is on hand during the entire film shoot , especially when actors are required to perform with or be aware of original diegetic music the composer is shown an unpolished '' rough cut '' of the film before the editing is completed and talks to the director or producer about what sort of music is required for the film in terms of style and tone the director and composer will watch the entire film , taking note of which scenes require original music during this process , the composer will take precise timing notes so that he or she knows how long each cue needs to last , where it begins , where it ends , and of particular moments during a scene with which the music may need to coincide in a specific way occasionally , a filmmaker will actually edit his or her film to fit the flow of music , rather than have the composer edit their score to the final cut similarly , the relationship between director sergio leone and composer ennio morricone was such that the finale of the good , the bad and the ugly and the films once upon a time in the west and once upon a time in america were edited to morricone 's score as the composer had prepared it months before the film 's production ended the extra-terrestrial was edited to match the music of his long-time collaborator john williams : as recounted in a companion documentary on the dvd , spielberg gave williams complete freedom with the music and asked him to record the cue without picture ; spielberg then re-edited the scene later to match the music in some circumstances , a composer will be asked to write music based on his or her impressions of the script or storyboards without seeing the film itself and is given more freedom to create music without the need to adhere to specific cue lengths or mirror the emotional arc of a particular scene this approach is usually taken by a director who does not wish to have the music comment specifically on a particular scene or nuance of a film and which can instead be inserted into the film at any point the director wishes during the post-production process there are many different methods for syncing music to picture when syncing music to picture , generally a leeway of 3â€“4 frames late or early allows the composer to be extremely accurate using a technique called free timing , a conductor will use either ( a ) a stopwatch or studio size stop clock , or ( b ) watch the film on a screen or video monitor while conducting the musicians to predetermined timings one can convert a standard bpm value to a written click where x represents the number of beats per bar , and w represents time in seconds , by using the following equation : \frac+1 b once the spotting session has been completed and the precise timings of each cue determined , the composer will then work on writing the score the methods of writing the score vary from composer to composer ; some composers prefer to work with a traditional pencil and paper , writing notes by hand on a staff and performing works-in-progress for the director on a piano , while other composers write on computers using sophisticated scorewriter such as digital performer , logic pro , finale , cubase , or pro tools the length of time a composer has to write the score varies from project to project ; depending on the post-production schedule , a composer may have as little as two weeks or as much as three months to write the score the actual musical content of a film score is wholly dependent on the type of film being scored , and the emotions the director wishes the music to convey a film score can encompass literally thousands of different combinations of instruments , ranging from full symphony orchestral ensembles to single solo instruments to rock bands to jazz combos , along with a multitude of ethnic and world music influences , soloists , vocalists , choirs and electronic textures the style of the music being written also varies massively from project to project , and can be influenced by the time period in which the film is set , the geographic location of the film 's action , and even the musical tastes of the characters as part of their preparations for writing the score the composer will often research different musical techniques and genres as appropriate for that specific project ; as such , it is not uncommon for established film composers to be proficient at writing music in dozens of different styles the nature and level of orchestration varies from project to project and composer to composer , but in its basic form the orchestrator 's job is to take the single-line music written by the composer and '' flesh it out '' into instrument-specific sheet music for each member of the orchestra to perform some composers provide intricate details in how they want this to be accomplished and will provide the orchestrator with copious notes outlining which instruments are being asked to perform which notes , giving the orchestrator no personal creative input whatsoever beyond re-notating the music on different sheets of paper as appropriate in many cases , time constraints determined by the film 's post-production schedule dictate whether composers orchestrate their own scores , as it is often impossible for the composer to complete all the required tasks within the time frame allowed spencer ;

a film score may also be called a background score , background music , film soundtrack , film music , screen composition , screen music , or incidental music the composer usually enters the creative process towards the end of filming at around the same time as the film is being edited , although on some occasions the composer is on hand during the entire film shoot , especially when actors are required to perform with or be aware of original diegetic music the composer is shown an unpolished '' rough cut '' of the film before the editing is completed and talks to the director or producer about what sort of music is required for the film in terms of style and tone the director and composer will watch the entire film , taking note of which scenes require original music during this process , the composer will take precise timing notes so that he or she knows how long each cue needs to last , where it begins , where it ends , and of particular moments during a scene with which the music may need to coincide in a specific way occasionally , a filmmaker will actually edit his or her film to fit the flow of music , rather than have the composer edit their score to the final cut director godfrey reggio edited his films koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi based on composer philip glass 's music in some circumstances , a composer will be asked to write music based on his or her impressions of the script or storyboards without seeing the film itself and is given more freedom to create music without the need to adhere to specific cue lengths or mirror the emotional arc of a particular scene this approach is usually taken by a director who does not wish to have the music comment specifically on a particular scene or nuance of a film and which can instead be inserted into the film at any point the director wishes during the post-production process composer hans zimmer was asked to write music in this way in 2010 for director christopher nolan 's film inception ; composer gustavo santaolalla did the same thing when he wrote his oscar-winning score for brokeback mountain when writing music for film , one goal is to sync dramatic events happening on screen with musical events in the score these include using sequencing software to calculate timings , using mathematic formulas and free timing with reference timings these are put on the film by the music editor at points specified by the composer in both instances , the timings on the clock or lines scribed on the film have corresponding timings which are also at specific points ( beats ) in the composer/conductor score one can convert a standard bpm value to a written click where x represents the number of beats per bar , and w represents time in seconds , by using the following equation : \frac+1 b from score to screen : sequencers , scores and second thoughts : the new film scoring process the actual musical content of a film score is wholly dependent on the type of film being scored , and the emotions the director wishes the music to convey the style of the music being written also varies massively from project to project , and can be influenced by the time period in which the film is set , the geographic location of the film 's action , and even the musical tastes of the characters as part of their preparations for writing the score the composer will often research different musical techniques and genres as appropriate for that specific project ; as such , it is not uncommon for established film composers to be proficient at writing music in dozens of different styles over the years several orchestrators have become linked to the work of one particular composer , often to the point where one will not work without the other once the orchestration process has been completed , the sheet music is physically printed onto paper by one or more music copyists and is ready for performance musicians for these ensembles are often uncredited in the film or on the album and are contracted individually ( and if so , the orchestra contractor is credited in the film or the soundtrack album ) however , some films have recently begun crediting the contracted musicians on the albums under the name hollywood studio symphony after an agreement with the american federation of musicians other performing ensembles that are often employed include the london symphony orchestra ( performing film music since 1935 ) london symphony orchestra and film music lso more rarely , the director will talk to the composer before shooting has started , so as to give more time to the composer or because the director needs to shoot scenes ( namely song or dance scenes ) according to the final score sometimes the director will have edited the film using '' temp ( temporary ) music '' : already published pieces with a character that the director believes to fit specific scenes however , some films have very little or no music ; others may feature a score that plays almost continuously throughout in some instances , film composers have been asked by the director to imitate a specific composer or style present in the temp track the themes for specific characters or locations are known as a motif where the rest of the track is usually centred around the particular motif and the track develops in line with the motif michael giacchino employed character themes in the soundtrack for the 2009 animated film up , for which he received the academy award for best score some consider film music to be a defining genre of classical music in the late 20th century , if only because it is the brand of classical music heard more often than any other '' even so , considering they are often the most popular modern compositions of classical music known to the general public , major orchestras sometimes perform film music concerts , as do pops orchestras in 1983 , a non-profit organization , the the film music society , was formed to preserve the '' byproducts '' of creating a film score , including the music manuscripts ( written music ) and other documents and studio recordings generated in the process of composing and recording scores which , in some instances , have been discarded by movie studios according to kurt london , film music '' began not as a result of any artistic urge , but from a dire need of something which would drown the noise made by the projector a landmark event in music synchronization with the action in film was achieved in the score composed by max steiner for david o the first production music library was set up by de wolfe music in 1927 with the advent of sound in film , the company originally scored music for use in silent film film in concert : film scores and their relation to classical concert music

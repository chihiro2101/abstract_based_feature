: after roliça , wellesley had established a position near vimeiro junot organised his 14,000-man force into two infantry divisions and a cavalry division under pierre margaron these units were created by taking the grenadier company from each of junot 's infantry battalions the french took 23 cannons into battle with them once junot realised that british troops occupied the ridge , he sent solignac 's brigade to the right to assist brenier 's attack first , thomières ' 2,100-man brigade approached the british position supported by three cannons and screened by skirmishers , the brigade was formed into a column of companies the first company of 120 men formed in a three-deep line would have a front rank 40 men wide these outnumbered and outfought the french skirmishers , who fell back to the sides of the brigade column unable to effectively reply to the devastating british volley fire , charlot 's men soon ran away seeing the battle going against him , junot committed his grenadier reserve to the attack victorious , the french pressed on in column , but soon ran into the 29th regiment in line and were stopped together , the volley fire of the three british battalions soon routed brenier 's men two of wellesley 's brigades never got into action , but the rest were used economically to defeat each french attack

maxims of equity are not a rigid set of rules , but are , rather , general principles which can be derived from in specific cases indeed it would not be difficult to reduce all under two : 'equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy ' and 'equity acts on the person ' '' equity regards as done what ought to be done this makes possible the legal phenomenon of equitable conversion the consequences of this maxim , and of equitable conversion , are significant in their bearing on the risk of loss in transactions when parties enter a contract for a sale of realty , the buyer is deemed to have obtained an equitable right that becomes a legal right only after the deal is completed if he is successful in seeking a remedy at law , he is entitled to the value of the property at the time of breach regardless of whether it has appreciated or depreciated the fair solution in the circumstances may be arrived at by applying the principle that equity regards that as done that ought to be done in other words , what would the position have been if what should have been done had been done ? thus , we know in one case , premiums on a life insurance policy were overdue the insurer 's letter to the policyholder warning him of this fact was never received by the policyholder , who died shortly after the policy consequently lapsed since the policyholder would have been fully entitled to pay the outstanding premium at that stage , regardless of his physical condition , the insurer ( with some persuasion from the bureau ) agreed that the matter should be dealt with as if the policyholder had done so in other similar cases , however , it has not been possible to follow the same principle because there has not been sufficiently clear evidence that the policy would have been renewed another illustration of the application of this equitable principle was in connection with motor vehicle insurance a policyholder was provided with coverage on the basis that she was entitled to a '' no claims '' discount from her previous insurer confirmation to this effect from the previous insurer was required this was done without reference to the insurer concerned whose normal practice in such circumstances would have been to maintain coverage and to require payment of the full premium until proof of the no claims discount was forthcoming however , in the circumstances , it was equitable for it to meet the claim these are superior remedies to those administered at common law such as damages the latin legal maxim is ubi jus ibi remedium ( '' where there is a right there must be a remedy '' ) six unknown named agents , the application of this principle at law was key in the decision of marbury v madison , wherein it was necessary to establish that marbury had a right to his commission in the first place in order for john marshall to make his more wide-ranging decision equity is a sort of equality this maxim flows from the fundamental notion of equality or impartiality due to the conception of equity and is the source of many equitable doctrines the rule of ordinary law may give one party an advantage over the other equity proceeds in the principle that a right or liability should as far as possible be equalized among all interested in other words , two parties have equal right in any property , so it is distributed equally as per the concerned law one who seeks equity must do equity to receive equitable relief , the petitioning party must be willing to complete all of its own obligations as well the applicant to a court of equity is just as much subject to the power of that court as the defendant this maxim may also overlap with the clean hands maxim ( see below ) a person who has been wronged must act relatively swiftly to preserve their rights nevertheless , courts of equity also developed a doctrine that an applicant must assert a '' property interest '' '' the goal of law and equity was the same but due to historical reasons they chose a different path however , pursuant to the equitable maxim , restitution does not allow a volunteer or '' officious intermeddler '' to recover due to limits in old common law , no remedy was had for beneficiaries if , for example , a trustee ran off with the trust property brocard ( law ) english trusts law legal maxim list of legal latin terms

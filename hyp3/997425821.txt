modchips operate by replacing or overriding a system 's protection hardware or software most modchips consist of one or more integrated circuits ( microcontrollers , fpgas , or cplds ) , often complemented with discrete parts , usually packaged on a small pcb to fit within the console system it is designed for although there are modchips that can be reprogrammed for different purposes , most modchips are designed to work within only one console system or even only one specific hardware version some modchips allow for installation by directly soldering the modchip 's contacts to the console 's circuit ( '' quicksolder '' ) , by the precise positioning of electrical contacts ( '' solderless '' ) , or , in rare cases , by plugging them into a system 's internal or external connector the diversity of hardware modchips operate on and varying methods they use mean that while modchips are often used for the same goal , they may work in vastly different ways , even if they are intended for use on the same console converters or passthrough devices have been used to circumvent the restrictions , while flash memory devices ( game backup devices ) were widely adopted in later years to copy game media early in the transition from solid-state to optical media , cd-based console systems did not have regional market segmentation or copy protection measures due to the rarity and high cost of user-writable media at the time in addition to circumventing regional lockout and copy protection mechanisms , modern modchips may introduce more sophisticated modifications to the system , such as allowing the use of user-created software ( homebrew ) , expanding the hardware capabilities of its host system , or even installing an alternative operating system to completely re-purpose the host system ( e.g most modchips open the system to copied media , therefore the availability of a modchip for a console system is undesirable for console manufacturers

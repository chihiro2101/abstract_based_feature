most modchips consist of one or more integrated circuits ( microcontrollers , fpgas , or cplds ) , often complemented with discrete parts , usually packaged on a small pcb to fit within the console system it is designed for although there are modchips that can be reprogrammed for different purposes , most modchips are designed to work within only one console system or even only one specific hardware version some modchips allow for installation by directly soldering the modchip 's contacts to the console 's circuit ( '' quicksolder '' ) , by the precise positioning of electrical contacts ( '' solderless '' ) , or , in rare cases , by plugging them into a system 's internal or external connector the diversity of hardware modchips operate on and varying methods they use mean that while modchips are often used for the same goal , they may work in vastly different ways , even if they are intended for use on the same console in addition to circumventing regional lockout and copy protection mechanisms , modern modchips may introduce more sophisticated modifications to the system , such as allowing the use of user-created software ( homebrew ) , expanding the hardware capabilities of its host system , or even installing an alternative operating system to completely re-purpose the host system ( e.g most modchips open the system to copied media , therefore the availability of a modchip for a console system is undesirable for console manufacturers they react by removing the intrusion points exploited by a modchip from subsequent hardware or software versions , changing the pcb layout the modchips are customized for , or by having the firmware or software detect an installed modchip and refuse operation as a consequence xbox live terms of use , section 14 in an effort to dissuade modchip creation , some console manufacturers included the option to run homebrew software or even an alternative operating system on their consoles one of the most prominent functions of many modchips & mdash ; the circumvention of copy protection mechanisms & mdash ; is outlawed by many countries ' copyright laws such as the digital millennium copyright act in the united states , the european copyright directive and its various implementations by the eu member countries , and the australian copyright act

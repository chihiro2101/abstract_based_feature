modchips operate by replacing or overriding a system 's protection hardware or software memory cards or cartridges that offer functions similar to modchips work on a completely different concept , namely by exploiting flaws in the system 's handling of media the diversity of hardware modchips operate on and varying methods they use mean that while modchips are often used for the same goal , they may work in vastly different ways , even if they are intended for use on the same console on the xbox 360 , a common modchip took advantage of the fact short periods of instability in the cpu could be used to fairly reliably lead it to incorrectly compare security signatures they usually implemented copy protection and regional lockout with game cartridges , both on hardware and software level converters or passthrough devices have been used to circumvent the restrictions , while flash memory devices ( game backup devices ) were widely adopted in later years to copy game media early in the transition from solid-state to optical media , cd-based console systems did not have regional market segmentation or copy protection measures due to the rarity and high cost of user-writable media at the time at the time , a modchip 's sole purpose was to allow the use of imported and copied game media with the advent of online services to be used by video game consoles , some manufacturers have executed their possibilities within the service 's license agreement to ban consoles equipped with modchips from using those services

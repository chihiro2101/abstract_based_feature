garrick was born at the angel inn , widemarsh street , hereford text of plaque on site of garrick theatre , hereford in 1717 into a family with french huguenot roots in the languedoc region of southern france the playwright and actor charles dibdin writes that george , when on occasion discovering his brother 's absence , would often inquire '' did david want me ? '' upon garrick 's death in 1779 , it was noted that george died 48 hours later , leading some to speculate that david did indeed want him at the age of 19 , garrick , who had been educated at lichfield grammar school , enrolled in samuel johnson 's edial hall school garrick showed an enthusiasm for the theatre very early on and he appeared in a school production around this time in the role of sergeant kite in george farquhar 's the recruiting officer upon his arrival in 1737 , garrick and his brother became partners in a wine business with operations in both london and lichfield with david taking the london operation playwright samuel foote remarked that he had known garrick to have only three quarts of vinegar in his cellar and still called himself a wine merchant in 1740 , four years after garrick 's arrival in london , and with his wine business failing , he saw his first play , a satire , lethe : or aesop in the shade , produced at the theatre royal , drury lane garrick 's performances at the theatre were a result of giffard 's help with garrick 's wine business giffard had helped garrick win the business of the bedford coffee-house , an establishment patronised by many theatrical and literary people and a location garrick frequented he made his debut as a professional actor on a summer tour to ipswich with giffard 's troupe in 1741 , where he played aboan in oroonoko with his success at goodman 's fields , charles fleetwood , manager of drury lane , engaged garrick to play chaumont in otway 's the orphan ( a role he first played in ipswich ) on 11 may 1742 while he used his letters patent to close down giffard 's theatre at the end of the london season , garrick , along with peg woffington , travelled to dublin for the summer season at the theatre royal , dublin while in dublin , garrick added two new roles to his repertoire : shakespeare 's hamlet , abel drugger in ben jonson 's the alchemist ( a role that earned him much acclaim ) and captain plume in farquhar 's the recruiting officer some of his success could be attributed to one of his earliest fans , john boyle , 5th earl of cork , who wrote letters to many noblemen and gentlemen recommending garrick 's acting with the end of the 1746â€“1747 season , fleetwoods ' patent on drury lane expired in partnership with james lacy , garrick took over the theatre in april 1747 the first performance under garrick and lacy 's management opened with an ode to drury lane theatre , on dedicating a building and erecting a statue , to shakespeare read by garrick and written by his friend , dr johnson '' certainly this statement could be regarded as succinctly summing up garrick 's management at drury lane where he was able to balance both artistic integrity and the fickle tastes of the public garrick would manage the theatre royal , drury lane , until his retirement from management in 1776 perhaps it was garrick 's acting , the most showy of his careers , that brought him the most adulation the lichfield garrick theatre takes its name from david garrick , as does the garrick room , the main function suite in lichfield 's george hotel two amateur dramatic theatres in greater manchester , the altrincham garrick theatre and the stockport garrick , also take his name

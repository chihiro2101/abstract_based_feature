sometime between 500 and 800 ce , tainos began crossing in dugout canoes from hispaniola and/or cuba to the bahamas hypothesized routes for the earliest migrations have been from hispaniola to the caicos islands , from hispaniola or eastern cuba to great inagua island , and from central cuba to long island ( in the central bahamas ) the settlement sites in the caicos islands differ from those found elsewhere in the bahamas , resembling sites in hispaniola associated with the classic taino settlements that arose after 1200 william keegan argues that the sites on caicos therefore represent a colonization after 1200 by tainos from hispaniola seeking salt from the natural salt pans on the island great inagua is closer to both hispaniola and cuba than any other island in the bahamas , and sites on great inagua contain large quantities of sand-tempered pottery imported from cuba and/or hispaniola , while sites on other islands in the bahamas contain more shell-tempered pottery ( '' palmetto ware '' ) , which developed in the bahamas while trade ( in dugout canoes ) between cuba and long island was reported by columbus , this involved a voyage of at least over open water , although much of that was on the very shallow waters of the great bahama bank craton:17 keegan:48–62 from an initial settlement of great inagua island , the lucayans expanded throughout the bahamas islands in some 800 years ( c known lucayan settlement sites are confined to the nineteen largest islands in the archipelago , or to smaller cays located less than one kilometre from those islands keegan posits a north-ward migration route from great inagua island to acklins and crooked islands , then on to long island from long island expansion would have gone east to rum cay and san salvador island , north to cat island and west to great and little exuma islands lucayan village sites are also known on mayaguana , east of acklins island , and samana cay , north of acklins there are also village sites on east , middle and north caicos and on providenciales , in the caicos islands , at least some of which keegan attributes to a later settlement wave from hispaniola population density in the southernmost bahamas remained lower , probably due to the drier climate there ( less than of rain a year on great inagua island and the turks and caicos islands and only slightly higher on acklins and crooked islands and mayaguana ) granberry & vescelius also state that around 1200 the turks and caicos islands were resettled from hispaniola and were thereafter part of the classical taino culture and language area , and no longer lucayan the lucayans were part of a larger taino community in the greater antilles the lucayans lived in smaller political units ( simple chiefdoms , compared to the more elaborate political structures in hispaniola ) , and their language and culture showed differences , but they remained tainos , although a '' hinterland '' of the wider taino world columbus thought the lucayans resembled the guanche of the canary islands ( in part because they were intermediate in skin color between europeans and africans ) descriptions of lucayan houses by the spanish match those of houses used by tainos in hispaniola and cuba : shaped like a round tent , tall , made of poles and thatch , with an opening at the top to let smoke out there are no surviving reports of the size of lucayan houses , but estimates of about 20 people per house in taino communities in pre-contact cuba are cited by keegan as a reasonable estimate for lucayan houses there are intact wooden in the collections of the musée de l'homme in paris and british museum in london ( the latter found on the island of eleuthera ) columbus visited several other islands in the bahamas hunting for gold before sailing on to cuba ) columbus spent three days sailing back and forth along the shore of an island seeking samaot european artifacts of the period have been found on san salvador , the caicos islands , long island , little exuma , acklins island , conception island and samaná cay '' sauer:160 when the spanish decided to traffic the remaining lucayans to hispaniola in 1520 , they could find only eleven in all of the bahamas

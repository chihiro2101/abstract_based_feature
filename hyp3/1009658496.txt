sometime between 500 and 800 ce , tainos began crossing in dugout canoes from hispaniola and/or cuba to the bahamas hypothesized routes for the earliest migrations have been from hispaniola to the caicos islands , from hispaniola or eastern cuba to great inagua island , and from central cuba to long island ( in the central bahamas ) the settlement sites in the caicos islands differ from those found elsewhere in the bahamas , resembling sites in hispaniola associated with the classic taino settlements that arose after 1200 william keegan argues that the sites on caicos therefore represent a colonization after 1200 by tainos from hispaniola seeking salt from the natural salt pans on the island great inagua is closer to both hispaniola and cuba than any other island in the bahamas , and sites on great inagua contain large quantities of sand-tempered pottery imported from cuba and/or hispaniola , while sites on other islands in the bahamas contain more shell-tempered pottery ( '' palmetto ware '' ) , which developed in the bahamas while trade ( in dugout canoes ) between cuba and long island was reported by columbus , this involved a voyage of at least over open water , although much of that was on the very shallow waters of the great bahama bank moreover , the tainos probably did not settle in central cuba until after 1000 , and there is no particular evidence that this was the route of the initial settlement of the bahamas craton:17 keegan:48–62 from an initial settlement of great inagua island , the lucayans expanded throughout the bahamas islands in some 800 years ( c keegan posits a north-ward migration route from great inagua island to acklins and crooked islands , then on to long island from long island expansion would have gone east to rum cay and san salvador island , north to cat island and west to great and little exuma islands from cat island the expansion proceeded to eleuthera , from which new providence and andros to the west and great and little abaco islands and grand bahama to the north were reached there are also village sites on east , middle and north caicos and on providenciales , in the caicos islands , at least some of which keegan attributes to a later settlement wave from hispaniola population density in the southernmost bahamas remained lower , probably due to the drier climate there ( less than of rain a year on great inagua island and the turks and caicos islands and only slightly higher on acklins and crooked islands and mayaguana ) granberry & vescelius also state that around 1200 the turks and caicos islands were resettled from hispaniola and were thereafter part of the classical taino culture and language area , and no longer lucayan the lucayans were part of a larger taino community in the greater antilles the lucayans , along with the tainos in jamaica , most of cuba and parts of western hispaniola have been classified as part of a sub-taino , western taino or ciboney taino cultural and language group columbus observed trade carried between long island and cuba by dugout canoe columbus thought the lucayans resembled the guanche of the canary islands ( in part because they were intermediate in skin color between europeans and africans ) there are no surviving reports of the size of lucayan houses , but estimates of about 20 people per house in taino communities in pre-contact cuba are cited by keegan as a reasonable estimate for lucayan houses craton:20 keegan:124–126 there were few land animals available in the bahamas for hunting : hutias ( taino utia ) , cyclura , small lizards , land crabs and birds columbus visited several other islands in the bahamas hunting for gold before sailing on to cuba european artifacts of the period have been found on san salvador , the caicos islands , long island , little exuma , acklins island , conception island and samaná cay such finds , however , do not prove that spaniards visited those islands , as trade among lucayans could have distributed the artifacts after columbus 's death , ferdinand ii of aragon ordered in 1509 that indians be imported from nearby islands to make up the population losses in hispaniola , and the spanish began capturing lucayans in the bahamas for use as laborers in hispaniola

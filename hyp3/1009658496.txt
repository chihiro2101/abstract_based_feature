sometime between 500 and 800 ce , tainos began crossing in dugout canoes from hispaniola and/or cuba to the bahamas hypothesized routes for the earliest migrations have been from hispaniola to the caicos islands , from hispaniola or eastern cuba to great inagua island , and from central cuba to long island ( in the central bahamas ) the settlement sites in the caicos islands differ from those found elsewhere in the bahamas , resembling sites in hispaniola associated with the classic taino settlements that arose after 1200 william keegan argues that the sites on caicos therefore represent a colonization after 1200 by tainos from hispaniola seeking salt from the natural salt pans on the island great inagua is closer to both hispaniola and cuba than any other island in the bahamas , and sites on great inagua contain large quantities of sand-tempered pottery imported from cuba and/or hispaniola , while sites on other islands in the bahamas contain more shell-tempered pottery ( '' palmetto ware '' ) , which developed in the bahamas moreover , the tainos probably did not settle in central cuba until after 1000 , and there is no particular evidence that this was the route of the initial settlement of the bahamas craton:17 keegan:48–62 from an initial settlement of great inagua island , the lucayans expanded throughout the bahamas islands in some 800 years ( c population density at the time of first european contact was highest in the south central area of the bahamas , declining towards the north , reflecting the progressively shorter time of occupation of the northern islands known lucayan settlement sites are confined to the nineteen largest islands in the archipelago , or to smaller cays located less than one kilometre from those islands lucayan village sites are also known on mayaguana , east of acklins island , and samana cay , north of acklins granberry & vescelius also state that around 1200 the turks and caicos islands were resettled from hispaniola and were thereafter part of the classical taino culture and language area , and no longer lucayan the lucayans , along with the tainos in jamaica , most of cuba and parts of western hispaniola have been classified as part of a sub-taino , western taino or ciboney taino cultural and language group keegan describes any distinctions between lucayans and classical tainos ( of hispaniola and eastern cuba ) as largely arbitrary a piece of jadeite found on san salvador island appears to have originated in guatemala , based on a trace element analysis columbus thought the lucayans resembled the guanche of the canary islands ( in part because they were intermediate in skin color between europeans and africans ) columbus reported seeing scars on the bodies of some of the men , which were explained to him as resulting from attempts by people from other islands to capture them descriptions of lucayan houses by the spanish match those of houses used by tainos in hispaniola and cuba : shaped like a round tent , tall , made of poles and thatch , with an opening at the top to let smoke out there are no surviving reports of the size of lucayan houses , but estimates of about 20 people per house in taino communities in pre-contact cuba are cited by keegan as a reasonable estimate for lucayan houses maize was a recent introduction to the greater antilles when the spanish arrived , and was only a minor component of the taino and , presumably , lucayan diets less than twelve percent of the meat eaten by lucayans came from land animals , of which three-quarters came from iguanas and land crabs columbus visited several other islands in the bahamas hunting for gold before sailing on to cuba european artifacts of the period have been found on san salvador , the caicos islands , long island , little exuma , acklins island , conception island and samaná cay after columbus 's death , ferdinand ii of aragon ordered in 1509 that indians be imported from nearby islands to make up the population losses in hispaniola , and the spanish began capturing lucayans in the bahamas for use as laborers in hispaniola '' sauer:160 when the spanish decided to traffic the remaining lucayans to hispaniola in 1520 , they could find only eleven in all of the bahamas

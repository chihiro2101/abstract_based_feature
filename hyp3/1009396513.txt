the eddystone rocks are an extensive reef approximately 12 miles ( 19 & nbsp ; km ) ssw off plymouth sound , one of the most important naval harbours of england , and midway between lizard point , cornwall and start point given the difficulty of gaining a foothold on the rocks particularly in the predominant swell it was a long time before anyone attempted to place any warning on them the first lighthouse on eddystone rocks was an octagonal wooden structure built by henry winstanley the lighthouse was also the first recorded instance of an offshore lighthouse during construction , a french privateer took winstanley prisoner and destroyed the work done so far on the foundations , causing louis xiv to order winstanley 's release with the words '' france is at war with england , not with humanity '' 01 : winstanley ’ s light ( painting 1699 – 1703 ) the lighthouse survived its first winter but was in need of repair , and was subsequently changed to a dodecagonal ( 12 sided ) stone clad exterior on a timber framed construction with an octagonal top section as can be seen in the later drawings or paintings following the destruction of the first lighthouse , captain john lovett later colonel john lovett ( c acquired the lease of the rock , and by act of parliament was allowed to charge passing ships a toll of one penny per ton he commissioned john rudyard ( or rudyerd ) to design the new lighthouse , built as a conical wooden structure around a core of brick and concrete in 1845 the lighthouse was equipped with a new second-order fixed catadioptric optic , image manufactured by henry lepaute of paris , with a single multi-wick oil lamp , replacing the old lamps and reflectors this was the first time that a fully catadioptric large optic ( using prisms rather than mirrors above and below the lens ) had been constructed , and the first such installation in any lighthouse a new lantern was constructed and fitted to the top of the tower in 1848 , as the original had proved unsatisfactory for housing the new optic smeaton 's lighthouse remained in use until 1877 when erosion to the rocks under the lighthouse caused it to shake from side to side whenever large waves hit the foundations and stub of the tower remain , close to the new and more solid foundations of the current lighthouse – the foundations proved too strong to be dismantled so the victorians left them where they stood by july 1878 the new site , on the south rock was being prepared during the 3½ hours between ebb and flood tide ; the foundation stone was laid on 19 august the following year by hrh the duke of edinburgh , master of trinity house later , in 1959 the light was electrified and the current smaller ( fourth-order ) 'bi-valve ' optic was installed ; at the same time a 'air horn ' fog signal was installed , with compressors powered from the diesel generators the lighthouse inspired a sea shanty , frequently recorded , that begins '' my father was the keeper of the eddystone light / and he slept with a mermaid one fine night / from this union there came three / a porpoise and a porgy and the other was me !

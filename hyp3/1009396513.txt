the eddystone rocks are an extensive reef approximately 12 miles ( 19 & nbsp ; km ) ssw off plymouth sound , one of the most important naval harbours of england , and midway between lizard point , cornwall and start point given the difficulty of gaining a foothold on the rocks particularly in the predominant swell it was a long time before anyone attempted to place any warning on them the first lighthouse on eddystone rocks was an octagonal wooden structure built by henry winstanley the lighthouse was also the first recorded instance of an offshore lighthouse during construction , a french privateer took winstanley prisoner and destroyed the work done so far on the foundations , causing louis xiv to order winstanley 's release with the words '' france is at war with england , not with humanity '' 01 : winstanley ’ s light ( painting 1699 – 1703 ) the lighthouse survived its first winter but was in need of repair , and was subsequently changed to a dodecagonal ( 12 sided ) stone clad exterior on a timber framed construction with an octagonal top section as can be seen in the later drawings or paintings on the night of 2 december 1755 , the top of the lantern caught fire , probably through a spark from one of the candles used to illuminate the light , or else through a fracture in the chimney which passed through the lantern from the stove in the kitchen below keeper henry hall , who was 94 at the time , died several days later from ingesting molten lead from the lantern roof construction started in 1756 at millbay and the light was first lit on 16 october 1759 in 1841 major renovations were made , woolmer 's exeter and plymouth gazette , 15 may 1841 under the direction of engineer henry norris of messrs in 1845 the lighthouse was equipped with a new second-order fixed catadioptric optic , image manufactured by henry lepaute of paris , with a single multi-wick oil lamp , replacing the old lamps and reflectors this was the first time that a fully catadioptric large optic ( using prisms rather than mirrors above and below the lens ) had been constructed , and the first such installation in any lighthouse a new lantern was constructed and fitted to the top of the tower in 1848 , as the original had proved unsatisfactory for housing the new optic smeaton 's lighthouse remained in use until 1877 when erosion to the rocks under the lighthouse caused it to shake from side to side whenever large waves hit in addition to the main light a fixed white light was shone from a room on the eighth storey of the tower ( using a pair of argand lamps and reflectors ) in the direction of the hazardous hand deeps image the lighthouse was also provided with a pair of large bells , each weighing two tons , which were suspended from either side of the lantern gallery to serve as a fog signal two years earlier the tower had been changed by construction of a helipad above the lantern , to allow maintenance crews access ; the helipad has a weight limit of 3600 & nbsp ; kg the lighthouse is referenced twice in herman melville 's epic novel moby-dick ; at the beginning of chapter 14 , '' nantucket '' : '' how it stands there , away off shore , more lonely than the eddystone lighthouse file : clouds over the hoe - geograph.org.uk - 474465.jpg clouds over plymouth hoe file : plymouth , smeaton 's tower - geograph.org.uk - 1186133.jpg smeaton 's tower file : plymouth - tinside pool , plymouth sound and smeaton 's tower - geograph.org.uk - 1180751.jpg tinside pool , plymouth sound file : smeatons tower light - geograph.org.uk - 67009.jpg sunlight through the lantern room file : smeatons lighthouse on plymouth hoe.jpg smeaton 's lighthouse , now partially re-erected on plymouth hoe

group relations are described as limited to 'eat-or-be-eaten ' , in contrast to individuals who ( do also eat but ) can engage in more complex types of interaction with the more complex cognition that sexual reproduction and social living require political implications of assuming reproduction style frames cognition and cooperation are profound and have immediate legal and political implications stricter individualist anarchists generally deny the assertion that corporations , for instance , are fundamentally different from trade unions or political party or religious institutions or even non-governmental organizations in particular the distinction is important for sexual interests , which are the most obvious interests that group-entities can not have , having no sexual feelings , and able to deal in sex only as a commodity not as a direct organismic interest , e.g the sexual individual animal can conceive ( pun intended ) of seduction , dance , flirtation , and other means of cooperation that do not involve one entity consuming and destroying the identity of the other families unlike the more economic or political entities focused on the outside world , do seem sometimes to merge or alter themselves so as to relate effectively in ways analogous to individuals ' - indeed , a traditional family is formed by exactly such a 'dance ' between two such individuals application of the theory of inherently competitive group-entities below that level is questionable to the degree that the group or the entity does have some biological identity , e.g such bases for organization would seem , like that of the kin , clan , or family , to align biological and group interests , and therefore overcome the objections that group and individual entities have nothing in common several specific proposals to do this are extant today : the theory of bioregional democracy relates political party and watershed and other ecological border and management problems explicitly , as one solution to the group-entity interest problem

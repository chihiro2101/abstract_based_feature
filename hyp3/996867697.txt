group relations are described as limited to 'eat-or-be-eaten ' , in contrast to individuals who ( do also eat but ) can engage in more complex types of interaction with the more complex cognition that sexual reproduction and social living require even if those individuals perceive those groups as serving their own interests , the anarchist argues , they are actually accepting a proxy for those interests in particular the distinction is important for sexual interests , which are the most obvious interests that group-entities can not have , having no sexual feelings , and able to deal in sex only as a commodity not as a direct organismic interest , e.g the sexual individual animal can conceive ( pun intended ) of seduction , dance , flirtation , and other means of cooperation that do not involve one entity consuming and destroying the identity of the other families unlike the more economic or political entities focused on the outside world , do seem sometimes to merge or alter themselves so as to relate effectively in ways analogous to individuals ' - indeed , a traditional family is formed by exactly such a 'dance ' between two such individuals lewis thomas noted in lives of a cell , 1975 , that people deprived of traditional life-ways could often behave in ways reminiscent of the sociopathic and predatory ways that nation-states interact , e.g application of the theory of inherently competitive group-entities below that level is questionable to the degree that the group or the entity does have some biological identity , e.g such bases for organization would seem , like that of the kin , clan , or family , to align biological and group interests , and therefore overcome the objections that group and individual entities have nothing in common accordingly , eco-anarchism and the looser green anarchisms , and related theories in green economics such as that of trustee stewardship of the commons , are more likely to perceive group-entity actions as benign if the group entity itself has a biological or ecological parameter , mission or scope

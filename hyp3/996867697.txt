group relations are described as limited to 'eat-or-be-eaten ' , in contrast to individuals who ( do also eat but ) can engage in more complex types of interaction with the more complex cognition that sexual reproduction and social living require stricter individualist anarchists generally deny the assertion that corporations , for instance , are fundamentally different from trade unions or political party or religious institutions or even non-governmental organizations in particular the distinction is important for sexual interests , which are the most obvious interests that group-entities can not have , having no sexual feelings , and able to deal in sex only as a commodity not as a direct organismic interest , e.g a response to this argument is that groups also do not feel hunger , but can act as a means for individuals to satisfy their hunger - this being the main motive for the corporation and collective economic effort , back to earliest systems of irrigation the sexual individual animal can conceive ( pun intended ) of seduction , dance , flirtation , and other means of cooperation that do not involve one entity consuming and destroying the identity of the other corporate mergers , for instance , are often presented as relationships of equals cooperating , but in fact usually one executive group or the other will be drastically reduced , the organizational structure and ethics of one of the two being obliterated more moderate eco-anarchist view : ecological alignment can tame group entities such bases for organization would seem , like that of the kin , clan , or family , to align biological and group interests , and therefore overcome the objections that group and individual entities have nothing in common accordingly , eco-anarchism and the looser green anarchisms , and related theories in green economics such as that of trustee stewardship of the commons , are more likely to perceive group-entity actions as benign if the group entity itself has a biological or ecological parameter , mission or scope

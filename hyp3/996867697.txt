group relations are described as limited to 'eat-or-be-eaten ' , in contrast to individuals who ( do also eat but ) can engage in more complex types of interaction with the more complex cognition that sexual reproduction and social living require in particular the distinction is important for sexual interests , which are the most obvious interests that group-entities can not have , having no sexual feelings , and able to deal in sex only as a commodity not as a direct organismic interest , e.g the sexual individual animal can conceive ( pun intended ) of seduction , dance , flirtation , and other means of cooperation that do not involve one entity consuming and destroying the identity of the other corporate mergers , for instance , are often presented as relationships of equals cooperating , but in fact usually one executive group or the other will be drastically reduced , the organizational structure and ethics of one of the two being obliterated as noted above , some anarchists employ arguments reminiscent of sociobiology and relate the behavior of other animals to those of humans - including that of animal groups much of anarchist discourse consists of comparing human behavior to that of other pack or social animals , and focuses on the 'collective stupidity ' such habits imply - also known in psychology as groupthink an interesting question is whether a family which exists primarily or only to provide economic , infrastructural , instructional and emotional support to specific individuals who are related , is a group-entity distinct from feelings or methods of individual sexual animals application of the theory of inherently competitive group-entities below that level is questionable to the degree that the group or the entity does have some biological identity , e.g such bases for organization would seem , like that of the kin , clan , or family , to align biological and group interests , and therefore overcome the objections that group and individual entities have nothing in common

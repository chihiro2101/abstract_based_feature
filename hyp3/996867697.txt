group relations are described as limited to 'eat-or-be-eaten ' , in contrast to individuals who ( do also eat but ) can engage in more complex types of interaction with the more complex cognition that sexual reproduction and social living require political implications of assuming reproduction style frames cognition and cooperation are profound and have immediate legal and political implications stricter individualist anarchists generally deny the assertion that corporations , for instance , are fundamentally different from trade unions or political party or religious institutions or even non-governmental organizations even if those individuals perceive those groups as serving their own interests , the anarchist argues , they are actually accepting a proxy for those interests in particular the distinction is important for sexual interests , which are the most obvious interests that group-entities can not have , having no sexual feelings , and able to deal in sex only as a commodity not as a direct organismic interest , e.g the sexual individual animal can conceive ( pun intended ) of seduction , dance , flirtation , and other means of cooperation that do not involve one entity consuming and destroying the identity of the other more moderate eco-anarchist view : ecological alignment can tame group entities application of the theory of inherently competitive group-entities below that level is questionable to the degree that the group or the entity does have some biological identity , e.g such bases for organization would seem , like that of the kin , clan , or family , to align biological and group interests , and therefore overcome the objections that group and individual entities have nothing in common

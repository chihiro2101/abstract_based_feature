forging is one of the oldest known metalworking processes smaller power hammers , or less reciprocating weight , and hydraulic presses are common in art smithies as well forging can produce a piece that is stronger than an equivalent cast or machined part as the metal is shaped during the forging process , its internal grain texture deforms to follow the general shape of the part some metals may be forged cold , but iron and steel are almost always hot forged hot forging prevents the work hardening that would result from cold forming , which would increase the difficulty of performing secondary machining operations on the piece in the case of hot forging , a high-temperature furnace ( sometimes referred to as the forge ) is required to heat ingots or billets all of the following forging processes can be performed at various temperatures ; however , they are generally classified by whether the metal temperature is above or below the recrystallization temperature cold forging typically results in work hardening of the piece drop forging is a forging process where a hammer is raised and then '' dropped '' onto the workpiece to deform it according to the shape of the die there are two types of drop forging : open-die drop forging and impression-die ( or closed-die ) drop forging as the names imply , the difference is in the shape of the die , with the former not fully enclosing the workpiece , while the latter does open-die forging is also known as smith forging 391 in open-die forging , a hammer strikes and deforms the workpiece , which is placed on a stationary anvil open-die forging lends itself to short runs and is appropriate for art smithing and custom work impression-die forging is also called '' closed-die forging '' in commercial impression-die forging , the workpiece is usually moved through a series of cavities in a die to get from an ingot to the final form in this type of forging , the die cavities are completely closed , which keeps the workpiece from forming flash closed-die forging has a high initial cost due to the creation of dies and required design work to make working die cavities glossary of forging terms and definitions evidences of forging history

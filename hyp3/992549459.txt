the smithy or forge has evolved over centuries to become a facility with engineered processes , production equipment , tooling , raw materials and products to meet the demands of modern industry in modern times , industrial forging is done either with presses or with hammers powered by compressed air , electricity , hydraulics or steam forging can produce a piece that is stronger than an equivalent cast or machined part as a result , the texture variation is continuous throughout the part , giving rise to a piece with improved strength characteristics additionally , forgings can achieve a lower total cost than casting or fabrication some metals may be forged cold , but iron and steel are almost always hot forged hot forging prevents the work hardening that would result from cold forming , which would increase the difficulty of performing secondary machining operations on the piece alloys that are amenable to precipitation hardening , such as most aluminium alloys and titanium , can be hot forged , followed by hardening in the case of hot forging , a high-temperature furnace ( sometimes referred to as the forge ) is required to heat ingots or billets owing to the size of the massive forging hammers and presses and the parts they can produce , as well as the dangers inherent in working with hot metal , a special building is frequently required to house the operation all of the following forging processes can be performed at various temperatures ; however , they are generally classified by whether the metal temperature is above or below the recrystallization temperature the main advantage of hot forging is that it can be done more quickly and precisely , and as the metal is deformed work hardening effects are negated by the recrystallization process drop forging is a forging process where a hammer is raised and then '' dropped '' onto the workpiece to deform it according to the shape of the die there are two types of drop forging : open-die drop forging and impression-die ( or closed-die ) drop forging open-die forging is also known as smith forging '' '' is a similar process that thins out sections of the forging using a convex shaped die impression-die forging is also called '' closed-die forging '' 393 one variation of impression-die forging is called '' flashless forging '' , or '' true closed-die forging '' the dimensional tolerances of a steel part produced using the impression-die forging method are outlined in the table below glossary of forging terms and definitions evidences of forging history

in modern times , industrial forging is done either with presses or with hammers powered by compressed air , electricity , hydraulics or steam as the metal is shaped during the forging process , its internal grain texture deforms to follow the general shape of the part some metals may be forged cold , but iron and steel are almost always hot forged hot forging prevents the work hardening that would result from cold forming , which would increase the difficulty of performing secondary machining operations on the piece also , while work hardening may be desirable in some circumstances , other methods of hardening the piece , such as heat treating , are generally more economical and more controllable alloys that are amenable to precipitation hardening , such as most aluminium alloys and titanium , can be hot forged , followed by hardening in the case of hot forging , a high-temperature furnace ( sometimes referred to as the forge ) is required to heat ingots or billets owing to the size of the massive forging hammers and presses and the parts they can produce , as well as the dangers inherent in working with hot metal , a special building is frequently required to house the operation the main advantage of hot forging is that it can be done more quickly and precisely , and as the metal is deformed work hardening effects are negated by the recrystallization process cold forging typically results in work hardening of the piece drop forging is a forging process where a hammer is raised and then '' dropped '' onto the workpiece to deform it according to the shape of the die there are two types of drop forging : open-die drop forging and impression-die ( or closed-die ) drop forging open-die forging is also known as smith forging in some cases , open-die forging may be employed to rough-shape ingots to prepare them for subsequent operations open-die forging may also orient the grain to increase strength in the required direction '' '' is a similar process that thins out sections of the forging using a convex shaped die in impression-die forging , the metal is placed in a die resembling a mold , which is attached to an anvil in commercial impression-die forging , the workpiece is usually moved through a series of cavities in a die to get from an ingot to the final form 393 one variation of impression-die forging is called '' flashless forging '' , or '' true closed-die forging '' closed-die forging has a high initial cost due to the creation of dies and required design work to make working die cavities

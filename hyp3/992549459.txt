forging is one of the oldest known metalworking processes in modern times , industrial forging is done either with presses or with hammers powered by compressed air , electricity , hydraulics or steam forging can produce a piece that is stronger than an equivalent cast or machined part as the metal is shaped during the forging process , its internal grain texture deforms to follow the general shape of the part hot forging prevents the work hardening that would result from cold forming , which would increase the difficulty of performing secondary machining operations on the piece also , while work hardening may be desirable in some circumstances , other methods of hardening the piece , such as heat treating , are generally more economical and more controllable in the case of drop forging operations , provisions must be made to absorb the shock and vibration generated by the hammer all of the following forging processes can be performed at various temperatures ; however , they are generally classified by whether the metal temperature is above or below the recrystallization temperature the main advantage of hot forging is that it can be done more quickly and precisely , and as the metal is deformed work hardening effects are negated by the recrystallization process cold forging typically results in work hardening of the piece drop forging is a forging process where a hammer is raised and then '' dropped '' onto the workpiece to deform it according to the shape of the die there are two types of drop forging : open-die drop forging and impression-die ( or closed-die ) drop forging open-die forging is also known as smith forging 391 in open-die forging , a hammer strikes and deforms the workpiece , which is placed on a stationary anvil open-die forging gets its name from the fact that the dies ( the surfaces that are in contact with the workpiece ) do not enclose the workpiece , allowing it to flow except where contacted by the dies impression-die forging is also called '' closed-die forging '' in impression-die forging , the metal is placed in a die resembling a mold , which is attached to an anvil in commercial impression-die forging , the workpiece is usually moved through a series of cavities in a die to get from an ingot to the final form in this type of forging , the die cavities are completely closed , which keeps the workpiece from forming flash the dimensional tolerances of a steel part produced using the impression-die forging method are outlined in the table below

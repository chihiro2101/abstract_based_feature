in modern times , industrial forging is done either with presses or with hammers powered by compressed air , electricity , hydraulics or steam smaller power hammers , or less reciprocating weight , and hydraulic presses are common in art smithies as well forging can produce a piece that is stronger than an equivalent cast or machined part as the metal is shaped during the forging process , its internal grain texture deforms to follow the general shape of the part hot forging prevents the work hardening that would result from cold forming , which would increase the difficulty of performing secondary machining operations on the piece in the case of hot forging , a high-temperature furnace ( sometimes referred to as the forge ) is required to heat ingots or billets owing to the size of the massive forging hammers and presses and the parts they can produce , as well as the dangers inherent in working with hot metal , a special building is frequently required to house the operation all of the following forging processes can be performed at various temperatures ; however , they are generally classified by whether the metal temperature is above or below the recrystallization temperature the main advantage of hot forging is that it can be done more quickly and precisely , and as the metal is deformed work hardening effects are negated by the recrystallization process cold forging typically results in work hardening of the piece drop forging is a forging process where a hammer is raised and then '' dropped '' onto the workpiece to deform it according to the shape of the die there are two types of drop forging : open-die drop forging and impression-die ( or closed-die ) drop forging open-die forging is also known as smith forging 391 in open-die forging , a hammer strikes and deforms the workpiece , which is placed on a stationary anvil open-die forging may also orient the grain to increase strength in the required direction impression-die forging is also called '' closed-die forging '' the hammer is then dropped on the workpiece , causing the metal to flow and fill the die cavities in this type of forging , the die cavities are completely closed , which keeps the workpiece from forming flash closed-die forging has a high initial cost due to the creation of dies and required design work to make working die cavities glossary of forging terms and definitions evidences of forging history

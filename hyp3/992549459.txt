forging is one of the oldest known metalworking processes in modern times , industrial forging is done either with presses or with hammers powered by compressed air , electricity , hydraulics or steam these hammers may have reciprocating weights in the thousands of pounds forging can produce a piece that is stronger than an equivalent cast or machined part as the metal is shaped during the forging process , its internal grain texture deforms to follow the general shape of the part some metals may be forged cold , but iron and steel are almost always hot forged hot forging prevents the work hardening that would result from cold forming , which would increase the difficulty of performing secondary machining operations on the piece in the case of hot forging , a high-temperature furnace ( sometimes referred to as the forge ) is required to heat ingots or billets owing to the size of the massive forging hammers and presses and the parts they can produce , as well as the dangers inherent in working with hot metal , a special building is frequently required to house the operation the main advantage of hot forging is that it can be done more quickly and precisely , and as the metal is deformed work hardening effects are negated by the recrystallization process drop forging is a forging process where a hammer is raised and then '' dropped '' onto the workpiece to deform it according to the shape of the die there are two types of drop forging : open-die drop forging and impression-die ( or closed-die ) drop forging open-die forging is also known as smith forging open-die forging may also orient the grain to increase strength in the required direction '' '' is a similar process that thins out sections of the forging using a convex shaped die impression-die forging is also called '' closed-die forging '' the hammer is then dropped on the workpiece , causing the metal to flow and fill the die cavities in this type of forging , the die cavities are completely closed , which keeps the workpiece from forming flash casting cold sizing hammerscale thixoforming forging temperature glossary of forging terms and definitions evidences of forging history

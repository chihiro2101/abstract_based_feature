ascomycetes : phylum ascomycota , biology of plants , seventh edition , w three species are now recognized : ophiostoma ulmi , which afflicted europe from 1910 , reaching north america on imported timber in 1928 , dutch elm disease , graphium ulmi ; new haven , 1936 ophiostoma himal-ulmi , a species endemic to the western himalaya ophiostoma novo-ulmi , an extremely virulent species from japan which was first described in europe and north america in the 1940s and has devastated elms in both continents since the late 1960s champion trees of britain and ireland ded is spread in north america by three species of bark beetles ( family : curculionidae , subfamily : scolytinae ) : the native elm bark beetle , hylurgopinus rufipes the smaller european elm bark beetle , scolytus multistriatus the banded elm bark beetle , scolytus schevyrewi multistriatus still acts as a vector for infection , it is much less effective than the large elm bark beetle , s rufipes can be a vector for the disease , but is inefficient compared to the other vectors 'field resistance ' is an umbrella term covering the various factors by which some elms avoid infection in the first place , rather than survive it another would be the inability of the beetles to see elms which did not break the silhouette as the xylem ( one of the two types of vascular tissue produced by the vascular cambium , the other being the phloem ) delivers water and nutrients to the rest of the plant , these plugs prevent them from travelling up the trunk of the tree , starving the tree of water and nutrients , therefore , eventually killing it the first sign of infection is usually an upper branch of the tree with leaves starting to wither and yellow in summer , months before the normal autumnal leaf shedding dutch elm disease was first noticed in continental europe in 1910 , and spread slowly and eventually extended to all other countries except greece and finland , after the elm ( london , 1979 ) in britain , the disease was first identified in 1927 by t r peace on english elm in hertfordshire the european white elm , ulmus laevis pall this first strain was a relatively mild one , which killed only a small proportion of elms , more often just killing a few branches , and had largely died out by 1940 owing to its susceptibility to viruses the disease was isolated in the netherlands in 1921 by bea schwarz , a pioneering dutch phytopathologist , and this discovery would lend the disease its name logs from canada destined for the small-boat industry , confirmed in 1973 when another consignment was examined at southampton docks this strain proved both highly contagious and lethal to european elms ; more than 25 million trees died in the united kingdom alone , while france lost 97 % of its elms by 1990 , very few mature elms were left in britain or much of continental europe , is particularly susceptible as it is the elm most favoured by the scolytus beetles the species still survives in hedgerows , as the roots are not killed and send up root sprouts ( '' suckers '' ) however , established hedges kept low by clipping have remained apparently healthy throughout the nearly 40 years since the onset of the disease in the united kingdom in 2005 , amsterdam was declared the '' elm city of europe '' : the city ’ s streets and canals are lined with at least 75,000 elms , including several generations of research-elms ( see below : resistant trees ) amsterdamse bomem some 30,000 of the 100,000 mature trees in the hague are elms , planted because of their tolerance of salty sea-winds since the 1990s , a programme of antifungal injections of the most prominent 10,000 elms , and of sanitation felling , has reduced annual elm losses in the hague from 7 % to less than 1 % ( see below : preventive treatment ) the largest concentration of mature elm trees remaining in england is in brighton and hove , east sussex , where of the 30,000 elms in 1983 research on dutch elm disease in europe , ed their survival is owing to the isolation of the area , between the english channel and the south downs , and the assiduous efforts of local authorities to identify and remove infected sections of trees immediately when they show symptoms of the disease the nps combated the disease 's local insect vector , the smaller european elm bark beetle ( scolytus multistriatus ) , by trapping and by spraying with insecticides ded reached eastern canada during world war ii , and spread to ontario in 1967 , manitoba in 1975 and saskatchewan in 1981 the provinces of alberta , manitoba , and saskatchewan all prohibit the pruning of elm trees during the middle of the year ( taking effect in april , and lasting through the end of september , july , and august respectively ) , which they deem to be the most active time of year for bark beetles dutch elm disease has reached new zealand the ministry of agriculture funded a national management programme but it was cancelled to allow more funds to be available for pests of a higher priority and adjacent areas , its cost made it uneconomical except in large cities where elms were considered valuable attractions biologist rachel carson consequently argued for improved sanitation and against spraying elms , which she saw as having been more effective in areas with earlier and greater experience countering dutch elm disease lignasan blp ( carbendazim phosphate ) , introduced in the 1970s , was the first fungicide used to control dutch elm disease this had to be injected into the base of the tree using specialized equipment , and was never especially effective it is more than 99.5 % effective for three years from beetle infections , which is the primary mode of tree infection research to select resistant cultivars and varieties began in the netherlands in 1928 , followed by the united states in 1937 ( see ulmus americana cultivars ) pumila with american red elm u ( 2007 ) bud burst phenology , dormancy release & susceptibility to dutch elm disease in elms ( ulmus spp 'valley forge ' , released in 1995 , has demonstrated the highest resistance of all the clones to dutch elm disease in controlled usda tests περλέρου ( : resistance test of greek field elm against dutch elm disease , by s it has been suggested that '' for thousands of years elms have flourished in natural balance with the scolytidae , combating occasional infections of dutch elm disease

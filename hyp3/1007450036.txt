ascomycetes : phylum ascomycota , biology of plants , seventh edition , w three species are now recognized : ophiostoma ulmi , which afflicted europe from 1910 , reaching north america on imported timber in 1928 , dutch elm disease , graphium ulmi ; new haven , 1936 ophiostoma himal-ulmi , a species endemic to the western himalaya ophiostoma novo-ulmi , an extremely virulent species from japan which was first described in europe and north america in the 1940s and has devastated elms in both continents since the late 1960s ded is spread in north america by three species of bark beetles ( family : curculionidae , subfamily : scolytinae ) : the native elm bark beetle , hylurgopinus rufipes the smaller european elm bark beetle , scolytus multistriatus multistriatus still acts as a vector for infection , it is much less effective than the large elm bark beetle , s schevyrewi was found in 2003 in colorado and utah other elm bark beetle species are also likely vectors 'field resistance ' is an umbrella term covering the various factors by which some elms avoid infection in the first place , rather than survive it this progressively spreads to the rest of the tree , with further dieback of branches often , not all the roots die : the roots of some species , notably the english elm , ulmus minor 'atinia ' ( formerly ulmus procera ) , can repeatedly put up suckers , which flourish for approximately 15 years , after which they , too , succumb dutch elm disease was first noticed in continental europe in 1910 , and spread slowly and eventually extended to all other countries except greece and finland , after the elm ( london , 1979 ) in britain , the disease was first identified in 1927 by t r peace on english elm in hertfordshire this first strain was a relatively mild one , which killed only a small proportion of elms , more often just killing a few branches , and had largely died out by 1940 owing to its susceptibility to viruses the disease was isolated in the netherlands in 1921 by bea schwarz , a pioneering dutch phytopathologist , and this discovery would lend the disease its name this strain proved both highly contagious and lethal to european elms ; more than 25 million trees died in the united kingdom alone , while france lost 97 % of its elms the disease spread rapidly northwards , reaching scotland within 10 years however , established hedges kept low by clipping have remained apparently healthy throughout the nearly 40 years since the onset of the disease in the united kingdom the largest concentration of mature elm trees remaining in england is in brighton and hove , east sussex , where of the 30,000 elms in 1983 research on dutch elm disease in europe , ed , the vector of elm disease ded was first reported in the united states in 1928 , with the beetles believed to have arrived in a shipment of logs from the netherlands destined for use as veneer in the ohio furniture industry quarantine and sanitation procedures held most cases within 150 miles of metropolitan new york city until 1941 when war demands began to curtail them 58 the disease spread from new england westward and southward , almost completely destroying the famous elms in the '' elm city '' of new haven , connecticut , reaching the detroit area in 1950 , the chicago area by 1960 , and minneapolis by 1970 the united states national park service ( nps ) used a number of methods to control the epidemic , including sanitation , pruning , injecting trees with fungicide and replanting with ded-resistant american elm cultivars ( see ulmus americana cultivars ) ded reached eastern canada during world war ii , and spread to ontario in 1967 , manitoba in 1975 and saskatchewan in 1981 in toronto , 80 % of the elm trees have been lost to dutch elm disease ; many more fell victim in ottawa , montreal and other cities during the 1970s and 1980s alberta and british columbia are the only provinces that are currently free of dutch elm disease , although , in an isolated case , an elm tree in wainwright , alberta , was found diseased in june 1998 and was immediately destroyed today , alberta has the largest number of elms unaffected by dutch elm disease in the world dutch elm disease has reached new zealand it was found in napier where it was eradicated and was also found in the auckland region in 1989 and adjacent areas , its cost made it uneconomical except in large cities where elms were considered valuable attractions it has potential in being used to trap male beetles , which carry the fungus because of the ban on the use of chemicals on street and park trees in the netherlands , the university of amsterdam developed a biological vaccine by the late 1980s the strain is believed to have enough pathogenicity left to induce an immune response in the elm , protecting it against ded during one growing season research to select resistant cultivars and varieties began in the netherlands in 1928 , followed by the united states in 1937 ( see ulmus americana cultivars ) glabra , but later included the himalayan or kashmir elm u recent research in sweden has established that early-flushing clones are less susceptible to ded owing to an asynchrony between ded susceptibility and infection ( 2007 ) bud burst phenology , dormancy release & susceptibility to dutch elm disease in elms ( ulmus spp testing for disease resistance elms are tested for resistance by inoculation with the fungal pathogen in late may when the tree 's growth is at its annual peak many attempts to breed disease resistant cultivar hybrids have usually involved a genetic contribution from asian elm species which have demonstrable resistance to this fungal disease the dutch research programme began in 1928 , and ended after 64 years in 1992 , during which time well over 1000 cultivars were raised and evaluated the programme had three major successes : 'columella ' , ulmus 'nanguen ' , and ulmus 'wanoux ' , institut national de la recherche agronomique περλέρου ( : resistance test of greek field elm against dutch elm disease , by s examination of subfossil elm wood showing signs of the changes associated with the disease has suggested that a form of ded may have been responsible

three species are now recognized : ophiostoma ulmi , which afflicted europe from 1910 , reaching north america on imported timber in 1928 , dutch elm disease , graphium ulmi ; new haven , 1936 ophiostoma himal-ulmi , a species endemic to the western himalaya ophiostoma novo-ulmi , an extremely virulent species from japan which was first described in europe and north america in the 1940s and has devastated elms in both continents since the late 1960s ded is spread in north america by three species of bark beetles ( family : curculionidae , subfamily : scolytinae ) : the native elm bark beetle , hylurgopinus rufipes the smaller european elm bark beetle , scolytus multistriatus other reported ded vectors include scolytus sulcifrons , s 'field resistance ' is an umbrella term covering the various factors by which some elms avoid infection in the first place , rather than survive it 'weeping ' elms are often spared infection owing to the beetles ' aversion to hanging upside-down while feeding in an attempt to block the fungus from spreading farther , the tree reacts by plugging its own xylem with gum and tyloses , bladder-like extensions of the xylem cell wall the first sign of infection is usually an upper branch of the tree with leaves starting to wither and yellow in summer , months before the normal autumnal leaf shedding often , not all the roots die : the roots of some species , notably the english elm , ulmus minor 'atinia ' ( formerly ulmus procera ) , can repeatedly put up suckers , which flourish for approximately 15 years , after which they , too , succumb dutch elm disease was first noticed in continental europe in 1910 , and spread slowly and eventually extended to all other countries except greece and finland , after the elm ( london , 1979 ) in britain , the disease was first identified in 1927 by t r peace on english elm in hertfordshire the european white elm , ulmus laevis pall the disease was isolated in the netherlands in 1921 by bea schwarz , a pioneering dutch phytopathologist , and this discovery would lend the disease its name the disease spread rapidly northwards , reaching scotland within 10 years thirty years after the outbreak of the epidemic , nearly all these trees , which often grew to more than 45 & nbsp ; m high , are gone in 2005 , amsterdam was declared the '' elm city of europe '' : the city ’ s streets and canals are lined with at least 75,000 elms , including several generations of research-elms ( see below : resistant trees ) amsterdamse bomem some 30,000 of the 100,000 mature trees in the hague are elms , planted because of their tolerance of salty sea-winds since the 1990s , a programme of antifungal injections of the most prominent 10,000 elms , and of sanitation felling , has reduced annual elm losses in the hague from 7 % to less than 1 % ( see below : preventive treatment ) the largest concentration of mature elm trees remaining in england is in brighton and hove , east sussex , where of the 30,000 elms in 1983 research on dutch elm disease in europe , ed prolandscapermagazine.com 24 february 2017 , named for the ancient roman name for the city : lutetia 58 the disease spread from new england westward and southward , almost completely destroying the famous elms in the '' elm city '' of new haven , connecticut , reaching the detroit area in 1950 , the chicago area by 1960 , and minneapolis by 1970 the nps combated the disease 's local insect vector , the smaller european elm bark beetle ( scolytus multistriatus ) , by trapping and by spraying with insecticides in toronto , 80 % of the elm trees have been lost to dutch elm disease ; many more fell victim in ottawa , montreal and other cities during the 1970s and 1980s alberta and british columbia are the only provinces that are currently free of dutch elm disease , although , in an isolated case , an elm tree in wainwright , alberta , was found diseased in june 1998 and was immediately destroyed today , alberta has the largest number of elms unaffected by dutch elm disease in the world the largest surviving urban forest of elm trees in north america is believed to be in the city of winnipeg , where close to 200,000 elms remain & nbsp ; – at least double that of amsterdam , the '' elm city of europe '' dutch elm disease has reached new zealand the ministry of agriculture funded a national management programme but it was cancelled to allow more funds to be available for pests of a higher priority a major outbreak occurred in new zealand in july 2013 , particularly at the site of kingseat hospital , south of auckland auckland 's elms , bts.nzpcn.org.nz/bts_pdf/abj58 ( 1 ) 2003-38-45-elms.pdf in areas sprayed during the 1950s , local people observed birds such as the american woodcock , american robin , white-breasted nuthatch , brown creeper and various poecile species dying biologist rachel carson consequently argued for improved sanitation and against spraying elms , which she saw as having been more effective in areas with earlier and greater experience countering dutch elm disease lignasan blp ( carbendazim phosphate ) , introduced in the 1970s , was the first fungicide used to control dutch elm disease it is still sold under the name '' elm fungicide '' arbotect ( thiabendazole hypophosphite ) became available some years later , and it has been proven effective the trees in the trial are exclusively american developments ; no european cultivars have been included recent research in sweden has established that early-flushing clones are less susceptible to ded owing to an asynchrony between ded susceptibility and infection testing for disease resistance many attempts to breed disease resistant cultivar hybrids have usually involved a genetic contribution from asian elm species which have demonstrable resistance to this fungal disease the programme had three major successes : 'columella ' , ulmus 'nanguen ' , and ulmus 'wanoux ' , institut national de la recherche agronomique ten resistant american elm cultivars are now in commerce in north america , but only two ( 'princeton ' and 'valley forge ' ) are currently available in europe the university of minnesota usa is testing various elms , including a huge now-patented century-old survivor known as ulmus 'st 'first genetically modified dutch elm trees grown ' , unisci.com resistantelms.co.uk , faq 'disease control ' however , owing to the hostility to gm developments , there are no plans to release the trees into the countryside upon mentioning this i found that it had been noticed in elm avenues and groups a hundred miles distant , so that it is not a local circumstance

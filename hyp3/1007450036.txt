three species are now recognized : ophiostoma ulmi , which afflicted europe from 1910 , reaching north america on imported timber in 1928 , dutch elm disease , graphium ulmi ; new haven , 1936 ophiostoma himal-ulmi , a species endemic to the western himalaya ophiostoma novo-ulmi , an extremely virulent species from japan which was first described in europe and north america in the 1940s and has devastated elms in both continents since the late 1960s ded is spread in north america by three species of bark beetles ( family : curculionidae , subfamily : scolytinae ) : the native elm bark beetle , hylurgopinus rufipes the smaller european elm bark beetle , scolytus multistriatus the banded elm bark beetle , scolytus schevyrewi multistriatus still acts as a vector for infection , it is much less effective than the large elm bark beetle , s other elm bark beetle species are also likely vectors another would be the inability of the beetles to see elms which did not break the silhouette often , not all the roots die : the roots of some species , notably the english elm , ulmus minor 'atinia ' ( formerly ulmus procera ) , can repeatedly put up suckers , which flourish for approximately 15 years , after which they , too , succumb dutch elm disease was first noticed in continental europe in 1910 , and spread slowly and eventually extended to all other countries except greece and finland , after the elm ( london , 1979 ) in britain , the disease was first identified in 1927 by t r peace on english elm in hertfordshire the european white elm , ulmus laevis pall this first strain was a relatively mild one , which killed only a small proportion of elms , more often just killing a few branches , and had largely died out by 1940 owing to its susceptibility to viruses the disease was isolated in the netherlands in 1921 by bea schwarz , a pioneering dutch phytopathologist , and this discovery would lend the disease its name this strain proved both highly contagious and lethal to european elms ; more than 25 million trees died in the united kingdom alone , while france lost 97 % of its elms one of the most distinctive england countryside trees ( see john constable 's painting salisbury cathedral from the south-west ) , the english elm u the species still survives in hedgerows , as the roots are not killed and send up root sprouts ( '' suckers '' ) however , established hedges kept low by clipping have remained apparently healthy throughout the nearly 40 years since the onset of the disease in the united kingdom amsterdamse bomem some 30,000 of the 100,000 mature trees in the hague are elms , planted because of their tolerance of salty sea-winds the largest concentration of mature elm trees remaining in england is in brighton and hove , east sussex , where of the 30,000 elms in 1983 research on dutch elm disease in europe , ed , the vector of elm disease ded was first reported in the united states in 1928 , with the beetles believed to have arrived in a shipment of logs from the netherlands destined for use as veneer in the ohio furniture industry quarantine and sanitation procedures held most cases within 150 miles of metropolitan new york city until 1941 when war demands began to curtail them 58 the disease spread from new england westward and southward , almost completely destroying the famous elms in the '' elm city '' of new haven , connecticut , reaching the detroit area in 1950 , the chicago area by 1960 , and minneapolis by 1970 the nps combated the disease 's local insect vector , the smaller european elm bark beetle ( scolytus multistriatus ) , by trapping and by spraying with insecticides as a result , the population of american elms planted on the mall and its surrounding areas has remained intact for more than 80 years today , alberta has the largest number of elms unaffected by dutch elm disease in the world the city spends 3 million annually to aggressively combat the disease using dursban and the dutch trig vaccine dutch elm disease has reached new zealand and adjacent areas , its cost made it uneconomical except in large cities where elms were considered valuable attractions in its early years , it was generally thought by observers that pesticides did slow the spread of the disease across the united states but as early as 1947 , concern was raised that many bird species were killed in large numbers by ingesting poisoned invertebrates in areas sprayed during the 1950s , local people observed birds such as the american woodcock , american robin , white-breasted nuthatch , brown creeper and various poecile species dying biologist rachel carson consequently argued for improved sanitation and against spraying elms , which she saw as having been more effective in areas with earlier and greater experience countering dutch elm disease it is more than 99.5 % effective for three years from beetle infections , which is the primary mode of tree infection resulting cultivars lacked the traditional shape and landscape value of the american elm ; few were planted however this method , developed in the netherlands , was considered too severe in america , where the principal disease vector is the bark beetle scolytus multistriatus , a far less effective vector than the larger beetle endemic to europe , scolytus scolytus , which is unknown in america in the method devised by the usda , the inoculum is introduced to the cambium via a 2 & nbsp ; mm-diameter hole drilled through the bark in the lower third of the tree another variable is the composition of the inoculum ; while an inoculum strength of 10 6 spores / & nbsp ; ml is standard in both continents , its composition reflects the different ophiostoma species , subspecies and hybrids endemic to the two continents the differences in method and inocula possibly explain why the american cultivar 'princeton ' , displaying high resistance in the usa , has often succumbed to dutch elm disease in europe many attempts to breed disease resistant cultivar hybrids have usually involved a genetic contribution from asian elm species which have demonstrable resistance to this fungal disease rubra is marginally less susceptible to dutch elm disease than the other american species , but this quality seems to have been largely ignored in american research recent research has indicated it is the presence of certain organic compounds , such as triterpenes and sterols , which serves to make the tree bark unattractive to the beetle species that spread the disease examination of subfossil elm wood showing signs of the changes associated with the disease has suggested that a form of ded may have been responsible dr oliver rackham of cambridge university presented evidence of an outbreak of elm disease in north-west europe , c first one tree was thus affected , then another , then a third , till , looking round the fields , it seemed as if every fourth or fifth tree had thus been burnt

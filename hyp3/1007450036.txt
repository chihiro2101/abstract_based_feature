three species are now recognized : ophiostoma ulmi , which afflicted europe from 1910 , reaching north america on imported timber in 1928 , dutch elm disease , graphium ulmi ; new haven , 1936 ophiostoma himal-ulmi , a species endemic to the western himalaya ophiostoma novo-ulmi , an extremely virulent species from japan which was first described in europe and north america in the 1940s and has devastated elms in both continents since the late 1960s ded is spread in north america by three species of bark beetles ( family : curculionidae , subfamily : scolytinae ) : the native elm bark beetle , hylurgopinus rufipes the smaller european elm bark beetle , scolytus multistriatus the banded elm bark beetle , scolytus schevyrewi multistriatus still acts as a vector for infection , it is much less effective than the large elm bark beetle , s other elm bark beetle species are also likely vectors 'field resistance ' is an umbrella term covering the various factors by which some elms avoid infection in the first place , rather than survive it another would be the inability of the beetles to see elms which did not break the silhouette in an attempt to block the fungus from spreading farther , the tree reacts by plugging its own xylem with gum and tyloses , bladder-like extensions of the xylem cell wall as the xylem ( one of the two types of vascular tissue produced by the vascular cambium , the other being the phloem ) delivers water and nutrients to the rest of the plant , these plugs prevent them from travelling up the trunk of the tree , starving the tree of water and nutrients , therefore , eventually killing it the first sign of infection is usually an upper branch of the tree with leaves starting to wither and yellow in summer , months before the normal autumnal leaf shedding eventually , the roots die , starved of nutrients from the leaves dutch elm disease was first noticed in continental europe in 1910 , and spread slowly and eventually extended to all other countries except greece and finland , after the elm ( london , 1979 ) in britain , the disease was first identified in 1927 by t r peace on english elm in hertfordshire the european white elm , ulmus laevis pall the disease was isolated in the netherlands in 1921 by bea schwarz , a pioneering dutch phytopathologist , and this discovery would lend the disease its name the species still survives in hedgerows , as the roots are not killed and send up root sprouts ( '' suckers '' ) since the 1990s , a programme of antifungal injections of the most prominent 10,000 elms , and of sanitation felling , has reduced annual elm losses in the hague from 7 % to less than 1 % ( see below : preventive treatment ) the largest concentration of mature elm trees remaining in england is in brighton and hove , east sussex , where of the 30,000 elms in 1983 research on dutch elm disease in europe , ed prolandscapermagazine.com 24 february 2017 , named for the ancient roman name for the city : lutetia quarantine and sanitation procedures held most cases within 150 miles of metropolitan new york city until 1941 when war demands began to curtail them 58 the disease spread from new england westward and southward , almost completely destroying the famous elms in the '' elm city '' of new haven , connecticut , reaching the detroit area in 1950 , the chicago area by 1960 , and minneapolis by 1970 the nps combated the disease 's local insect vector , the smaller european elm bark beetle ( scolytus multistriatus ) , by trapping and by spraying with insecticides in toronto , 80 % of the elm trees have been lost to dutch elm disease ; many more fell victim in ottawa , montreal and other cities during the 1970s and 1980s alberta and british columbia are the only provinces that are currently free of dutch elm disease , although , in an isolated case , an elm tree in wainwright , alberta , was found diseased in june 1998 and was immediately destroyed the provinces of alberta , manitoba , and saskatchewan all prohibit the pruning of elm trees during the middle of the year ( taking effect in april , and lasting through the end of september , july , and august respectively ) , which they deem to be the most active time of year for bark beetles it is also illegal to use , store , sell , or transport elm firewood the largest surviving urban forest of elm trees in north america is believed to be in the city of winnipeg , where close to 200,000 elms remain & nbsp ; â€“ at least double that of amsterdam , the '' elm city of europe '' the city spends 3 million annually to aggressively combat the disease using dursban and the dutch trig vaccine a major outbreak occurred in new zealand in july 2013 , particularly at the site of kingseat hospital , south of auckland in its early years , it was generally thought by observers that pesticides did slow the spread of the disease across the united states but as early as 1947 , concern was raised that many bird species were killed in large numbers by ingesting poisoned invertebrates biologist rachel carson consequently argued for improved sanitation and against spraying elms , which she saw as having been more effective in areas with earlier and greater experience countering dutch elm disease although modern critics of carson have argued that the bird deaths were caused by other factors such as mercury poisoning in the soil , spraying against elm bark beetles declined very rapidly after 1962 , a trend aided by fungicides without dangerous side-effects being discovered for the first time after many years of research arbotect must be injected every two to three years to provide ongoing control ; the disease generally can not be eradicated once a tree is infected multistriatin is a pheromone produced by female elm bark beetles , which can be produced synthetically dutch trig is nontoxic , consisting of a suspension in distilled water of spores of a strain of the fungus verticillium albo-atrum that has lost much of its pathogenic capabilities , injected in the elm in spring research to select resistant cultivars and varieties began in the netherlands in 1928 , followed by the united states in 1937 ( see ulmus americana cultivars ) glabra , but later included the himalayan or kashmir elm u the differences in method and inocula possibly explain why the american cultivar 'princeton ' , displaying high resistance in the usa , has often succumbed to dutch elm disease in europe in europe the testing of clones of surviving field elms for innate resistance has been carried out since the 1990s by national research institutes , with findings centrally assessed and published much of the work in the united kingdom is by the forestry commission 's research arm , which has had dutch elm disease on its agenda since the 1920s from analysis of fossil pollen in peat samples , it is apparent that elms , an abundant tree in prehistoric times , all but disappeared from northwestern europe during the mid-holocene period around 4000 bc , and to a lesser extent around 1000 bc a less devastating form of the disease , caused by a different fungus , had possibly been present in north-west europe for some time burton '' army of experts wage war on dutch elm disease '' popular science monthly , may 1937

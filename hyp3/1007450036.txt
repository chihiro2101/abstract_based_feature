three species are now recognized : ophiostoma ulmi , which afflicted europe from 1910 , reaching north america on imported timber in 1928 , dutch elm disease , graphium ulmi ; new haven , 1936 ophiostoma himal-ulmi , a species endemic to the western himalaya ophiostoma novo-ulmi , an extremely virulent species from japan which was first described in europe and north america in the 1940s and has devastated elms in both continents since the late 1960s ded is spread in north america by three species of bark beetles ( family : curculionidae , subfamily : scolytinae ) : the native elm bark beetle , hylurgopinus rufipes the smaller european elm bark beetle , scolytus multistriatus the banded elm bark beetle , scolytus schevyrewi multistriatus still acts as a vector for infection , it is much less effective than the large elm bark beetle , s other elm bark beetle species are also likely vectors 'field resistance ' is an umbrella term covering the various factors by which some elms avoid infection in the first place , rather than survive it a clear example would be the european white elm ulmus laevis which , while having little or no genetic resistance to ded , synthesizes a triterpene , alnulin , rendering the bark distasteful to the vector beetles , obliging them to look further afield for more suitable elms in an attempt to block the fungus from spreading farther , the tree reacts by plugging its own xylem with gum and tyloses , bladder-like extensions of the xylem cell wall dutch elm disease was first noticed in continental europe in 1910 , and spread slowly and eventually extended to all other countries except greece and finland the disease was isolated in the netherlands in 1921 by bea schwarz , a pioneering dutch phytopathologist , and this discovery would lend the disease its name one of the most distinctive england countryside trees ( see john constable 's painting salisbury cathedral from the south-west ) , the english elm u thirty years after the outbreak of the epidemic , nearly all these trees , which often grew to more than 45 & nbsp ; m high , are gone however , established hedges kept low by clipping have remained apparently healthy throughout the nearly 40 years since the onset of the disease in the united kingdom in 2005 , amsterdam was declared the '' elm city of europe '' : the city ’ s streets and canals are lined with at least 75,000 elms , including several generations of research-elms ( see below : resistant trees ) amsterdamse bomem some 30,000 of the 100,000 mature trees in the hague are elms , planted because of their tolerance of salty sea-winds since the 1990s , a programme of antifungal injections of the most prominent 10,000 elms , and of sanitation felling , has reduced annual elm losses in the hague from 7 % to less than 1 % ( see below : preventive treatment ) the losses are made up by the planting of disease-resistant cultivars the largest concentration of mature elm trees remaining in england is in brighton and hove , east sussex , where of the 30,000 elms in 1983 research on dutch elm disease in europe , ed their survival is owing to the isolation of the area , between the english channel and the south downs , and the assiduous efforts of local authorities to identify and remove infected sections of trees immediately when they show symptoms of the disease ded was first reported in the united states in 1928 , with the beetles believed to have arrived in a shipment of logs from the netherlands destined for use as veneer in the ohio furniture industry quarantine and sanitation procedures held most cases within 150 miles of metropolitan new york city until 1941 when war demands began to curtail them 58 the disease spread from new england westward and southward , almost completely destroying the famous elms in the '' elm city '' of new haven , connecticut , reaching the detroit area in 1950 , the chicago area by 1960 , and minneapolis by 1970 new york times , 5 december 1989 , nytimes.com nytimes.com/1989/12/05/science/new-varieties-of-elm-raise-hope-of-rebirth-for-davastated-tree.html ?

while the united nations had dreamed of constructing an independent city for its new world capital , multiple obstacles soon forced the organization to downsize their plans they ultimately decided to build on rockefeller 's east river plot , since the land was free and the land 's owners were well known the diminutive site on the east river necessitated a rockefeller center-type vertical complex , thus , it was a given that the secretariat would be housed in a tall office tower rather than hold a competition for the design of the facilities for the headquarters , the un decided to commission a multinational team of leading architects to collaborate on the design niemeyer met with corbusier at the latter 's request shortly after the former arrived in new york city instead , corbusier asked the younger architect niemeyer to assist him with his project niemeyer began to absent himself from the meetings le corbusier 's project 23 consisted of a large block containing both the assembly hall and the council chambers near the center of the site with the secretariat tower emerging as a slab from the south niemeyer 's plan was closer to that actually constructed , with a distinctive general assembly building , a long low horizontal block housing the other meeting rooms , and a tall tower for the secretariat the un headquarters was originally proposed alongside a grand boulevard leading eastward from third avenue or lexington avenue , between 46th street to the south and 49th street to the north these plans were eventually downsized into dag hammarskjöld plaza , a small plaza on the south side of 47th street east of second avenue , '' 'constructing ' the united nations headquarters : modern architecture as public diplomacy '' , ph.d watson , and nelson rockefeller , coordinated efforts with the powerful coordinator of construction , robert moses , and mayor william o'dwyer , to assemble acceptable interim facilities san francisco , where the un was founded in 1945 , was favored by australia , new zealand , china , and the philippines due to the city 's proximity to their countries the manhattan site was ultimately chosen over philadelphia after john d , offered to donate 8.5 & nbsp ;

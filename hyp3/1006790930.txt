this conditional statement may be written in several equivalent ways , such as '' n if s '' , '' s only if n '' , '' s implies n '' , '' n is implied by s '' , , and '' n whenever s '' in common language , this is equivalent to saying that if the conditional statement is a true statement , then the consequent n must be trueâ€”if s is to be true ( see third column of '' truth table '' immediately below ) in the above situation , one can also say s is a sufficient condition for n ( refer again to the third column of the truth table immediately below ) if the conditional statement is true , then if s is true , n must be true ; whereas if the conditional statement is true and n is true , then s may be true or be false for example , carrying on from the previous example , one can say that knowing that someone is called socrates is sufficient to know that someone has a name a necessary and sufficient condition requires that both of the implications s \rightarrow n and n \rightarrow s ( the latter of which can also be written as s \leftarrow n ) hold this is expressed as '' s is necessary and sufficient for n '' , '' s if and only if n '' , or s \leftrightarrow n the assertion that q is necessary for p is colloquially equivalent to '' p can not be true unless q is true '' or '' if q is false , then p is false '' one often finds , in mathematical prose for instance , several necessary conditions that , taken together , constitute a sufficient condition ( i.e ; example 1 : for it to be true that '' john is a bachelor '' , it is necessary that it be also true that he is : unmarried , : male , : adult , : since to state '' john is a bachelor '' implies john has each of those three additional predicates ; example 2 : for the whole numbers greater than two , being odd is necessary to being prime , since two is the only whole number that is both even and prime the thunder does not cause the lightning ( since lightning causes thunder ) , but because lightning always comes with thunder , we say that thunder is necessary for lightning it may be the case that several sufficient conditions , when taken together , constitute a single necessary condition ( i.e a condition can be both necessary and sufficient for any statements s and n , the assertion that '' n is necessary for s '' is equivalent to the assertion that '' s is sufficient for n '' to say that p is necessary and sufficient for q is to say two things : that p is necessary for q , p \leftarrow q , and that p is sufficient for q , p \rightarrow q p \leftarrow q is equivalent to q \rightarrow p , if p is necessary and sufficient for q , then q is necessary and sufficient for p

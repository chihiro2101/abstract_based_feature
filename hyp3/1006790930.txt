in the conditional statement , '' if s , then n '' , the expression represented by s is called the antecedent , and the expression represented by n is called the consequent in the above situation , n is said to be a necessary condition for s in common language , this is equivalent to saying that if the conditional statement is a true statement , then the consequent n must be trueâ€”if s is to be true ( see third column of '' truth table '' immediately below ) in other words , the antecedent s can not be true without n being true in the above situation , one can also say s is a sufficient condition for n ( refer again to the third column of the truth table immediately below ) if the conditional statement is true , then if s is true , n must be true ; whereas if the conditional statement is true and n is true , then s may be true or be false for example , carrying on from the previous example , one can say that knowing that someone is called socrates is sufficient to know that someone has a name a necessary and sufficient condition requires that both of the implications s \rightarrow n and n \rightarrow s ( the latter of which can also be written as s \leftarrow n ) hold the first implication suggests that s is a sufficient condition for n , while the second implication suggests that s is a necessary condition for n the assertion that q is necessary for p is colloquially equivalent to '' p can not be true unless q is true '' or '' if q is false , then p is false '' , individually necessary and jointly sufficient ) , as shown in example 5 ; example 1 : for it to be true that '' john is a bachelor '' , it is necessary that it be also true that he is : unmarried , : male , : adult , : since to state '' john is a bachelor '' implies john has each of those three additional predicates if p is sufficient for q , then knowing p to be true is adequate grounds to conclude that q is true ; however , knowing p to be false does not meet a minimal need to conclude that q is false ; example 2 : a number 's being divisible by 4 is sufficient ( but not necessary ) for it to be even , but being divisible by 2 is both sufficient and necessary a condition can be both necessary and sufficient in mathematics , theorems are often stated in the form '' p is true if and only if q is true '' p \leftarrow q is equivalent to q \rightarrow p , if p is necessary and sufficient for q , then q is necessary and sufficient for p

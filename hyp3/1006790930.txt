in the conditional statement , '' if s , then n '' , the expression represented by s is called the antecedent , and the expression represented by n is called the consequent this conditional statement may be written in several equivalent ways , such as '' n if s '' , '' s only if n '' , '' s implies n '' , '' n is implied by s '' , , and '' n whenever s '' in common language , this is equivalent to saying that if the conditional statement is a true statement , then the consequent n must be trueâ€”if s is to be true ( see third column of '' truth table '' immediately below ) in other words , the antecedent s can not be true without n being true in the above situation , one can also say s is a sufficient condition for n ( refer again to the third column of the truth table immediately below ) if the conditional statement is true , then if s is true , n must be true ; whereas if the conditional statement is true and n is true , then s may be true or be false for example , carrying on from the previous example , one can say that knowing that someone is called socrates is sufficient to know that someone has a name a necessary and sufficient condition requires that both of the implications s \rightarrow n and n \rightarrow s ( the latter of which can also be written as s \leftarrow n ) hold the first implication suggests that s is a sufficient condition for n , while the second implication suggests that s is a necessary condition for n this is expressed as '' s is necessary and sufficient for n '' , '' s if and only if n '' , or s \leftrightarrow n the assertion that q is necessary for p is colloquially equivalent to '' p can not be true unless q is true '' or '' if q is false , then p is false '' , individually necessary and jointly sufficient ) , as shown in example 5 ; example 1 : for it to be true that '' john is a bachelor '' , it is necessary that it be also true that he is : unmarried , : male , : adult , : since to state '' john is a bachelor '' implies john has each of those three additional predicates one says that thunder is necessary for lightning , since lightning never occurs without thunder a condition can be both necessary and sufficient to say that p is necessary and sufficient for q is to say two things : that p is necessary for q , p \leftarrow q , and that p is sufficient for q , p \rightarrow q p \leftarrow q is equivalent to q \rightarrow p , if p is necessary and sufficient for q , then q is necessary and sufficient for p

their conference , set for labor day 1979 , was to be called the '' spiritual conference for radical fairies '' , hay and others switched to the older spelling , '' faeries '' , after 1979 with the term '' radical faerie '' having been coined by hay the term '' radical '' was chosen to reflect both political extremity and the idea of '' root '' or '' essence '' , while the term '' faerie '' was chosen in reference both to the fairy and to the fact that '' fairy '' had become a pejorative slang term for gay men initially , hay rejected the term '' movement '' when discussing the radical faeries , considering it to instead be a '' way of life '' for gay males , and he began referring to it as a '' not-movement '' in organising the event , hay handled the political issues , burnside the logistics and mechanics , kilhefner the budgetary and administrative side , and walker was to be its spiritual leader rather than being referred to as '' workshops '' , the events that took place were known as '' faerie circles '' , and were on such varied subjects as massage , nutrition , local botany , healing energy , the politics of gay enspiritment , english country dancing , and auto-fellatio hay decided to found a faerie circle in los angeles that met at their house , which became known as '' faerie central '' , devoting half their time to serious discussion and the other half to recreation , in particular english circle dancing as more joined the circle , they began meeting in west hollywood 's first presbyterian church and then the olive grove atop the hill at barnsdall park ; however they found it difficult to gain the same change of consciousness that had been present at the rural gathering the group began to discuss what the faerie movement was developing into ; hay encouraged them to embark on political activism , using marxism and his subject-subject consciousness theory as a framework for bringing about societal change the gathering was also attended by an increasing number of men from outside of america , particularly canada , but also from australia , norway , france and germany , many of whom returned to their countries of origin to establish faerie communes , such as the wellington boot , common ground etc walker and kilhefner formed a new los angeles-based gay spiritual group called treeroots which promoted a form of rural gay consciousness associated with jungian psychology and ceremonial magic an effort to exclude walker and kilbourne was controversially attempted in the early 1990s and , to this day some individuals , including kilhefner attempt to erase walker from his pivotal role in the original organizing efforts throughout the 1980s the radical faerie movement had spread out from the united states and had gatherings in canada , australia , the united kingdom , and italy , as well as folleterre in france lgbt themes in mythology religion and lgbt people running water farm , site of several faerie gatherings between 1978 and 1989 subject-subject consciousness , concept proposed by harry hay modern pagan views on lgbt people pink capitalism

their conference , set for labor day 1979 , was to be called the '' spiritual conference for radical fairies '' , hay and others switched to the older spelling , '' faeries '' , after 1979 with the term '' radical faerie '' having been coined by hay the term '' radical '' was chosen to reflect both political extremity and the idea of '' root '' or '' essence '' , while the term '' faerie '' was chosen in reference both to the fairy and to the fact that '' fairy '' had become a pejorative slang term for gay men initially , hay rejected the term '' movement '' when discussing the radical faeries , considering it to instead be a '' way of life '' for gay males , and he began referring to it as a '' not-movement '' after hay and the others returned to los angeles , they received messages of thanks from various participants , many of whom asked when the next faerie gathering would be hay decided to found a faerie circle in los angeles that met at their house , which became known as '' faerie central '' , devoting half their time to serious discussion and the other half to recreation , in particular english circle dancing as more joined the circle , they began meeting in west hollywood 's first presbyterian church and then the olive grove atop the hill at barnsdall park ; however they found it difficult to gain the same change of consciousness that had been present at the rural gathering the group began to discuss what the faerie movement was developing into ; hay encouraged them to embark on political activism , using marxism and his subject-subject consciousness theory as a framework for bringing about societal change another issue of contention was over what constituted a '' faery '' ; hay had an idealized image of what someone with '' gay consciousness '' thought and acted like , and turned away some prospective members of the circle because he disagreed with their views one prospective member , the gay theatre director john callaghan , joined the circle in february 1980 , but was soon ejected by hay after he voiced concern about hostility toward heterosexuals among the group walker and kilhefner formed a new los angeles-based gay spiritual group called treeroots which promoted a form of rural gay consciousness associated with jungian psychology and ceremonial magic this second gathering included faeries who had attended the second and third gatherings in the united states , and led to continued growth of the radical faeries in australia , and repeated attempts to establish faerie communes , such as common ground ( clarence river valley ) , and eventually the ongoing commune faerieland , near nimbin , nsw throughout the 1980s the radical faerie movement had spread out from the united states and had gatherings in canada , australia , the united kingdom , and italy , as well as folleterre in france black leather wings is an organization for spiritual gay leather folk affiliated with the radical faeries

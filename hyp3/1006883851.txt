since the 1730s , when the first act of parliament to authorize a canal from the river severn to stroud had been passed , the stroudwater navigation had been seen as part of a larger plan to link london and bristol by waterway no work took place immediately , but the stroudwater was eventually opened in 1779 , and within two years the shareholders commissioned a survey for a canal from dudbridge to cricklade , which would complete the link robert whitworth then surveyed two routes , the first as suggested by priddy , and the second direct from the severn to the thames following the valley of the river coln the bill to authorise the canal passed through parliament relatively easily , and became an act on 17 april 1783 he left the construction of the canal shortly before completion to work on dudley tunnel commissioners from the river thames thought that it would have to be built for narrow boats , since the cost of a larger tunnel would be prohibitive however , a decision was made that it would be built as a broad tunnel , wide and high , and so the company advertised for tunnellers the tunnel was expected to take four years to complete when work began at the start of 1784 , but it was not completed until april 1789 the first from wallbridge to chalford opened in january 1785 , and by mid-1786 , the navigable section had reached the western portal of the tunnel , and 28 locks from wallbridge the canal was completed at a cost of £250,000 with the stroudwater navigation , which had been completed in 1779 , it completed a link between the river severn in the west and the river thames in the east the first from wallbridge to brimscombe , where there was a canal basin , was built with locks , enabling severn trows to use it the canal 's summit , which is above sea level and long , includes the sapperton tunnel , at the time , the longest in england it was assumed that the river frome , to the west of the tunnel , the river churn which flowed through cirencester , and the river coln , together with springs at boxwell and a well near the source of the river thames at thames head , would be sufficient the flow on the river churn was , whereas the calculated flow at the start of the project had been more than ten times this value in one of the attempts to conserve water , the length of the locks was reduced by , which resulted in their unusual double headed appearance the concrete invert was thick , and a brome wilson , the canal 's engineer , used pipes to feed water from the underlying springs into the canal , but at a level above the waterline on the thames , there had been a proposal for a canal from lechlade to abingdon in 1784 , and for a cut from inglesham to buscot in 1788 , but neither had been built ultimately , most of the bristol to london trade used the kennet and avon canal after it opened in 1810 , as it provided a much shorter route than the thames and severn canal the line opened to kemble in 1841 , and the tolls on the carriage of materials for the railway 's construction improved the financial position of the canal for a short time canal tolls were cut , in an attempt to retain traffic , but toll revenue fell from £11,000 to £2,874 between 1841 and 1855 in 1866 , plans to convert the canal to a railway were rejected by parliament , but the thames commissioners were replaced by the thames conservancy , and most of the river was soon returned to a navigable state complaints were made about its state in 1874 and 1885 , which resulted in surveys being undertaken , but little was done to remedy the situation image : south cerney canal.jpg thumb left the canal towpath at south cerney near cirencester following the publication of ronald russell 's influential book entitled lost canals of england and wales in 1972 , a number of canal restoration schemes sprang up among the organisations established that year was the stroudwater canal society , which soon became the stroudwater , thames and severn canal trust , and from 1975 , the cotswold canals trust volunteers for the trust have since been working to restore both the stroudwater navigation and the thames and severn canal alongside these major developments , the trust has rebuilt a number of locks and bridges and some small sections of the rest of the route are now in water phase 2 covers work at the eastern end of the

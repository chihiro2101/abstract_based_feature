since the 1730s , when the first act of parliament to authorize a canal from the river severn to stroud had been passed , the stroudwater navigation had been seen as part of a larger plan to link london and bristol by waterway no work took place immediately , but the stroudwater was eventually opened in 1779 , and within two years the shareholders commissioned a survey for a canal from dudbridge to cricklade , which would complete the link josiah clowes was appointed head engineer , surveyor and carpenter to the canal in 1783 to assist whitworth he left the construction of the canal shortly before completion to work on dudley tunnel there was great debate about the gauge of the tunnel required at sapperton commissioners from the river thames thought that it would have to be built for narrow boats , since the cost of a larger tunnel would be prohibitive the tunnel was expected to take four years to complete when work began at the start of 1784 , but it was not completed until april 1789 after completion there were problems , and the tunnel was shut for two and a half months during 1790 for further work to be carried out the summit level and a branch to cirencester were completed in 1787 , and became operational as soon as the tunnel opened the final section to the junction with the thames at inglesham , which descends through 16 locks , was finished in november 1789 the canal was completed at a cost of £250,000 with the stroudwater navigation , which had been completed in 1779 , it completed a link between the river severn in the west and the river thames in the east the first from wallbridge to brimscombe , where there was a canal basin , was built with locks , enabling severn trows to use it the canal 's summit , which is above sea level and long , includes the sapperton tunnel , at the time , the longest in england the original horse pump at thames head was replaced by a windmill , but clowes discovered that he could not stop the summit pound from leaking the wells at thames head were extended and a boulton & watt steam engine was installed in 1792 to pump the water into the canal an extra , shallow lock was built at boxwell , which allowed the level of the canal to be dropped beyond it , and more water to be taken from boxwell springs in a further attempt to prevent water loss , at king 's reach , the section immediately east of sapperton tunnel , the canal was lined with concrete rather than puddle clay on the thames , there had been a proposal for a canal from lechlade to abingdon in 1784 , and for a cut from inglesham to buscot in 1788 , but neither had been built some improvements were made to the river after 1786 , but the canal company encouraged the building of bypasses the wilts and berks canal was one , providing a link to the river at abingdon , but although it was proposed in 1793 , it was not opened until 1810 , and the north wilts canal , which provided a connecting link from latton to swindon was not completed until 1819 ultimately , most of the bristol to london trade used the kennet and avon canal after it opened in 1810 , as it provided a much shorter route than the thames and severn canal the canal company opposed the scheme , and received compensation of £7,500 from the railway company over the next four and a half years in 1866 , plans to convert the canal to a railway were rejected by parliament , but the thames commissioners were replaced by the thames conservancy , and most of the river was soon returned to a navigable state the stroudwater navigation managed to keep the remaining section open until 1933 , when it was abandoned , and their own canal closed in 1941 large trees have grown up in the 70 years since the canal was abandoned volunteers for the trust have since been working to restore both the stroudwater navigation and the thames and severn canal phase 2 covers work at the eastern end of the canal , between gateway bridge in the cotswold water park ( cerney wick ) , and inglesham lock , the junction with the thames the final section of the canal before it joins the stroudwater navigation presents particular problems for restoration , as the channel had been used as part of a flood relief scheme by the environment agency volunteers completed restoration of griffin 's mill lock in 2017 , but dredging of the intervening channel took rather longer , and the lock was opened on 9 july 2018 restoration programme phase 2 covers work at the eastern end of the canal , between gateway bridge in the cotswold water park ( cerney wick ) , and the junction with the thames at inglesham lock , a distance of about as of may 2015 , there was no significant funding in place for any restoration projects on this section of the canal canals of great britain history of the british canal system list of canal tunnels in the united kingdom the golden valley line which runs alongside the canal between stroud and kemble

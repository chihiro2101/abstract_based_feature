since the 1730s , when the first act of parliament to authorize a canal from the river severn to stroud had been passed , the stroudwater navigation had been seen as part of a larger plan to link london and bristol by waterway the canal was to be suitable for boats wide , and so could accommodate thames barges , but not severn trows clowes became resident engineer and was paid £300 per year clowes ' work on the canal gave him a reputation that made him highly sought after in the last five years of his life he left the construction of the canal shortly before completion to work on dudley tunnel commissioners from the river thames thought that it would have to be built for narrow boats , since the cost of a larger tunnel would be prohibitive it was also going to be longer than any tunnel yet built after completion there were problems , and the tunnel was shut for two and a half months during 1790 for further work to be carried out the summit level and a branch to cirencester were completed in 1787 , and became operational as soon as the tunnel opened the final section to the junction with the thames at inglesham , which descends through 16 locks , was finished in november 1789 the canal was completed at a cost of £250,000 with the stroudwater navigation , which had been completed in 1779 , it completed a link between the river severn in the west and the river thames in the east the canal 's summit , which is above sea level and long , includes the sapperton tunnel , at the time , the longest in england the wells at thames head were extended and a boulton & watt steam engine was installed in 1792 to pump the water into the canal the new arrangements were adequate , although some of the reason was the failure of traffic to develop to the levels anticipated in a further attempt to prevent water loss , at king 's reach , the section immediately east of sapperton tunnel , the canal was lined with concrete rather than puddle clay the concrete invert was thick , and a brome wilson , the canal 's engineer , used pipes to feed water from the underlying springs into the canal , but at a level above the waterline on the thames , there had been a proposal for a canal from lechlade to abingdon in 1784 , and for a cut from inglesham to buscot in 1788 , but neither had been built some improvements were made to the river after 1786 , but the canal company encouraged the building of bypasses ultimately , most of the bristol to london trade used the kennet and avon canal after it opened in 1810 , as it provided a much shorter route than the thames and severn canal the railway company was then taken over by the great western railway , who built a new tunnel at sapperton , and opened the railway to gloucester in 1845 in 1893 , the thames and severn company announced that the canal between chalford and inglesham would close two days later at the same time as the trust refurbished the canal , the upper thames was upgraded by the thames conservancy in 1925 they began negotiations with interested parties which ultimately led to the abandonment of the canal from chalford to inglesham in 1927 the stroudwater navigation managed to keep the remaining section open until 1933 , when it was abandoned , and their own canal closed in 1941 image : south cerney canal.jpg thumb left the canal towpath at south cerney near cirencester volunteers for the trust have since been working to restore both the stroudwater navigation and the thames and severn canal an additional £2.9 & nbsp ; million was received from the european inter-regional budget for this first phase phase 2 covers work at the eastern end of the canal , between gateway bridge in the cotswold water park ( cerney wick ) , and inglesham lock , the junction with the thames the pipeline runs over the top of the canal bank , and a solar-powered pump creates a vacuum within the pipe to allow the siphoning to begin since the canal was abandoned , the river frome and the oldbury brook have both been diverted to use part of the canal bed restoration programme phase 2 covers work at the eastern end of the canal , between gateway bridge in the cotswold water park ( cerney wick ) , and the junction with the thames at inglesham lock , a distance of about in june 2010 the inland waterways association ( iwa ) mounted a national campaign for £125,000 to enable inglesham lock and around of the pound above it to be restored

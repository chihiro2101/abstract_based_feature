since the 1730s , when the first act of parliament to authorize a canal from the river severn to stroud had been passed , the stroudwater navigation had been seen as part of a larger plan to link london and bristol by waterway no work took place immediately , but the stroudwater was eventually opened in 1779 , and within two years the shareholders commissioned a survey for a canal from dudbridge to cricklade , which would complete the link it is likely that john priddy – previously the engineer for the stroudwater scheme – carried out the survey , but others were soon involved including sir edward littleton , who was connected with the staffordshire and worcestershire canal the canal was to be suitable for boats wide , and so could accommodate thames barges , but not severn trows josiah clowes was appointed head engineer , surveyor and carpenter to the canal in 1783 to assist whitworth he left the construction of the canal shortly before completion to work on dudley tunnel commissioners from the river thames thought that it would have to be built for narrow boats , since the cost of a larger tunnel would be prohibitive however , a decision was made that it would be built as a broad tunnel , wide and high , and so the company advertised for tunnellers the canal opened in stages as it was completed the first from wallbridge to chalford opened in january 1785 , and by mid-1786 , the navigable section had reached the western portal of the tunnel , and 28 locks from wallbridge the final section to the junction with the thames at inglesham , which descends through 16 locks , was finished in november 1789 with the stroudwater navigation , which had been completed in 1779 , it completed a link between the river severn in the west and the river thames in the east the first from wallbridge to brimscombe , where there was a canal basin , was built with locks , enabling severn trows to use it the canal 's summit , which is above sea level and long , includes the sapperton tunnel , at the time , the longest in england it was assumed that the river frome , to the west of the tunnel , the river churn which flowed through cirencester , and the river coln , together with springs at boxwell and a well near the source of the river thames at thames head , would be sufficient the original horse pump at thames head was replaced by a windmill , but clowes discovered that he could not stop the summit pound from leaking the wells at thames head were extended and a boulton & watt steam engine was installed in 1792 to pump the water into the canal in one of the attempts to conserve water , the length of the locks was reduced by , which resulted in their unusual double headed appearance in a further attempt to prevent water loss , at king 's reach , the section immediately east of sapperton tunnel , the canal was lined with concrete rather than puddle clay the concrete invert was thick , and a brome wilson , the canal 's engineer , used pipes to feed water from the underlying springs into the canal , but at a level above the waterline ultimately , most of the bristol to london trade used the kennet and avon canal after it opened in 1810 , as it provided a much shorter route than the thames and severn canal the canal company opposed the scheme , and received compensation of £7,500 from the railway company over the next four and a half years canal tolls were cut , in an attempt to retain traffic , but toll revenue fell from £11,000 to £2,874 between 1841 and 1855 the thames commissioners were also in financial difficulties , and the thames was nearly unnavigable from oxford to lechlade after 1855 in 1866 , plans to convert the canal to a railway were rejected by parliament , but the thames commissioners were replaced by the thames conservancy , and most of the river was soon returned to a navigable state the trust included representatives from the sharpness new docks & gloucester & birmingham company , the stroudwater canal , the staffs & worcs canal , the severn commissioners , berkshire , gloucestershire and wiltshire county councils and stroud and cirencester district councils at the same time as the trust refurbished the canal , the upper thames was upgraded by the thames conservancy in 1925 they began negotiations with interested parties which ultimately led to the abandonment of the canal from chalford to inglesham in 1927 among the organisations established that year was the stroudwater canal society , which soon became the stroudwater , thames and severn canal trust , and from 1975 , the cotswold canals trust phase 1a of the restoration programme covers the length of canal from the ocean at stonehouse , on the stroudwater navigation , to brimscombe port , east of stroud , on the

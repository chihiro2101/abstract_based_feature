since the 1730s , when the first act of parliament to authorize a canal from the river severn to stroud had been passed , the stroudwater navigation had been seen as part of a larger plan to link london and bristol by waterway no work took place immediately , but the stroudwater was eventually opened in 1779 , and within two years the shareholders commissioned a survey for a canal from dudbridge to cricklade , which would complete the link robert whitworth then surveyed two routes , the first as suggested by priddy , and the second direct from the severn to the thames following the valley of the river coln the canal was to be suitable for boats wide , and so could accommodate thames barges , but not severn trows josiah clowes was appointed head engineer , surveyor and carpenter to the canal in 1783 to assist whitworth clowes ' work on the canal gave him a reputation that made him highly sought after in the last five years of his life the first from wallbridge to chalford opened in january 1785 , and by mid-1786 , the navigable section had reached the western portal of the tunnel , and 28 locks from wallbridge the final section to the junction with the thames at inglesham , which descends through 16 locks , was finished in november 1789 with the stroudwater navigation , which had been completed in 1779 , it completed a link between the river severn in the west and the river thames in the east the first from wallbridge to brimscombe , where there was a canal basin , was built with locks , enabling severn trows to use it the flow on the river churn was , whereas the calculated flow at the start of the project had been more than ten times this value an extra , shallow lock was built at boxwell , which allowed the level of the canal to be dropped beyond it , and more water to be taken from boxwell springs in one of the attempts to conserve water , the length of the locks was reduced by , which resulted in their unusual double headed appearance the concrete invert was thick , and a brome wilson , the canal 's engineer , used pipes to feed water from the underlying springs into the canal , but at a level above the waterline on the thames , there had been a proposal for a canal from lechlade to abingdon in 1784 , and for a cut from inglesham to buscot in 1788 , but neither had been built the wilts and berks canal was one , providing a link to the river at abingdon , but although it was proposed in 1793 , it was not opened until 1810 , and the north wilts canal , which provided a connecting link from latton to swindon was not completed until 1819 ultimately , most of the bristol to london trade used the kennet and avon canal after it opened in 1810 , as it provided a much shorter route than the thames and severn canal railway competition began in 1836 , when the cheltenham and great western railway proposed a line between swindon and cheltenham , via gloucester the canal company opposed the scheme , and received compensation of £7,500 from the railway company over the next four and a half years the line opened to kemble in 1841 , and the tolls on the carriage of materials for the railway 's construction improved the financial position of the canal for a short time the railway company was then taken over by the great western railway , who built a new tunnel at sapperton , and opened the railway to gloucester in 1845 in 1893 , the thames and severn company announced that the canal between chalford and inglesham would close two days later negotiations with a number of interested parties took place , and having given an assurance that it would not be converted into a railway to the great western railway , an act of parliament was obtained in 1895 , which formed a trust with powers to raise £15,000 at the same time as the trust refurbished the canal , the upper thames was upgraded by the thames conservancy although the canal was re-opened in march 1899 , lack of water on the summit level soon closed it again , after which gloucestershire county council suggested that they take it over the stroudwater navigation managed to keep the remaining section open until 1933 , when it was abandoned , and their own canal closed in 1941 volunteers for the trust have since been working to restore both the stroudwater navigation and the thames and severn canal two years later , county council support was required when the project benefited from 20 workers and a £17,000 budget for materials under the job creation scheme set up by the manpower services commission , as the council had to manage the scheme phase 2 covers work at the eastern end of the canal , between gateway bridge in the cotswold water park ( cerney wick ) , and inglesham lock , the junction with the thames during the execution of the phase 1a project , it became obvious that there would be a shortfall in funding , caused in part by the development of brimscombe port being deferred the second phase of the restoration programme covers the length of the stroudwater navigation between the ocean railway bridge , stonehouse , and saul junction on the gloucester and sharpness canal , a distance of about as of may 2015 , there was no significant funding in place for any restoration projects on this section of the canal canals of great britain history of the british canal system list of canal tunnels in

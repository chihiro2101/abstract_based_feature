since the 1730s , when the first act of parliament to authorize a canal from the river severn to stroud had been passed , the stroudwater navigation had been seen as part of a larger plan to link london and bristol by waterway no work took place immediately , but the stroudwater was eventually opened in 1779 , and within two years the shareholders commissioned a survey for a canal from dudbridge to cricklade , which would complete the link the first route was chosen , based on excellent water supplies at cirencester , although the estimates of the amount of water available proved to be wildly optimistic the canal was to be suitable for boats wide , and so could accommodate thames barges , but not severn trows commissioners from the river thames thought that it would have to be built for narrow boats , since the cost of a larger tunnel would be prohibitive the first from wallbridge to chalford opened in january 1785 , and by mid-1786 , the navigable section had reached the western portal of the tunnel , and 28 locks from wallbridge after completion there were problems , and the tunnel was shut for two and a half months during 1790 for further work to be carried out with the stroudwater navigation , which had been completed in 1779 , it completed a link between the river severn in the west and the river thames in the east beyond that , the locks were and the boats used were thames barges the canal 's summit , which is above sea level and long , includes the sapperton tunnel , at the time , the longest in england its length has only been exceeded by two other canal tunnels , at standedge in the pennines and at strood in kent it was assumed that the river frome , to the west of the tunnel , the river churn which flowed through cirencester , and the river coln , together with springs at boxwell and a well near the source of the river thames at thames head , would be sufficient an extra , shallow lock was built at boxwell , which allowed the level of the canal to be dropped beyond it , and more water to be taken from boxwell springs in one of the attempts to conserve water , the length of the locks was reduced by , which resulted in their unusual double headed appearance the concrete invert was thick , and a brome wilson , the canal 's engineer , used pipes to feed water from the underlying springs into the canal , but at a level above the waterline in the west , the situation was remedied in 1820 , with the construction of the gloucester and sharpness canal seven years later railway competition began in 1836 , when the cheltenham and great western railway proposed a line between swindon and cheltenham , via gloucester the canal company opposed the scheme , and received compensation of Â£7,500 from the railway company over the next four and a half years the line opened to kemble in 1841 , and the tolls on the carriage of materials for the railway 's construction improved the financial position of the canal for a short time the railway company was then taken over by the great western railway , who built a new tunnel at sapperton , and opened the railway to gloucester in 1845 the trust included representatives from the sharpness new docks & gloucester & birmingham company , the stroudwater canal , the staffs & worcs canal , the severn commissioners , berkshire , gloucestershire and wiltshire county councils and stroud and cirencester district councils in 1925 they began negotiations with interested parties which ultimately led to the abandonment of the canal from chalford to inglesham in 1927 the stroudwater navigation managed to keep the remaining section open until 1933 , when it was abandoned , and their own canal closed in 1941 large trees have grown up in the 70 years since the canal was abandoned among the organisations established that year was the stroudwater canal society , which soon became the stroudwater , thames and severn canal trust , and from 1975 , the cotswold canals trust volunteers for the trust have since been working to restore both the stroudwater navigation and the thames and severn canal phase 3 completes the project , connecting brimscombe port in the west with gateway bridge in the east , via sapperton tunnel water from the slad brook , which is culverted beneath stroud , joins the canal a short distance above lower wallbridge lock at capels mill , the bed of the canal was used as the route for the stroud bypass in the 1980s , and so a diversion had to be built at this point the second phase of the restoration programme covers the length of the stroudwater navigation between the ocean railway bridge , stonehouse , and saul junction on the gloucester and sharpness canal , a distance of about after they pulled out of the restoration scheme , they sold the house , which was bought by a member of the cotswold canals trust , and transferred the ownership of the lock to the trust as of may 2015 , there was no significant funding in place for any restoration projects on this section of the canal canals of great britain history of the british canal system list of canal tunnels in the united kingdom the golden valley line which runs

von frisch attracted negative attention from the nazi regime , among other things for employing jewish assistants , including many women , and for practicing '' jewish science '' eventually frisch was forced into retirement , but the decision was reversed because of his research on nosema infections in bees frisch studied aspects of animal behaviour , including animal navigation , in the carniolan honey bee ( apis mellifera carnica ) , a subspecies of the european honey bee frisch discovered that bees can distinguish various blossoming plants by their scent , and that each bee is '' flower constant '' he thought it possible that a bee 's spatial sense of smell arises from the firm coupling of its olfactory sense with its tactile sense frisch was the second to demonstrate that honey bees had color vision , the first being charles henry turner which he accomplished by using classical conditioning if the bees see the colored card as a shade of gray , then they will confuse the blue card with at least one of the gray-toned cards ; bees arriving to feed will visit more than one card in the array for example , several blossoms which may appear to humans to be of the same yellow color will appear to bees as having different colors ( multicolored patterns ) because of their different proportions of ultraviolet light scattered in a blue sky forms a characteristic pattern of partially polarized light which is dependent on the position of the sun and invisible to human eyes a small piece of blue sky is enough for a bee to recognize the pattern changes occurring over the course of a day frisch proved that variations in the position of the sun over the course of a day provided bees with an orientation tool they use this capability to obtain information about the progression of the day deep inside a dark beehive comparable to what is known from the position of the sun this makes it possible for the bees to convey always up-to-date directional information during their waggle dance , without having to make a comparison with the sun during long dance phases if a bee knows the direction to a feeding place found during a morning excursion , it can also find the same location , as well as the precise time at which this source provides food , in the afternoon , based on the position of the sun the direction of the straight stretch contains the information about the direction of the food source , the angle between the straight stretch and the vertical being precisely the angle which the direction of flight has to the position of the sun der farben- und formensinn der bienen in : zoologische jahrbücher ( physiologie ) 40 , 1–186 ( 1923 ) aus dem leben der bienen in : experientia ( basel ) 5 , 142–148 ( 1949 ) die sonne als kompaß im leben der bienen dance and communication of honey bees with the nobel lecture december 12 , 1973 decoding the language of the bee biography and bibliography in the virtual laboratory of the max planck institute for the history of science

in a capitalist society , the worker 's alienation from their humanity occurs because the worker can express labour—a fundamental social aspect of personal individuality—only through a private system of industrial production in which each worker is an instrument : i.e in the '' comment on james mill '' ( 1844 ) , marx explained alienation thus : let us suppose that we had carried out production as human beings ( ii ) in your enjoyment , or use , of my product i would have the direct enjoyment both of being conscious of having satisfied a human need by my work , that is , of having objectified man 's essential nature , and of having thus created an object corresponding to the need of another man 's essential nature they are alienation of the worker from their product , from the act of production , from their gattungswesen ( 'species-essence ' ) and from other workers aside from the workers having no control over the design-and-production protocol , alienation ( entfremdung ) broadly describes the conversion of labour ( work as an activity ) , which is performed to generate a use value ( the product ) , into a commodity , which—like products—can be assigned an exchange value moreover , the capitalist production system also reifies labour into the '' concrete '' concept of '' work '' ( a job ) , for which the worker is paid wages—at the lowest-possible rate—that maintain a maximum rate of return on the capitalist 's investment capital ; this is an aspect of exploitation furthermore , with such a reified system of industrial production , the profit ( exchange value ) generated by the sale of the goods and services ( products ) that could be paid to the workers is instead paid to the capitalist classes : the functional capitalist , who manages the means of production ; and the rentier capitalism , who owns the means of production '' by means of commodification , the labor power of the worker is reduced to wages ( an exchange value ) ; the psychological estrangement ( entfremdung ) of the worker results from the unmediated relation between his productive labor and the wages paid to him for the labor the worker is alienated from the means of production via two forms ; wage compulsion and the imposed production content the distribution of private property in the hands of wealth owners , combined with government enforced taxes compel workers to labor in a capitalist world , our means of survival is based on monetary exchange , therefore we have no other choice than to sell our labour power and consequently be bound to the demands of the capitalist the worker therefore only feels himself outside his work , and in his work feels outside himself ; '' '' labor is external to the worker , '' marx , karl a person 's mind should be free and conscious , instead it is controlled and directed by the capitalist , '' the external character of labor for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own but someone else 's , that it does not belong to him , that in it he belongs , not to himself , but to another moreover , the near-total mechanization and automation of the industrial production system would allow the ( newly ) dominant bourgeois capitalist social class to exploit the working class to the degree that the value obtained from their labour would diminish the ability of the worker to materially survive in the classless , collectively-managed communist society , the exchange of value between the objectified productive labour of one worker and the consumption benefit derived from that production will not be determined by or directed to the narrow interests of a bourgeois capitalist class , but instead will be directed to meet the needs of each producer and consumer furthermore , in the capitalist mode of production the philosophic collusion of religion in justifying the relations of production facilitates the realization and then worsens the alienation ( entfremdung ) of the worker from their humanity ; it is a socio-economic role independent of religion being '' opiate of the people '' in chapter 4 of the holy family ( 1845 ) , marx said that capitalists and proletarians are equally alienated , but that each social class experiences alienation in a different form : the propertied class and the class of the proletariat present the same human self-estrangement

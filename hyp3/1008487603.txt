in a capitalist society , the worker 's alienation from their humanity occurs because the worker can express labour—a fundamental social aspect of personal individuality—only through a private system of industrial production in which each worker is an instrument : i.e in the '' comment on james mill '' ( 1844 ) , marx explained alienation thus : let us suppose that we had carried out production as human beings ( ii ) in your enjoyment , or use , of my product i would have the direct enjoyment both of being conscious of having satisfied a human need by my work , that is , of having objectified man 's essential nature , and of having thus created an object corresponding to the need of another man 's essential nature in the economic and philosophic manuscripts of 1844 ( 1844/1932 ) , marx identified four types of alienation that occur to the worker labouring under a capitalism system of industrial production they are alienation of the worker from their product , from the act of production , from their gattungswesen ( 'species-essence ' ) and from other workers that is , the capitalist gains control of the manual and intellectual workers and the benefits of their labour , with a system of industrial production that converts said labour into concrete products ( goods and services ) that benefit the consumer moreover , the capitalist production system also reifies labour into the '' concrete '' concept of '' work '' ( a job ) , for which the worker is paid wages—at the lowest-possible rate—that maintain a maximum rate of return on the capitalist 's investment capital ; this is an aspect of exploitation the worker is alienated from the means of production via two forms ; wage compulsion and the imposed production content in a capitalist world , our means of survival is based on monetary exchange , therefore we have no other choice than to sell our labour power and consequently be bound to the demands of the capitalist during work , the worker is miserable , unhappy and drained of their energy , work '' mortifies his body and ruins his mind the worker is being controlled and told what to do since they do not own the means of production they have no say in production , '' labor is external to the worker , i.e a person 's mind should be free and conscious , instead it is controlled and directed by the capitalist , '' the external character of labor for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own but someone else 's , that it does not belong to him , that in it he belongs , not to himself , but to another one societal group ( class ) owned and controlled the means of production while another societal class worked the means of production and in the relations of production of that status quo the goal of the owner-class was to economically benefit as much as possible from the labour of the working class in the resultant communist society , the fundamental relation of the workers to the means of production would be equal and non-conflictual because there would be no artificial distinctions about the value of a worker 's labour ; the worker 's humanity ( gattungswesen ) thus respected , men and women would not become alienated in a capitalist economy , the businesses who own the means of production establish a competitive labour-market meant to extract from the worker as much labour ( value ) as possible in the form of capital the capitalist economy 's arrangement of the relations of production provokes social conflict by pitting worker against worker in a competition for '' higher wages '' , thereby alienating them from their mutual economic interests ; the effect is a false consciousness , which is a form of ideological control exercised by the capitalist bourgeoisie through its cultural hegemony in chapter 4 of the holy family ( 1845 ) , marx said that capitalists and proletarians are equally alienated , but that each social class experiences alienation in a different form : the propertied class and the class of the proletariat present the same human self-estrangement

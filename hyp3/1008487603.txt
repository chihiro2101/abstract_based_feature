in a capitalist society , the worker 's alienation from their humanity occurs because the worker can express labour—a fundamental social aspect of personal individuality—only through a private system of industrial production in which each worker is an instrument : i.e ( i ) in my production i would have objectified my individuality , its specific character , and , therefore , enjoyed not only an individual manifestation of my life during the activity , but also , when looking at the object , i would have the individual pleasure of knowing my personality to be objective , visible to the senses , and , hence , a power beyond all doubt in the economic and philosophic manuscripts of 1844 ( 1844/1932 ) , marx identified four types of alienation that occur to the worker labouring under a capitalism system of industrial production they are alienation of the worker from their product , from the act of production , from their gattungswesen ( 'species-essence ' ) and from other workers aside from the workers having no control over the design-and-production protocol , alienation ( entfremdung ) broadly describes the conversion of labour ( work as an activity ) , which is performed to generate a use value ( the product ) , into a commodity , which—like products—can be assigned an exchange value that is , the capitalist gains control of the manual and intellectual workers and the benefits of their labour , with a system of industrial production that converts said labour into concrete products ( goods and services ) that benefit the consumer furthermore , with such a reified system of industrial production , the profit ( exchange value ) generated by the sale of the goods and services ( products ) that could be paid to the workers is instead paid to the capitalist classes : the functional capitalist , who manages the means of production ; and the rentier capitalism , who owns the means of production '' by means of commodification , the labor power of the worker is reduced to wages ( an exchange value ) ; the psychological estrangement ( entfremdung ) of the worker results from the unmediated relation between his productive labor and the wages paid to him for the labor the worker therefore only feels himself outside his work , and in his work feels outside himself ; '' '' labor is external to the worker , '' marx , karl a person 's mind should be free and conscious , instead it is controlled and directed by the capitalist , '' the external character of labor for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own but someone else 's , that it does not belong to him , that in it he belongs , not to himself , but to another the gattungswesen ( 'species-essence ' or 'human nature ' ) , human nature of individuals is not discrete ( separate and apart ) from their activity as a worker and as such species-essence also comprises all of innate human potential as a person whereas a person 's gattungswesen does not exist independently of specific , historically conditioned activities , the essential nature of a human being is actualized when an individual—within their given historical circumstance—is free to subordinate their will to the internal demands they have imposed upon themselves by their imagination and not the external demands imposed upon individuals by other people whatever the character of a person 's consciousness ( will and imagination ) , societal existence is conditioned by their relationships with the people and things that facilitate survival , which is fundamentally dependent upon cooperation with others , thus , a person 's consciousness is determined inter-subjectively ( collectively ) , not subjectively ( individually ) , because humans are a social animal one societal group ( class ) owned and controlled the means of production while another societal class worked the means of production and in the relations of production of that status quo the goal of the owner-class was to economically benefit as much as possible from the labour of the working class in the course of economic development when a new type of economy displaced an old type of economy—agrarian feudalism superseded by mercantilism , in turn superseded by the industrial revolution—the rearranged economic order of the social classes favored the social class who controlled the technology ( the means of production ) that made possible the change in the relations of production in the resultant communist society , the fundamental relation of the workers to the means of production would be equal and non-conflictual because there would be no artificial distinctions about the value of a worker 's labour ; the worker 's humanity ( gattungswesen ) thus respected , men and women would not become alienated in chapter 4 of the holy family ( 1845 ) , marx said that capitalists and proletarians are equally alienated , but that each social class experiences alienation in a different form : the propertied class and the class of the proletariat present the same human self-estrangement

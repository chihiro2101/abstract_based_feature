in a capitalist society , the worker 's alienation from their humanity occurs because the worker can express labour—a fundamental social aspect of personal individuality—only through a private system of industrial production in which each worker is an instrument : i.e in the '' comment on james mill '' ( 1844 ) , marx explained alienation thus : let us suppose that we had carried out production as human beings ( i ) in my production i would have objectified my individuality , its specific character , and , therefore , enjoyed not only an individual manifestation of my life during the activity , but also , when looking at the object , i would have the individual pleasure of knowing my personality to be objective , visible to the senses , and , hence , a power beyond all doubt ( ii ) in your enjoyment , or use , of my product i would have the direct enjoyment both of being conscious of having satisfied a human need by my work , that is , of having objectified man 's essential nature , and of having thus created an object corresponding to the need of another man 's essential nature aside from the workers having no control over the design-and-production protocol , alienation ( entfremdung ) broadly describes the conversion of labour ( work as an activity ) , which is performed to generate a use value ( the product ) , into a commodity , which—like products—can be assigned an exchange value that is , the capitalist gains control of the manual and intellectual workers and the benefits of their labour , with a system of industrial production that converts said labour into concrete products ( goods and services ) that benefit the consumer moreover , the capitalist production system also reifies labour into the '' concrete '' concept of '' work '' ( a job ) , for which the worker is paid wages—at the lowest-possible rate—that maintain a maximum rate of return on the capitalist 's investment capital ; this is an aspect of exploitation furthermore , with such a reified system of industrial production , the profit ( exchange value ) generated by the sale of the goods and services ( products ) that could be paid to the workers is instead paid to the capitalist classes : the functional capitalist , who manages the means of production ; and the rentier capitalism , who owns the means of production in the capitalist mode of production , the generation of products ( goods and services ) is accomplished with an endless sequence of discrete , repetitive motions that offer the worker little psychological satisfaction for '' a job well done the worker therefore only feels himself outside his work , and in his work feels outside himself ; '' '' labor is external to the worker , '' marx , karl conceptually , in the term species-essence , the word species describes the intrinsic human mental essence that is characterized by a '' plurality of interests '' and '' psychological dynamism , '' whereby every individual has the desire and the tendency to engage in the many activities that promote mutual human survival and psychological well-being , by means of emotional connections with other people , with society whatever the character of a person 's consciousness ( will and imagination ) , societal existence is conditioned by their relationships with the people and things that facilitate survival , which is fundamentally dependent upon cooperation with others , thus , a person 's consciousness is determined inter-subjectively ( collectively ) , not subjectively ( individually ) , because humans are a social animal in the course of history , to ensure individual survival societies have organized themselves into groups who have different , basic relationships to the means of production moreover , the near-total mechanization and automation of the industrial production system would allow the ( newly ) dominant bourgeois capitalist social class to exploit the working class to the degree that the value obtained from their labour would diminish the ability of the worker to materially survive in a capitalist economy , the businesses who own the means of production establish a competitive labour-market meant to extract from the worker as much labour ( value ) as possible in the form of capital that humans psychologically require the life activities that lead to their self-actualisation as persons remains a consideration of secondary historical relevance because the capitalist mode of production eventually will exploit and impoverish the proletariat until compelling them to social revolution for survival in chapter 4 of the holy family ( 1845 ) , marx said that capitalists and proletarians are equally alienated , but that each social class experiences alienation in a different form : the propertied class and the class of the proletariat present the same human self-estrangement

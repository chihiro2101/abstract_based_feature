in a capitalist society , the worker 's alienation from their humanity occurs because the worker can express labour—a fundamental social aspect of personal individuality—only through a private system of industrial production in which each worker is an instrument : i.e in the '' comment on james mill '' ( 1844 ) , marx explained alienation thus : let us suppose that we had carried out production as human beings our products would be so many mirrors in which we saw reflected our essential nature in the economic and philosophic manuscripts of 1844 ( 1844/1932 ) , marx identified four types of alienation that occur to the worker labouring under a capitalism system of industrial production they are alienation of the worker from their product , from the act of production , from their gattungswesen ( 'species-essence ' ) and from other workers the design of the product and how it is produced are determined , not by the producers who make it ( the workers ) , nor by the consumers of the product ( the buyers ) , but by the capitalist class who besides accommodating the worker 's manual labour also accommodate the intellectual labour of the engineer and the industrial designer who create the product in order to shape the taste of the consumer to buy the goods and services at a price that yields a maximal profit aside from the workers having no control over the design-and-production protocol , alienation ( entfremdung ) broadly describes the conversion of labour ( work as an activity ) , which is performed to generate a use value ( the product ) , into a commodity , which—like products—can be assigned an exchange value in the capitalist mode of production , the generation of products ( goods and services ) is accomplished with an endless sequence of discrete , repetitive motions that offer the worker little psychological satisfaction for '' a job well done '' by means of commodification , the labor power of the worker is reduced to wages ( an exchange value ) ; the psychological estrangement ( entfremdung ) of the worker results from the unmediated relation between his productive labor and the wages paid to him for the labor a person 's mind should be free and conscious , instead it is controlled and directed by the capitalist , '' the external character of labor for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own but someone else 's , that it does not belong to him , that in it he belongs , not to himself , but to another the gattungswesen ( 'species-essence ' or 'human nature ' ) , human nature of individuals is not discrete ( separate and apart ) from their activity as a worker and as such species-essence also comprises all of innate human potential as a person one societal group ( class ) owned and controlled the means of production while another societal class worked the means of production and in the relations of production of that status quo the goal of the owner-class was to economically benefit as much as possible from the labour of the working class likewise , there occurred a corresponding rearrangement of the human nature ( gattungswesen ) and the value system of the owner-class and of the working-class , which allowed each group of people to accept and to function in the rearranged status quo of production-relations in the resultant communist society , the fundamental relation of the workers to the means of production would be equal and non-conflictual because there would be no artificial distinctions about the value of a worker 's labour ; the worker 's humanity ( gattungswesen ) thus respected , men and women would not become alienated furthermore , in the capitalist mode of production the philosophic collusion of religion in justifying the relations of production facilitates the realization and then worsens the alienation ( entfremdung ) of the worker from their humanity ; it is a socio-economic role independent of religion being '' opiate of the people '' therefore , alienation is a lack of self-worth , the absence of meaning in one 's life , consequent to being coerced to lead a life without opportunity for self-fulfillment , without the opportunity to become actualized , to become one 's self in chapter 4 of the holy family ( 1845 ) , marx said that capitalists and proletarians are equally alienated , but that each social class experiences alienation in a different form : the propertied class and the class of the proletariat present the same human self-estrangement

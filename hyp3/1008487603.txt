in a capitalist society , the worker 's alienation from their humanity occurs because the worker can express labour—a fundamental social aspect of personal individuality—only through a private system of industrial production in which each worker is an instrument : i.e ( ii ) in your enjoyment , or use , of my product i would have the direct enjoyment both of being conscious of having satisfied a human need by my work , that is , of having objectified man 's essential nature , and of having thus created an object corresponding to the need of another man 's essential nature in the economic and philosophic manuscripts of 1844 ( 1844/1932 ) , marx identified four types of alienation that occur to the worker labouring under a capitalism system of industrial production they are alienation of the worker from their product , from the act of production , from their gattungswesen ( 'species-essence ' ) and from other workers aside from the workers having no control over the design-and-production protocol , alienation ( entfremdung ) broadly describes the conversion of labour ( work as an activity ) , which is performed to generate a use value ( the product ) , into a commodity , which—like products—can be assigned an exchange value that is , the capitalist gains control of the manual and intellectual workers and the benefits of their labour , with a system of industrial production that converts said labour into concrete products ( goods and services ) that benefit the consumer furthermore , with such a reified system of industrial production , the profit ( exchange value ) generated by the sale of the goods and services ( products ) that could be paid to the workers is instead paid to the capitalist classes : the functional capitalist , who manages the means of production ; and the rentier capitalism , who owns the means of production in the capitalist mode of production , the generation of products ( goods and services ) is accomplished with an endless sequence of discrete , repetitive motions that offer the worker little psychological satisfaction for '' a job well done '' by means of commodification , the labor power of the worker is reduced to wages ( an exchange value ) ; the psychological estrangement ( entfremdung ) of the worker results from the unmediated relation between his productive labor and the wages paid to him for the labor the worker is alienated from the means of production via two forms ; wage compulsion and the imposed production content the worker therefore only feels himself outside his work , and in his work feels outside himself ; '' '' labor is external to the worker , '' marx , karl the worker is being controlled and told what to do since they do not own the means of production they have no say in production , '' labor is external to the worker , i.e the gattungswesen ( 'species-essence ' or 'human nature ' ) , human nature of individuals is not discrete ( separate and apart ) from their activity as a worker and as such species-essence also comprises all of innate human potential as a person hence ? , when the proletarian working-class become a sufficiently developed political force , they will effect a revolution and re-orient the relations of production to the means of production—from a capitalist mode of production to a communist mode of production under the collective ownership of the means of production , the relation of each worker to the mode of production will be identical and will assume the character that corresponds to the universal interests of the communist society in a capitalist economy , the businesses who own the means of production establish a competitive labour-market meant to extract from the worker as much labour ( value ) as possible in the form of capital in part i : '' feuerbach – opposition of the materialist and idealist outlook '' of the german ideology ( 1846 ) , karl marx said the following : things have now come to such a pass that the individuals must appropriate the existing totality of productive forces , not only to achieve self-activity , but also , merely , to safeguard their very existence

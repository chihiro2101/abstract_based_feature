cantharidin , from the greek kantharis , for beetle , is an odorless , colorless natural product with solubility in various organic solvents , but only slight solubility in water its functionalities include a organic acid anhydride ( −co−o−co− ) substructure in one of its rings , as well as a bridging ether in its bicyclic ring system however , feeding studies indicate that the biosynthetic process is more complicated and not a simple product of geranyl pyrophosphate or related ten-carbon parent structure as the seeming monoterpene nature would suggest the level of cantharidin in blister beetles can be quite variable immaculata contains 4.8 & nbsp ; mg per beetle ; males also contain higher levels than females males of berberomeloe majalis have higher level of cantharidin per beetle : 64.22 ± 51.28 & nbsp ; mg/g ( dry weight ) and 9.10 ± 12.64 & nbsp ; mg/g ( d cantharidin content in haemolymph is also higher in males ( 80.9 ± 106.5 & nbsp ; µg/g ) than in females ( 20.0 ± 41.5 & nbsp ; µg/g ) preparations made from spanish fly have been used since ancient times as an aphrodisiac , possibly because their physical effects were perceived to mimic those of sexual arousal , john l taberner , aphrodisiacs : the science and the myth , springer science & business media , 2012 , pp.100ff these preparations were known as cantharides , from the greek word for '' beetle '' the same paré also cites the case of a priest who died of hematuria after swallowing a dose of cantharides which he intended to fortify his sex drive police searches in connection with a rash of poisonings around 1680 turned up many stashes of '' bluish flies '' which were known to be used in the preparation of aphrodisiac potions they were multicolored tablets nicknamed '' pastilles de richelieu '' after the maréchal de richelieu , a notorious libertine ( not to be confused with his great-uncle the cardinal richelieu ) who procured sexual encounters for king louis xv poisoning from cantharidin is a significant veterinary concern , especially in horses by epicauta species ; species infesting feedstocks depend on region—e.g great bustards , a strongly polygynous bird species , are not immune to the toxicity of cantharidin ; they become intoxicated after ingesting blister beetles ; however , cantharidin has activity also against parasites that infect them the extreme toxicity of cantharidin makes any use as an aphrodisiac highly dangerous in addition to topical medical applications , cantharidin and its analogues may have activity against cancer cells

cantharidin , from the greek kantharis , for beetle , is an odorless , colorless natural product with solubility in various organic solvents , but only slight solubility in water the complete mechanism of the biosynthesis of cantharidin is unknown the level of cantharidin in blister beetles can be quite variable immaculata contains 4.8 & nbsp ; mg per beetle ; males also contain higher levels than females males of berberomeloe majalis have higher level of cantharidin per beetle : 64.22 ± 51.28 & nbsp ; mg/g ( dry weight ) and 9.10 ± 12.64 & nbsp ; mg/g ( d cantharidin content in haemolymph is also higher in males ( 80.9 ± 106.5 & nbsp ; µg/g ) than in females ( 20.0 ± 41.5 & nbsp ; µg/g ) taberner , aphrodisiacs : the science and the myth , springer science & business media , 2012 , pp.100ff these preparations were known as cantharides , from the greek word for '' beetle '' cantharides were in widespread use among the upper classes in france in the 1600s , despite being a banned substance preparations of dried blister beetles were at one time used as a treatment for smallpox cantharidin was first isolated as a chemically pure substance in 1810 by pierre robiquet , a french chemist then living in paris robiquet isolated cantharidin as the active ingredient in pharmacological preparations of lytta vesicatoria , a.k.a poisoning from cantharidin is a significant veterinary concern , especially in horses by epicauta species ; species infesting feedstocks depend on region—e.g horses may be accidentally poisoned when fed bales of fodder with blister beetles in them great bustards may eat toxic blister beetles of the genus meloe to increase the sexual arousal of males ingesting cantharidin can initially cause severe damage to the lining of the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts , and may also cause permanent renal damage cantharidin appears to have some effect in the topical treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis in animal models

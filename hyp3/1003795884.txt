the complete mechanism of the biosynthesis of cantharidin is unknown however , feeding studies indicate that the biosynthetic process is more complicated and not a simple product of geranyl pyrophosphate or related ten-carbon parent structure as the seeming monoterpene nature would suggest the level of cantharidin in blister beetles can be quite variable among blister beetles of the genus epicauta in colorado , e immaculata contains 4.8 & nbsp ; mg per beetle ; males also contain higher levels than females males of berberomeloe majalis have higher level of cantharidin per beetle : 64.22 ± 51.28 & nbsp ; mg/g ( dry weight ) and 9.10 ± 12.64 & nbsp ; mg/g ( d cantharidin content in haemolymph is also higher in males ( 80.9 ± 106.5 & nbsp ; µg/g ) than in females ( 20.0 ± 41.5 & nbsp ; µg/g ) the same paré also cites the case of a priest who died of hematuria after swallowing a dose of cantharides which he intended to fortify his sex drive jacques levron , le maréchal de richelieu , un libertin fastueux ( paris , perrin , 1971 ) 1540–1610 ) reported the use of blister beetles as a poison as well as an aphrodisiac preparations of dried blister beetles were at one time used as a treatment for smallpox robiquet found cantharidin to be an odorless and colorless solid at room temperature as a blister agent , cantharidin has the potential to cause adverse effects when used medically ; for this reason , it has been included in a list of '' problem drugs '' used by dermatologists and emergency personnel ingesting cantharidin can initially cause severe damage to the lining of the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts , and may also cause permanent renal damage as a result , it is illegal to sell ( or use ) cantharidin or preparations containing it without a prescription in many countries in addition to topical medical applications , cantharidin and its analogues may have activity against cancer cells

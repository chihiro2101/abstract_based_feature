in later hellenistic greek theatres the proskenion ( προσκήνιον ) was a rather narrow raised stage where solo actors performed , while the greek chorus and musicians remained in the '' orchestra '' in front and below it , and there were often further areas for performing from above and behind the proskenion , on and behind the skene skene is the greek word ( meaning '' tent '' ) for the tent , and later building , at the back of the stage from which actors entered , and which often supported painted scenery 168 , 1993 , oup , in ancient rome , the stage area in front of the scaenae frons ( equivalent to the greek skene ) was known as the pulpitum , and the vertical front dropping from the stage to the orchestra floor , often in stone and decorated , as the proscaenium , again meaning '' in front of the skene '' in the greek and roman theatre , no proscenium arch existed , in the modern sense , and the acting space was always fully in the view of the audience however , roman theatres were similar to modern proscenium theatres in the sense that the entire audience had a restricted range of views on the stage—all of which were from the front , rather than the sides or back no proscenium arch divides the seating area from the '' proscenium '' ( stage ) , and the space between the two has been made as open as possible , without endangering the structural integrity of the building the oldest surviving indoor theatre of the modern era , the teatro olimpico in vicenza ( 1585 ) , is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the first example of a proscenium theatre it has a plain proscaenium at the front of the stage , dropping to the orchestra level , now usually containing '' stalls '' seating , but no proscenium arch however , the teatro olimpico 's exact replication of the open and accessible roman stage was the exception rather than the rule in sixteenth-century theatre design the staging in proscenium theatres often implies that the characters performing on stage are doing so in a four-walled environment , with the '' wall '' facing the audience being invisible prior to the use of proscenium stages , early court ballets took place in large chambers where the audience members sat around and above the dance space later on , the use of the proscenium stage for performances established a separation of the audience from the performers traverse stage : the stage is surrounded on two sides by the audience theatre in the round : the stage is surrounded by audience on all sides

skene is the greek word ( meaning '' tent '' ) for the tent , and later building , at the back of the stage from which actors entered , and which often supported painted scenery 168 , 1993 , oup , in ancient rome , the stage area in front of the scaenae frons ( equivalent to the greek skene ) was known as the pulpitum , and the vertical front dropping from the stage to the orchestra floor , often in stone and decorated , as the proscaenium , again meaning '' in front of the skene '' in the greek and roman theatre , no proscenium arch existed , in the modern sense , and the acting space was always fully in the view of the audience however , roman theatres were similar to modern proscenium theatres in the sense that the entire audience had a restricted range of views on the stageâ€”all of which were from the front , rather than the sides or back no proscenium arch divides the seating area from the '' proscenium '' ( stage ) , and the space between the two has been made as open as possible , without endangering the structural integrity of the building the oldest surviving indoor theatre of the modern era , the teatro olimpico in vicenza ( 1585 ) , is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the first example of a proscenium theatre it has a plain proscaenium at the front of the stage , dropping to the orchestra level , now usually containing '' stalls '' seating , but no proscenium arch however , the teatro olimpico 's exact replication of the open and accessible roman stage was the exception rather than the rule in sixteenth-century theatre design while the proscenium arch became an important feature of the traditional european theatre , often becoming very large and elaborate , the original proscaenium front below the stage became plainer what the romans would have called the proscaenium is , in modern theatres with orchestra pits , normally painted black in order that it does not draw attention this emulation of the roman model extended to refer to the stage area as the '' proscenium '' , and some writers have incorrectly referred to the theatre 's scaenae frons as a proscenium , and have even suggested that the central archway in the middle of the scaenae frons was the inspiration for the later development of the full-size proscenium arch proscenium theatres have fallen out of favor in some theatre circles because they perpetuate the fourth wall concept later on , the use of the proscenium stage for performances established a separation of the audience from the performers theatre in the round : the stage is surrounded by audience on all sides

in later hellenistic greek theatres the proskenion ( προσκήνιον ) was a rather narrow raised stage where solo actors performed , while the greek chorus and musicians remained in the '' orchestra '' in front and below it , and there were often further areas for performing from above and behind the proskenion , on and behind the skene in the greek and roman theatre , no proscenium arch existed , in the modern sense , and the acting space was always fully in the view of the audience however , roman theatres were similar to modern proscenium theatres in the sense that the entire audience had a restricted range of views on the stage—all of which were from the front , rather than the sides or back no proscenium arch divides the seating area from the '' proscenium '' ( stage ) , and the space between the two has been made as open as possible , without endangering the structural integrity of the building the oldest surviving indoor theatre of the modern era , the teatro olimpico in vicenza ( 1585 ) , is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the first example of a proscenium theatre it has a plain proscaenium at the front of the stage , dropping to the orchestra level , now usually containing '' stalls '' seating , but no proscenium arch however , the teatro olimpico 's exact replication of the open and accessible roman stage was the exception rather than the rule in sixteenth-century theatre design parma has a clearly defined '' boccascena '' , or scene mouth , as italians call it , more like a picture frame than an arch but serving the same purpose : to delineate the stage and separate the audience from its action while the proscenium arch became an important feature of the traditional european theatre , often becoming very large and elaborate , the original proscaenium front below the stage became plainer what the romans would have called the proscaenium is , in modern theatres with orchestra pits , normally painted black in order that it does not draw attention anything that is not meant to be seen is simply placed outside the '' window '' created by the proscenium arch , either in the wings or in the flyspace above the stage later on , the use of the proscenium stage for performances established a separation of the audience from the performers thrust stage : the stage is surrounded on three sides ( or 270° ) by audience theatre in the round : the stage is surrounded by audience on all sides

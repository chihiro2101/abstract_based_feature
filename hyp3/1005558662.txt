pure poly ( methyl methacrylate ) homopolymer is rarely sold as an end product , since it is not optimized for most applications for example , a small amount of acrylate comonomers are routinely used in pmma grades destined for heat processing , since this stabilizes the polymer to depolymerization ( '' unzipping '' ) during processing comonomers such as methacrylic acid can be added to increase the glass transition temperature of the polymer for higher temperature use such as in lighting applications being transparent and durable , pmma is a versatile material and has been used in a wide range of fields and applications such as rear-lights and instrument clusters for vehicles , appliances , and lenses for glasses it is also used for coating polymers based on mma provides outstanding stability against environmental conditions with reduced emission of voc methacrylate polymers are used extensively in medical and dental applications where purity and stability are critical to performance pmma is commonly used for constructing residential and commercial aquariums pmma is used for viewing ports and even complete pressure hulls of submersibles , such as the alicia submarine 's viewing sphere and the window of the bathyscaphe trieste pmma is used in the lenses of exterior lights of automobiles historically , pmma was an important improvement in the design of aircraft windows , making possible such designs as the bombardier 's transparent nose compartment in the boeing b-17 flying fortress police vehicles for riot control often have the regular glass replaced with pmma to protect the occupants from thrown objects pmma is an important material in the making of certain lighthouse lenses pmma was used for the roofing of the compound in the olympic park for the 1972 summer olympics in munich laser cut acrylic panels have been used to redirect sunlight into a light pipe or tubular skylight and , from there , to spread it into a room 722 ridley had a lens manufactured by the rayner company ( brighton & hove , east sussex ) made from perspex polymerised by ici in particular , acrylic-type contact lenses are useful for cataract surgery in patients that have recurrent ocular inflammation ( uveitis ) , as acrylic material induces less inflammation soft contact lenses are often made of a related polymer , where acrylate monomers containing one or more hydroxyls make them hydrophile in plastic surgery , tiny pmma microspheres suspended in some biological fluid are injected as a soft tissue filler under the skin to reduce wrinkles or scars permanently emerging biotechnology and medical research uses pmma to create microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices , which require 100 micrometre-wide geometries for routing liquids ; acrylic prosthetic construction : pre-polymerized , powdered pmma spheres are mixed with a methyl methacrylate liquid monomer , benzoyl peroxide ( initiator ) , and nn-dimethyl-p-toluidine ( accelerator ) , and placed under heat and pressure to produce a hardened polymerized pmma structure ; artificial teeth : while denture teeth can be made of several different materials , pmma is a material of choice for the manufacturing of artificial teeth used in dental prosthetics pmma has been used to create ultra-white opaque membranes that are flexible and switch appearance to transparent when wet smooth pmma surface can be easily nanostructured by treatment in oxygen radio-frequency plasma and nanostructured pmma surface can be easily smoothed by vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) irradiation small strips of pmma are used as dosimeter devices during the gamma irradiation process file : acrylic heels.jpg high heel shoes made of lucite file : basscat bass.jpg an electric bass guitar made from poly ( methyl methacrylate )

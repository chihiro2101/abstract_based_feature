pure poly ( methyl methacrylate ) homopolymer is rarely sold as an end product , since it is not optimized for most applications rather , modified formulations with varying amounts of other comonomers , additives , and fillers are created for uses where specific properties are required for example , a small amount of acrylate comonomers are routinely used in pmma grades destined for heat processing , since this stabilizes the polymer to depolymerization ( '' unzipping '' ) during processing comonomers such as butyl acrylate are often added to improve impact strength comonomers such as methacrylic acid can be added to increase the glass transition temperature of the polymer for higher temperature use such as in lighting applications the polymer of methyl acrylate , pma or poly ( methyl acrylate ) , is similar to poly ( methyl methacrylate ) , except for the lack of methyl groups on the backbone carbon chain pma is a soft white rubbery material that is softer than pmma because its long polymer chains are thinner and smoother and can more easily slide past each other being transparent and durable , pmma is a versatile material and has been used in a wide range of fields and applications such as rear-lights and instrument clusters for vehicles , appliances , and lenses for glasses it is also used for coating polymers based on mma provides outstanding stability against environmental conditions with reduced emission of voc methacrylate polymers are used extensively in medical and dental applications where purity and stability are critical to performance the very small black circle ( smaller than the man 's head ) is the inner side of the plastic '' window '' , only a few inches in diameter pmma is commonly used for constructing residential and commercial aquariums designers started building large aquariums when poly ( methyl methacrylate ) could be used pmma is used for viewing ports and even complete pressure hulls of submersibles , such as the alicia submarine 's viewing sphere and the window of the bathyscaphe trieste police vehicles for riot control often have the regular glass replaced with pmma to protect the occupants from thrown objects laser cut acrylic panels have been used to redirect sunlight into a light pipe or tubular skylight and , from there , to spread it into a room glasses lenses are commonly made from pmma although pmma is biologically compatible , mma is considered to be an irritant and a possible carcinogen pmma has also been linked to cardiopulmonary events in the operating room due to hypotension a disadvantage of this bone cement is that it heats up to while setting that may cause thermal necrosis of neighboring tissue these small geometries are amenable to using pmma in a biochip fabrication process and offers moderate biocompatibility pmma polymer and methyl methacrylate monomer mix is then injected into a flask containing a gypsum mold of the previously designed prosthesis , and placed under heat to initiate polymerization process smooth pmma surface can be easily nanostructured by treatment in oxygen radio-frequency plasma and nanostructured pmma surface can be easily smoothed by vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) irradiation small strips of pmma are used as dosimeter devices during the gamma irradiation process pmma is a widely used material to create deal toys and financial tombstones

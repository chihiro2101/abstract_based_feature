pure poly ( methyl methacrylate ) homopolymer is rarely sold as an end product , since it is not optimized for most applications rather , modified formulations with varying amounts of other comonomers , additives , and fillers are created for uses where specific properties are required for example , a small amount of acrylate comonomers are routinely used in pmma grades destined for heat processing , since this stabilizes the polymer to depolymerization ( '' unzipping '' ) during processing comonomers such as methacrylic acid can be added to increase the glass transition temperature of the polymer for higher temperature use such as in lighting applications the polymer of methyl acrylate , pma or poly ( methyl acrylate ) , is similar to poly ( methyl methacrylate ) , except for the lack of methyl groups on the backbone carbon chain pma is a soft white rubbery material that is softer than pmma because its long polymer chains are thinner and smoother and can more easily slide past each other being transparent and durable , pmma is a versatile material and has been used in a wide range of fields and applications such as rear-lights and instrument clusters for vehicles , appliances , and lenses for glasses pmma in the form of sheets affords to shatter resistant panels for building windows , skylights , bulletproof security barriers , signs & displays , sanitary ware ( bathtubs ) , lcd screens , furniture and many other applications it is also used for coating polymers based on mma provides outstanding stability against environmental conditions with reduced emission of voc methacrylate polymers are used extensively in medical and dental applications where purity and stability are critical to performance pmma is commonly used for constructing residential and commercial aquariums designers started building large aquariums when poly ( methyl methacrylate ) could be used historically , pmma was an important improvement in the design of aircraft windows , making possible such designs as the bombardier 's transparent nose compartment in the boeing b-17 flying fortress pmma was used for the roofing of the compound in the olympic park for the 1972 summer olympics in munich laser cut acrylic panels have been used to redirect sunlight into a light pipe or tubular skylight and , from there , to spread it into a room such panels have been commercialized for purposes of daylighting , to be used as a window or a canopy such that sunlight descending from the sky is directed to the ceiling or into the room rather than to the floor pmma has a good degree of compatibility with human tissue , and it is used in the manufacture of rigid intraocular lenses which are implanted in the eye when the original lens has been removed in the treatment of cataracts pmma has also been linked to cardiopulmonary events in the operating room due to hypotension pmma as a soft tissue filler was widely used in the beginning of the century to restore volume in patients with hiv-related facial wasting ; artificial teeth : while denture teeth can be made of several different materials , pmma is a material of choice for the manufacturing of artificial teeth used in dental prosthetics mechanical properties of the material allow for heightened control of aesthetics , easy surface adjustments , decreased risk of fracture when in function in the oral cavity , and minimal wear against opposing teeth additionally , since the bases of dental prosthetics are often constructed using pmma , adherence of pmma denture teeth to pmma denture bases is unparalleled , leading to the construction of a strong and durable prosthetic plastic optical fiber used for short distance communication is made from pmma , and perfluorinated pmma , clad with fluorinated pmma , in situations where its flexibility and cheaper installation costs outweigh its poor heat tolerance and higher attenuation over glass fiber smooth pmma surface can be easily nanostructured by treatment in oxygen radio-frequency plasma and nanostructured pmma surface can be easily smoothed by vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) irradiation file : acrylic heels.jpg high heel shoes made of lucite file : basscat bass.jpg an electric bass guitar made from poly ( methyl methacrylate )

pure poly ( methyl methacrylate ) homopolymer is rarely sold as an end product , since it is not optimized for most applications rather , modified formulations with varying amounts of other comonomers , additives , and fillers are created for uses where specific properties are required for example , a small amount of acrylate comonomers are routinely used in pmma grades destined for heat processing , since this stabilizes the polymer to depolymerization ( '' unzipping '' ) during processing comonomers such as methacrylic acid can be added to increase the glass transition temperature of the polymer for higher temperature use such as in lighting applications the polymer of methyl acrylate , pma or poly ( methyl acrylate ) , is similar to poly ( methyl methacrylate ) , except for the lack of methyl groups on the backbone carbon chain pma is a soft white rubbery material that is softer than pmma because its long polymer chains are thinner and smoother and can more easily slide past each other being transparent and durable , pmma is a versatile material and has been used in a wide range of fields and applications such as rear-lights and instrument clusters for vehicles , appliances , and lenses for glasses methacrylate polymers are used extensively in medical and dental applications where purity and stability are critical to performance the very small black circle ( smaller than the man 's head ) is the inner side of the plastic '' window '' , only a few inches in diameter pmma is commonly used for constructing residential and commercial aquariums designers started building large aquariums when poly ( methyl methacrylate ) could be used pmma is used for viewing ports and even complete pressure hulls of submersibles , such as the alicia submarine 's viewing sphere and the window of the bathyscaphe trieste pmma is used in the lenses of exterior lights of automobiles pmma is an important material in the making of certain lighthouse lenses pmma was used for the roofing of the compound in the olympic park for the 1972 summer olympics in munich laser cut acrylic panels have been used to redirect sunlight into a light pipe or tubular skylight and , from there , to spread it into a room pairs of acrylic sheets with a layer of microreplicated prisms between the sheets can have reflective and refractive properties that let them redirect part of incoming sunlight in dependence on its angle of incidence glasses lenses are commonly made from pmma soft contact lenses are often made of a related polymer , where acrylate monomers containing one or more hydroxyls make them hydrophile in orthopedic surgery , pmma bone cement is used to affix implants and to remodel lost bone pmma as a soft tissue filler was widely used in the beginning of the century to restore volume in patients with hiv-related facial wasting pmma polymer and methyl methacrylate monomer mix is then injected into a flask containing a gypsum mold of the previously designed prosthesis , and placed under heat to initiate polymerization process ; artificial teeth : while denture teeth can be made of several different materials , pmma is a material of choice for the manufacturing of artificial teeth used in dental prosthetics small strips of pmma are used as dosimeter devices during the gamma irradiation process pmma is a widely used material to create deal toys and financial tombstones

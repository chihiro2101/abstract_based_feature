for example , a small amount of acrylate comonomers are routinely used in pmma grades destined for heat processing , since this stabilizes the polymer to depolymerization ( '' unzipping '' ) during processing comonomers such as methacrylic acid can be added to increase the glass transition temperature of the polymer for higher temperature use such as in lighting applications plasticizers may be added to improve processing properties , lower the glass transition temperature , improve impact properties , and improve mechanical properties such as elastic modulus dyes may be added to give color for decorative applications , or to protect against ( or filter ) uv light the polymer of methyl acrylate , pma or poly ( methyl acrylate ) , is similar to poly ( methyl methacrylate ) , except for the lack of methyl groups on the backbone carbon chain pma is a soft white rubbery material that is softer than pmma because its long polymer chains are thinner and smoother and can more easily slide past each other being transparent and durable , pmma is a versatile material and has been used in a wide range of fields and applications such as rear-lights and instrument clusters for vehicles , appliances , and lenses for glasses pmma in the form of sheets affords to shatter resistant panels for building windows , skylights , bulletproof security barriers , signs & displays , sanitary ware ( bathtubs ) , lcd screens , furniture and many other applications it is also used for coating polymers based on mma provides outstanding stability against environmental conditions with reduced emission of voc methacrylate polymers are used extensively in medical and dental applications where purity and stability are critical to performance pmma is commonly used for constructing residential and commercial aquariums designers started building large aquariums when poly ( methyl methacrylate ) could be used it is less often used in other building types due to incidents such as the summerland disaster pmma is used for viewing ports and even complete pressure hulls of submersibles , such as the alicia submarine 's viewing sphere and the window of the bathyscaphe trieste historically , pmma was an important improvement in the design of aircraft windows , making possible such designs as the bombardier 's transparent nose compartment in the boeing b-17 flying fortress police vehicles for riot control often have the regular glass replaced with pmma to protect the occupants from thrown objects laser cut acrylic panels have been used to redirect sunlight into a light pipe or tubular skylight and , from there , to spread it into a room due to its aforementioned biocompatibility , poly ( methyl methacrylate ) is a commonly used material in modern dentistry , particularly in the fabrication of dental prosthetics , artificial teeth , and orthodontic appliances ; acrylic prosthetic construction : pre-polymerized , powdered pmma spheres are mixed with a methyl methacrylate liquid monomer , benzoyl peroxide ( initiator ) , and nn-dimethyl-p-toluidine ( accelerator ) , and placed under heat and pressure to produce a hardened polymerized pmma structure pmma polymer and methyl methacrylate monomer mix is then injected into a flask containing a gypsum mold of the previously designed prosthesis , and placed under heat to initiate polymerization process ; artificial teeth : while denture teeth can be made of several different materials , pmma is a material of choice for the manufacturing of artificial teeth used in dental prosthetics many other products ( for example , guitars ) are sometimes made with acrylic glass to make the commonly opaque objects translucent pmma , in a purified form , is used as the matrix in laser dye-doped organic solid-state gain media for tunable solid state dye lasers smooth pmma surface can be easily nanostructured by treatment in oxygen radio-frequency plasma and nanostructured pmma surface can be easily smoothed by vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) irradiation the optical properties of pmma change as the gamma dose increases , and can be measured with a spectrophotometry file : acrylic heels.jpg high heel shoes made of lucite file : basscat bass.jpg an electric bass guitar made from poly ( methyl methacrylate )

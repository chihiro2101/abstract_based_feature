pure poly ( methyl methacrylate ) homopolymer is rarely sold as an end product , since it is not optimized for most applications for example , a small amount of acrylate comonomers are routinely used in pmma grades destined for heat processing , since this stabilizes the polymer to depolymerization ( '' unzipping '' ) during processing comonomers such as methacrylic acid can be added to increase the glass transition temperature of the polymer for higher temperature use such as in lighting applications the polymer of methyl acrylate , pma or poly ( methyl acrylate ) , is similar to poly ( methyl methacrylate ) , except for the lack of methyl groups on the backbone carbon chain pma is a soft white rubbery material that is softer than pmma because its long polymer chains are thinner and smoother and can more easily slide past each other being transparent and durable , pmma is a versatile material and has been used in a wide range of fields and applications such as rear-lights and instrument clusters for vehicles , appliances , and lenses for glasses it is also used for coating polymers based on mma provides outstanding stability against environmental conditions with reduced emission of voc methacrylate polymers are used extensively in medical and dental applications where purity and stability are critical to performance the larger circular clear black area represents the larger outer side of the thick one-piece plastic cone '' window '' pmma is commonly used for constructing residential and commercial aquariums designers started building large aquariums when poly ( methyl methacrylate ) could be used pmma is an important material in the making of certain lighthouse lenses pmma ( under the brand name '' lucite '' ) was used for the ceiling of the reliant astrodome such panels have been commercialized for purposes of daylighting , to be used as a window or a canopy such that sunlight descending from the sky is directed to the ceiling or into the room rather than to the floor in particular , acrylic-type contact lenses are useful for cataract surgery in patients that have recurrent ocular inflammation ( uveitis ) , as acrylic material induces less inflammation glasses lenses are commonly made from pmma in orthopedic surgery , pmma bone cement is used to affix implants and to remodel lost bone although pmma is biologically compatible , mma is considered to be an irritant and a possible carcinogen pmma as a soft tissue filler was widely used in the beginning of the century to restore volume in patients with hiv-related facial wasting emerging biotechnology and medical research uses pmma to create microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices , which require 100 micrometre-wide geometries for routing liquids acrylic paint essentially consists of pmma suspended in water ; however since pmma is hydrophobe , a substance with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups needs to be added to facilitate the suspension pmma , in a purified form , is used as the matrix in laser dye-doped organic solid-state gain media for tunable solid state dye lasers small strips of pmma are used as dosimeter devices during the gamma irradiation process artificial nails in the '' acrylic '' type often include pmma powder pmma is a widely used material to create deal toys and financial tombstones

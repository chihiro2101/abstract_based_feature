merit exists only in works that are positively good the relation between merit and reward furnishes the intrinsic reason why in the matter of service and its remuneration , the guiding norm can be only the virtue of justice , and not disinterested kindness or pure mercy ; for it would destroy the very notion of reward to conceive of it as a free gift of bounty ( cf if , however , salutary acts can in virtue of divine justice give the right to an eternal reward , this is possible only because they themselves have their root in gratuitous grace , and consequently are of their very nature dependent ultimately on grace , as the council of trent emphatically declares ( sess '' ethics and theology clearly distinguish two kinds of merit : condign merit or merit in the strict sense of the word ( meritum adœquatum sive de condigno ) , and congruous or quasi-merit ( meritum inadœquatum sive de congruo ) condign merit supposes an equality between service and return ; it is measured by commutative justice ( justitia commutativa ) , and thus gives a real claim to a reward hence the reward of congruous merit always depends in great measure on the kindness and liberality of the giver , though not purely and simply on his good will in christian theology , man possesses nothing of his own ; all that he has and all that he does is a gift of god , and , since god is infinitely self-sufficient , there is no advantage or benefit which man can by his services confer upon him hence on the part of god there can only be question of a gratuitous promise of reward for certain good works in order to be meritorious , a work must be morally good , morally free , done with the assistance of actual grace , and inspired by a supernatural motive finally , a supernatural motive is required because good works must be supernatural , not only as regards their object and circumstances , but also as regards the end for which they are performed ( ex fine ) in opposition to vasquez , most theologians are of opinion that one who is holier will gain greater merit for a given work than one who is less holy , although the latter perform the same work under exactly the same circumstances and in the same way merit requires on the part of god that he accept ( in actu secundo ) the good work as meritorious , even though the work in itself ( in actu primo ) and previous to its acceptance by god , be already truly meritorious martin luther emphasized the merit of christ by considering justification as entirely the work of god he noted that while the reward one gains from condign merit is much greater than that of congruent merit , the sort of good works said to attain each type of merit is similar luther thought it did not make sense that the two types of merit could be gained by similar actions when the benefit of condign merit is so much greater than the benefit of congruent merit

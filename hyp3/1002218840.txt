in catholic philosophy , merit ( as understood to be a property of a good work which entitles the doer to receive a reward ) , is a salutary act to which god , in whose service the work is done , in consequence of his infallible promise may give a reward ( prœmium , merces ) the relation between merit and reward furnishes the intrinsic reason why in the matter of service and its remuneration , the guiding norm can be only the virtue of justice , and not disinterested kindness or pure mercy ; for it would destroy the very notion of reward to conceive of it as a free gift of bounty ( cf if , however , salutary acts can in virtue of divine justice give the right to an eternal reward , this is possible only because they themselves have their root in gratuitous grace , and consequently are of their very nature dependent ultimately on grace , as the council of trent emphatically declares ( sess '' ethics and theology clearly distinguish two kinds of merit : condign merit or merit in the strict sense of the word ( meritum adœquatum sive de condigno ) , and congruous or quasi-merit ( meritum inadœquatum sive de congruo ) congruous merit , owing to its inadequacy and the lack of intrinsic proportion between the service and the recompense , claims a reward only on the ground of equity in christian theology , man possesses nothing of his own ; all that he has and all that he does is a gift of god , and , since god is infinitely self-sufficient , there is no advantage or benefit which man can by his services confer upon him hence on the part of god there can only be question of a gratuitous promise of reward for certain good works it is on this ground alone that we can speak of divine justice at all , and apply the principle : do ut des ( cf in catholic teaching , for all true merit , there are seven conditions , of which four regard the meritorious work , two the agent who merits , and one god who rewards in order to be meritorious , a work must be morally good , morally free , done with the assistance of actual grace , and inspired by a supernatural motive , of the influence of actual grace , is clear from the fact that every act meriting heaven must evidently be supernatural just as heaven itself is supernatural , and that consequently it can not be performed without the help of prevenient and assisting grace , which is necessary even for the just while some require the motive of faith ( motivum fidei ) in order to have merit , others demand in addition the motive of charity ( motivum caritatis ) , and thus , by rendering the conditions more difficult , considerably restrict the extent of meritorious works ( as distinguished from merely good works ) merit requires on the part of god that he accept ( in actu secundo ) the good work as meritorious , even though the work in itself ( in actu primo ) and previous to its acceptance by god , be already truly meritorious a living , bold trust in god 's grace , so certain of god 's favor that it would risk death a thousand times trusting in it luther thought it did not make sense that the two types of merit could be gained by similar actions when the benefit of condign merit is so much greater than the benefit of congruent merit

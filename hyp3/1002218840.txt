in catholic philosophy , merit ( as understood to be a property of a good work which entitles the doer to receive a reward ) , is a salutary act to which god , in whose service the work is done , in consequence of his infallible promise may give a reward ( prœmium , merces ) merit exists only in works that are positively good the relation between merit and reward furnishes the intrinsic reason why in the matter of service and its remuneration , the guiding norm can be only the virtue of justice , and not disinterested kindness or pure mercy ; for it would destroy the very notion of reward to conceive of it as a free gift of bounty ( cf if , however , salutary acts can in virtue of divine justice give the right to an eternal reward , this is possible only because they themselves have their root in gratuitous grace , and consequently are of their very nature dependent ultimately on grace , as the council of trent emphatically declares ( sess '' ethics and theology clearly distinguish two kinds of merit : condign merit or merit in the strict sense of the word ( meritum adœquatum sive de condigno ) , and congruous or quasi-merit ( meritum inadœquatum sive de congruo ) condign merit supposes an equality between service and return ; it is measured by commutative justice ( justitia commutativa ) , and thus gives a real claim to a reward the essential difference between meritum de condigno and meritum de congruo is based on the fact that , besides those works which claim a remuneration under pain of violating strict justice ( as in contracts between employer and employee , in buying and selling , etc ) , there are also other meritorious works which at most are entitled to reward or honour for reasons of equity ( ex œquitate ) or mere distributive justice ( ex iustitia distributiva ) , as in the case of gratuities and military decorations from an ethical point of view the difference practically amounts to this that , if the reward due to condign merit be withheld , there is a violation of right and justice and the consequent obligation in conscience to make restitution , while , in the case of congruous merit , to withhold the reward involves no violation of right and no obligation to restore , it being merely an offence against what is fitting or a matter of personal discrimination ( acceptio personarum ) hence the reward of congruous merit always depends in great measure on the kindness and liberality of the giver , though not purely and simply on his good will in christian theology , man possesses nothing of his own ; all that he has and all that he does is a gift of god , and , since god is infinitely self-sufficient , there is no advantage or benefit which man can by his services confer upon him in catholic teaching , for all true merit , there are seven conditions , of which four regard the meritorious work , two the agent who merits , and one god who rewards finally , a supernatural motive is required because good works must be supernatural , not only as regards their object and circumstances , but also as regards the end for which they are performed ( ex fine ) in opposition to vasquez , most theologians are of opinion that one who is holier will gain greater merit for a given work than one who is less holy , although the latter perform the same work under exactly the same circumstances and in the same way he noted that while the reward one gains from condign merit is much greater than that of congruent merit , the sort of good works said to attain each type of merit is similar

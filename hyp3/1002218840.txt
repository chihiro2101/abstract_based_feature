in catholic philosophy , merit ( as understood to be a property of a good work which entitles the doer to receive a reward ) , is a salutary act to which god , in whose service the work is done , in consequence of his infallible promise may give a reward ( prœmium , merces ) the relation between merit and reward furnishes the intrinsic reason why in the matter of service and its remuneration , the guiding norm can be only the virtue of justice , and not disinterested kindness or pure mercy ; for it would destroy the very notion of reward to conceive of it as a free gift of bounty ( cf if , however , salutary acts can in virtue of divine justice give the right to an eternal reward , this is possible only because they themselves have their root in gratuitous grace , and consequently are of their very nature dependent ultimately on grace , as the council of trent emphatically declares ( sess '' ethics and theology clearly distinguish two kinds of merit : condign merit or merit in the strict sense of the word ( meritum adœquatum sive de condigno ) , and congruous or quasi-merit ( meritum inadœquatum sive de congruo ) hence the reward of congruous merit always depends in great measure on the kindness and liberality of the giver , though not purely and simply on his good will in christian theology , man possesses nothing of his own ; all that he has and all that he does is a gift of god , and , since god is infinitely self-sufficient , there is no advantage or benefit which man can by his services confer upon him hence on the part of god there can only be question of a gratuitous promise of reward for certain good works in catholic teaching , for all true merit , there are seven conditions , of which four regard the meritorious work , two the agent who merits , and one god who rewards in order to be meritorious , a work must be morally good , morally free , done with the assistance of actual grace , and inspired by a supernatural motive finally , a supernatural motive is required because good works must be supernatural , not only as regards their object and circumstances , but also as regards the end for which they are performed ( ex fine ) while some require the motive of faith ( motivum fidei ) in order to have merit , others demand in addition the motive of charity ( motivum caritatis ) , and thus , by rendering the conditions more difficult , considerably restrict the extent of meritorious works ( as distinguished from merely good works ) in opposition to vasquez , most theologians are of opinion that one who is holier will gain greater merit for a given work than one who is less holy , although the latter perform the same work under exactly the same circumstances and in the same way the scotists hold that the entire condignity of the good work rests exclusively on the gratuitous promise of god and his free acceptance , without which even the most heroic act is devoid of merit , and with which even mere naturally good works may become meritorious he noted that while the reward one gains from condign merit is much greater than that of congruent merit , the sort of good works said to attain each type of merit is similar , iii , ii , 4 ) good works are '' impurities and defilement '' ( inquinamenta et sordes ) , but god covers their innate hideousness with the cloak of the merits of christ , and imputes them to the predestined as good works in order that he may requite them not with life eternal , but at most with a temporal reward

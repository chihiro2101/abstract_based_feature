in catholic philosophy , merit ( as understood to be a property of a good work which entitles the doer to receive a reward ) , is a salutary act to which god , in whose service the work is done , in consequence of his infallible promise may give a reward ( prœmium , merces ) merit exists only in works that are positively good the relation between merit and reward furnishes the intrinsic reason why in the matter of service and its remuneration , the guiding norm can be only the virtue of justice , and not disinterested kindness or pure mercy ; for it would destroy the very notion of reward to conceive of it as a free gift of bounty ( cf if , however , salutary acts can in virtue of divine justice give the right to an eternal reward , this is possible only because they themselves have their root in gratuitous grace , and consequently are of their very nature dependent ultimately on grace , as the council of trent emphatically declares ( sess '' ethics and theology clearly distinguish two kinds of merit : condign merit or merit in the strict sense of the word ( meritum adœquatum sive de condigno ) , and congruous or quasi-merit ( meritum inadœquatum sive de congruo ) condign merit supposes an equality between service and return ; it is measured by commutative justice ( justitia commutativa ) , and thus gives a real claim to a reward congruous merit , owing to its inadequacy and the lack of intrinsic proportion between the service and the recompense , claims a reward only on the ground of equity hence the reward of congruous merit always depends in great measure on the kindness and liberality of the giver , though not purely and simply on his good will in christian theology , man possesses nothing of his own ; all that he has and all that he does is a gift of god , and , since god is infinitely self-sufficient , there is no advantage or benefit which man can by his services confer upon him for such works he owes the promised reward , not in justice or equity , but because he has freely bound himself , i.e in catholic teaching , for all true merit , there are seven conditions , of which four regard the meritorious work , two the agent who merits , and one god who rewards others again set down as the only condition of merit that the good work of the just man , who already has habitual faith and charity , be in conformity with the divine law , and require no other special motive martin luther emphasized the merit of christ by considering justification as entirely the work of god luther thought it did not make sense that the two types of merit could be gained by similar actions when the benefit of condign merit is so much greater than the benefit of congruent merit xxv ) , and declared as a dogma that the just , in return for their good works done in god through the merits of jesus , should expect an eternal reward ( loc

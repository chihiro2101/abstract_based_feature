in catholic philosophy , merit ( as understood to be a property of a good work which entitles the doer to receive a reward ) , is a salutary act to which god , in whose service the work is done , in consequence of his infallible promise may give a reward ( prœmium , merces ) merit exists only in works that are positively good the relation between merit and reward furnishes the intrinsic reason why in the matter of service and its remuneration , the guiding norm can be only the virtue of justice , and not disinterested kindness or pure mercy ; for it would destroy the very notion of reward to conceive of it as a free gift of bounty ( cf if , however , salutary acts can in virtue of divine justice give the right to an eternal reward , this is possible only because they themselves have their root in gratuitous grace , and consequently are of their very nature dependent ultimately on grace , as the council of trent emphatically declares ( sess '' ethics and theology clearly distinguish two kinds of merit : condign merit or merit in the strict sense of the word ( meritum adœquatum sive de condigno ) , and congruous or quasi-merit ( meritum inadœquatum sive de congruo ) congruous merit , owing to its inadequacy and the lack of intrinsic proportion between the service and the recompense , claims a reward only on the ground of equity ) , there are also other meritorious works which at most are entitled to reward or honour for reasons of equity ( ex œquitate ) or mere distributive justice ( ex iustitia distributiva ) , as in the case of gratuities and military decorations hence the reward of congruous merit always depends in great measure on the kindness and liberality of the giver , though not purely and simply on his good will hence on the part of god there can only be question of a gratuitous promise of reward for certain good works in catholic teaching , for all true merit , there are seven conditions , of which four regard the meritorious work , two the agent who merits , and one god who rewards it is an axiom of criminal jurisprudence that no one shall be punished for a misdeed done without free will ; similarly , a good work can only then be meritorious and deserving of reward when it proceeds from a free determination of the will , of the influence of actual grace , is clear from the fact that every act meriting heaven must evidently be supernatural just as heaven itself is supernatural , and that consequently it can not be performed without the help of prevenient and assisting grace , which is necessary even for the just finally , a supernatural motive is required because good works must be supernatural , not only as regards their object and circumstances , but also as regards the end for which they are performed ( ex fine ) merit requires on the part of god that he accept ( in actu secundo ) the good work as meritorious , even though the work in itself ( in actu primo ) and previous to its acceptance by god , be already truly meritorious , iii , ii , 4 ) good works are '' impurities and defilement '' ( inquinamenta et sordes ) , but god covers their innate hideousness with the cloak of the merits of christ , and imputes them to the predestined as good works in order that he may requite them not with life eternal , but at most with a temporal reward

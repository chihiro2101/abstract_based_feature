no name for this soldier is given in the canonical gospels ; the name longinus is instead found in the acts of pilate , a text appended to the apocryphal gospel of nicodemus longinus did not start out as a saint 523 later traditions turned him into a christian convert , but as sabine baring-gould observed : '' the name of longinus was not known to the greeks previous to the patriarch germanus , in 715 it was introduced amongst the westerns from the apocryphal gospel of nicodemus iii ( edinburgh ) 1914 , sub '' march 15 : saint longinus martyr '' ; baring-gould adds , '' the greek acts pretend to be by s the spear used is known as the holy lance , and more recently , especially in occult circles , as the '' spear of destiny '' , which was revered at jerusalem by the sixth century , although neither the centurion nor the name '' longinus '' were invoked in any surviving report the touch of jesus 's blood cures his eye problem : christian legend has it that longinus was a blind roman centurion who thrust the spear into christ 's side at the crucifixion the body of longinus is said to have been lost twice , and that its second recovery was at mantua in 1304 , together with the holy sponge stained with christ 's blood , wherewith it was told—extending longinus ' role—that longinus had assisted in cleansing christ 's body when it was taken down from the cross the relics are said to have been divided and then distributed to prague and elsewhere , with the body taken to the basilica of sant'agostino in rome it is also said that the body of longinus was found in sardinia ; greek sources assert that he suffered martyrdom in gabala , cappadocia his feast day is kept on 16 october in the roman martyrology , which mentions him , without any indication of martyrdom , in the following terms : '' at jerusalem , commemoration of saint longinus , who is venerated as the soldier opening the side of the crucified lord with a lance '' it has an important role in persona 2 : innocent sin , where the order of the holy lance carry copies of the longinus spear while adolf hitler carries the real one longinus - the centurion who pierced the side of jesus with the holy lance ( spear of destiny )

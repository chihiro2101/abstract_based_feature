the beginnings of the theory were proposed by ferdinand de saussure in 1879 , in an article chiefly devoted to something else altogether ( demonstrating that a and o were separate phonemes in pie ) in the course of his analysis , saussure proposed that what had then been reconstructed as long vowels ā and ō , alternating with ǝ , was an ordinary type of pie ablaut that is , it was an alternation between e-grade and zero grade like in '' regular '' ablaut ( further explanations below ) , but followed by a previously unidentified element this '' element '' accounted for both the changed vowel colour and the lengthening ( short e becoming long ā or ō ) saussure called them simply '' coefficients sonantiques '' , which was the term for what are now in english more usually called resonants ; that is , the six elements present in pie which can be either consonants ( non-syllabic ) or vowels ( syllabic ) depending on the sounds they are adjacent to : y w r l m n these views were accepted by a few scholars , in particular hermann möller , who added important elements to the theory hittite phonology included two sounds written with symbols from the akkadian syllabary conventionally transcribed as , as in '' i put , am putting '' this consonant did not appear to be related to any of the consonants then reconstructed for pie , and various unsatisfactory proposals were made to explain this consonant in terms of the pie consonant system as it had then been reconstructed their appearance explained some other matters as well : for example , why verb roots containing only a consonant and a vowel always have long vowels this not only accounted for the patterns of alternation more economically than before ( by requiring fewer types of ablaut ) but also brought the structure of these roots into line with the basic pie pattern which required roots to begin and end with a consonant the lateness of the discovery of these sounds by indo-europeanists is largely because hittite and the other anatolian languages are the only indo-european languages for which at least some are attested directly and consistently as consonantal sounds when a laryngeal is attested directly , it is usually as a special type of vowel and not as a consonant , best exemplified in greek where syllabic laryngeals ( when they appeared next to only consonants ) developed as such : h₁ > e , h₂ > a , and h₃ > o there are many variations of the laryngeal theory most scholars work with a basic three : , the '' neutral '' laryngeal , the '' a-colouring '' laryngeal , the '' o-colouring '' laryngeal pie h₄órǵʰiyeh₂ '' testicle '' yields albanian herdhe '' testicle '' but hittite arki- '' testicle '' whereas pie '' bear '' yields alb doublet another such theory , but much less generally accepted , is winfred p some direct evidence for laryngeal consonants comes from anatolian : pie a is a fairly rare sound , and in an uncommonly large number of good etymologies , it is word-initial thus pie ( traditional ) anti '' in front of and facing '' > greek antí '' against '' ; latin ante '' in front of , before '' ; sanskrit ánti '' near ; in the presence of '' considerable debate still surrounds the pronunciation of the laryngeals and various arguments have been given to pinpoint their exact place of articulation the evidence from hittite and uralic is sufficient to conclude that these sounds were '' guttural '' or pronounced rather back in the vocal tract the same evidence is also consistent with the assumption that they were fricative sounds ( as opposed to approximants or stops ) , an assumption that is strongly supported by the behaviour of laryngeals in consonant clusters lehmann instead theorized , based on inconsistent reflexes in hittite , that there were two h₁ sounds : a glottal stop and an h sound as in english hat words with hittite ḫ ( hh ) , luwian h and lycian x are explained as reflexes of pie roots with h₂ as mentioned above , in forms like dwi-bhr-o- ( etymon of greek diphrós , above ) , the new '' coefficients sonantiques '' ( unlike the six resonants ) have no reflexes at all in any daughter language the explanation for the híeros/híaros business has long been discussed , without much result ; laryngeal theory now provides the opportunity for an explanation which did not exist before , namely the metathesis of the two laryngeals

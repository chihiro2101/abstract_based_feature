the beginnings of the theory were proposed by ferdinand de saussure in 1879 , in an article chiefly devoted to something else altogether ( demonstrating that a and o were separate phonemes in pie ) in the course of his analysis , saussure proposed that what had then been reconstructed as long vowels ā and ō , alternating with ǝ , was an ordinary type of pie ablaut this '' element '' accounted for both the changed vowel colour and the lengthening ( short e becoming long ā or ō ) so , rather than reconstructing ā , ō and ǝ as others had done before , saussure proposed something like ea alternating with a and eo with o , where a and o represented the unidentified elements these views were accepted by a few scholars , in particular hermann möller , who added important elements to the theory saussure 's observations , however , did not achieve any general currency , as they were still too abstract and had little direct evidence to back them up hittite phonology included two sounds written with symbols from the akkadian syllabary conventionally transcribed as , as in '' i put , am putting '' this consonant did not appear to be related to any of the consonants then reconstructed for pie , and various unsatisfactory proposals were made to explain this consonant in terms of the pie consonant system as it had then been reconstructed he suggested that the unknown consonant of hittite was , in fact , a direct reflex of the coefficients sonantiques that saussure had proposed their appearance explained some other matters as well : for example , why verb roots containing only a consonant and a vowel always have long vowels the lateness of the discovery of these sounds by indo-europeanists is largely because hittite and the other anatolian languages are the only indo-european languages for which at least some are attested directly and consistently as consonantal sounds when a laryngeal is attested directly , it is usually as a special type of vowel and not as a consonant , best exemplified in greek where syllabic laryngeals ( when they appeared next to only consonants ) developed as such : h₁ > e , h₂ > a , and h₃ > o there are many variations of the laryngeal theory but being reflected , to the exclusion of all other laryngeals , as albanian h when word-initial before an originally stressed vowel doublet another such theory , but much less generally accepted , is winfred p but in hittite there is a noun '' front , face '' , with various derivatives ( ḫantezzi '' first '' , and so on ) , pointing to a pie root-noun '' face '' ( of which would be the locative singular ) ) similarly , the traditional pie reconstruction for 'sheep ' is owi- ( a y-stem , not an i-stem ) whence sanskrit ávi- , latin ovis , greek ὄϊς considerable debate still surrounds the pronunciation of the laryngeals and various arguments have been given to pinpoint their exact place of articulation firstly the effect these sounds have had on adjacent phonemes is well documented the evidence from hittite and uralic is sufficient to conclude that these sounds were '' guttural '' or pronounced rather back in the vocal tract 71 its failure ( unlike h₂ and h₃ ) to create an auxiliary vowel in greek and tocharian when it occurs between a semivowel and a consonant , and the typological likelihood of an given the presence of aspirated consonants in pie rasmussen ( 1983 ) suggested a consonantal realization for h₂ as a voiceless velar fricative , with a syllabic allophone , i.e . support for theory from daughter languages words with hittite ḫ ( hh ) , luwian h and lycian x are explained as reflexes of pie roots with h₂ today the laryngeal theory is almost universally accepted in this new standard form

the beginnings of the theory were proposed by ferdinand de saussure in 1879 , in an article chiefly devoted to something else altogether ( demonstrating that a and o were separate phonemes in pie ) in the course of his analysis , saussure proposed that what had then been reconstructed as long vowels ā and ō , alternating with ǝ , was an ordinary type of pie ablaut that is , it was an alternation between e-grade and zero grade like in '' regular '' ablaut ( further explanations below ) , but followed by a previously unidentified element these views were accepted by a few scholars , in particular hermann möller , who added important elements to the theory saussure 's observations , however , did not achieve any general currency , as they were still too abstract and had little direct evidence to back them up hittite phonology included two sounds written with symbols from the akkadian syllabary conventionally transcribed as , as in '' i put , am putting '' this consonant did not appear to be related to any of the consonants then reconstructed for pie , and various unsatisfactory proposals were made to explain this consonant in terms of the pie consonant system as it had then been reconstructed it remained for jerzy kuryłowicz to propose that these sounds lined up with saussure 's conjectures he suggested that the unknown consonant of hittite was , in fact , a direct reflex of the coefficients sonantiques that saussure had proposed their appearance explained some other matters as well : for example , why verb roots containing only a consonant and a vowel always have long vowels the lateness of the discovery of these sounds by indo-europeanists is largely because hittite and the other anatolian languages are the only indo-european languages for which at least some are attested directly and consistently as consonantal sounds most scholars work with a basic three : , the '' neutral '' laryngeal , the '' a-colouring '' laryngeal , the '' o-colouring '' laryngeal some scholars suggest the existence of a fourth consonant , , which differs from in not being reflected as anatolian zair , n but being reflected , to the exclusion of all other laryngeals , as albanian h when word-initial before an originally stressed vowel pie h₄órǵʰiyeh₂ '' testicle '' yields albanian herdhe '' testicle '' but hittite arki- '' testicle '' whereas pie '' bear '' yields alb ari '' bear '' but hittite hart ( ag ) ga- ( /hartka-/ ) '' cultic official , bear-person '' doublet another such theory , but much less generally accepted , is winfred p ( he assumed that one was a glottal stop and the other a glottal fricative some direct evidence for laryngeal consonants comes from anatolian : pie a is a fairly rare sound , and in an uncommonly large number of good etymologies , it is word-initial thus pie ( traditional ) anti '' in front of and facing '' > greek antí '' against '' ; latin ante '' in front of , before '' ; sanskrit ánti '' near ; in the presence of '' considerable debate still surrounds the pronunciation of the laryngeals and various arguments have been given to pinpoint their exact place of articulation pharyngeal consonants ( like the arabic letter ح ( ħ ) as in muħammad ) often cause a-colouring in the semitic languages rasmussen ( 1983 ) suggested a consonantal realization for h₂ as a voiceless velar fricative , with a syllabic allophone , i.e . support for theory from daughter languages today the laryngeal theory is almost universally accepted in this new standard form

the beginnings of the theory were proposed by ferdinand de saussure in 1879 , in an article chiefly devoted to something else altogether ( demonstrating that a and o were separate phonemes in pie ) in the course of his analysis , saussure proposed that what had then been reconstructed as long vowels ā and ō , alternating with ǝ , was an ordinary type of pie ablaut that is , it was an alternation between e-grade and zero grade like in '' regular '' ablaut ( further explanations below ) , but followed by a previously unidentified element this '' element '' accounted for both the changed vowel colour and the lengthening ( short e becoming long ā or ō ) these views were accepted by a few scholars , in particular hermann möller , who added important elements to the theory saussure 's observations , however , did not achieve any general currency , as they were still too abstract and had little direct evidence to back them up hittite phonology included two sounds written with symbols from the akkadian syllabary conventionally transcribed as , as in '' i put , am putting '' this consonant did not appear to be related to any of the consonants then reconstructed for pie , and various unsatisfactory proposals were made to explain this consonant in terms of the pie consonant system as it had then been reconstructed their appearance explained some other matters as well : for example , why verb roots containing only a consonant and a vowel always have long vowels the lateness of the discovery of these sounds by indo-europeanists is largely because hittite and the other anatolian languages are the only indo-european languages for which at least some are attested directly and consistently as consonantal sounds otherwise , their presence is to be inferred mostly through the effects they have on neighboring sounds , and on patterns of alternation that they participate in there are many variations of the laryngeal theory most scholars work with a basic three : , the '' neutral '' laryngeal , the '' a-colouring '' laryngeal , the '' o-colouring '' laryngeal some scholars suggest the existence of a fourth consonant , , which differs from in not being reflected as anatolian zair , n pie h₄órǵʰiyeh₂ '' testicle '' yields albanian herdhe '' testicle '' but hittite arki- '' testicle '' whereas pie '' bear '' yields alb doublet another such theory , but much less generally accepted , is winfred p some direct evidence for laryngeal consonants comes from anatolian : pie a is a fairly rare sound , and in an uncommonly large number of good etymologies , it is word-initial thus pie ( traditional ) anti '' in front of and facing '' > greek antí '' against '' ; latin ante '' in front of , before '' ; sanskrit ánti '' near ; in the presence of '' ) similarly , the traditional pie reconstruction for 'sheep ' is owi- ( a y-stem , not an i-stem ) whence sanskrit ávi- , latin ovis , greek ὄϊς firstly the effect these sounds have had on adjacent phonemes is well documented the evidence from hittite and uralic is sufficient to conclude that these sounds were '' guttural '' or pronounced rather back in the vocal tract the same evidence is also consistent with the assumption that they were fricative sounds ( as opposed to approximants or stops ) , an assumption that is strongly supported by the behaviour of laryngeals in consonant clusters the hypothetical existence of laryngeals in pie finds support in the body of daughter language cognates which can be most efficiently explained through simple rules of development the explanation for the híeros/híaros business has long been discussed , without much result ; laryngeal theory now provides the opportunity for an explanation which did not exist before , namely the metathesis of the two laryngeals today the laryngeal theory is almost universally accepted in this new standard form

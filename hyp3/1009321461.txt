the beginnings of the theory were proposed by ferdinand de saussure in 1879 , in an article chiefly devoted to something else altogether ( demonstrating that a and o were separate phonemes in pie ) in the course of his analysis , saussure proposed that what had then been reconstructed as long vowels ā and ō , alternating with ǝ , was an ordinary type of pie ablaut this '' element '' accounted for both the changed vowel colour and the lengthening ( short e becoming long ā or ō ) so , rather than reconstructing ā , ō and ǝ as others had done before , saussure proposed something like ea alternating with a and eo with o , where a and o represented the unidentified elements saussure called them simply '' coefficients sonantiques '' , which was the term for what are now in english more usually called resonants ; that is , the six elements present in pie which can be either consonants ( non-syllabic ) or vowels ( syllabic ) depending on the sounds they are adjacent to : y w r l m n these views were accepted by a few scholars , in particular hermann möller , who added important elements to the theory saussure 's observations , however , did not achieve any general currency , as they were still too abstract and had little direct evidence to back them up this consonant did not appear to be related to any of the consonants then reconstructed for pie , and various unsatisfactory proposals were made to explain this consonant in terms of the pie consonant system as it had then been reconstructed he suggested that the unknown consonant of hittite was , in fact , a direct reflex of the coefficients sonantiques that saussure had proposed their appearance explained some other matters as well : for example , why verb roots containing only a consonant and a vowel always have long vowels the lateness of the discovery of these sounds by indo-europeanists is largely because hittite and the other anatolian languages are the only indo-european languages for which at least some are attested directly and consistently as consonantal sounds when a laryngeal is attested directly , it is usually as a special type of vowel and not as a consonant , best exemplified in greek where syllabic laryngeals ( when they appeared next to only consonants ) developed as such : h₁ > e , h₂ > a , and h₃ > o pie h₄órǵʰiyeh₂ '' testicle '' yields albanian herdhe '' testicle '' but hittite arki- '' testicle '' whereas pie '' bear '' yields alb adams edition : illustrated published by taylor & francis , 1997 , pp when there is an uncertainty whether the laryngeal is or , the symbol may be used some direct evidence for laryngeal consonants comes from anatolian : pie a is a fairly rare sound , and in an uncommonly large number of good etymologies , it is word-initial thus pie ( traditional ) anti '' in front of and facing '' > greek antí '' against '' ; latin ante '' in front of , before '' ; sanskrit ánti '' near ; in the presence of '' ) similarly , the traditional pie reconstruction for 'sheep ' is owi- ( a y-stem , not an i-stem ) whence sanskrit ávi- , latin ovis , greek ὄϊς 77 this is supported by the closeness of to ( with which it combines in greek ) , rasmussen ( 1999 ) , p 71 its failure ( unlike h₂ and h₃ ) to create an auxiliary vowel in greek and tocharian when it occurs between a semivowel and a consonant , and the typological likelihood of an given the presence of aspirated consonants in pie later , kloekhorst ( 2006 ) claimed that also hittite preserves pie h₁ as a glottal stop , visible in words like hittite e-eš-zi 'he is ' melchert ( 2010 ) , and weeden ( 2011 ) ( b ) greek gené-tēs '' begetter , father '' ; géne-sis greek méga , sanskrit máha it used to be standard to explain the root vowels of greek thetós , statós , dotós '' put , stood , given '' as analogical among its early proponents were hermann möller , who extended saussure 's system with a third , non-colouring laryngeal , albert cuny , holger pedersen , and karl oštir today the laryngeal theory is almost universally accepted in this new standard form

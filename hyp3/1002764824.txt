in an 1858 paper for the proceedings of the linnean society , british zoologist philip sclater first identified six terrestrial zoogeographic realms of the world : palaearctic , aethiopian/afrotropic , indian/indomalayan , australasian , nearctic , and neotropical the palearctic realm includes mostly subarctic climate and temperate climate ecoregions , which run across eurasia from western europe to the bering sea the boreal and temperate euro-siberian region is the palearctic 's largest biogeography region , which transitions from tundra in the northern reaches of russia and scandinavia to the vast taiga , the boreal coniferous forests which run across the continent this vast euro-siberian region is characterized by many shared plant and animal species , and has many affinities with the temperate and boreal regions of the nearctic realm of north america the palearctic and nearctic also share many plant species , which botanists call the arcto-tertiary geoflora the lands bordering the mediterranean sea in southern europe , north africa , and western asia are home to the mediterranean basin ecoregions , which together constitute the world 's largest and most diverse mediterranean climate region of the world , with generally mild , rainy winters and hot , dry summers the mediterranean basin is also one of the world 's most endangered biogeographic regions ; only 4 % of the region 's original vegetation remains , and human activities , including overgrazing , deforestation , and conversion of lands for pasture , agriculture , and urbanization , have degraded much of the region this scheme includes these desert ecoregions in the palearctic realm ; other biogeographers identify the realm boundary as the transition zone between the desert ecoregions and the mediterranean basin ecoregions to the north , which places the deserts in the afrotropic , while others place the boundary through the middle of the desert avionary 1500 bird species of the western and central palaearctic in 46 languages map of the ecozones

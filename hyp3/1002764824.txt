in an 1858 paper for the proceedings of the linnean society , british zoologist philip sclater first identified six terrestrial zoogeographic realms of the world : palaearctic , aethiopian/afrotropic , indian/indomalayan , australasian , nearctic , and neotropical the palearctic realm includes mostly subarctic climate and temperate climate ecoregions , which run across eurasia from western europe to the bering sea the boreal and temperate euro-siberian region is the palearctic 's largest biogeography region , which transitions from tundra in the northern reaches of russia and scandinavia to the vast taiga , the boreal coniferous forests which run across the continent this vast euro-siberian region is characterized by many shared plant and animal species , and has many affinities with the temperate and boreal regions of the nearctic realm of north america the lands bordering the mediterranean sea in southern europe , north africa , and western asia are home to the mediterranean basin ecoregions , which together constitute the world 's largest and most diverse mediterranean climate region of the world , with generally mild , rainy winters and hot , dry summers formerly the region was mostly covered with forests and woodlands , but heavy human use has reduced much of the region to the sclerophyll shrublands known as chaparral , matorral , maquis , or garrigue the caucasus mountains , which run between the black sea and the caspian sea , are a particularly rich mix of coniferous , broadleaf , and mixed forests , and include the temperate rain forests of the euxine-colchic deciduous forests ecoregion in the subtropical region of southern china and southern edge of the himalayas , the palearctic temperate forests transition to the subtropical and tropical forests of indomalaya , creating a rich and diverse mix of plant and animal species in southeastern asia , high mountain ranges form tongues of palearctic flora and fauna in northern indochina and southern china

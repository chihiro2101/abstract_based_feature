the vast desert wasteland of southern saudi arabia known as the empty quarter , or rub ' al khali in arabic , is one of the most desolate places on earth philby had heard of bedouin legends of an area called al hadida ( '' place of iron '' in arabic ) with ruins of ancient habitations , and also an area where a piece of iron the size of a camel had been found , and so organized an expedition to visit the site philby identified two large circular depressions partially filled with sand , and three other features that he identified as possible '' submerged craters '' he also mapped the area where the large iron block was reputed to have been found philby thought that the area was a volcano , and it was only after bringing back samples to the uk that the site was identified as that of a meteorite impact by leonard james spencer of the british museum these craters were respectively about 100 and 50 yards in diameter , sunken in the middle but half choked with sand , while inside and outside their walls lay what i took to be lava in great circles where it seemed to have flowed out from the fiery furnace 13 amongst the samples of iron , cindery material and silica glass that philby brought back from the site was a 25 & nbsp ; lb chunk of iron analysis showed it to be about 90 % iron and 5 % nickel , with the rest consisting of various elements , including copper , cobalt , and 6 ppm of iridium , an unusually high concentration this siderophile element implied that the wabar site was a meteorite impact area abercrombie visited the site and found the large meteorite : '' rumor has become a reality ; the biggest iron meteorite ever found in arabia lay at our feet & nbsp ; the presence of iron fragments at the site also pointed to a meteorite impact , as there are no iron deposits in the region fission-track analysis of glass fragments by storzer ( 1965 ) suggested the wabar impact took place thousands of years ago , but delicate glass filigree , and the fact that the craters have been filled-in considerably since philby 's 1932 visit , suggests their origin is much more recent jeff wynn and gene shoemaker the large meteorite fragment ( the camel 's hump ' ) before its removal from the site

the long history and consistent sales of flight simulator has encouraged a very large body of add-on packages to be developed as both commercial and volunteer ventures a formal software development kit and other tools for the simulator exist to further facilitate third-party efforts , and some third parties have also learned to 'tweak ' the simulator in various ways by trial and error as for number of add-ons , tweaks , and modifications flight simulator can accommodate solely depends on the user 's hardware setup the number is not limited by the simulator , and when multiple computers are linked together with multiple monitors and third party software and controls , flight simulator enthusiasts can build their own realistic home cockpits dedicated 'flightsimmers ' have taken advantage of flight simulator 's vast add-on capabilities , having successfully linked flight simulator to homebuilt hardware , some of which approaches the complexity of commercial full-motion flight simulators the simulator 's aircraft are made up of five parts : the model , which is a 3d cad-style model of the aircraft 's exterior and virtual cockpit , if applicable these can be easily edited ( known as repainting ) , so that a model can adopt any paint scheme imaginable , real or fictional this is determined by defining which wav files the aircraft uses as its sound-set air file ) , which contains hundreds of parameters that define the aircraft 's flight characteristics , and the aircraft.cfg file , which contains more and easier-to-edit parameters not being limited to using the default aircraft , add-on planes can be downloaded from many sources for free or purchased , which can then be installed into microsoft flight simulator typically , third-party aircraft models have multiple levels of detail , which allow the ai traffic to be better on frame rates , while still being detailed during close looks the internet has also facilitated the distribution of 'payware ' add-ons for the simulator , with the option of downloading the files , which reduces distribution costs computer gaming world stated in 1994 that flight simulator 5 '' is closer to simulating real flight than ever before '' these records include '' longest running flight sim series '' , '' most successful flight simulator series '' , and '' most expensive home flight simulator cockpit '' , which was built by australian trucking tycoon matthew sheil , and cost around 200,000 to build

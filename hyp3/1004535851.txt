nuclei of nuclear isomers the nucleus of a nuclear isomer occupies a higher energy state than the non-excited nucleus existing in the ground state in an excited state , one or more of the protons or neutrons in a nucleus occupy a nuclear orbital of higher energy than an available nuclear orbital however , a much stronger type of binding energy , the nuclear binding energy , is involved in nuclear processes due to this , most nuclear excited states decay by gamma ray emission for example , a well-known nuclear isomer used in various medical procedures is , which decays with a half-life of about 6 hours by emitting a gamma ray of 140 & nbsp ; kev of energy ; this is close to the energy of medical diagnostic x-rays nuclear isomers have long half-lives because their gamma decay is '' forbidden '' from the large change in nuclear spin needed to emit a gamma ray while most metastable isomers decay through gamma-ray emission , they can also decay through internal conversion during internal conversion , energy of nuclear de-excitation is not emitted as a gamma ray , but is instead used to accelerate one of the inner electrons of the atom metastable isomers can be produced through nuclear fusion or other nuclear reactions this usually occurs when the formation of an intermediate excited state has a spin far different from that of the ground state the excited state in this situation is a good candidate to be metastable if there are no other states of intermediate spin with excitation energies less than that of the metastable state metastable isomers of a particular isotope are usually designated with an '' m '' for isotopes with more than one metastable isomer , '' indices '' are placed after the designation , and the labeling becomes m1 , m2 , m3 , and so on a different kind of metastable nuclear state ( isomer ) is the fission isomer or shape isomer the highest known spin change of 8 units occurs in the decay of 180m ta , which suppresses its decay by a factor of 10 35 from that associated with 1 unit hafnium isomers ( mainly 178m2 hf ) have been considered as weapons that could be used to circumvent the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , since it is claimed that they can be induced gamma emission the emission of a gamma ray from an excited nuclear state allows the nucleus to lose energy and reach a lower-energy state , sometimes its ground state in certain cases , the excited nuclear state following a nuclear reaction or other type of radioactive decay can become a metastable nuclear excited state the process of isomeric transition is similar to gamma emission from any excited nuclear state , but differs by involving excited metastable states of nuclei with longer half-lives

the nucleus of a nuclear isomer occupies a higher energy state than the non-excited nucleus existing in the ground state in an excited state , one or more of the protons or neutrons in a nucleus occupy a nuclear orbital of higher energy than an available nuclear orbital when excited atomic states decay , energy is released by fluorescence however , a much stronger type of binding energy , the nuclear binding energy , is involved in nuclear processes due to this , most nuclear excited states decay by gamma ray emission for example , a well-known nuclear isomer used in various medical procedures is , which decays with a half-life of about 6 hours by emitting a gamma ray of 140 & nbsp ; kev of energy ; this is close to the energy of medical diagnostic x-rays nuclear isomers have long half-lives because their gamma decay is '' forbidden '' from the large change in nuclear spin needed to emit a gamma ray during internal conversion , energy of nuclear de-excitation is not emitted as a gamma ray , but is instead used to accelerate one of the inner electrons of the atom in nuclei that are far from stability in energy , even more decay modes are known a nucleus produced this way generally starts its existence in an excited state that relaxes through the emission of one or more gamma rays or conversion electrons this usually occurs when the formation of an intermediate excited state has a spin far different from that of the ground state the excited state in this situation is a good candidate to be metastable if there are no other states of intermediate spin with excitation energies less than that of the metastable state a different kind of metastable nuclear state ( isomer ) is the fission isomer or shape isomer this geometry can result in quantum-mechanical states where the distribution of protons and neutrons is so much further from spherical geometry that de-excitation to the nuclear ground state is strongly hindered its half-life is at least 10 15 years , markedly longer than the age of the universe the low excitation energy of the isomeric state causes both gamma de-excitation to the ground state ( which itself is radioactive by beta decay , with a half-life of only 8 hours ) and direct beta decay to hafnium or tungsten to be suppressed due to spin mismatches in the natural decay of , the energy is released as gamma rays with a total energy of 2.45 & nbsp ; mev technetium isomers ( with a half-life of 6.01 & nbsp ; hours ) and ( with a half-life of 61 & nbsp ; days ) are used in medical and industrial applications the emission of a gamma ray from an excited nuclear state allows the nucleus to lose energy and reach a lower-energy state , sometimes its ground state the process of isomeric transition is similar to gamma emission from any excited nuclear state , but differs by involving excited metastable states of nuclei with longer half-lives

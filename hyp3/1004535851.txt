nuclei of nuclear isomers the nucleus of a nuclear isomer occupies a higher energy state than the non-excited nucleus existing in the ground state in an excited state , one or more of the protons or neutrons in a nucleus occupy a nuclear orbital of higher energy than an available nuclear orbital when excited atomic states decay , energy is released by fluorescence the amount of energy released is related to bond-dissociation energy or ionization energy and is usually in the range of a few to few tens of ev per bond however , a much stronger type of binding energy , the nuclear binding energy , is involved in nuclear processes due to this , most nuclear excited states decay by gamma ray emission nuclear isomers have long half-lives because their gamma decay is '' forbidden '' from the large change in nuclear spin needed to emit a gamma ray while most metastable isomers decay through gamma-ray emission , they can also decay through internal conversion metastable isomers can be produced through nuclear fusion or other nuclear reactions a nucleus produced this way generally starts its existence in an excited state that relaxes through the emission of one or more gamma rays or conversion electrons sometimes the de-excitation does not completely proceed rapidly to the nuclear ground state this usually occurs when the formation of an intermediate excited state has a spin far different from that of the ground state gamma-ray emission is hindered if the spin of the post-emission state differs greatly from that of the emitting state , especially if the excitation energy is low the excited state in this situation is a good candidate to be metastable if there are no other states of intermediate spin with excitation energies less than that of the metastable state a different kind of metastable nuclear state ( isomer ) is the fission isomer or shape isomer most nuclear excited states are very unstable and '' immediately '' radiate away the extra energy after existing on the order of 10 −12 & nbsp ; seconds has a remarkably low-lying metastable isomer , estimated at only 8.28 & nbsp ; ± & nbsp ; 0.17 & nbsp ; ev above the ground state nuclear battery use small amounts ( milligrams and microcuries ) of radioisotopes with high energy densities in certain cases , the excited nuclear state following a nuclear reaction or other type of radioactive decay can become a metastable nuclear excited state

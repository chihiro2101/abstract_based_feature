nuclei of nuclear isomers the nucleus of a nuclear isomer occupies a higher energy state than the non-excited nucleus existing in the ground state in an excited state , one or more of the protons or neutrons in a nucleus occupy a nuclear orbital of higher energy than an available nuclear orbital when excited atomic states decay , energy is released by fluorescence due to this , most nuclear excited states decay by gamma ray emission while most metastable isomers decay through gamma-ray emission , they can also decay through internal conversion during internal conversion , energy of nuclear de-excitation is not emitted as a gamma ray , but is instead used to accelerate one of the inner electrons of the atom sometimes the de-excitation does not completely proceed rapidly to the nuclear ground state this usually occurs when the formation of an intermediate excited state has a spin far different from that of the ground state gamma-ray emission is hindered if the spin of the post-emission state differs greatly from that of the emitting state , especially if the excitation energy is low the excited state in this situation is a good candidate to be metastable if there are no other states of intermediate spin with excitation energies less than that of the metastable state a different kind of metastable nuclear state ( isomer ) is the fission isomer or shape isomer most nuclear excited states are very unstable and '' immediately '' radiate away the extra energy after existing on the order of 10 −12 & nbsp ; seconds as a result , the characterization '' nuclear isomer '' is usually applied only to configurations with half-lives of 10 −9 & nbsp ; seconds or longer has a remarkably low-lying metastable isomer , estimated at only 8.28 & nbsp ; ± & nbsp ; 0.17 & nbsp ; ev above the ground state due to its low energy , the isomer is expected to allow for direct nuclear laser spectroscopy and the development of a nuclear clock of unprecedented accuracy gamma emission is impossible when the nucleus begins in a zero-spin state , as such an emission would not conserve angular momentum technetium isomers ( with a half-life of 6.01 & nbsp ; hours ) and ( with a half-life of 61 & nbsp ; days ) are used in medical and industrial applications an isomeric transition ( it ) is the decay of a nuclear isomer to a lower-energy nuclear state in certain cases , the excited nuclear state following a nuclear reaction or other type of radioactive decay can become a metastable nuclear excited state

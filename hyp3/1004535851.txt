nuclei of nuclear isomers the nucleus of a nuclear isomer occupies a higher energy state than the non-excited nucleus existing in the ground state in an excited state , one or more of the protons or neutrons in a nucleus occupy a nuclear orbital of higher energy than an available nuclear orbital when excited atomic states decay , energy is released by fluorescence the amount of energy released is related to bond-dissociation energy or ionization energy and is usually in the range of a few to few tens of ev per bond due to this , most nuclear excited states decay by gamma ray emission for example , a well-known nuclear isomer used in various medical procedures is , which decays with a half-life of about 6 hours by emitting a gamma ray of 140 & nbsp ; kev of energy ; this is close to the energy of medical diagnostic x-rays nuclear isomers have long half-lives because their gamma decay is '' forbidden '' from the large change in nuclear spin needed to emit a gamma ray while most metastable isomers decay through gamma-ray emission , they can also decay through internal conversion during internal conversion , energy of nuclear de-excitation is not emitted as a gamma ray , but is instead used to accelerate one of the inner electrons of the atom this usually occurs when the formation of an intermediate excited state has a spin far different from that of the ground state gamma-ray emission is hindered if the spin of the post-emission state differs greatly from that of the emitting state , especially if the excitation energy is low the excited state in this situation is a good candidate to be metastable if there are no other states of intermediate spin with excitation energies less than that of the metastable state a different kind of metastable nuclear state ( isomer ) is the fission isomer or shape isomer most nuclear excited states are very unstable and '' immediately '' radiate away the extra energy after existing on the order of 10 −12 & nbsp ; seconds as a result , the characterization '' nuclear isomer '' is usually applied only to configurations with half-lives of 10 −9 & nbsp ; seconds or longer some nuclear isomers are so long-lived that they are relatively stable and can be produced and observed in quantity in the natural decay of , the energy is released as gamma rays with a total energy of 2.45 & nbsp ; mev the emission of a gamma ray from an excited nuclear state allows the nucleus to lose energy and reach a lower-energy state , sometimes its ground state the process of isomeric transition is similar to gamma emission from any excited nuclear state , but differs by involving excited metastable states of nuclei with longer half-lives

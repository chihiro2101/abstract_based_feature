nuclei of nuclear isomers the nucleus of a nuclear isomer occupies a higher energy state than the non-excited nucleus existing in the ground state in an excited state , one or more of the protons or neutrons in a nucleus occupy a nuclear orbital of higher energy than an available nuclear orbital when excited atomic states decay , energy is released by fluorescence in electronic transitions , this process usually involves emission of light near the visible range the amount of energy released is related to bond-dissociation energy or ionization energy and is usually in the range of a few to few tens of ev per bond however , a much stronger type of binding energy , the nuclear binding energy , is involved in nuclear processes due to this , most nuclear excited states decay by gamma ray emission nuclear isomers have long half-lives because their gamma decay is '' forbidden '' from the large change in nuclear spin needed to emit a gamma ray while most metastable isomers decay through gamma-ray emission , they can also decay through internal conversion during internal conversion , energy of nuclear de-excitation is not emitted as a gamma ray , but is instead used to accelerate one of the inner electrons of the atom metastable isomers can be produced through nuclear fusion or other nuclear reactions a nucleus produced this way generally starts its existence in an excited state that relaxes through the emission of one or more gamma rays or conversion electrons gamma-ray emission is hindered if the spin of the post-emission state differs greatly from that of the emitting state , especially if the excitation energy is low a different kind of metastable nuclear state ( isomer ) is the fission isomer or shape isomer in the natural decay of , the energy is released as gamma rays with a total energy of 2.45 & nbsp ; mev due to its low energy , the isomer is expected to allow for direct nuclear laser spectroscopy and the development of a nuclear clock of unprecedented accuracy an isomeric transition ( it ) is the decay of a nuclear isomer to a lower-energy nuclear state the emission of a gamma ray from an excited nuclear state allows the nucleus to lose energy and reach a lower-energy state , sometimes its ground state in certain cases , the excited nuclear state following a nuclear reaction or other type of radioactive decay can become a metastable nuclear excited state

monocrystalline silicon ( mono-si ) grown by the czochralski method is often referred to as monocrystalline czochralski silicon ( cz-si ) czochralski crystal growth method monocrystalline silicon is also used in large quantities by the photovoltaic industry for the production of conventional mono-si solar cells the almost perfect crystal structure yields the highest light-to-electricity conversion efficiency for silicon production of czochralski silicon a precisely oriented rod-mounted seed crystal is dipped into the molten silicon occurrence of unwanted instabilities in the melt can be avoided by investigating and visualizing the temperature and velocity fields during the crystal growth process image : silicon grown by czochralski process 1956.jpg thumb 240px silicon crystal being grown by the czochralski method at raytheon , 1956 the process begins when the chamber is heated to approximately 1500 degrees celsius , melting the silicon during growth , the walls of the crucible dissolve into the melt and czochralski silicon therefore contains oxygen at a typical concentration of 10 & nbsp ; cm however , formation of oxygen precipitates at unintended locations can also destroy electrical structures

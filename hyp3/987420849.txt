monocrystalline silicon ( mono-si ) grown by the czochralski method is often referred to as monocrystalline czochralski silicon ( cz-si ) it is the basic material in the production of integrated circuits used in computers , tvs , mobile phones and all types of electronic equipment and semiconductor devices czochralski crystal growth method monocrystalline silicon is also used in large quantities by the photovoltaic industry for the production of conventional mono-si solar cells production of czochralski silicon high-purity , semiconductor-grade silicon ( only a few parts per million of impurities ) is melted in a crucible at , usually made of quartz a precisely oriented rod-mounted seed crystal is dipped into the molten silicon image : silicon grown by czochralski process 1956.jpg thumb 240px silicon crystal being grown by the czochralski method at raytheon , 1956 the crystals produced by this early apparatus , used in an early si plant , were only one inch in diameter this method is also used with semiconductor materials other than silicon , such as gallium arsenide therefore , radiation detectors made of czochralski- and magnetic czochralski-silicon are considered to be promising candidates for many future high-energy physics experiments

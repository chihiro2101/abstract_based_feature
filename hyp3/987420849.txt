monocrystalline silicon ( mono-si ) grown by the czochralski method is often referred to as monocrystalline czochralski silicon ( cz-si ) czochralski crystal growth method monocrystalline silicon is also used in large quantities by the photovoltaic industry for the production of conventional mono-si solar cells the almost perfect crystal structure yields the highest light-to-electricity conversion efficiency for silicon production of czochralski silicon high-purity , semiconductor-grade silicon ( only a few parts per million of impurities ) is melted in a crucible at , usually made of quartz image : silicon grown by czochralski process 1956.jpg thumb 240px silicon crystal being grown by the czochralski method at raytheon , 1956 when the silicon is fully melted , a small seed crystal mounted on the end of a rotating shaft is slowly lowered until it dips just below the surface of the molten silicon this method is also used with semiconductor materials other than silicon , such as gallium arsenide these have the effect of trapping unwanted transition metal impurities in a process known as gettering , improving the purity of surrounding silicon the impurity concentration in the solid crystal that results from freezing an amount of volume can be obtained from consideration of the segregation coefficient

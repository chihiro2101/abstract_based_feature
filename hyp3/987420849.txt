monocrystalline silicon ( mono-si ) grown by the czochralski method is often referred to as monocrystalline czochralski silicon ( cz-si ) czochralski crystal growth method monocrystalline silicon is also used in large quantities by the photovoltaic industry for the production of conventional mono-si solar cells high-purity , semiconductor-grade silicon ( only a few parts per million of impurities ) is melted in a crucible at , usually made of quartz dopant impurity atoms such as boron or phosphorus can be added to the molten silicon in precise amounts to dope the silicon , thus changing it into p-type or n-type silicon , with different electronic properties a precisely oriented rod-mounted seed crystal is dipped into the molten silicon image : silicon grown by czochralski process 1956.jpg thumb 240px silicon crystal being grown by the czochralski method at raytheon , 1956 the electrical characteristics of the silicon are controlled by adding material like phosphorus or boron to the silicon before it is melted during growth , the walls of the crucible dissolve into the melt and czochralski silicon therefore contains oxygen at a typical concentration of 10 & nbsp ; cm additionally , oxygen impurities can improve the mechanical strength of silicon wafers by immobilising any dislocations which may be introduced during device processing the impurity concentration in the solid crystal that results from freezing an amount of volume can be obtained from consideration of the segregation coefficient

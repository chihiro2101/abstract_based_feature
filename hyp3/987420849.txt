monocrystalline silicon ( mono-si ) grown by the czochralski method is often referred to as monocrystalline czochralski silicon ( cz-si ) it is the basic material in the production of integrated circuits used in computers , tvs , mobile phones and all types of electronic equipment and semiconductor devices czochralski crystal growth method monocrystalline silicon is also used in large quantities by the photovoltaic industry for the production of conventional mono-si solar cells dopant impurity atoms such as boron or phosphorus can be added to the molten silicon in precise amounts to dope the silicon , thus changing it into p-type or n-type silicon , with different electronic properties a precisely oriented rod-mounted seed crystal is dipped into the molten silicon occurrence of unwanted instabilities in the melt can be avoided by investigating and visualizing the temperature and velocity fields during the crystal growth process image : silicon grown by czochralski process 1956.jpg thumb 240px silicon crystal being grown by the czochralski method at raytheon , 1956 image : silicon seed crystal puller rod.jpg thumb 240px a puller rod with seed crystal for growing single-crystal silicon by the czochralski method thumb thumb when silicon is grown by the czochralski method , the melt is contained in a silica ( quartz ) crucible during growth , the walls of the crucible dissolve into the melt and czochralski silicon therefore contains oxygen at a typical concentration of 10 & nbsp ; cm additionally , oxygen impurities can improve the mechanical strength of silicon wafers by immobilising any dislocations which may be introduced during device processing

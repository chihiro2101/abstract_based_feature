monocrystalline silicon ( mono-si ) grown by the czochralski method is often referred to as monocrystalline czochralski silicon ( cz-si ) it is the basic material in the production of integrated circuits used in computers , tvs , mobile phones and all types of electronic equipment and semiconductor devices czochralski crystal growth method monocrystalline silicon is also used in large quantities by the photovoltaic industry for the production of conventional mono-si solar cells production of czochralski silicon high-purity , semiconductor-grade silicon ( only a few parts per million of impurities ) is melted in a crucible at , usually made of quartz a precisely oriented rod-mounted seed crystal is dipped into the molten silicon occurrence of unwanted instabilities in the melt can be avoided by investigating and visualizing the temperature and velocity fields during the crystal growth process image : silicon grown by czochralski process 1956.jpg thumb 240px silicon crystal being grown by the czochralski method at raytheon , 1956 when the silicon is fully melted , a small seed crystal mounted on the end of a rotating shaft is slowly lowered until it dips just below the surface of the molten silicon during growth , the walls of the crucible dissolve into the melt and czochralski silicon therefore contains oxygen at a typical concentration of 10 & nbsp ; cm

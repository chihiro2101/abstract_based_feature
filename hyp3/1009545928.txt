the building stands on the former site of the baltic exchange ( 24-28 st mary axe ) , which was the headquarters of a global marketplace for shipping freight contracts and also soft commodity , and the chamber of shipping ( 30-32 st mary axe ) on 10 april 1992 , the provisional ira detonated a bomb close to the exchange , causing extensive damage to the historic building and neighbouring structures the united kingdom government 's statutory adviser on the historic environment , english heritage , and the city of london 's governing body , the city of london corporation , were keen that any redevelopment must restore the baltic exchange 's old façade onto st mary axe most of the remaining structures on the baltic exchange site were then carefully dismantled , and the interior of exchange hall and the façade were preserved , hoping for a reconstruction of the building in the future in 1996 , trafalgar house submitted plans for the london millennium tower , a building with more than of office space , apartments , shops , restaurants and gardens this plan was dropped after objections that it was totally out-of-scale in the city of london , and anticipated disruption to flight paths for both london city and london heathrow airports ; the revised plan for a lower tower was accepted the tower 's topmost panoramic dome , known as the '' lens '' , recalls the iconic glass dome that covered part of the ground floor of the baltic exchange and much of which is now displayed at the national maritime museum the site was special because it needed development , it was not on any of the '' sight lines '' ( planning guidance requires that new buildings do not obstruct or detract from the view of st paul 's cathedral dome when viewed from a number of locations around london ) , and it had housed the baltic exchange gmw architects proposed a new rectangular building surrounding a restored exchange : it would have the type of large floor plan that banks liked eventually , the planners realised that the exchange was not recoverable , forcing them to relax their building constraints ; they hinted that an '' architecturally significant '' building might obtain a favourable reception from city authorities the building was constructed by skanska , completed in december 2003 and opened on 28 april 2004 the tower is thus sometimes known as the swiss re building , although this name has never been official and has more recently fallen out of favour , since the company 's main headquarters is in zurich and the gherkin name has become more popular

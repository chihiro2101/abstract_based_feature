the intel 8086 , the predecessor to the 286 , was originally designed with a 20-bit address bus for its memory the initial protected mode , released with the 286 , was not widely used ; for example , it was used by microsoft xenix ( around 1984 ) , coherent and minix several shortcomings such as the inability to access the bios or dos calls due to inability to switch back to real mode without resetting the processor prevented widespread usage real mode also served as a more basic mode in which protected mode could be set up , solving a sort of chicken-and-egg problem to access the extended functionality of the 286 , the operating system would set up some tables in memory that controlled memory access in protected mode , set the addresses of those tables into some special registers of the processor , and then set the processor into protected mode with the release of the 386 in 1985 , many of the issues preventing widespread adoption of the previous protected mode were addressed protected mode is now used in virtually all modern operating systems which run on the x86 architecture , such as microsoft windows , linux , and many others furthermore , learning from the failures of the 286 protected mode to satisfy the needs for multiuser dos , intel added a separate virtual 8086 mode , charles petzold , intel 's 32-bit wonder : the 80386 microprocessor , pc magazine , november 25 , 1986 , pp hardware support required for virtualizing the protected mode itself , however , had to wait for another 20 years ) 32-bit segment offsets ability to switch back to real mode without resetting virtual 8086 mode entering and exiting protected mode until the release of the 386 , protected mode did not offer a direct method to switch back into real mode once protected mode was entered the use of rings allows for system software to restrict tasks from accessing data , call gates or executing privileged instructions with the release of the 386 , protected mode offers what the intel manuals call virtual 8086 mode virtual 8086 mode is designed to allow code previously written for the 8086 to run unmodified and concurrently with other tasks , without compromising security or system stability programs that require segment manipulation , privileged instructions , direct hardware access , or use self-modifying code will generate an exception that must be served by the operating system in addition , applications running in virtual 8086 mode generate a trap with the use of instructions that involve input/output ( i/o ) , which can negatively impact performance the physical address can be calculated as physical_address : segment_part × 16 + offset ( if the address a20 line is enabled ) , respectively ( segment_part × 16 + offset ) mod 2 20 ( if a20 is off ) every segment has a size of 2 16 bytes in protected mode , the is replaced by a 16-bit selector , in which the 13 upper bits ( bit 3 to bit 15 ) contain the index of an entry inside a descriptor table the lowest two bits ( bit 1 and bit 0 ) of the selector are combined to define the privilege of the request , where the values of 0 and 3 represent the highest and the lowest privilege , respectively the segment address inside the descriptor table entry has a length of 24 bits so every byte of the physical memory can be defined as bound of the segment in addition to adding virtual 8086 mode , the 386 also added paging to protected mode however , 64-bit operating systems ( which run in long mode ) no longer use this , since virtual 8086 mode has been removed from long mode .

several shortcomings such as the inability to access the bios or dos calls due to inability to switch back to real mode without resetting the processor prevented widespread usage acceptance was additionally hampered by the fact that the 286 only allowed memory access in 16 bit segments via each of four segment registers , meaning only 4 2 16 bytes , equivalent to 256 kilobytes , could be accessed at a time the 286 maintained backwards compatibility with its precursor the 8086 by initially entering real mode on power up real mode also served as a more basic mode in which protected mode could be set up , solving a sort of chicken-and-egg problem to access the extended functionality of the 286 , the operating system would set up some tables in memory that controlled memory access in protected mode , set the addresses of those tables into some special registers of the processor , and then set the processor into protected mode with the release of the 386 in 1985 , many of the issues preventing widespread adoption of the previous protected mode were addressed the segment sizes were also increased to 32 bits , meaning that the full address space of 4 gigabytes could be accessed without the need to switch between multiple segments in addition to the increased size of the address bus and segment registers , many other new features were added with the intention of increasing operational security and stability protected mode is now used in virtually all modern operating systems which run on the x86 architecture , such as microsoft windows , linux , and many others furthermore , learning from the failures of the 286 protected mode to satisfy the needs for multiuser dos , intel added a separate virtual 8086 mode , charles petzold , intel 's 32-bit wonder : the 80386 microprocessor , pc magazine , november 25 , 1986 , pp . 386 additions to protected mode with the release of the 386 , the following additional features were added to protected mode : paging 32-bit physical and virtual address space ( the 32-bit physical address space is not present on the 80386sx , and other 386 processor variants which use the older 286 bus ) 32-bit segment offsets ability to switch back to real mode without resetting virtual 8086 mode until the release of the 386 , protected mode did not offer a direct method to switch back into real mode once protected mode was entered protected mode has a number of features designed to enhance an operating system 's control over application software , in order to increase security and system stability in protected mode , there are four privilege levels or rings , numbered from 0 to 3 , with ring 0 being the most privileged and 3 being the least . real mode application compatibility despite such potential setbacks , windows 3.0 and its successors can take advantage of the binary compatibility with real mode to run many windows 2.x ( windows 2.0 and windows 2.1x ) applications in protected mode , which ran in real mode in windows 2.x in protected mode , the is replaced by a 16-bit selector , in which the 13 upper bits ( bit 3 to bit 15 ) contain the index of an entry inside a descriptor table the segment address inside the descriptor table entry has a length of 24 bits so every byte of the physical memory can be defined as bound of the segment in addition to adding virtual 8086 mode , the 386 also added paging to protected mode starting an old program while windows & nbsp ; 3.0 is running in protected mode triggers a warning dialog , suggesting to either run windows in real mode or to obtain an updated version of the application however , 64-bit operating systems ( which run in long mode ) no longer use this , since virtual 8086 mode has been removed from long mode .

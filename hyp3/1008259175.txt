at the time , 1 megabyte was considered a relatively large amount of memory , so the designers of the ibm personal computer reserved the first 640 kilobytes for use by applications and the operating system and upper memory area for the bios ( basic input/output system ) and memory for peripheral the initial protected mode , released with the 286 , was not widely used ; for example , it was used by microsoft xenix ( around 1984 ) , coherent and minix several shortcomings such as the inability to access the bios or dos calls due to inability to switch back to real mode without resetting the processor prevented widespread usage acceptance was additionally hampered by the fact that the 286 only allowed memory access in 16 bit segments via each of four segment registers , meaning only 4 2 16 bytes , equivalent to 256 kilobytes , could be accessed at a time real mode also served as a more basic mode in which protected mode could be set up , solving a sort of chicken-and-egg problem to access the extended functionality of the 286 , the operating system would set up some tables in memory that controlled memory access in protected mode , set the addresses of those tables into some special registers of the processor , and then set the processor into protected mode the segment sizes were also increased to 32 bits , meaning that the full address space of 4 gigabytes could be accessed without the need to switch between multiple segments protected mode is now used in virtually all modern operating systems which run on the x86 architecture , such as microsoft windows , linux , and many others furthermore , learning from the failures of the 286 protected mode to satisfy the needs for multiuser dos , intel added a separate virtual 8086 mode , charles petzold , intel 's 32-bit wonder : the 80386 microprocessor , pc magazine , november 25 , 1986 , pp . 386 additions to protected mode with the release of the 386 , the following additional features were added to protected mode : paging 32-bit physical and virtual address space ( the 32-bit physical address space is not present on the 80386sx , and other 386 processor variants which use the older 286 bus until the release of the 386 , protected mode did not offer a direct method to switch back into real mode once protected mode was entered ; set pe bit mov eax , cr0 or eax , 1 mov cr0 , eax ; far jump ( cs selector of code segment ) jmp cs : pm pm : ; now we are in pm with the release of the 386 , protected mode could be exited by loading the segment registers with real mode values , disabling the a20 line and clearing the pe bit in the cr0 register , without the need to perform the initial setup steps required with the 286 protected mode has a number of features designed to enhance an operating system 's control over application software , in order to increase security and system stability the use of rings allows for system software to restrict tasks from accessing data , call gates or executing privileged instructions despite such potential setbacks , windows 3.0 and its successors can take advantage of the binary compatibility with real mode to run many windows 2.x ( windows 2.0 and windows 2.1x ) applications in protected mode , which ran in real mode in windows 2.x with the release of the 386 , protected mode offers what the intel manuals call virtual 8086 mode in real mode each logical address points directly into physical memory location , every logical address consists of two 16 bit parts : the segment part of the logical address contains the base address of a segment with a granularity of 16 bytes , i.e the descriptor table entry defines the real linear address of the segment , a limit value for the segment size , and some attribute bits ( flags ) in addition to adding virtual 8086 mode , the 386 also added paging to protected mode windows & nbsp ; 3.0 was able to run real mode programs in 16-bit protected mode ; when switching to protected mode , it decided to preserve the single privilege level model that was used in real mode , which is why windows applications and dlls can hook interrupts and do direct hardware access however , 64-bit operating systems ( which run in long mode ) no longer use this , since virtual 8086 mode has been removed from long mode .

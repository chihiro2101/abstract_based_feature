several shortcomings such as the inability to access the bios or dos calls due to inability to switch back to real mode without resetting the processor prevented widespread usage acceptance was additionally hampered by the fact that the 286 only allowed memory access in 16 bit segments via each of four segment registers , meaning only 4 2 16 bytes , equivalent to 256 kilobytes , could be accessed at a time real mode also served as a more basic mode in which protected mode could be set up , solving a sort of chicken-and-egg problem to access the extended functionality of the 286 , the operating system would set up some tables in memory that controlled memory access in protected mode , set the addresses of those tables into some special registers of the processor , and then set the processor into protected mode this enabled 24 bit addressing which allowed the processor to access 2 24 bytes of memory , equivalent to 16 megabytes the segment sizes were also increased to 32 bits , meaning that the full address space of 4 gigabytes could be accessed without the need to switch between multiple segments in addition to the increased size of the address bus and segment registers , many other new features were added with the intention of increasing operational security and stability protected mode is now used in virtually all modern operating systems which run on the x86 architecture , such as microsoft windows , linux , and many others furthermore , learning from the failures of the 286 protected mode to satisfy the needs for multiuser dos , intel added a separate virtual 8086 mode , charles petzold , intel 's 32-bit wonder : the 80386 microprocessor , pc magazine , november 25 , 1986 , pp ) 32-bit segment offsets ability to switch back to real mode without resetting virtual 8086 mode until the release of the 386 , protected mode did not offer a direct method to switch back into real mode once protected mode was entered this allowed the bios to restore the cpu to a similar state and begin executing code before the reset to enter protected mode , the global descriptor table ( gdt ) must first be created with a minimum of three entries : a null descriptor , a code segment descriptor and data segment descriptor after performing those two steps , the pe bit must be set in the cr0 register and a far jump must be made to clear the prefetch input queue with the release of the 386 , protected mode could be exited by loading the segment registers with real mode values , disabling the a20 line and clearing the pe bit in the cr0 register , without the need to perform the initial setup steps required with the 286 protected mode has a number of features designed to enhance an operating system 's control over application software , in order to increase security and system stability despite such potential setbacks , windows 3.0 and its successors can take advantage of the binary compatibility with real mode to run many windows 2.x ( windows 2.0 and windows 2.1x ) applications in protected mode , which ran in real mode in windows 2.x with the release of the 386 , protected mode offers what the intel manuals call virtual 8086 mode virtual 8086 mode is designed to allow code previously written for the 8086 to run unmodified and concurrently with other tasks , without compromising security or system stability the descriptor table entry defines the real linear address of the segment , a limit value for the segment size , and some attribute bits ( flags ) the segment address inside the descriptor table entry is expanded to 32 bits so every byte of the physical memory can be defined as bound of the segment windows & nbsp ; 3.0 was able to run real mode programs in 16-bit protected mode ; when switching to protected mode , it decided to preserve the single privilege level model that was used in real mode , which is why windows applications and dlls can hook interrupts and do direct hardware access however , 64-bit operating systems ( which run in long mode ) no longer use this , since virtual 8086 mode has been removed from long mode .

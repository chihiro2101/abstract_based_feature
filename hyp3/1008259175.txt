the intel 8086 , the predecessor to the 286 , was originally designed with a 20-bit address bus for its memory at the time , 1 megabyte was considered a relatively large amount of memory , so the designers of the ibm personal computer reserved the first 640 kilobytes for use by applications and the operating system and upper memory area for the bios ( basic input/output system ) and memory for peripheral the initial protected mode , released with the 286 , was not widely used ; for example , it was used by microsoft xenix ( around 1984 ) , coherent and minix several shortcomings such as the inability to access the bios or dos calls due to inability to switch back to real mode without resetting the processor prevented widespread usage acceptance was additionally hampered by the fact that the 286 only allowed memory access in 16 bit segments via each of four segment registers , meaning only 4 2 16 bytes , equivalent to 256 kilobytes , could be accessed at a time real mode also served as a more basic mode in which protected mode could be set up , solving a sort of chicken-and-egg problem to access the extended functionality of the 286 , the operating system would set up some tables in memory that controlled memory access in protected mode , set the addresses of those tables into some special registers of the processor , and then set the processor into protected mode in addition to the increased size of the address bus and segment registers , many other new features were added with the intention of increasing operational security and stability protected mode is now used in virtually all modern operating systems which run on the x86 architecture , such as microsoft windows , linux , and many others furthermore , learning from the failures of the 286 protected mode to satisfy the needs for multiuser dos , intel added a separate virtual 8086 mode , charles petzold , intel 's 32-bit wonder : the 80386 microprocessor , pc magazine , november 25 , 1986 , pp hardware support required for virtualizing the protected mode itself , however , had to wait for another 20 years with the release of the 386 , the following additional features were added to protected mode : paging 32-bit physical and virtual address space ( the 32-bit physical address space is not present on the 80386sx , and other 386 processor variants which use the older 286 bus ) 32-bit segment offsets ability to switch back to real mode without resetting virtual 8086 mode until the release of the 386 , protected mode did not offer a direct method to switch back into real mode once protected mode was entered ; set pe bit mov eax , cr0 or eax , 1 mov cr0 , eax ; far jump ( cs selector of code segment ) jmp cs : pm pm : ; now we are in pm with the release of the 386 , protected mode could be exited by loading the segment registers with real mode values , disabling the a20 line and clearing the pe bit in the cr0 register , without the need to perform the initial setup steps required with the 286 protected mode has a number of features designed to enhance an operating system 's control over application software , in order to increase security and system stability . real mode application compatibility despite such potential setbacks , windows 3.0 and its successors can take advantage of the binary compatibility with real mode to run many windows 2.x ( windows 2.0 and windows 2.1x ) applications in protected mode , which ran in real mode in windows 2.x with the release of the 386 , protected mode offers what the intel manuals call virtual 8086 mode the segment address inside the descriptor table entry has a length of 24 bits so every byte of the physical memory can be defined as bound of the segment it is not possible to have some gui programs running in 16-bit protected mode and other gui programs running in real mode however , 64-bit operating systems ( which run in long mode ) no longer use this , since virtual 8086 mode has been removed from long mode .

boileau was the fifteenth child of gilles boileau , a clerk in the parlement two of his brothers attained some distinction : gilles boileau , the author of a translation of epictetus ; and jacques boileau , who became a canon of the sainte-chapelle , and made valuable contributions to church history his mother died when he was two years old ; and nicolas boileau , who had a delicate constitution , seems to have suffered something from want of care sainte-beuve puts down his somewhat hard and unsympathetic outlook quite as much to the uninspiring circumstances of these days as to the general character of his time the first piece in which his peculiar powers were displayed was the first satire ( 1660 ) , in imitation of the third satire of juvenal ; it embodied the farewell of a poet to the city of paris prose in the hands of such writers as rené descartes and blaise pascal had proved itself a flexible and powerful instrument of expression , with a distinct mechanism and form but except with francois de malherbe , there had been no attempt to fashion french versification according to rule or method in boileau for the first time appeared terseness and vigour of expression , with perfect regularity of verse structure though fairly widely read in manuscript and also released in an unauthorized edition in 1668 , the book was not published till 1713 , out of regard , it is said , for mlle de scudéry in 1674 boileau 's l'art poétique ( in imitation of the ars poetica of horace ) and le lutrin were published with some earlier works as the l'œuvres diverses du sieur d the epistle , sur l'amour de dieu , was a triumphant vindication on the part of boileau of the dignity of his art he holds a well-defined place in french literature , as the first who reduced its versification to rule , and taught the value of workmanship for its own sake after much undue depreciation , boileau 's critical work has been rehabilitated by recent writers , perhaps to the extent of some exaggeration in the other direction boileau 's works , ( in french ) illustrated by rémy lejeune ( ladoré ) , edited by pierre et berthe bricage ( 1961 ) , in 5 volumes

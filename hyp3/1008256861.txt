the island of timor was populated as part of the human migrations that have shaped australasia more generally one of the oldest fish hooks in the world , dated between 16,000 and 23,000 years old , was excavated at the jerimalai cave it is believed that survivors from three waves of migration still live in the country timorese origin myths tell of ancestors that sailed around the eastern end of timor arriving on land in the south the later timorese were not seafarers , rather they were land focused people who rarely made contact with other islands timor was part of a region of small islands with small populations of similarly land-focused people that now make up eastern indonesia contact with the outside world was via networks of foreign seafaring traders from as far as china and india that served the archipelago however , as portuguese chronologist tomé pires wrote in the 16th century , all islands east of java were called '' timor '' early european explorers report that the island had a number of small chiefdoms or princedoms in the early 16th century the first europeans to arrive in the area were the portugal , who landed near modern pante macassar by the seventeenth century the village of lifau - today part of the oecussi enclave - became the centre of portuguese activities at this time , the portuguese began to convert the timorese to catholicism the aim of this expedition was to weaken the power of the timor kings and even as this expedition was made by the topasses , the 'black portuguese ' , it succeeded to extend the portuguese influence into the interior of the country in 1702 the territory officially became a portuguese colony , known as portuguese timor , when lisbon sent its first governor , with lifau as its capital portuguese control over the territory was tenuous particularly in the mountainous interior sandalwood remained the main export crop with coffee exports becoming significant in the mid-nineteenth century at the beginning of the twentieth century , a faltering home economy prompted the portuguese to extract greater wealth from its colonies the capital was moved from lifau to dili in 1769 , due to attacks from the topasses , an independent-minded eurasian group meanwhile , the dutch were colonising the rest of the island and the surrounding archipelago that is now indonesia in 1910–12 , the east timorese rebelled against portugal the definitive border was drawn by the hague in 1914 , and it remains the international boundary between the modern states of east timor and indonesia although portugal was neutral during world war ii , in december 1941 , portuguese timor was occupied by australian and dutch forces , which were expecting a japanese invasion this australian military intervention dragged portuguese timor into the pacific war but it also slowed the japanese expansion when the japanese did occupy timor , in february 1942 , a 400-strong dutch-australian force and large numbers of timorese volunteers engaged them in battle of timor ( 1942–43 ) portuguese timor was handed back to portugal after the war , but portugal continued to neglect the colony the colony was declared an 'overseas province ' of the portuguese republic in 1955 this was partly as indonesia was preoccupied with gaining control of west irian , now called papua , which had been retained by the netherlands after indonesian independence in fact , at the united nations , indonesian diplomats stressed that their country did not seek control over any territory outside the former netherlands east indies , explicitly mentioning portuguese timor the decolonisation process instigated by carnation revolution saw portugal effectively abandon the colony of portuguese timor a civil war between supporters of portuguese timorese political parties , fretilin and the udt , broke out in 1975 as udt attempted a coup which fretilin resisted with the help of local portuguese military one of its leaders , mário viegas carrascalão , one of the few timorese to have been educated at university in portugal , later became indonesian governor of east timor during the 1980s and early 1990s , although with the demise of indonesian rule , he would change to supporting independence it later changed its name to frente revolucionária de timor-leste independente ( revolutionary front of independent east timor or fretilin ) the party committed itself to '' the universal doctrines of socialism '' one of its leaders , abílio osório soares , later served as the last indonesian-appointed governor of east timor it also had some support in the small muslim minority , although marí alkatiri , a muslim , was a prominent fretilin leader , and became prime minister in 2002 developments in portuguese timor during 1974 and 1975 were watched closely by indonesia and australia at a meeting in the javanese town of wonosobo in 1974 , he told suharto that an independent portuguese timor would be 'an unviable state , and a potential threat to the stability of the region' while recognising the need for an act of self-determination , he considered integration with indonesia to be in portuguese timor 's best interests indonesian military intelligence , known as bakin , began attempting to cause divisions between the pro-independence parties , and promote the support of apodeti many indonesian military figures held meetings with udt leaders , who made it plain that jakarta would not tolerate a fretilin-led administration in an independent east timor indonesia sought to portray the conflict as a civil war , which had plunged portuguese timor into chaos , but after only a month , aid and relief agencies from australia and elsewhere visited the territory , and reported that the situation was stable on 28 november 1975 , fretilin made a unilateral declaration of independence of the democratic republic of east timor ( república democrática de timor-leste in portuguese ) fretilin 's francisco xavier do amaral became the first president , while fretilin leader nicolau dos reis lobato was prime minister an international east timor solidarity movement arose in response to the 1975 invasion of east timor by indonesia and the occupation that followed many demonstrations and vigils backed legislative actions to cut off military supplies to indonesia josé ramos-horta , later president of east timor , stated in a 2007 interview that the solidarity movement '' was instrumental the reason may be the existence of oil found in the waters between indonesia and australia by 1976 there were 35,000 indonesian troops in east timor falintil , the military wing of fretilin , fought a guerrilla war with marked success in the first few years but weakened considerably thereafter by february 1976 , with troops spreading out from the capital to occupy villages to the east and south , east timor 's indonesian-appointed deputy governor , lopez la cruz , admitted that 60,000 east timorese had been killed timorese groups fought a campaign of resistance against indonesian forces for the independence of east timor , during which many atrocities and human rights violations by the indonesian army were reported upon his arrival in east timor , the pope symbolically kissed a cross then pressed it to the ground , alluding to his usual practice of kissing the ground on arrival in a nation , and yet avoiding overtly suggesting east timor was a sovereign country on 20 september 1999 the australian-led peacekeeping troops of the international force for east timor ( interfet ) deployed to the country and brought the violence to an end timeline of east timorese history list of years in east timor list of rulers of timor history of asia history of southeast asia history of indonesia politics

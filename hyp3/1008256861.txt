the first is described by anthropologists as people of the veddo-australoid type timorese origin myths tell of ancestors that sailed around the eastern end of timor arriving on land in the south the later timorese were not seafarers , rather they were land focused people who rarely made contact with other islands timor was part of a region of small islands with small populations of similarly land-focused people that now make up eastern indonesia the first known mention of timor in writing can be found in the 13th-century chinese zhu fan zhi , which describes various products and civilizations found outside china in the zhu fan zhi , timor is called ti-wen and is noted for its sandalwood however , as portuguese chronologist tomé pires wrote in the 16th century , all islands east of java were called '' timor '' early european explorers report that the island had a number of small chiefdoms or princedoms in the early 16th century one of the most significant is the wehali kingdom in central timor , to which the tetum , bunaq and kemak ethnic groups were aligned the aim of this expedition was to weaken the power of the timor kings and even as this expedition was made by the topasses , the 'black portuguese ' , it succeeded to extend the portuguese influence into the interior of the country in 1702 the territory officially became a portuguese colony , known as portuguese timor , when lisbon sent its first governor , with lifau as its capital the control of colonial administrators , largely restricted to dili , had to rely on traditional tribal chieftains for control and influence the island was seen as a way to exile those who the government in lisbon saw as '' problems '' - these included political prisoners as well as ordinary criminals at the beginning of the twentieth century , a faltering home economy prompted the portuguese to extract greater wealth from its colonies the capital was moved from lifau to dili in 1769 , due to attacks from the topasses , an independent-minded eurasian group meanwhile , the dutch were colonising the rest of the island and the surrounding archipelago that is now indonesia the definitive border was drawn by the hague in 1914 , and it remains the international boundary between the modern states of east timor and indonesia although portugal was neutral during world war ii , in december 1941 , portuguese timor was occupied by australian and dutch forces , which were expecting a japanese invasion this assistance cost the civilian population dearly : japanese forces burned many villages and seized food supplies the japanese occupation resulted in the deaths of 40,000–70,000 timorese portuguese timor was handed back to portugal after the war , but portugal continued to neglect the colony very little investment was made in infrastructure , education and healthcare locally , authority rested with the portuguese governor and the legislative council , as well as local chiefs or liurai only a small minority of timorese were educated , and even fewer went on to university in portugal ( there were no universities in the territory until 2000 ) in fact , at the united nations , indonesian diplomats stressed that their country did not seek control over any territory outside the former netherlands east indies , explicitly mentioning portuguese timor a civil war between supporters of portuguese timorese political parties , fretilin and the udt , broke out in 1975 as udt attempted a coup which fretilin resisted with the help of local portuguese military one of the first acts of the new government in lisbon was to appoint a new governor for the colony on 18 november 1974 , in the form of mário lemos pires , who would ultimately be , as events were to prove , the last governor of portuguese timor one of his first decrees made upon his arrival in dili was to legalise political parties in preparation for elections to a constituent assembly in 1976 one of its leaders , mário viegas carrascalão , one of the few timorese to have been educated at university in portugal , later became indonesian governor of east timor during the 1980s and early 1990s , although with the demise of indonesian rule , he would change to supporting independence it later changed its name to frente revolucionária de timor-leste independente ( revolutionary front of independent east timor or fretilin ) fretilin was regarded by many in australia and indonesia as being marxist , its name sounding reminiscent of frelimo in mozambique the associação popular democrática timorense ( '' apodeti '' , timorese popular democratic association ) supported integration with indonesia , as an autonomous province , but had little grassroots support one of its leaders , abílio osório soares , later served as the last indonesian-appointed governor of east timor it also had some support in the small muslim minority , although marí alkatiri , a muslim , was a prominent fretilin leader , and became prime minister in 2002 the associação democrática para a integração de timor-leste na austrália ( aditla ) advocated integration with australia , but folded after the australian government emphatically ruled out the idea developments in portuguese timor during 1974 and 1975 were watched closely by indonesia and australia australia 's labor prime minister , gough whitlam , had developed a close working relationship with the indonesian leader , and also followed events with concern indonesian military intelligence , known as bakin , began attempting to cause divisions between the pro-independence parties , and promote the support of apodeti many indonesian military figures held meetings with udt leaders , who made it plain that jakarta would not tolerate a fretilin-led administration in an independent east timor many local leaders saw independence as unrealistic , and were open to discussions with jakarta over portuguese timor 's incorporation into the indonesian state nevertheless , many udt supporters had fled across the border into indonesian timor , where they were coerced into supporting integration with indonesia while fretilin had sought the return of the portuguese governor , pointedly flying the portuguese flag from government offices , the deteriorating situation meant that it had to make an appeal to the world for international support , independently of portugal on 28 november 1975 , fretilin made a unilateral declaration of independence of the democratic republic of east timor ( república democrática de timor-leste in portuguese ) the movement was most extensive in neighbouring australia , in portugal , in the philippines and the former portuguese colonies in africa , but had significant force in the united states , canada and europe josé ramos-horta , later president of east timor , stated in a 2007 interview that the solidarity movement '' was instrumental the indonesian invasion of east timor began on 7 december 1975 moreover , according to declassified documents released by the national security archive ( nsa ) in december 2001 , usa gave its agreement to indonesia for the invasion by 1976 there were 35,000

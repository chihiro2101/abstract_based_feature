the island of timor was populated as part of the human migrations that have shaped australasia more generally the first is described by anthropologists as people of the veddo-australoid type the later timorese were not seafarers , rather they were land focused people who rarely made contact with other islands timor was part of a region of small islands with small populations of similarly land-focused people that now make up eastern indonesia in the zhu fan zhi , timor is called ti-wen and is noted for its sandalwood in 1365 , the nagarakretagama , which contains descriptions of the majapahit empire at its peak , identifies timor as an island within majapahit 's realm however , as portuguese chronologist tomé pires wrote in the 16th century , all islands east of java were called '' timor '' early european explorers report that the island had a number of small chiefdoms or princedoms in the early 16th century the first europeans to arrive in the area were the portugal , who landed near modern pante macassar starting in 1642 , a military expedition led by the portuguese francisco fernandes took place the aim of this expedition was to weaken the power of the timor kings and even as this expedition was made by the topasses , the 'black portuguese ' , it succeeded to extend the portuguese influence into the interior of the country in 1702 the territory officially became a portuguese colony , known as portuguese timor , when lisbon sent its first governor , with lifau as its capital for the portuguese , east timor remained little more than a neglected trading post until the late nineteenth century portuguese ruled through a traditional system of liurai ( local chiefs ) sandalwood remained the main export crop with coffee exports becoming significant in the mid-nineteenth century the border between portuguese timor and the dutch east indies was formally decided in 1859 with the treaty of lisbon this australian military intervention dragged portuguese timor into the pacific war but it also slowed the japanese expansion when the japanese did occupy timor , in february 1942 , a 400-strong dutch-australian force and large numbers of timorese volunteers engaged them in battle of timor ( 1942–43 ) this was partly as indonesia was preoccupied with gaining control of west irian , now called papua , which had been retained by the netherlands after indonesian independence in fact , at the united nations , indonesian diplomats stressed that their country did not seek control over any territory outside the former netherlands east indies , explicitly mentioning portuguese timor a civil war between supporters of portuguese timorese political parties , fretilin and the udt , broke out in 1975 as udt attempted a coup which fretilin resisted with the help of local portuguese military one of his first decrees made upon his arrival in dili was to legalise political parties in preparation for elections to a constituent assembly in 1976 one of its leaders , mário viegas carrascalão , one of the few timorese to have been educated at university in portugal , later became indonesian governor of east timor during the 1980s and early 1990s , although with the demise of indonesian rule , he would change to supporting independence the associação social democrática timorense ( asdt , timorese social democratic association ) supported a rapid movement to independence it later changed its name to frente revolucionária de timor-leste independente ( revolutionary front of independent east timor or fretilin ) fretilin was regarded by many in australia and indonesia as being marxist , its name sounding reminiscent of frelimo in mozambique at a meeting in the javanese town of wonosobo in 1974 , he told suharto that an independent portuguese timor would be 'an unviable state , and a potential threat to the stability of the region' while recognising the need for an act of self-determination , he considered integration with indonesia to be in portuguese timor 's best interests in local elections on 13 march 1975 , fretilin and udt emerged as the largest parties , having previously formed an alliance to campaign for independence many local leaders saw independence as unrealistic , and were open to discussions with jakarta over portuguese timor 's incorporation into the indonesian state he was urged by fretilin to return and resume the decolonisation process , but he insisted that he was awaiting instructions from the government in lisbon , now increasingly uninterested nevertheless , many udt supporters had fled across the border into indonesian timor , where they were coerced into supporting integration with indonesia while fretilin had sought the return of the portuguese governor , pointedly flying the portuguese flag from government offices , the deteriorating situation meant that it had to make an appeal to the world for international support , independently of portugal on 28 november 1975 , fretilin made a unilateral declaration of independence of the democratic republic of east timor ( república democrática de timor-leste in portuguese ) xanana gusmão , now the country 's prime minister , described this as the 'balibohong declaration ' , a pun on the indonesian word for 'lie ' east timor solidarity movement an international east timor solidarity movement arose in response to the 1975 invasion of east timor by indonesia and the occupation that followed many demonstrations and vigils backed legislative actions to cut off military supplies to indonesia josé ramos-horta , later president of east timor , stated in a 2007 interview that the solidarity movement '' was instrumental the indonesian invasion of east timor began on 7 december 1975 the reason may be the existence of oil found in the waters between indonesia and australia by 1976 there were 35,000 indonesian troops in east timor a puppet provisional government of east timor was installed in mid-december , consisting of apodeti and udt leaders attempts by the united nations secretary general 's special representative , vittorio winspeare-guicciardi to visit fretilin-held areas from darwin , australia , were obstructed by the indonesian military , which blockaded east timor with the event captured on film and aired around the world , the embarrassed indonesian government admitted to 19 killings , although it 's estimated that over 200 died in the massacre the indonesian army is reported to have trained and supplied militias imported from indonesia to terrorism the population foreign powers such as the australian government , concerned to maintain good relations with indonesia , had been consistently reluctant to assist a push for independence ( despite popular sympathy for the east timorese cause among many in the australian electorate ) a burgeoning east timor solidarity movement grew in portugal , australia , and the united states etan.org , etan backgrounder for 20 may independence , east timor and indonesia action network nevertheless , australia provided important sanctuary to east timorese independence advocates like josé ramos-horta ( who based himself in australia during his exile ) the catholic church in australia urged the australian government to send an armed peacekeeping force to east timor to end the violence the administration of east timor was taken over by the un through the united nations transitional administration in east timor ( untaet ) , established on 25 october 1999 canberra claims petroleum and natural gas fields in an area known as the 'timor gap ' , which east timor regards as lying within its maritime boundaries five new zealand troops were killed in the 13 years the country had a military presence in east timor

the island of timor was populated as part of the human migrations that have shaped australasia more generally one of the oldest fish hooks in the world , dated between 16,000 and 23,000 years old , was excavated at the jerimalai cave it is believed that survivors from three waves of migration still live in the country timorese origin myths tell of ancestors that sailed around the eastern end of timor arriving on land in the south the later timorese were not seafarers , rather they were land focused people who rarely made contact with other islands timor was part of a region of small islands with small populations of similarly land-focused people that now make up eastern indonesia climatic changes , in particular during the little ice age , and the increased trade in sandalwood , are thought to have increased tensions around the control of resources during that time the first known mention of timor in writing can be found in the 13th-century chinese zhu fan zhi , which describes various products and civilizations found outside china in 1365 , the nagarakretagama , which contains descriptions of the majapahit empire at its peak , identifies timor as an island within majapahit 's realm however , as portuguese chronologist tomé pires wrote in the 16th century , all islands east of java were called '' timor '' early european explorers report that the island had a number of small chiefdoms or princedoms in the early 16th century at this time , the portuguese began to convert the timorese to catholicism portuguese control over the territory was tenuous particularly in the mountainous interior at the beginning of the twentieth century , a faltering home economy prompted the portuguese to extract greater wealth from its colonies portugal received the eastern half , together with the north coast pocket of oecussi the definitive border was drawn by the hague in 1914 , and it remains the international boundary between the modern states of east timor and indonesia although portugal was neutral during world war ii , in december 1941 , portuguese timor was occupied by australian and dutch forces , which were expecting a japanese invasion this australian military intervention dragged portuguese timor into the pacific war but it also slowed the japanese expansion when the japanese did occupy timor , in february 1942 , a 400-strong dutch-australian force and large numbers of timorese volunteers engaged them in battle of timor ( 1942–43 ) after the allied evacuation in february 1943 the east timorese continued fighting the japanese , with comparatively little collaboration with the enemy taking place portuguese timor was handed back to portugal after the war , but portugal continued to neglect the colony this was partly as indonesia was preoccupied with gaining control of west irian , now called papua , which had been retained by the netherlands after indonesian independence in fact , at the united nations , indonesian diplomats stressed that their country did not seek control over any territory outside the former netherlands east indies , explicitly mentioning portuguese timor the decolonisation process instigated by carnation revolution saw portugal effectively abandon the colony of portuguese timor a civil war between supporters of portuguese timorese political parties , fretilin and the udt , broke out in 1975 as udt attempted a coup which fretilin resisted with the help of local portuguese military one of the first acts of the new government in lisbon was to appoint a new governor for the colony on 18 november 1974 , in the form of mário lemos pires , who would ultimately be , as events were to prove , the last governor of portuguese timor one of his first decrees made upon his arrival in dili was to legalise political parties in preparation for elections to a constituent assembly in 1976 one of its leaders , mário viegas carrascalão , one of the few timorese to have been educated at university in portugal , later became indonesian governor of east timor during the 1980s and early 1990s , although with the demise of indonesian rule , he would change to supporting independence one of its leaders , abílio osório soares , later served as the last indonesian-appointed governor of east timor parties compete , foreign powers take interest developments in portuguese timor during 1974 and 1975 were watched closely by indonesia and australia at a meeting in the javanese town of wonosobo in 1974 , he told suharto that an independent portuguese timor would be 'an unviable state , and a potential threat to the stability of the region' in local elections on 13 march 1975 , fretilin and udt emerged as the largest parties , having previously formed an alliance to campaign for independence this was known as operasi komodo or 'operation komodo ' after the giant komodo lizard found in the eastern indonesian island of the same name during the course of 1975 , portugal became increasingly detached from political developments in its colony , becoming embroiled in civil unrest and political crises , and more concerned with decolonisation in its african colonies of angola and mozambique than with portuguese timor on 11 august 1975 , the udt mounted a coup , in a bid to halt the increasing popularity of fretilin he was urged by fretilin to return and resume the decolonisation process , but he insisted that he was awaiting instructions from the government in lisbon , now increasingly uninterested in october 1975 , in the border town of balibo , two australian television crews ( the '' balibo five '' ) reporting on the conflict were killed by indonesian forces , after they witnessed indonesian incursions into portuguese timor while fretilin had sought the return of the portuguese governor , pointedly flying the portuguese flag from government offices , the deteriorating situation meant that it had to make an appeal to the world for international support , independently of portugal on 28 november 1975 , fretilin made a unilateral declaration of independence of the democratic republic of east timor ( república democrática de timor-leste in portuguese ) xanana gusmão , now the country 's prime minister , described this as the 'balibohong declaration ' , a pun on the indonesian word for 'lie ' east timor solidarity movement an international east timor solidarity

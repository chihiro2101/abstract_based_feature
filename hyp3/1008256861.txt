timorese origin myths tell of ancestors that sailed around the eastern end of timor arriving on land in the south timor was part of a region of small islands with small populations of similarly land-focused people that now make up eastern indonesia contact with the outside world was via networks of foreign seafaring traders from as far as china and india that served the archipelago outside products brought to the region included metal goods , rice , fine textiles , and coins exchanged for local spices , sandalwood , deer horn , bees ' wax , and slaves the first known mention of timor in writing can be found in the 13th-century chinese zhu fan zhi , which describes various products and civilizations found outside china however , as portuguese chronologist tomé pires wrote in the 16th century , all islands east of java were called '' timor '' early european explorers report that the island had a number of small chiefdoms or princedoms in the early 16th century by the seventeenth century the village of lifau - today part of the oecussi enclave - became the centre of portuguese activities at this time , the portuguese began to convert the timorese to catholicism the aim of this expedition was to weaken the power of the timor kings and even as this expedition was made by the topasses , the 'black portuguese ' , it succeeded to extend the portuguese influence into the interior of the country in 1702 the territory officially became a portuguese colony , known as portuguese timor , when lisbon sent its first governor , with lifau as its capital dominican friars , the occasional dutch raid , and the timorese themselves provided opposition to the portuguese for the portuguese , east timor remained little more than a neglected trading post until the late nineteenth century the island was seen as a way to exile those who the government in lisbon saw as '' problems '' - these included political prisoners as well as ordinary criminals meanwhile , the dutch were colonising the rest of the island and the surrounding archipelago that is now indonesia the border between portuguese timor and the dutch east indies was formally decided in 1859 with the treaty of lisbon portugal received the eastern half , together with the north coast pocket of oecussi the definitive border was drawn by the hague in 1914 , and it remains the international boundary between the modern states of east timor and indonesia although portugal was neutral during world war ii , in december 1941 , portuguese timor was occupied by australian and dutch forces , which were expecting a japanese invasion when the japanese did occupy timor , in february 1942 , a 400-strong dutch-australian force and large numbers of timorese volunteers engaged them in battle of timor ( 1942–43 ) after the allied evacuation in february 1943 the east timorese continued fighting the japanese , with comparatively little collaboration with the enemy taking place this assistance cost the civilian population dearly : japanese forces burned many villages and seized food supplies portuguese timor was handed back to portugal after the war , but portugal continued to neglect the colony this was partly as indonesia was preoccupied with gaining control of west irian , now called papua , which had been retained by the netherlands after indonesian independence in fact , at the united nations , indonesian diplomats stressed that their country did not seek control over any territory outside the former netherlands east indies , explicitly mentioning portuguese timor a civil war between supporters of portuguese timorese political parties , fretilin and the udt , broke out in 1975 as udt attempted a coup which fretilin resisted with the help of local portuguese military one of the first acts of the new government in lisbon was to appoint a new governor for the colony on 18 november 1974 , in the form of mário lemos pires , who would ultimately be , as events were to prove , the last governor of portuguese timor one of its leaders , mário viegas carrascalão , one of the few timorese to have been educated at university in portugal , later became indonesian governor of east timor during the 1980s and early 1990s , although with the demise of indonesian rule , he would change to supporting independence the associação social democrática timorense ( asdt , timorese social democratic association ) supported a rapid movement to independence it later changed its name to frente revolucionária de timor-leste independente ( revolutionary front of independent east timor or fretilin ) the party committed itself to '' the universal doctrines of socialism '' the associação popular democrática timorense ( '' apodeti '' , timorese popular democratic association ) supported integration with indonesia , as an autonomous province , but had little grassroots support one of its leaders , abílio osório soares , later served as the last indonesian-appointed governor of east timor it also had some support in the small muslim minority , although marí alkatiri , a muslim , was a prominent fretilin leader , and became prime minister in 2002 other smaller parties included klibur oan timur asuwain ( kota , tetum for 'sons of the mountain warriors ' ) , which sought to create a form of monarchy involving the local liurai , and the partido trabalhista ( labour party ) , but neither had any significant support australia 's labor prime minister , gough whitlam , had developed a close working relationship with the indonesian leader , and also followed events with concern at a meeting in the javanese town of wonosobo in 1974 , he told suharto that an independent portuguese timor would be 'an unviable state , and a potential threat to the stability of the region' this was known as operasi komodo or 'operation komodo ' after the giant komodo lizard found in the eastern indonesian island of the same name governor pires fled to the offshore island of atauro , north of the capital , dili , from where he later attempted to broker an agreement between the two sides indonesia sought to portray the conflict as a civil war , which had plunged portuguese timor into chaos , but after only a month , aid and relief agencies from australia and elsewhere visited the territory , and reported that the situation was stable in october 1975 , in the border town of balibo , two australian television crews ( the '' balibo five '' ) reporting on the conflict were killed by indonesian forces , after they witnessed indonesian incursions into portuguese timor while fretilin had sought the return of the portuguese governor , pointedly flying the portuguese flag from government offices , the deteriorating situation meant that it had to make an appeal to the world for international support , independently of portugal indonesia 's response was to have udt , apodeti , kota and trabalhista leaders sign a declaration calling for integration with indonesia called the balibo declaration , although it was drafted by indonesian intelligence and signed in bali , indonesia not balibo , portuguese timor an international east timor solidarity movement arose in response to the 1975 invasion of east timor by indonesia and the occupation that followed the movement was most extensive in neighbouring australia , in portugal , in the philippines and the former portuguese colonies in africa , but had significant force in the united states , canada and europe indonesian forces launched a massive air and sea invasion , known as operasi seroja , or 'operation komodo ' , almost entirely using us-supplied equipment even if kissinger feared this would be revealed to the public in fact , when the indonesian president suharto asked the understanding of taking rapid drastic action in east timor to the american president , president ford replied , '' we will understand and not press you on the issue the occupation of east timor remained a public issue in many nations , portugal in particular , and the un never recognised either the regime installed by the indonesians or the subsequent annexation policy toward east timor , east timor and indonesia action network instead , the un authorised the creation of a multinational military force known as interfet ( international force for east timor ) , with security council resolution 1264 east timor became a member of the un on 27 september 2002 canberra claims petroleum and natural gas fields in an area known as the 'timor gap ' , which east timor regards as lying within its maritime boundaries

the island of timor was populated as part of the human migrations that have shaped australasia more generally as of 2019 , the oldest traces of human settlement are 43,000 to 44,000 years old , and were found in the laili cave in manatuto municipality one of the oldest fish hooks in the world , dated between 16,000 and 23,000 years old , was excavated at the jerimalai cave timorese origin myths tell of ancestors that sailed around the eastern end of timor arriving on land in the south timor was part of a region of small islands with small populations of similarly land-focused people that now make up eastern indonesia the first known mention of timor in writing can be found in the 13th-century chinese zhu fan zhi , which describes various products and civilizations found outside china early european explorers report that the island had a number of small chiefdoms or princedoms in the early 16th century one of the most significant is the wehali kingdom in central timor , to which the tetum , bunaq and kemak ethnic groups were aligned starting in 1642 , a military expedition led by the portuguese francisco fernandes took place in 1702 the territory officially became a portuguese colony , known as portuguese timor , when lisbon sent its first governor , with lifau as its capital dominican friars , the occasional dutch raid , and the timorese themselves provided opposition to the portuguese for the portuguese , east timor remained little more than a neglected trading post until the late nineteenth century the border between portuguese timor and the dutch east indies was formally decided in 1859 with the treaty of lisbon portugal received the eastern half , together with the north coast pocket of oecussi the definitive border was drawn by the hague in 1914 , and it remains the international boundary between the modern states of east timor and indonesia although portugal was neutral during world war ii , in december 1941 , portuguese timor was occupied by australian and dutch forces , which were expecting a japanese invasion when the japanese did occupy timor , in february 1942 , a 400-strong dutch-australian force and large numbers of timorese volunteers engaged them in battle of timor ( 1942–43 ) this assistance cost the civilian population dearly : japanese forces burned many villages and seized food supplies locally , authority rested with the portuguese governor and the legislative council , as well as local chiefs or liurai only a small minority of timorese were educated , and even fewer went on to university in portugal ( there were no universities in the territory until 2000 ) this was partly as indonesia was preoccupied with gaining control of west irian , now called papua , which had been retained by the netherlands after indonesian independence decolonisation , coup , and independence the decolonisation process instigated by carnation revolution saw portugal effectively abandon the colony of portuguese timor one of its leaders , mário viegas carrascalão , one of the few timorese to have been educated at university in portugal , later became indonesian governor of east timor during the 1980s and early 1990s , although with the demise of indonesian rule , he would change to supporting independence fretilin was regarded by many in australia and indonesia as being marxist , its name sounding reminiscent of frelimo in mozambique the associação popular democrática timorense ( '' apodeti '' , timorese popular democratic association ) supported integration with indonesia , as an autonomous province , but had little grassroots support one of its leaders , abílio osório soares , later served as the last indonesian-appointed governor of east timor other smaller parties included klibur oan timur asuwain ( kota , tetum for 'sons of the mountain warriors ' ) , which sought to create a form of monarchy involving the local liurai , and the partido trabalhista ( labour party ) , but neither had any significant support australia 's labor prime minister , gough whitlam , had developed a close working relationship with the indonesian leader , and also followed events with concern in local elections on 13 march 1975 , fretilin and udt emerged as the largest parties , having previously formed an alliance to campaign for independence this was known as operasi komodo or 'operation komodo ' after the giant komodo lizard found in the eastern indonesian island of the same name many indonesian military figures held meetings with udt leaders , who made it plain that jakarta would not tolerate a fretilin-led administration in an independent east timor during the course of 1975 , portugal became increasingly detached from political developments in its colony , becoming embroiled in civil unrest and political crises , and more concerned with decolonisation in its african colonies of angola and mozambique than with portuguese timor many local leaders saw independence as unrealistic , and were open to discussions with jakarta over portuguese timor 's incorporation into the indonesian state on 11 august 1975 , the udt mounted a coup , in a bid to halt the increasing popularity of fretilin he was urged by fretilin to return and resume the decolonisation process , but he insisted that he was awaiting instructions from the government in lisbon , now increasingly uninterested in october 1975 , in the border town of balibo , two australian television crews ( the '' balibo five '' ) reporting on the conflict were killed by indonesian forces , after they witnessed indonesian incursions into portuguese timor an international east timor solidarity movement arose in response to the 1975 invasion of east timor by indonesia and the occupation that followed josé ramos-horta , later president of east timor , stated in a 2007 interview that the solidarity movement '' was instrumental moreover , according to declassified documents released by the national security archive ( nsa ) in december 2001 , usa gave its agreement to indonesia for the invasion the reason may be the existence of oil found in the waters between indonesia and australia unlike the portuguese , the indonesians favoured strong , direct rule , which was never accepted by the timorese people who were determined to preserve their culture and national identity by 1976 there were 35,000 indonesian troops in east timor a puppet provisional government of east timor was installed in mid-december , consisting of apodeti and udt leaders while indonesia introduced a civilian administration , the military remained in control aided by secret police and civilian timorese militia to crush dissent , reports of arrest , torture , and murder were numerous ongoing lobbying by the portuguese government also provided impetus after the massacre , the us congress voted to cut off funding for imet training of indonesian military personnel australian governments saw good relations and stability in indonesia ( australia 's largest neighbour ) as providing an important security buffer to australia 's north '' indonesia 's government refused but did announce that it would take three

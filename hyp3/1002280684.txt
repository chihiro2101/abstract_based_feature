in the early development of geology , efforts were made in a predominantly christian western society to reconcile biblical narratives of creation and the universal flood with new concepts about the processes which had formed the earth the discovery of other ancient flood myths was taken as explaining why the flood story was '' stated in scientific methods with surprising frequency among the greeks '' , an example being plutarch 's account of the ogygian flood the leading scientific proponent of catastrophism in the early eighteenth century was the french anatomist and paleontologist georges cuvier while he did speculate that the catastrophe responsible for the most recent extinctions in eurasia might have been the result of the inundation of low-lying areas by the sea , he did not make any reference to noah 's flood cuvier also believed that the stratigraphic record indicated that there had been several of these revolutions , which he viewed as recurring natural events , amid long intervals of stability during the history of life on earth by contrast in britain , where natural theology was influential during the early nineteenth century , a group of geologists including william buckland and robert jameson interpreted cuvier 's work differently as a result of the influence of jameson , buckland , and other advocates of natural theology , the nineteenth century debate over catastrophism took on much stronger religious overtones in britain than elsewhere in europe the geologist charles lyell built upon hutton 's ideas during the first half of 19th century and amassed observations in support of the uniformitarian idea that the earth 's features had been shaped by same geological processes that could be observed in the present acting gradually over an immense period of time lyell presented his ideas in the influential three volume work , principles of geology , published in the 1830s , which challenged theories about geological cataclysms proposed by proponents of catastrophism like cuvier and buckland over the past 25 years , a scientifically based catastrophism has gained wide acceptance with regard to certain events in the distant past today most geologists combine catastrophist and uniformitarianist standpoints , taking the view that earth 's history is a slow , gradual story punctuated by occasional natural catastrophic events that have affected earth and its inhabitants catastrophism ! man , myth and mayhem in ancient history and the sciences answers in creation - catastrophism article dictionary of the history of ideas : '' uniformitarianism and catastrophism ''

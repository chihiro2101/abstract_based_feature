in the early development of geology , efforts were made in a predominantly christian western society to reconcile biblical narratives of creation and the universal flood with new concepts about the processes which had formed the earth the discovery of other ancient flood myths was taken as explaining why the flood story was '' stated in scientific methods with surprising frequency among the greeks '' , an example being plutarch 's account of the ogygian flood the leading scientific proponent of catastrophism in the early eighteenth century was the french anatomist and paleontologist georges cuvier while he did speculate that the catastrophe responsible for the most recent extinctions in eurasia might have been the result of the inundation of low-lying areas by the sea , he did not make any reference to noah 's flood cuvier also believed that the stratigraphic record indicated that there had been several of these revolutions , which he viewed as recurring natural events , amid long intervals of stability during the history of life on earth by contrast in britain , where natural theology was influential during the early nineteenth century , a group of geologists including william buckland and robert jameson interpreted cuvier 's work differently uniformitarian explanations for the formation of sedimentary rock and an understanding of the immense stretch of geological time , or as the concept came to be known deep time , were found in the writing of james hutton , sometimes known as the father of geology , in the late 18th century the geologist charles lyell built upon hutton 's ideas during the first half of 19th century and amassed observations in support of the uniformitarian idea that the earth 's features had been shaped by same geological processes that could be observed in the present acting gradually over an immense period of time lyell presented his ideas in the influential three volume work , principles of geology , published in the 1830s , which challenged theories about geological cataclysms proposed by proponents of catastrophism like cuvier and buckland from around 1850 to 1980 , most geologists endorsed uniformitarianism ( '' the present is the key to the past '' ) and gradualism ( geologic change occurs slowly over long periods of time ) and rejected the idea that cataclysmic events such as earthquakes , volcano , or floods of vastly greater power than those observed at the present time , played any significant role in the formation of the earth 's surface some of the theories about catastrophism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were connected with religion and catastrophic origins were sometimes considered miracle rather than natural events since then , the debate about the extinction of the dinosaurs and other mass extinction events has centered on whether the extinction mechanism was the asteroid impact , widespread volcanism ( which occurred about the same time ) , or some other mechanism or combination

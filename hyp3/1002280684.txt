in the early development of geology , efforts were made in a predominantly christian western society to reconcile biblical narratives of creation and the universal flood with new concepts about the processes which had formed the earth . cuvier and the natural theologians the leading scientific proponent of catastrophism in the early eighteenth century was the french anatomist and paleontologist georges cuvier in fact cuvier , influenced by the ideas of the enlightenment and the intellectual climate of the french revolution , avoided religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings cuvier also believed that the stratigraphic record indicated that there had been several of these revolutions , which he viewed as recurring natural events , amid long intervals of stability during the history of life on earth by contrast in britain , where natural theology was influential during the early nineteenth century , a group of geologists including william buckland and robert jameson interpreted cuvier 's work differently uniformitarian explanations for the formation of sedimentary rock and an understanding of the immense stretch of geological time , or as the concept came to be known deep time , were found in the writing of james hutton , sometimes known as the father of geology , in the late 18th century lyell presented his ideas in the influential three volume work , principles of geology , published in the 1830s , which challenged theories about geological cataclysms proposed by proponents of catastrophism like cuvier and buckland from around 1850 to 1980 , most geologists endorsed uniformitarianism ( '' the present is the key to the past '' ) and gradualism ( geologic change occurs slowly over long periods of time ) and rejected the idea that cataclysmic events such as earthquakes , volcano , or floods of vastly greater power than those observed at the present time , played any significant role in the formation of the earth 's surface neocatastrophism is the explanation of sudden extinctions in the palaeontological record by high magnitude , low frequency events ( such as asteroid impacts , super-volcanic eruptions , supernova gamma ray bursts , etc over the past 25 years , a scientifically based catastrophism has gained wide acceptance with regard to certain events in the distant past the observation of the shoemaker-levy 9 cometary collision with jupiter illustrated that catastrophic events occur as natural events

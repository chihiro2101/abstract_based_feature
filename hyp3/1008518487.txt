the concept of a world chess champion started to emerge in the first half of the 19th century , and the phrase '' world champion '' appeared in 1845 from then onwards various players were acclaimed as world champions , but the first contest that was defined in advance as being for the world championship was the match between wilhelm steinitz and johannes zukertort in 1886 until 1948 world championship contests were arranged privately between the players between 1888 and 1948 various difficulties that arose in match negotiations led players to try to define agreed rules for matches , including the frequency of matches , how much or how little say the champion had in the conditions for a title match and what the stakes and division of the purse should be the first attempt by an external organization to manage the world championship was in 1887–1889 , but this experiment was not repeated however , in that year reigning champion kasparov and challenger short were so dissatisfied with fide 's arrangements for their match that they set up a breakaway organization the split in the world championship continued until world chess championship 2006 ; however , the compromises required in order to achieve reunification had effects that lasted until the 2010 match something resembling a world championship match was the la bourdonnais - mcdonnell chess matches in 1834 , in which la bourdonnais played a series of six matches – and 85 games – against the irishman alexander mcdonnell , with la bourdonnais winning a majority of the games '' the earliest recorded use of the term '' world champion '' was in 1845 , when howard staunton was described as '' the chess champion of england , or & nbsp ; similarly , the london 1851 chess tournament was described beforehand by some contemporary commentators as being for the world championship , but there is no mention afterwards in the tournament book by staunton '' the world 's great chess games '' , reuben fine , ( mckay , 1976 ) p.17 however , there is no evidence that he was widely acclaimed at the time as the world champion , although in 1893 henry bird retrospectively awarded the title to anderssen for his victory section '' progress of chess '' in anderssen was himself decisively defeated in an 1858 match against the american paul morphy ( 7-2 , 2 draws ) , after which morphy was toasted across the chess-playing world as the world chess champion afterward morphy 's retirement from chess , anderssen was again regarded as the world 's strongest active player , a reputation he reinforced by winning the strong london 1862 chess tournament this tournament established steinitz and zukertort as the best two players in the world , and led to a match between these two , the world chess championship 1886 , '' the centenary match , kasparov–karpov iii '' , raymond keene and david goodman , batsford 1986 , p.9 won by steinitz there is some debate over whether to date steinitz ' reign as world champion from his win over anderssen in 1866 , or from his win over zukertort in 1886 by this reckoning , the first world championship match was in 1886 , and steinitz was the first official world chess champion when he resumed negotiations with capablanca after world war i , lasker insisted on a similar clause that if lasker should resign the title after a date had been set for the match , capablanca should become world champion on 27 june 1920 lasker abdicated in favor of capablanca because of public criticisms of the terms for the match , naming capablanca as his successor ( american chess bulletin , july august 1920 ) the main points were : the champion must be prepared to defend his title once a year ; the match should be won by whichever player first won six or eight games ( the champion had the right to choose ) ; and the stake should be at least £1,000 ( about £

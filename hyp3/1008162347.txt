during much of the letterpress era , movable type was composed by hand for each page cast metal sorts were composed into words , then lines , then paragraphs , then pages of text and tightly bound together to make up a form , with all letter faces exactly the same '' height to paper '' , creating an even surface of type during typesetting , individual sorts are picked from a type case with the right hand , and set into a composing stick held in the left hand from left to right , and as viewed by the setter upside down as seen in the photo of the composing stick , a lower case ' q ' looks like a 'd ' , a lower case ' b ' looks like a ' p ' , a lower case ' p ' looks like a ' b ' and a lower case 'd ' looks like a ' q ' the diagram at right illustrates a cast metal sort : a face , b body or shank , c point size , 1 shoulder , 2 nick , 3 groove , 4 foot wooden printing sorts were in use for centuries in combination with metal type in order to extend the working life of type , and to account for the finite sorts in a case of type , copies of forms were cast when anticipating subsequent printings of a text , freeing the costly type for other work this was particularly prevalent in book and newspaper work where rotary presses required type forms to wrap an impression cylinder rather than set in the bed of a press still , hand composition and letterpress printing have not fallen completely out of use , and since the introduction of digital typesetting , it has seen a revival as an artisanal pursuit the time and effort required to manually compose the text led to several efforts in the 19th century to produce mechanical typesetting most of the successful systems involved the in-house casting of the type to be used , hence are termed '' hot metal '' typesetting the linotype machine , invented in 1884 , used a keyboard to assemble the casting matrices , and cast an entire line of type at a time ( hence its name ) thumb phototypesetting systems first appeared in the early 1960s and rapidly displaced continuous casting machines photosensitive paper was exposed to light through the negative film , resulting in a column of black type on white paper , or a galley the next generation of phototypesetting machines to emerge were those that generated characters on a cathode ray tube such machines could be '' driven online '' by a computer front-end system or took their data from magnetic tape ( webpage has a translation button ) character-by-character , computer-aided phototypesetting was , in turn , rapidly rendered obsolete in the 1980s by fully digital systems employing a raster image processor to render an entire page to a single high-resolution digital image , now known as imagesetting computerized typesetting was so rare that byte magazine ( comparing itself to '' the proverbial shoemaker 's children who went barefoot '' ) did not use any computers in production until its august 1979 issue used a compugraphics system for typesetting and page layout improvements in software and hardware , and rapidly lowering costs , popularized desktop publishing and enabled very fine control of typeset results much less expensively than the minicomputer dedicated systems image : ams euler sample.png right 200px thumb mathematical text typeset using tex and the ams euler font knuth at the end of the 1970s , is another widespread and powerful automated typesetting system that has set high standards , especially for typesetting mathematics gnu texmacs ( whose name is a combination of tex and emacs , although it is independent from both of these programs ) is a typesetting system which is at the same time a wysiwyg word processor

during much of the letterpress era , movable type was composed by hand for each page cast metal sorts were composed into words , then lines , then paragraphs , then pages of text and tightly bound together to make up a form , with all letter faces exactly the same '' height to paper '' , creating an even surface of type during typesetting , individual sorts are picked from a type case with the right hand , and set into a composing stick held in the left hand from left to right , and as viewed by the setter upside down the diagram at right illustrates a cast metal sort : a face , b body or shank , c point size , 1 shoulder , 2 nick , 3 groove , 4 foot in order to extend the working life of type , and to account for the finite sorts in a case of type , copies of forms were cast when anticipating subsequent printings of a text , freeing the costly type for other work this was particularly prevalent in book and newspaper work where rotary presses required type forms to wrap an impression cylinder rather than set in the bed of a press in this process , called stereotyping , the entire form is pressed into a fine matrix such as plaster of paris or papier mâché called a flong to create a positive , from which the stereotype form was electrotyped , cast of type metal still , hand composition and letterpress printing have not fallen completely out of use , and since the introduction of digital typesetting , it has seen a revival as an artisanal pursuit the time and effort required to manually compose the text led to several efforts in the 19th century to produce mechanical typesetting most of the successful systems involved the in-house casting of the type to be used , hence are termed '' hot metal '' typesetting the linotype machine , invented in 1884 , used a keyboard to assemble the casting matrices , and cast an entire line of type at a time ( hence its name ) in the monotype system , a keyboard was used to punched tape , which was then fed to control a casting machine thumb phototypesetting systems first appeared in the early 1960s and rapidly displaced continuous casting machines if the two lines were identical a bell rang and the machine produced a punched tape corresponding to the text photosensitive paper was exposed to light through the negative film , resulting in a column of black type on white paper , or a galley such machines could be '' driven online '' by a computer front-end system or took their data from magnetic tape ( webpage has a translation button ) character-by-character , computer-aided phototypesetting was , in turn , rapidly rendered obsolete in the 1980s by fully digital systems employing a raster image processor to render an entire page to a single high-resolution digital image , now known as imagesetting the minicomputer systems output columns of text on film for paste-up and eventually produced entire pages and signatures of 4 , 8 , 16 or more pages using imposition software on devices such as the israeli-made scitex dolev computerized typesetting was so rare that byte magazine ( comparing itself to '' the proverbial shoemaker 's children who went barefoot '' ) did not use any computers in production until its august 1979 issue used a compugraphics system for typesetting and page layout before the 1980s , practically all typesetting for publishers and advertisers was performed by specialist typesetting companies image : ams euler sample.png right 200px thumb mathematical text typeset using tex and the ams euler font metal type – for those who remember hot metal typesetting tex users group fundamentals of typesetting the lout document formatting system xml page at www.w3c.org sgml page at www.xml.org typeset-8 , the first low cost computerized type setting system 1960 era typesetting in the 1960 era

during much of the letterpress era , movable type was composed by hand for each page cast metal sorts were composed into words , then lines , then paragraphs , then pages of text and tightly bound together to make up a form , with all letter faces exactly the same '' height to paper '' , creating an even surface of type during typesetting , individual sorts are picked from a type case with the right hand , and set into a composing stick held in the left hand from left to right , and as viewed by the setter upside down as seen in the photo of the composing stick , a lower case ' q ' looks like a 'd ' , a lower case ' b ' looks like a ' p ' , a lower case ' p ' looks like a ' b ' and a lower case 'd ' looks like a ' q ' the diagram at right illustrates a cast metal sort : a face , b body or shank , c point size , 1 shoulder , 2 nick , 3 groove , 4 foot in order to extend the working life of type , and to account for the finite sorts in a case of type , copies of forms were cast when anticipating subsequent printings of a text , freeing the costly type for other work this was particularly prevalent in book and newspaper work where rotary presses required type forms to wrap an impression cylinder rather than set in the bed of a press the time and effort required to manually compose the text led to several efforts in the 19th century to produce mechanical typesetting most of the successful systems involved the in-house casting of the type to be used , hence are termed '' hot metal '' typesetting in the monotype system , a keyboard was used to punched tape , which was then fed to control a casting machine thumb phototypesetting systems first appeared in the early 1960s and rapidly displaced continuous casting machines the galley was then cut up and used to create a mechanical drawing or paste up of a whole page ( webpage has a translation button ) character-by-character , computer-aided phototypesetting was , in turn , rapidly rendered obsolete in the 1980s by fully digital systems employing a raster image processor to render an entire page to a single high-resolution digital image , now known as imagesetting the first commercially successful laser imagesetter , able to make use of a raster image processor was the monotype lasercomp the minicomputer systems output columns of text on film for paste-up and eventually produced entire pages and signatures of 4 , 8 , 16 or more pages using imposition software on devices such as the israeli-made scitex dolev the data stream used by these systems to drive page layout on printers and imagesetters , often proprietary or specific to a manufacturer or device , drove development of generalized printer control languages , such as adobe systems ' postscript and hewlett-packard 's pcl these companies performed keyboarding , editing and production of paper or film output , and formed a large component of the graphic arts industry thumb ibm created and inspired a family of typesetting languages with names that were derivatives of the word '' script '' glossary of university of waterloo computing chronology script/vs was a script variant developed at ibm in the 1980s script is still available from ibm as part of the document composition facility for the z/os operating system image : ams euler sample.png right 200px thumb mathematical text typeset using tex and the ams euler font gnu texmacs ( whose name is a combination of tex and emacs , although it is independent from both of these programs ) is a typesetting system which is at the same time a wysiwyg word processor

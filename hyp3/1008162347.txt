during much of the letterpress era , movable type was composed by hand for each page cast metal sorts were composed into words , then lines , then paragraphs , then pages of text and tightly bound together to make up a form , with all letter faces exactly the same '' height to paper '' , creating an even surface of type during typesetting , individual sorts are picked from a type case with the right hand , and set into a composing stick held in the left hand from left to right , and as viewed by the setter upside down in order to extend the working life of type , and to account for the finite sorts in a case of type , copies of forms were cast when anticipating subsequent printings of a text , freeing the costly type for other work still , hand composition and letterpress printing have not fallen completely out of use , and since the introduction of digital typesetting , it has seen a revival as an artisanal pursuit the time and effort required to manually compose the text led to several efforts in the 19th century to produce mechanical typesetting most of the successful systems involved the in-house casting of the type to be used , hence are termed '' hot metal '' typesetting the linotype machine , invented in 1884 , used a keyboard to assemble the casting matrices , and cast an entire line of type at a time ( hence its name ) the ludlow typograph involved hand-set matrices , but otherwise used hot metal thumb phototypesetting systems first appeared in the early 1960s and rapidly displaced continuous casting machines these devices consisted of glass or film disks or strips ( one per font ) that spun in front of a light source to selectively expose characters onto light-sensitive paper photosensitive paper was exposed to light through the negative film , resulting in a column of black type on white paper , or a galley the galley was then cut up and used to create a mechanical drawing or paste up of a whole page a large film negative of the page is shot and used to make plates for offset printing the next generation of phototypesetting machines to emerge were those that generated characters on a cathode ray tube the minicomputer systems output columns of text on film for paste-up and eventually produced entire pages and signatures of 4 , 8 , 16 or more pages using imposition software on devices such as the israeli-made scitex dolev computerized typesetting was so rare that byte magazine ( comparing itself to '' the proverbial shoemaker 's children who went barefoot '' ) did not use any computers in production until its august 1979 issue used a compugraphics system for typesetting and page layout the advent of postscript , supplemented by the pdf file format , provided a universal method of proofing designs and layouts , readable on major computers and operating systems the standard generalized markup language ( sgml ) was based upon ibm generalized markup language ( gml ) image : ams euler sample.png right 200px thumb mathematical text typeset using tex and the ams euler font knuth at the end of the 1970s , is another widespread and powerful automated typesetting system that has set high standards , especially for typesetting mathematics gnu texmacs ( whose name is a combination of tex and emacs , although it is independent from both of these programs ) is a typesetting system which is at the same time a wysiwyg word processor

during much of the letterpress era , movable type was composed by hand for each page cast metal sorts were composed into words , then lines , then paragraphs , then pages of text and tightly bound together to make up a form , with all letter faces exactly the same '' height to paper '' , creating an even surface of type during typesetting , individual sorts are picked from a type case with the right hand , and set into a composing stick held in the left hand from left to right , and as viewed by the setter upside down wooden printing sorts were in use for centuries in combination with metal type in order to extend the working life of type , and to account for the finite sorts in a case of type , copies of forms were cast when anticipating subsequent printings of a text , freeing the costly type for other work this was particularly prevalent in book and newspaper work where rotary presses required type forms to wrap an impression cylinder rather than set in the bed of a press in this process , called stereotyping , the entire form is pressed into a fine matrix such as plaster of paris or papier mâché called a flong to create a positive , from which the stereotype form was electrotyped , cast of type metal still , hand composition and letterpress printing have not fallen completely out of use , and since the introduction of digital typesetting , it has seen a revival as an artisanal pursuit the time and effort required to manually compose the text led to several efforts in the 19th century to produce mechanical typesetting while some , such as the paige compositor , met with limited success , by the end of the 19th century , several methods had been devised whereby an operator working a keyboard or other devices could produce the desired text most of the successful systems involved the in-house casting of the type to be used , hence are termed '' hot metal '' typesetting the linotype machine , invented in 1884 , used a keyboard to assemble the casting matrices , and cast an entire line of type at a time ( hence its name ) in the monotype system , a keyboard was used to punched tape , which was then fed to control a casting machine with the completion of a block of lines the typesetter fed the corresponding paper tapes into a phototypesetting device that mechanically set type outlines printed on glass sheets into place for exposure onto a negative film the next generation of phototypesetting machines to emerge were those that generated characters on a cathode ray tube such machines could be '' driven online '' by a computer front-end system or took their data from magnetic tape these companies performed keyboarding , editing and production of paper or film output , and formed a large component of the graphic arts industry the standard generalized markup language ( sgml ) was based upon ibm generalized markup language ( gml ) these products allow users to program their sgml/xml typesetting process with the help of scripting languages image : ams euler sample.png right 200px thumb mathematical text typeset using tex and the ams euler font these programs include scientific workplace and lyx , which are graphical/interactive editors ; texmacs , while being an independent typesetting system , can also be used as an aid for the preparation of tex documents through its export capability gnu texmacs ( whose name is a combination of tex and emacs , although it is independent from both of these programs ) is a typesetting system which is at the same time a wysiwyg word processor

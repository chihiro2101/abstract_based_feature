during much of the letterpress era , movable type was composed by hand for each page cast metal sorts were composed into words , then lines , then paragraphs , then pages of text and tightly bound together to make up a form , with all letter faces exactly the same '' height to paper '' , creating an even surface of type during typesetting , individual sorts are picked from a type case with the right hand , and set into a composing stick held in the left hand from left to right , and as viewed by the setter upside down as seen in the photo of the composing stick , a lower case ' q ' looks like a 'd ' , a lower case ' b ' looks like a ' p ' , a lower case ' p ' looks like a ' b ' and a lower case 'd ' looks like a ' q ' the diagram at right illustrates a cast metal sort : a face , b body or shank , c point size , 1 shoulder , 2 nick , 3 groove , 4 foot wooden printing sorts were in use for centuries in combination with metal type in order to extend the working life of type , and to account for the finite sorts in a case of type , copies of forms were cast when anticipating subsequent printings of a text , freeing the costly type for other work advances such as the typewriter and computer would push the state of the art even farther ahead still , hand composition and letterpress printing have not fallen completely out of use , and since the introduction of digital typesetting , it has seen a revival as an artisanal pursuit while some , such as the paige compositor , met with limited success , by the end of the 19th century , several methods had been devised whereby an operator working a keyboard or other devices could produce the desired text most of the successful systems involved the in-house casting of the type to be used , hence are termed '' hot metal '' typesetting by the early 20th century , the various systems were nearly universal in large newspapers and publishing houses thumb phototypesetting systems first appeared in the early 1960s and rapidly displaced continuous casting machines these devices consisted of glass or film disks or strips ( one per font ) that spun in front of a light source to selectively expose characters onto light-sensitive paper one of the earliest electronic photocomposition systems was introduced by fairchild semiconductor if the two lines were identical a bell rang and the machine produced a punched tape corresponding to the text photosensitive paper was exposed to light through the negative film , resulting in a column of black type on white paper , or a galley ( webpage has a translation button ) character-by-character , computer-aided phototypesetting was , in turn , rapidly rendered obsolete in the 1980s by fully digital systems employing a raster image processor to render an entire page to a single high-resolution digital image , now known as imagesetting the first commercially successful laser imagesetter , able to make use of a raster image processor was the monotype lasercomp by the year 2000 , this industry segment had shrunk because publishers were now capable of integrating typesetting and graphic design on their own in-house computers image : ams euler sample.png right 200px thumb mathematical text typeset using tex and the ams euler font gnu texmacs ( whose name is a combination of tex and emacs , although it is independent from both of these programs ) is a typesetting system which is at the same time a wysiwyg word processor

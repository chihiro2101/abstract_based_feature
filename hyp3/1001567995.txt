for example , if a group g is finitely generated and the order of each element of g is a divisor of 4 , then g is finite this provides a solution for the restricted burnside problem for the case of prime exponent ( later , in 1989 , efim zelmanov was able to solve the restricted burnside problem for an arbitrary exponent in 1968 , pyotr novikov and sergei adian supplied a negative solution to the bounded exponent problem for all odd exponents larger than 4381 a group g is called periodic if every element has finite order ; in other words , for each g in g , there exists some positive integer n such that g n 1 however , the orders of the elements of this group are not a priori bounded by a single constant part of the difficulty with the general burnside problem is that the requirements of being finitely generated and periodic give very little information about the possible structure of a group a group with this property is said to be periodic with bounded exponent n , or just a group with exponent n burnside problem for groups with bounded exponent asks : burnside problem if g is a finitely generated group with exponent n , is g necessarily finite ? it turns out that this problem can be restated as a question about the finiteness of groups in a particular family for which positive integers m , n is the free burnside group b ( m , n ) finite ? the full solution to burnside problem in this form is not known in the case of the odd exponent , all finite subgroups of the free burnside groups were shown to be cyclic groups every finite group of exponent n with m generators is a homomorphic image of b 0 ( m , n ) the restricted burnside problem then asks whether b 0 ( m , n ) is a finite group

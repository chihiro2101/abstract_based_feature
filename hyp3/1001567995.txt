for example , if a group g is finitely generated and the order of each element of g is a divisor of 4 , then g is finite this provides a solution for the restricted burnside problem for the case of prime exponent ( later , in 1989 , efim zelmanov was able to solve the restricted burnside problem for an arbitrary exponent in 1964 , golod and shafarevich constructed an infinite group of burnside type without assuming that all elements have uniformly bounded order later joint work of ol'shanskii and ivanov established a negative solution to an analogue of burnside problem for hyperbolic groups , provided the exponent is sufficiently large there exist easily defined groups such as the pr√ºfer group which are infinite periodic groups ; but the latter group can not be finitely generated a group with this property is said to be periodic with bounded exponent n , or just a group with exponent n burnside problem for groups with bounded exponent asks : burnside problem if g is a finitely generated group with exponent n , is g necessarily finite ? it turns out that this problem can be restated as a question about the finiteness of groups in a particular family the free burnside group of rank m and exponent n , denoted b ( m , n ) , is a group with m distinguished generators x 1 , in the language of group presentations , free burnside group b ( m , n ) has m generators x 1 , thus if g is any finitely generated group of exponent n , then g is a homomorphic image of b ( m , n ) , where m is the number of generators of g the restricted burnside problem then asks whether b 0 ( m , n ) is a finite group kostrikin during the 1950s , prior to the negative solution of the general burnside problem

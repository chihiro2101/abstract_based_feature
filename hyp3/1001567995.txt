for example , if a group g is finitely generated and the order of each element of g is a divisor of 4 , then g is finite this provides a solution for the restricted burnside problem for the case of prime exponent ( later , in 1989 , efim zelmanov was able to solve the restricted burnside problem for an arbitrary exponent in 1964 , golod and shafarevich constructed an infinite group of burnside type without assuming that all elements have uniformly bounded order later joint work of ol'shanskii and ivanov established a negative solution to an analogue of burnside problem for hyperbolic groups , provided the exponent is sufficiently large if g is a finitely generated , periodic group , then is g necessarily finite ? this question was answered in the negative in 1964 by evgeny golod and igor shafarevich , who gave an example of an infinite p-group that is finitely generated ( see golodâ€“shafarevich theorem ) however , the orders of the elements of this group are not a priori bounded by a single constant consider a periodic group g with the additional property that there exists a least integer n such that for all g in g , g n 1 a group with this property is said to be periodic with bounded exponent n , or just a group with exponent n burnside problem for groups with bounded exponent asks : burnside problem if g is a finitely generated group with exponent n , is g necessarily finite ? it turns out that this problem can be restated as a question about the finiteness of groups in a particular family for which positive integers m , n is the free burnside group b ( m , n ) finite ? the full solution to burnside problem in this form is not known one can therefore define a group b 0 ( m , n ) to be the factor group b ( m , n ) /m the restricted burnside problem then asks whether b 0 ( m , n ) is a finite group

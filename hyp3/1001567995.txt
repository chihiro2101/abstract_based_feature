for example , if a group g is finitely generated and the order of each element of g is a divisor of 4 , then g is finite this provides a solution for the restricted burnside problem for the case of prime exponent ( later , in 1989 , efim zelmanov was able to solve the restricted burnside problem for an arbitrary exponent nevertheless , the general answer to the burnside problem turned out to be negative in 1964 , golod and shafarevich constructed an infinite group of burnside type without assuming that all elements have uniformly bounded order a group with this property is said to be periodic with bounded exponent n , or just a group with exponent n burnside problem for groups with bounded exponent asks : burnside problem if g is a finitely generated group with exponent n , is g necessarily finite ? it turns out that this problem can be restated as a question about the finiteness of groups in a particular family the free burnside group of rank m and exponent n , denoted b ( m , n ) , is a group with m distinguished generators x 1 , in the language of group presentations , free burnside group b ( m , n ) has m generators x 1 , , x m , and any group g with m generators of exponent n is obtained from it by imposing additional relations for which positive integers m , n is the free burnside group b ( m , n ) finite ? the full solution to burnside problem in this form is not known using a complicated combinatorial argument , they demonstrated that for every odd number n with n > 4381 , there exist infinite , finitely generated groups of exponent n the restricted burnside problem then asks whether b 0 ( m , n ) is a finite group

for example , if a group g is finitely generated and the order of each element of g is a divisor of 4 , then g is finite kostrikin was able to prove in 1958 that among the finite groups with a given number of generators and a given prime exponent , there exists a largest one this provides a solution for the restricted burnside problem for the case of prime exponent in 1964 , golod and shafarevich constructed an infinite group of burnside type without assuming that all elements have uniformly bounded order a group g is called periodic if every element has finite order ; in other words , for each g in g , there exists some positive integer n such that g n 1 clearly , every finite group is periodic there exist easily defined groups such as the pr√ºfer group which are infinite periodic groups ; but the latter group can not be finitely generated part of the difficulty with the general burnside problem is that the requirements of being finitely generated and periodic give very little information about the possible structure of a group a group with this property is said to be periodic with bounded exponent n , or just a group with exponent n burnside problem for groups with bounded exponent asks : burnside problem the free burnside group of rank m and exponent n , denoted b ( m , n ) , is a group with m distinguished generators x 1 , for which positive integers m , n is the free burnside group b ( m , n ) finite ? the full solution to burnside problem in this form is not known in the case of the odd exponent , all finite subgroups of the free burnside groups were shown to be cyclic groups the restricted burnside problem then asks whether b 0 ( m , n ) is a finite group

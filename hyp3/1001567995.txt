kostrikin was able to prove in 1958 that among the finite groups with a given number of generators and a given prime exponent , there exists a largest one this provides a solution for the restricted burnside problem for the case of prime exponent ( later , in 1989 , efim zelmanov was able to solve the restricted burnside problem for an arbitrary exponent in 1964 , golod and shafarevich constructed an infinite group of burnside type without assuming that all elements have uniformly bounded order there exist easily defined groups such as the pr√ºfer group which are infinite periodic groups ; but the latter group can not be finitely generated part of the difficulty with the general burnside problem is that the requirements of being finitely generated and periodic give very little information about the possible structure of a group a group with this property is said to be periodic with bounded exponent n , or just a group with exponent n burnside problem for groups with bounded exponent asks : burnside problem if g is a finitely generated group with exponent n , is g necessarily finite ? it turns out that this problem can be restated as a question about the finiteness of groups in a particular family the free burnside group of rank m and exponent n , denoted b ( m , n ) , is a group with m distinguished generators x 1 , in the language of group presentations , free burnside group b ( m , n ) has m generators x 1 , in the case of the odd exponent , all finite subgroups of the free burnside groups were shown to be cyclic groups every finite group of exponent n with m generators is a homomorphic image of b 0 ( m , n ) the restricted burnside problem then asks whether b 0 ( m , n ) is a finite group

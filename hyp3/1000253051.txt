2 : shell and tube heat exchanger , 2-pass tube side ( 1–2 crossflow ) image : heat_exc_2-2.png fig in parallel-flow heat exchangers , the two fluids enter the exchanger at the same end , and travel in parallel to one another to the other side in counter-flow heat exchangers the fluids enter the exchanger from opposite ends the driving temperature across the heat transfer surface varies with position , but an appropriate mean temperature can be defined in most simple systems this is the '' log mean temperature difference '' ( lmtd ) however , since double pipe heat exchangers are simple , they are used to teach heat exchanger design basics to students as the fundamental rules for all heat exchangers are the same 1.double-pipe heat exchanger ( a ) when the other fluid flows into the annular gap between two tubes , one fluid flows through the smaller pipe the flow may be a current flow or parallel flow in a double pipe heat exchanger ( c ) counter flow , where at opposite ends , hot and cold fluids join , flow in the opposite direction and exit at opposite ends if this is done under comparable conditions , more heat is transferred to the counter-flow device than to the parallel flow heat exchanger owing to the large temperature differential arising from the high thermal voltage , the temperature profiles of the two heat exchangers display two significant disadvantages in the parallel-flow design which indicates that the partnership is a distinct disadvantage if it is intended a design is to increase the cold fluid temperature where two fluids are expected to be taken to exactly the same temperature , the parallel flow configuration is beneficial 2.shell-and-tube heat exchanger the main constituents of this type of heat exchanger seem to be the tube box , shell , the front rear end headers , and baffles or fins the baffles are used to support the tubes , direct the fluid flow to the tubes in an approximately natural manner , and maximize the turbulence of the shell fluid 3.plate heat exchanger a plate heat exchanger contains an amount of thin shaped heat transfer plates bundled together a gasket plate heat exchanger has a heat region from corrugated plates the gasket function as seal between plates and they are located between frame and pressure plates fluid flows in a counter current direction throughout the heat exchanger this helps to prevent stagnant area that can cause accumulation of unwanted material on solid surfaces 4.condensers and boilers heat exchangers using a two-phase heat transfer system are condensers , boilers and evaporators to prevent a decrease in pressure in the movement of steam from the turbine to condenser , the condenser unit is placed underneath and connected to the turbine the word steam generator was regularly used to describe a boiler unit where a hot liquid stream is the source of heat rather than the combustion products depending on the dimensions and configurations the boilers are manufactured several boilers are only able to produce hot fluid while on the other hand the others are manufactured for steam production shell and tube heat exchanger thumb shell and tube heat exchangers consist of a series of tubes which contain fluid that must be either heated or cooled shell and tube heat exchangers are typically used for high-pressure applications ( with pressures greater than 30 bar and temperatures greater than 260 & nbsp ; °c ) this is because the shell and tube heat exchangers are robust due to their shape the tubes may be straight or bent in the shape of a u , called u-tubes tube diameter : using a small tube diameter makes the heat exchanger both economical and compact thus to determine the tube diameter , the available space , cost and fouling nature of the fluids must be considered tube pitch : when designing the tubes , it is practical to ensure that the tube pitch ( i.e this is mainly used for heating or cooling with high-viscosity products , crystallization processes , evaporation and high-fouling applications in chemical plants and refineries , reboilers used to heat incoming feed for distillation towers are often heat exchangers direct contact heat exchangers _1 is known as the log mean temperature difference , and is a measure of the effectiveness of the heat exchanger in transferring heat energy

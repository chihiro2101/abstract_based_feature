°c ) thus to determine the tube diameter , the available space , cost and fouling nature of the fluids must be considered thus , typically there is an aim to make the heat exchanger as long as physically possible whilst not exceeding production capabilities tube corrugation : this type of tubes , mainly used for the inner tubes , increases the turbulence of the fluids and the effect is very important in the heat transfer giving a better performance for thermo economic optimization it is suggested that the baffles be spaced no closer than 20 % of the shell 's inner diameter tubes & fins design : in application to cool air with shell-and-tube technology ( such as intercooler / charge air cooler for combustion engines ) , the difference in heat transfer between air and cold fluid can be such that there is a need to increase heat transfer area on air side another type of heat exchanger is the plate heat exchanger a fourth type of heat exchanger uses an intermediate fluid or solid store to hold heat , which is then moved to the other side of the heat exchanger to be released another type of heat exchanger is called '' dynamic scraped surface heat exchanger '' thumb thumb in addition to heating up or cooling down fluids in just a single phase , heat exchangers can be used either to heat a liquid to evaporate ( or boil ) it or used as condensers to cool a vapor and condense it to a liquid in chemical plants and refineries , reboilers used to heat incoming feed for distillation towers are often heat exchangers this change of phase effectively acts as a buffer because it occurs at a constant temperature but still allows for the heat exchanger to accept additional heat such types of heat exchangers are used predominantly in air conditioning , humidification , industrial hot water heating , water cooling and condensing plants

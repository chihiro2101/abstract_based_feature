complex eyes can distinguish shapes and colours the visual fields of many organisms , especially predators , involve large areas of binocular vision to improve depth perception in other organisms , eyes are located so as to maximise the field of view , such as in rabbits and horses , which have monocular vision the last common ancestor of animals possessed the biochemical toolkit necessary for vision , and more advanced eyes have evolved in 96 % of animal species in six of the ~35 main phyla in most vertebrates and some molluscs , the eye works by allowing light to enter and project onto a light-sensitive layer of cells at the end of the eye , known as the retina the cone cells ( for colour ) and the rod cells ( for low-light contrasts ) in the retina detect and convert light into neural signals for vision the visual signals are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve compound eyes are very sensitive to motion some arthropods , including many strepsiptera , have compound eyes of only a few facets , each with a retina capable of creating an image , creating vision with each eye viewing a different thing , a fused image from all the eyes is produced in the brain , providing very different , high-resolution images possessing detailed hyperspectral colour vision , the mantis shrimp has been reported to have the world 's most complex colour vision system trilobites , which are now extinct , had unique compound eyes they used clear calcite crystals to form the lenses of their eyes in this , they differ from most other arthropods , which have soft eyes the number of lenses in such an eye varied ; however , some trilobites had only one , and some had thousands of lenses in one eye in contrast to compound eyes , simple eyes are those that have a single lens for example , jumping spiders have a large pair of simple eyes with a narrow field of view , supported by an array of other , smaller eyes for peripheral vision they do have photosensitive cells , but no lens and no other means of projecting an image onto these cells in organisms dwelling near deep-sea vents , compound eyes have been secondarily simplified and adapted to see the infrared produced by the hot vents—in this way the bearers can avoid being boiled alive the only limitations specific to eye types are that of resolution—the physics of compound eyes prevents them from achieving a resolution better than 1° also , superposition eyes can achieve greater sensitivity than apposition eyes , so are better suited to dark-dwelling creatures these two groups are not monophyletic ; the cnidaria also possess cilliated cells , and some gastropods , as well as some annelids possess both some organisms have photosensitive cells that do nothing but detect whether the surroundings are light or dark , which is sufficient for the entrainment of circadian rhythms found in about 85 % of phyla , these basic forms were probably the precursors to more advanced types of '' simple eyes '' crotalinae have developed pits that function as eyes by sensing thermal infra-red radiation , in addition to their optical wavelength eyes like those of other vertebrates ( see infrared sensing in snakes ) this also allows a larger aperture for a given sharpness of image , allowing more light to enter the lens ; and a flatter lens , reducing spherical aberration no extant aquatic organisms possess homogeneous lenses ; presumably the evolutionary pressure for a heterogeneous lens is great enough for this stage to be quickly '' outgrown '' to minimise the effect of eye motion while the animal moves , most such eyes have stabilising eye muscles focusing the image would also cause the sun 's image to be focused on a few receptors , with the possibility of damage under the intense light ; shielding the receptors would block out some light and thus reduce their sensitivity hence creatures that have returned to the water—penguins and seals , for example—lose their highly curved cornea and return to lens-based vision an alternative to a lens is to line the inside of the eye with '' mirrors '' , and reflect the image to focus at a central point the nature of these eyes means that if one were to peer into the pupil of an eye , one would see the same image that the organism would see , reflected back out some larger organisms , such as scallops , also use reflector eyes each of the two eyes of a spookfish collects light from both above and below ; the light coming from above is focused by a lens , while that coming from below , by a curved mirror composed of many layers of small reflective plates made of guanine crystals compared with simple eyes , compound eyes possess a very large view angle , and can detect fast movement and , in some cases , the polarisation of light to see with a resolution comparable to our simple eyes , humans would require very large compound eyes , around in radius compound eyes fall into two groups : apposition eyes , which form multiple inverted images , and superposition eyes , which form a single erect image apposition eyes are the most common form of eyes and are presumably the ancestral form of compound eyes the typical apposition eye has a lens focusing light from one direction on the rhabdom , while light from other directions is absorbed by the dark wall of the ommatidium the superposition eye is divided into three types : refracting , reflecting and parabolic superposition the refracting superposition eye has a gap between the lens and the rhabdom , and no side wall the result is an image at half the radius of the eye , which is where the tips of the rhabdoms are long-bodied decapoda such as shrimp , prawns , crayfish and lobsters are alone in having reflecting superposition eyes , which also have a transparent gap but use corner mirrors instead of lenses this eye type functions by refracting light , then using a parabolic mirror to focus the image ; it combines features of superposition and apposition eyes several of these eyelets together form the strepsipteran compound eye , which is similar to the 'schizochroal ' compound eyes of some trilobites in organisms with compound eyes , it is the number of ommatidia rather than ganglia that reflects the region of highest data acquisition it is often measured in cycles per degree ( cpd ) , which measures an angular resolution , or how much an eye can differentiate one object from another in terms of visual angles a horse has higher acuity through most of the visual field of its eyes than a human has , but does not match the high acuity of the human eye 's central fovea region they may have been expressed in ciliary cells of larval eyes , which were subsequently resorbed into the brain on metamorphosis to the adult form

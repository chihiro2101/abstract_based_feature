complex eyes can distinguish shapes and colours in other organisms , eyes are located so as to maximise the field of view , such as in rabbits and horses , which have monocular vision the last common ancestor of animals possessed the biochemical toolkit necessary for vision , and more advanced eyes have evolved in 96 % of animal species in six of the ~35 main phyla in most vertebrates and some molluscs , the eye works by allowing light to enter and project onto a light-sensitive layer of cells at the end of the eye , known as the retina the cone cells ( for colour ) and the rod cells ( for low-light contrasts ) in the retina detect and convert light into neural signals for vision the eyes of most cephalopods , fish , amphibians and snakes have fixed lens shapes , and focusing vision is achieved by telescoping the lens—similar to how a camera focuses some eyes have up to 28,000 such sensors , which are arranged hexagonally , and which can give a full 360° field of vision some arthropods , including many strepsiptera , have compound eyes of only a few facets , each with a retina capable of creating an image , creating vision with each eye viewing a different thing , a fused image from all the eyes is produced in the brain , providing very different , high-resolution images the number of lenses in such an eye varied ; however , some trilobites had only one , and some had thousands of lenses in one eye for example , jumping spiders have a large pair of simple eyes with a narrow field of view , supported by an array of other , smaller eyes for peripheral vision some of the simplest eyes , called ocelli , can be found in animals like some of the snails , which can not actually '' see '' in the normal sense eye types can be categorised into '' simple eyes '' , with one concave photoreceptive surface , and '' compound eyes '' , which comprise a number of individual lenses laid out on a convex surface note that '' simple '' does not imply a reduced level of complexity or acuity also , superposition eyes can achieve greater sensitivity than apposition eyes , so are better suited to dark-dwelling creatures eyes also fall into two groups on the basis of their photoreceptor 's cellular construction , with the photoreceptor cells either being cilliated ( as in the vertebrates ) or rhabdomeric some organisms have photosensitive cells that do nothing but detect whether the surroundings are light or dark , which is sufficient for the entrainment of circadian rhythms these are not considered eyes because they lack enough structure to be considered an organ , and do not produce an image simple eyes are rather ubiquitous , and lens-bearing eyes have evolved at least seven times in vertebrates , cephalopods , annelids , crustaceans and cubozoa pit eyes , also known as stemma , are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angles of light that enters and affects the eye-spot , to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light the main difference is that photoreceptors are g protein-coupled receptor but trp are ion channels such a non-homogeneous lens is necessary for the focal length to drop from about 4 times the lens radius , to 2.5 radii heterogeneous eyes have evolved at least nine times : four or more times in gastropods , once in the copepods , once in the annelids , once in the cephalopods , and once in the chitons , which have aragonite lenses this eye creates an image that is sharp enough that motion of the eye can cause significant blurring the ocelli of insects bear a simple lens , but their focal point usually lies behind the retina ; consequently , those ca n't form a sharp image another copepod , copilia , has two lenses in each eye , arranged like those in a telescope multiple lenses are seen in some hunters such as eagles and jumping spiders , which have a refractive cornea : these have a negative lens , enlarging the observed image by up to 50 % over the receptor cells , thus increasing their optical resolution in refractive corneas , the lens tissue is corrected with inhomogeneous lens material ( see luneburg lens ) , or with an aspheric shape the nature of these eyes means that if one were to peer into the pupil of an eye , one would see the same image that the organism would see , reflected back out a compound eye may consist of thousands of individual photoreceptor units or ommatidia ( ommatidium , singular ) compared with simple eyes , compound eyes possess a very large view angle , and can detect fast movement and , in some cases , the polarisation of light compound eyes fall into two groups : apposition eyes , which form multiple inverted images , and superposition eyes , which form a single erect image compound eyes in arthropods grow at their margins by the addition of new ommatidia apposition eyes are the most common form of eyes and are presumably the ancestral form of compound eyes ( some caterpillars appear to have evolved compound eyes from simple eyes in the opposite fashion the superposition eye is divided into three types : refracting , reflecting and parabolic superposition the refracting superposition eye has a gap between the lens and the rhabdom , and no side wall each lens takes light at an angle to its axis and reflects it to the same angle on the other side another kind of compound eye , found in males of order strepsiptera , employs a series of simple eyes—eyes having one opening that provides light for an entire image-forming retina because each eyelet is a simple eye , it produces an inverted image ; those images are combined in the brain to form one unified image because the aperture of an eyelet is larger than the facets of a compound eye , this arrangement allows vision under low light levels the black spot that can be seen on the compound eyes of such insects , which always seems to look directly at the observer , is called a pseudopupil this occurs because the ommatidia which one observes '' head-on '' ( along their optical axis ) absorb the incident light , while those to one side reflect it this projects an upright image on a specialised retina this type of eye consists of a cluster of numerous ommatidia on each side of the head , organised in a way that resembles a true compound eye the tube feet of sea urchins contain photoreceptor proteins , which together act as a compound eye ; they lack screening pigments , but can detect the directionality of light by the shadow cast by its opaque body the evolution of eyes : where do lenses come from ? karger gazette 64 : '' the eye in focus '' the highest such number that the eye can resolve as stripes , or distinguish from a grey block , is then the measurement of visual acuity of the eye the eyes of vertebrates usually contain ciliary cells with c-opsins , and ( bilaterian ) invertebrates have rhabdomeric cells in the eye with r-opsins

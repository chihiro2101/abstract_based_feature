the visual fields of many organisms , especially predators , involve large areas of binocular vision to improve depth perception in other organisms , eyes are located so as to maximise the field of view , such as in rabbits and horses , which have monocular vision the last common ancestor of animals possessed the biochemical toolkit necessary for vision , and more advanced eyes have evolved in 96 % of animal species in six of the ~35 main phyla in most vertebrates and some molluscs , the eye works by allowing light to enter and project onto a light-sensitive layer of cells at the end of the eye , known as the retina the cone cells ( for colour ) and the rod cells ( for low-light contrasts ) in the retina detect and convert light into neural signals for vision the visual signals are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve the eyes of most cephalopods , fish , amphibians and snakes have fixed lens shapes , and focusing vision is achieved by telescoping the lens—similar to how a camera focuses some arthropods , including many strepsiptera , have compound eyes of only a few facets , each with a retina capable of creating an image , creating vision with each eye viewing a different thing , a fused image from all the eyes is produced in the brain , providing very different , high-resolution images trilobites , which are now extinct , had unique compound eyes in contrast to compound eyes , simple eyes are those that have a single lens for example , jumping spiders have a large pair of simple eyes with a narrow field of view , supported by an array of other , smaller eyes for peripheral vision eye types can be categorised into '' simple eyes '' , with one concave photoreceptive surface , and '' compound eyes '' , which comprise a number of individual lenses laid out on a convex surface indeed , any eye type can be adapted for almost any behaviour or environment the only limitations specific to eye types are that of resolution—the physics of compound eyes prevents them from achieving a resolution better than 1° also , superposition eyes can achieve greater sensitivity than apposition eyes , so are better suited to dark-dwelling creatures eyes also fall into two groups on the basis of their photoreceptor 's cellular construction , with the photoreceptor cells either being cilliated ( as in the vertebrates ) or rhabdomeric these two groups are not monophyletic ; the cnidaria also possess cilliated cells , and some gastropods , as well as some annelids possess both pit eyes , also known as stemma , are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angles of light that enters and affects the eye-spot , to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light the directionality can be improved by reducing the size of the aperture , by incorporating a reflective layer behind the receptor cells , or by filling the pit with a refractile material the most basic form , seen in some gastropods and annelids , consists of a lens of one refractive index this also allows a larger aperture for a given sharpness of image , allowing more light to enter the lens ; and a flatter lens , reducing spherical aberration such a non-homogeneous lens is necessary for the focal length to drop from about 4 times the lens radius , to 2.5 radii to minimise the effect of eye motion while the animal moves , most such eyes have stabilising eye muscles some marine organisms bear more than one lens ; for instance the copepod pontella has three multiple lenses are seen in some hunters such as eagles and jumping spiders , which have a refractive cornea : these have a negative lens , enlarging the observed image by up to 50 % over the receptor cells , thus increasing their optical resolution thus , animals that have evolved with a wide field-of-view often have eyes that make use of an inhomogeneous lens an alternative solution , borne by some divers , is to have a very strongly focusing cornea an alternative to a lens is to line the inside of the eye with '' mirrors '' , and reflect the image to focus at a central point some larger organisms , such as scallops , also use reflector eyes each of the two eyes of a spookfish collects light from both above and below ; the light coming from above is focused by a lens , while that coming from below , by a curved mirror composed of many layers of small reflective plates made of guanine crystals a compound eye may consist of thousands of individual photoreceptor units or ommatidia ( ommatidium , singular ) compared with simple eyes , compound eyes possess a very large view angle , and can detect fast movement and , in some cases , the polarisation of light because the individual lenses are so small , the effects of diffraction impose a limit on the possible resolution that can be obtained ( assuming that they do not function as phased arrays ) to see with a resolution comparable to our simple eyes , humans would require very large compound eyes , around in radius compound eyes fall into two groups : apposition eyes , which form multiple inverted images , and superposition eyes , which form a single erect image compound eyes are common in arthropods , annelids and some bivalved molluscs compound eyes in arthropods grow at their margins by the addition of new ommatidia this type of compound eye , for which a minimal size exists below which effective superposition can not occur , is normally found in nocturnal insects , because it can create images up to 1000 times brighter than equivalent apposition eyes , though at the cost of reduced resolution in the parabolic superposition compound eye type , seen in arthropods such as mayfly , the parabolic surfaces of the inside of each facet focus light from a reflector to a sensor array this eye type functions by refracting light , then using a parabolic mirror to focus the image ; it combines features of superposition and apposition eyes another kind of compound eye , found in males of order strepsiptera , employs a series of simple eyes—eyes having one opening that provides light for an entire image-forming retina several of these eyelets together form the strepsipteran compound eye , which is similar to the 'schizochroal ' compound eyes of some trilobites the flattening allows more ommatidia to receive light from a spot and therefore higher resolution some insects have a so-called single lens compound eye , a transitional type which is something between a superposition type of the multi-lens compound eye and the single lens eye found in animals with simple eyes eyes can be the most visible parts of organisms , and this can act as a pressure on organisms to have more transparent eyes at the cost of function compound eyes have a much lower acuity than vertebrate eyes the eyes of vertebrates usually contain ciliary cells with c-opsins , and ( bilaterian ) invertebrates have rhabdomeric cells in the eye with r-opsins

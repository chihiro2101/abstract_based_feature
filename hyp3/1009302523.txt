the visual fields of many organisms , especially predators , involve large areas of binocular vision to improve depth perception in other organisms , eyes are located so as to maximise the field of view , such as in rabbits and horses , which have monocular vision the last common ancestor of animals possessed the biochemical toolkit necessary for vision , and more advanced eyes have evolved in 96 % of animal species in six of the ~35 main phyla in most vertebrates and some molluscs , the eye works by allowing light to enter and project onto a light-sensitive layer of cells at the end of the eye , known as the retina the cone cells ( for colour ) and the rod cells ( for low-light contrasts ) in the retina detect and convert light into neural signals for vision the eyes of most cephalopods , fish , amphibians and snakes have fixed lens shapes , and focusing vision is achieved by telescoping the lens—similar to how a camera focuses some arthropods , including many strepsiptera , have compound eyes of only a few facets , each with a retina capable of creating an image , creating vision with each eye viewing a different thing , a fused image from all the eyes is produced in the brain , providing very different , high-resolution images possessing detailed hyperspectral colour vision , the mantis shrimp has been reported to have the world 's most complex colour vision system the number of lenses in such an eye varied ; however , some trilobites had only one , and some had thousands of lenses in one eye for example , jumping spiders have a large pair of simple eyes with a narrow field of view , supported by an array of other , smaller eyes for peripheral vision some of the simplest eyes , called ocelli , can be found in animals like some of the snails , which can not actually '' see '' in the normal sense there are ten different eye layouts—indeed every technological method of capturing an optical image commonly used by human beings , with the exceptions of zoom and fresnel lenses , occur in nature eye types can be categorised into '' simple eyes '' , with one concave photoreceptive surface , and '' compound eyes '' , which comprise a number of individual lenses laid out on a convex surface also , superposition eyes can achieve greater sensitivity than apposition eyes , so are better suited to dark-dwelling creatures eyes also fall into two groups on the basis of their photoreceptor 's cellular construction , with the photoreceptor cells either being cilliated ( as in the vertebrates ) or rhabdomeric simple eyes are rather ubiquitous , and lens-bearing eyes have evolved at least seven times in vertebrates , cephalopods , annelids , crustaceans and cubozoa the directionality can be improved by reducing the size of the aperture , by incorporating a reflective layer behind the receptor cells , or by filling the pit with a refractile material crotalinae have developed pits that function as eyes by sensing thermal infra-red radiation , in addition to their optical wavelength eyes like those of other vertebrates ( see infrared sensing in snakes ) the most basic form , seen in some gastropods and annelids , consists of a lens of one refractive index a far sharper image can be obtained using materials with a high refractive index , decreasing to the edges ; this decreases the focal length and thus allows a sharp image to form on the retina such a non-homogeneous lens is necessary for the focal length to drop from about 4 times the lens radius , to 2.5 radii this eye creates an image that is sharp enough that motion of the eye can cause significant blurring the ocelli of insects bear a simple lens , but their focal point usually lies behind the retina ; consequently , those ca n't form a sharp image focusing the image would also cause the sun 's image to be focused on a few receptors , with the possibility of damage under the intense light ; shielding the receptors would block out some light and thus reduce their sensitivity another copepod , copilia , has two lenses in each eye , arranged like those in a telescope in refractive corneas , the lens tissue is corrected with inhomogeneous lens material ( see luneburg lens ) , or with an aspheric shape flattening the lens has a disadvantage ; the quality of vision is diminished away from the main line of focus thus , animals that have evolved with a wide field-of-view often have eyes that make use of an inhomogeneous lens an alternative to a lens is to line the inside of the eye with '' mirrors '' , and reflect the image to focus at a central point the scallop pecten has up to 100 millimetre-scale reflector eyes fringing the edge of its shell the image perceived is a combination of inputs from the numerous ommatidia ( individual '' eye units '' ) , which are located on a convex surface , thus pointing in slightly different directions compound eyes are common in arthropods , annelids and some bivalved molluscs some annelids and bivalves also have apposition eyes ) apposition eyes work by gathering a number of images , one from each eye , and combining them in the brain , with each eye typically contributing a single point of information the typical apposition eye has a lens focusing light from one direction on the rhabdom , while light from other directions is absorbed by the dark wall of the ommatidium in the parabolic superposition compound eye type , seen in arthropods such as mayfly , the parabolic surfaces of the inside of each facet focus light from a reflector to a sensor array several of these eyelets together form the strepsipteran compound eye , which is similar to the 'schizochroal ' compound eyes of some trilobites because each eyelet is a simple eye , it produces an inverted image ; those images are combined in the brain to form one unified image because the aperture of an eyelet is larger than the facets of a compound eye , this arrangement allows vision under low light levels good fliers such as flies or honey bees , or prey-catching insects such as praying mantis or dragonfly , have specialised zones of ommatidia organised into a fovea area which gives acute vision this occurs because the ommatidia which one observes '' head-on '' ( along their optical axis ) absorb the incident light , while those to one side reflect it some insects have a so-called single lens compound eye , a transitional type which is something between a superposition type of the multi-lens compound eye and the single lens eye found in animals with simple eyes the resulting eye is a mixture of a simple eye within a compound eye this type of eye consists of a cluster of numerous ommatidia on each side of the head , organised in a way that resembles a true compound eye the body of ophiocoma wendtii , a type of brittle star , is covered with ommatidia , turning its whole skin into a compound eye physically these can not be reduced in size to achieve the acuity seen with single lensed eyes as in mammals the eyes of vertebrates usually contain ciliary cells with c-opsins , and ( bilaterian ) invertebrates have rhabdomeric cells in the eye with r-opsins

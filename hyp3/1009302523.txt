complex eyes can distinguish shapes and colours the last common ancestor of animals possessed the biochemical toolkit necessary for vision , and more advanced eyes have evolved in 96 % of animal species in six of the ~35 main phyla the cone cells ( for colour ) and the rod cells ( for low-light contrasts ) in the retina detect and convert light into neural signals for vision the visual signals are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve some eyes have up to 28,000 such sensors , which are arranged hexagonally , and which can give a full 360° field of vision some arthropods , including many strepsiptera , have compound eyes of only a few facets , each with a retina capable of creating an image , creating vision with each eye viewing a different thing , a fused image from all the eyes is produced in the brain , providing very different , high-resolution images possessing detailed hyperspectral colour vision , the mantis shrimp has been reported to have the world 's most complex colour vision system they used clear calcite crystals to form the lenses of their eyes for example , jumping spiders have a large pair of simple eyes with a narrow field of view , supported by an array of other , smaller eyes for peripheral vision some of the simplest eyes , called ocelli , can be found in animals like some of the snails , which can not actually '' see '' in the normal sense they do have photosensitive cells , but no lens and no other means of projecting an image onto these cells in organisms dwelling near deep-sea vents , compound eyes have been secondarily simplified and adapted to see the infrared produced by the hot vents—in this way the bearers can avoid being boiled alive there are ten different eye layouts—indeed every technological method of capturing an optical image commonly used by human beings , with the exceptions of zoom and fresnel lenses , occur in nature eye types can be categorised into '' simple eyes '' , with one concave photoreceptive surface , and '' compound eyes '' , which comprise a number of individual lenses laid out on a convex surface also , superposition eyes can achieve greater sensitivity than apposition eyes , so are better suited to dark-dwelling creatures some organisms have photosensitive cells that do nothing but detect whether the surroundings are light or dark , which is sufficient for the entrainment of circadian rhythms these are not considered eyes because they lack enough structure to be considered an organ , and do not produce an image simple eyes are rather ubiquitous , and lens-bearing eyes have evolved at least seven times in vertebrates , cephalopods , annelids , crustaceans and cubozoa the most basic form , seen in some gastropods and annelids , consists of a lens of one refractive index heterogeneous eyes have evolved at least nine times : four or more times in gastropods , once in the copepods , once in the annelids , once in the cephalopods , and once in the chitons , which have aragonite lenses the ocelli of insects bear a simple lens , but their focal point usually lies behind the retina ; consequently , those ca n't form a sharp image focusing the image would also cause the sun 's image to be focused on a few receptors , with the possibility of damage under the intense light ; shielding the receptors would block out some light and thus reduce their sensitivity this fast response has led to suggestions that the ocelli of insects are used mainly in flight , because they can be used to detect sudden changes in which way is up ( because light , especially uv light which is absorbed by vegetation , usually comes from above ) another copepod , copilia , has two lenses in each eye , arranged like those in a telescope such arrangements are rare and poorly understood , but represent an alternative construction multiple lenses are seen in some hunters such as eagles and jumping spiders , which have a refractive cornea : these have a negative lens , enlarging the observed image by up to 50 % over the receptor cells , thus increasing their optical resolution in refractive corneas , the lens tissue is corrected with inhomogeneous lens material ( see luneburg lens ) , or with an aspheric shape the nature of these eyes means that if one were to peer into the pupil of an eye , one would see the same image that the organism would see , reflected back out many small organisms such as rotifers , copepods and flatworms use such organs , but these are too small to produce usable images some larger organisms , such as scallops , also use reflector eyes it detects moving objects as they pass successive lenses there is at least one vertebrate , the spookfish , whose eyes include reflective optics for focusing of light the image perceived is a combination of inputs from the numerous ommatidia ( individual '' eye units '' ) , which are located on a convex surface , thus pointing in slightly different directions compared with simple eyes , compound eyes possess a very large view angle , and can detect fast movement and , in some cases , the polarisation of light because the individual lenses are so small , the effects of diffraction impose a limit on the possible resolution that can be obtained ( assuming that they do not function as phased arrays ) to see with a resolution comparable to our simple eyes , humans would require very large compound eyes , around in radius compound eyes in arthropods grow at their margins by the addition of new ommatidia apposition eyes are the most common form of eyes and are presumably the ancestral form of compound eyes the typical apposition eye has a lens focusing light from one direction on the rhabdom , while light from other directions is absorbed by the dark wall of the ommatidium in the parabolic superposition compound eye type , seen in arthropods such as mayfly , the parabolic surfaces of the inside of each facet focus light from a reflector to a sensor array long-bodied decapoda such as shrimp , prawns , crayfish and lobsters are alone in having reflecting superposition eyes , which also have a transparent gap but use corner mirrors instead of lenses another kind of compound eye , found in males of order strepsiptera , employs a series of simple eyes—eyes having one opening that provides light for an entire image-forming retina because each eyelet is a simple eye , it produces an inverted image ; those images are combined in the brain to form one unified image because the aperture of an eyelet is larger than the facets of a compound eye , this arrangement allows vision under low light levels the body of ophiocoma wendtii , a type of brittle star , is covered with ommatidia , turning its whole skin into a compound eye they may have been expressed in ciliary cells of larval eyes , which were subsequently resorbed into the brain on metamorphosis to the adult form c-opsins are also found in some derived bilaterian-invertebrate eyes , such as the pallial eyes of the bivalve molluscs ; however , the lateral eyes ( which were presumably the ancestral type for this group , if eyes evolved once there ) always use r-opsins

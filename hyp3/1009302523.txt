complex eyes can distinguish shapes and colours the visual fields of many organisms , especially predators , involve large areas of binocular vision to improve depth perception in other organisms , eyes are located so as to maximise the field of view , such as in rabbits and horses , which have monocular vision the last common ancestor of animals possessed the biochemical toolkit necessary for vision , and more advanced eyes have evolved in 96 % of animal species in six of the ~35 main phyla in most vertebrates and some molluscs , the eye works by allowing light to enter and project onto a light-sensitive layer of cells at the end of the eye , known as the retina the cone cells ( for colour ) and the rod cells ( for low-light contrasts ) in the retina detect and convert light into neural signals for vision the eyes of most cephalopods , fish , amphibians and snakes have fixed lens shapes , and focusing vision is achieved by telescoping the lens—similar to how a camera focuses some eyes have up to 28,000 such sensors , which are arranged hexagonally , and which can give a full 360° field of vision compound eyes are very sensitive to motion some arthropods , including many strepsiptera , have compound eyes of only a few facets , each with a retina capable of creating an image , creating vision with each eye viewing a different thing , a fused image from all the eyes is produced in the brain , providing very different , high-resolution images possessing detailed hyperspectral colour vision , the mantis shrimp has been reported to have the world 's most complex colour vision system the number of lenses in such an eye varied ; however , some trilobites had only one , and some had thousands of lenses in one eye in contrast to compound eyes , simple eyes are those that have a single lens indeed , any eye type can be adapted for almost any behaviour or environment also , superposition eyes can achieve greater sensitivity than apposition eyes , so are better suited to dark-dwelling creatures eyes also fall into two groups on the basis of their photoreceptor 's cellular construction , with the photoreceptor cells either being cilliated ( as in the vertebrates ) or rhabdomeric these two groups are not monophyletic ; the cnidaria also possess cilliated cells , and some gastropods , as well as some annelids possess both pit eyes , also known as stemma , are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angles of light that enters and affects the eye-spot , to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light found in about 85 % of phyla , these basic forms were probably the precursors to more advanced types of '' simple eyes '' however , pit organs are fitted with receptors rather different from photoreceptors , namely a specific transient receptor potential channel ( trp channels ) called trpv1 the most basic form , seen in some gastropods and annelids , consists of a lens of one refractive index this also allows a larger aperture for a given sharpness of image , allowing more light to enter the lens ; and a flatter lens , reducing spherical aberration this eye creates an image that is sharp enough that motion of the eye can cause significant blurring to minimise the effect of eye motion while the animal moves , most such eyes have stabilising eye muscles the ocelli of insects bear a simple lens , but their focal point usually lies behind the retina ; consequently , those ca n't form a sharp image focusing the image would also cause the sun 's image to be focused on a few receptors , with the possibility of damage under the intense light ; shielding the receptors would block out some light and thus reduce their sensitivity the outer has a parabolic surface , countering the effects of spherical aberration while allowing a sharp image to be formed in refractive corneas , the lens tissue is corrected with inhomogeneous lens material ( see luneburg lens ) , or with an aspheric shape the nature of these eyes means that if one were to peer into the pupil of an eye , one would see the same image that the organism would see , reflected back out some larger organisms , such as scallops , also use reflector eyes each of the two eyes of a spookfish collects light from both above and below ; the light coming from above is focused by a lens , while that coming from below , by a curved mirror composed of many layers of small reflective plates made of guanine crystals compared with simple eyes , compound eyes possess a very large view angle , and can detect fast movement and , in some cases , the polarisation of light because the individual lenses are so small , the effects of diffraction impose a limit on the possible resolution that can be obtained ( assuming that they do not function as phased arrays ) compound eyes are common in arthropods , annelids and some bivalved molluscs apposition eyes are the most common form of eyes and are presumably the ancestral form of compound eyes they are also possessed by limulus , the horseshoe crab , and there are suggestions that other chelicerates developed their simple eyes by reduction from a compound starting point ) apposition eyes work by gathering a number of images , one from each eye , and combining them in the brain , with each eye typically contributing a single point of information the superposition eye is divided into three types : refracting , reflecting and parabolic superposition the refracting superposition eye has a gap between the lens and the rhabdom , and no side wall long-bodied decapoda such as shrimp , prawns , crayfish and lobsters are alone in having reflecting superposition eyes , which also have a transparent gap but use corner mirrors instead of lenses another kind of compound eye , found in males of order strepsiptera , employs a series of simple eyes—eyes having one opening that provides light for an entire image-forming retina this occurs because the ommatidia which one observes '' head-on '' ( along their optical axis ) absorb the incident light , while those to one side reflect it some insects have a so-called single lens compound eye , a transitional type which is something between a superposition type of the multi-lens compound eye and the single lens eye found in animals with simple eyes the shrimp has an eye of the refracting superposition type , in the rear behind this in each eye there is a single large facet that is three times in diameter the others in the eye and behind this is an enlarged crystalline cone eyes can be the most visible parts of organisms , and this can act as a pressure on organisms to have more transparent eyes at the cost of function other pigments , such as melanin , are used to shield the photoreceptor cells from light leaking in from the sides they may have been expressed in ciliary cells of larval eyes , which were subsequently resorbed into the brain on metamorphosis to the adult form c-opsins are also found in some derived bilaterian-invertebrate eyes , such as the pallial eyes of the bivalve molluscs ; however , the lateral eyes ( which were presumably the ancestral type for this group , if eyes evolved once there ) always use r-opsins

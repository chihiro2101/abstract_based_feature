in those decades the experimental genre of musique concrète used tape manipulation to create sound compositions producers and engineers like ruddy redwood , king tubby and lee '' scratch '' perry popularized stripped-down instrumental mixes ( which they called '' versions '' ) of reggae tunes from the mid-1970s , djs in early discothèques were performing similar tricks with disco songs ( using loops and tape edits ) to get dancers on the floor and keep them there one noteworthy figure was tom moulton who invented the dance remix as we now know it though not a dj ( a popular misconception ) , moulton had begun his career by making a homemade mix tape for a fire island dance club in the late 1960s his tapes eventually became popular and he came to the attention of the music industry in new york city at first , moulton was simply called upon to improve the aesthetics of dance-oriented recordings before release ( '' i did n't do the remix , i did the mix '' —tom moulton ) eventually , he moved from being a '' fix it '' man on pop records to specializing in remixes for the dance floor the salsoul catalog is seen ( especially in the uk and europe ) as being the '' canon '' for the disco mixer 's art form contemporaneously to disco in the mid-1970s , the dub and disco remix cultures met through jamaican immigrants to the bronx , energizing both and helping to create hip-hop music '' one of the first mainstream successes of this style of remix was the 1983 track rockit by herbie hancock , as remixed by grand mixer dxt dorian lynskey of the guardian named it a '' benchmark remix '' and placed it in his top ten list of remixes early pop remixes were fairly simple ; in the 1980s , '' extended mixes '' of songs were released to clubs and commercial outlets on vinyl 12-inch singles contemporaneous to art of noise was the seminal body of work by yello ( composed , arranged and mixed by boris blank ) primarily because they featured sampled and synthesized sounds , yello and art of noise would produce a great deal of influential work for the next phase after the rise of dance music in the late 1980s , a new form of remix was popularised , where the vocals would be kept and the instruments would be replaced , often with matching backing in the house music idiom jesse saunders , known as the originator of house music , was the first producer to change the art of remixing by creating his own original music , entirely replacing the earlier track , then mixing back in the artist 's original lyrics to make his remix other artists , such as erasure , have included remix software in their officially released singles , enabling almost infinite permutations of remixes by users indeed , there have been popular singles that have been expanded to an entire album of remixes by other well-known artists some radio stations , such as the uk 's make extensive use of remixes in their formats to create a hotter , more up-beat sound than their market rivals recent technology allows for easier remixing , leading to a rise in its use in the music industry many famous artists have been involved in remix disputes in 2015 , jay-z went to trial over a dispute about his use of a sample from '' khosara khosara '' , a composition by egyptian composer baligh hamdy in his song '' big pimpin ' '' in 1988 , sinéad o'connor 's art-rock song '' i want your ( hands on me ) '' was remixed to emphasize the urban appeal of the composition ( the original contains a tight , grinding bassline and a rhythm guitar not entirely unlike chic 's work ) in 1989 , the cure 's '' pictures of you '' was remixed turning '' the music on its head , twisted the beat completely , but at the same time left the essential heart of the song intact an r & b remix usually has the same music as the original song but has added or altered verses that are rapped or sung by the featured artists in the early 1990s , mariah carey became one of the first mainstream artists who re-recorded vocals for a dancefloor version , and by 1993 most of her major dance and urban-targeted versions had been re-sung , e.g these versions were not technically remixes , as entirely new productions of the material were undertaken ( the songs were '' re-cut '' , usually from the ground up ) some of the song 's r & b elements were removed for the remix , while the bassline and '' genius of love '' sample were emphasized and the bridge from the original version was used as the chorus the bad boy remix garnered positive reviews from music critics '' fantasy '' exemplified how a music sample could be transformed '' into a fully realized pop masterpiece '' sasha frere-jones , editor of the new yorker commented in referencing to the song 's remix : '' it became standard for r & b/hip-hop stars like missy elliott and beyoncé , to combine melodies with rapped verses '' moreover , jones concludes that '' her idea of pairing a female songbird with the leading male mcs of hip-hop changed r & b and , eventually , all of pop '' john norris of mtv news has stated that the remix was '' responsible for , i would argue , an entire wave of music that we 've seen since and that is the r & b-hip-hop collaboration in 2011 , the experimental metal band iwrestledabearonce used the song at the beginning and end of the video '' you know that ai n't them dogs ' real voices '' dre again featured , who originally wanted it for his next album , but relented to let it be on the album all eyez on me instead in 2001 , jessica simpson released an urban remix of her song '' irresistible '' , featuring rappers lil ' bow wow and jermaine dupri , who also produced the track in addition , the original version 's beginning line '' you remind me of something/i just ca n't think of what it is '' is actually sampled from an older kelly song , '' you remind me of something '' kelly later revealed that he actually wrote '' ignition ( remix ) '' before the purported original version of '' ignition '' , and created the purported original so that the chorus lyric in his alleged remix would make sense sega would also bring virtua fighter remix to sega titan video arcade hardware nicolas suzor

in those decades the experimental genre of musique concrète used tape manipulation to create sound compositions the fluid evolution of music that encompassed ska , rocksteady , reggae and dub was embraced by local music mixers who deconstructed and rebuilt tracks to suit the tastes of their audience one noteworthy figure was tom moulton who invented the dance remix as we now know it his tapes eventually became popular and he came to the attention of the music industry in new york city at first , moulton was simply called upon to improve the aesthetics of dance-oriented recordings before release ( '' i did n't do the remix , i did the mix '' —tom moulton ) walter gibbons provided the dance version of the first commercial 12-inch single ( '' ten percent '' , by double exposure ) pettibone is among a very small number of remixers whose work successfully transitioned from the disco to the house era contemporaneously to disco in the mid-1970s , the dub and disco remix cultures met through jamaican immigrants to the bronx , energizing both and helping to create hip-hop music '' one of the first mainstream successes of this style of remix was the 1983 track rockit by herbie hancock , as remixed by grand mixer dxt malcolm mclaren and the creative team behind ztt records would feature the '' cut up '' style of hip hop on such records as '' duck rock '' english duo coldcut 's remix of eric b the coldcut remix '' seven minutes of madness '' became one of the first commercially successful remixes , becoming a top fifteen hit in countries such as germany , the netherlands and the united kingdom art of noise took the remix styles to an extreme—creating music entirely of samples others such as cabaret voltaire and the aforementioned jarre ( whose zoolook was an epic usage of sampling and sequencing ) were equally influential in this era after the rise of dance music in the late 1980s , a new form of remix was popularised , where the vocals would be kept and the instruments would be replaced , often with matching backing in the house music idiom jesse saunders , known as the originator of house music , was the first producer to change the art of remixing by creating his own original music , entirely replacing the earlier track , then mixing back in the artist 's original lyrics to make his remix he introduced this technique for the first time with the club nouveau song '' it 's a cold , cold world '' , in may 1988 some industrial groups allow , and often encourage , their fans to remix their music , notably nine inch nails , whose website contains a list of downloadable songs that can be remixed using apple 's garageband software it can be done legally , but there have been numerous disputes over rights to samples used in remixed songs osama fahmy , a nephew of hamdy , argued that while jay-z had the “ economic rights ” to use the song , he did not have the “ moral rights ” in 1988 , sinéad o'connor 's art-rock song '' i want your ( hands on me ) '' was remixed to emphasize the urban appeal of the composition ( the original contains a tight , grinding bassline and a rhythm guitar not entirely unlike chic 's work ) in 1989 , the cure 's '' pictures of you '' was remixed turning '' the music on its head , twisted the beat completely , but at the same time left the essential heart of the song intact such remixes often include '' featured '' artists , adding new vocalists or musicians to the original mix it usually contains some if not all of the original verses of the song however they may be arranged in a different order than they originally were in the early 1990s , mariah carey became one of the first mainstream artists who re-recorded vocals for a dancefloor version , and by 1993 most of her major dance and urban-targeted versions had been re-sung , e.g some of the song 's r & b elements were removed for the remix , while the bassline and '' genius of love '' sample were emphasized and the bridge from the original version was used as the chorus the '' bad boy fantasy remix '' , combines the chorus from the original version and the chorus of the bad boy remix together , removing ol ' dirty bastard 's vocals from his second verse the song and its remix arguably remains as one of carey 's most important singles to date '' judnick mayard , writer of thefader , wrote that in regarding of r & b and hip hop collaboration , '' the champion of this movement is mariah carey in 2011 , the experimental metal band iwrestledabearonce used the song at the beginning and end of the video '' you know that ai n't them dogs ' real voices '' lyte was asked to provide a '' guest rap '' , and a new tradition was born in pop music in 1995 , after doing '' california love '' , which proved to be his best selling single ever , tupac shakur would do its remix with dr the song is unique in that it segues from the end of the original to the beginning of the remixed version ( accompanied by the line '' now usually i do n't do this , but uh , go ahead on , break em ' off with a little preview of the remix in 2015 , edm artist deadmau5 , who worked with jay-z 's roc nation , tried to sue his former manager for remixing his songs without permission , claiming that he gave his manager the go-ahead to use his work for some remixes , but not others 50 cent tried to sue rapper rick ross in october 2018 for remixing his '' in da club '' beat , due to their publicized feud remixes can boost popularity of the original versions of songs thanks to a combination of guest raps , re-sung or altered lyrics and alternative backing tracks , some hip-hop remixes can end up being almost entirely different songs from the originals slow ballads and r & b songs can be remixed by techno producers and djs in order to give the song appeal to the club scene and to urban radio it is essentially a reworked abstraction of the original work while still holding remnants of the original piece while still letting the true meanings of the original piece shine through a parody in contemporary usage , is a work created to mock , comment on , or make fun at an original work , its subject , author , style , or some other target , by means of humorous , satiric or ironic imitation if the song is substantively dissimilar in form ( for example , it might only borrow a motif which is modified , and be completely different in all other respects ) , then it may not necessarily be a derivative work ( depending on how heavily modified the melody and chord progressions were ) lessig also believes that creative commons and other licences , such as the gnu general public licence are important mechanisms which mashup and remix artists can use to mitigate the impact of copyright law the key word in such considerations is transformative , as the remix product must have been either sufficiently altered or clearly used for a sufficiently different purpose for it to be safe from copyright violation

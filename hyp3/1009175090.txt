from the mid-1970s , djs in early discothèques were performing similar tricks with disco songs ( using loops and tape edits ) to get dancers on the floor and keep them there one noteworthy figure was tom moulton who invented the dance remix as we now know it though not a dj ( a popular misconception ) , moulton had begun his career by making a homemade mix tape for a fire island dance club in the late 1960s at first , moulton was simply called upon to improve the aesthetics of dance-oriented recordings before release ( '' i did n't do the remix , i did the mix '' —tom moulton ) contemporaneously to disco in the mid-1970s , the dub and disco remix cultures met through jamaican immigrants to the bronx , energizing both and helping to create hip-hop music '' one of the first mainstream successes of this style of remix was the 1983 track rockit by herbie hancock , as remixed by grand mixer dxt dorian lynskey of the guardian named it a '' benchmark remix '' and placed it in his top ten list of remixes early pop remixes were fairly simple ; in the 1980s , '' extended mixes '' of songs were released to clubs and commercial outlets on vinyl 12-inch singles these typically had a duration of six to seven minutes , and often consisted of the original song with 8 or 16 bars of instruments inserted , often after the second chorus ; some were as simplistic as two copies of the song stitched end to end madonna began her career writing music for dance clubs and used remixes extensively to propel her career ; one of her early boyfriends was noted dj john jellybean benitez , who created several mixes of her work art of noise took the remix styles to an extreme—creating music entirely of samples girl talk is perhaps the most famous of this movement , creating albums using sounds entirely from other music and cutting it into his own underground mixing is more difficult than the typical official remix because clean copies of separated tracks such as vocals or individual instruments are usually not available to the public some artists ( such as björk , nine inch nails , and public enemy ) embraced this trend and outspokenly sanctioned fan remixing of their work ; there was once a web site which hosted hundreds of unofficial remixes of björk 's songs , all made using only various officially sanctioned mixes other artists , such as erasure , have included remix software in their officially released singles , enabling almost infinite permutations of remixes by users the band has also presided over remix competitions for their releases , selecting their favourite fan-created remix to appear on later official releases some industrial groups allow , and often encourage , their fans to remix their music , notably nine inch nails , whose website contains a list of downloadable songs that can be remixed using apple 's garageband software some artists have started releasing their songs in the u-myx format , which allows buyers to mix songs and share them on the u-myx website some radio stations , such as the uk 's make extensive use of remixes in their formats to create a hotter , more up-beat sound than their market rivals recent technology allows for easier remixing , leading to a rise in its use in the music industry many famous artists have been involved in remix disputes in 1988 , sinéad o'connor 's art-rock song '' i want your ( hands on me ) '' was remixed to emphasize the urban appeal of the composition ( the original contains a tight , grinding bassline and a rhythm guitar not entirely unlike chic 's work ) in 1989 , the cure 's '' pictures of you '' was remixed turning '' the music on its head , twisted the beat completely , but at the same time left the essential heart of the song intact '' remixes have become the norm in contemporary dance music , giving one song the ability to appeal across many different musical genres or dance venues the remix is also widely used in hip hop music an r & b remix usually has the same music as the original song but has added or altered verses that are rapped or sung by the featured artists in the early 1990s , mariah carey became one of the first mainstream artists who re-recorded vocals for a dancefloor version , and by 1993 most of her major dance and urban-targeted versions had been re-sung , e.g carey worked with producer sean combs to create the official bad boy remix of '' fantasy '' some of the song 's r & b elements were removed for the remix , while the bassline and '' genius of love '' sample were emphasized and the bridge from the original version was used as the chorus the '' bad boy fantasy remix '' , combines the chorus from the original version and the chorus of the bad boy remix together , removing ol ' dirty bastard 's vocals from his second verse the song and its remix arguably remains as one of carey 's most important singles to date '' moreover , jones concludes that '' her idea of pairing a female songbird with the leading male mcs of hip-hop changed r & b and , eventually , all of pop george michael would feature three artistically differentiated arrangements of '' i want your sex '' in 1987 , highlighting the potential of '' serial productions '' of a piece to find markets and expand the tastes of listeners in 1995 , after doing '' california love '' , which proved to be his best selling single ever , tupac shakur would do its remix with dr this also included the reappearance of roger troutman , also from the original , but he ended the remix with an ad-lib on the outro a separate music video was filmed for the remix , shot in black and white and featuring a cameo appearance by snoop the song is unique in that it segues from the end of the original to the beginning of the remixed version ( accompanied by the line '' now usually i do n't do this , but uh , go ahead on , break em ' off with a little preview of the remix in addition , the original version 's beginning line '' you remind me of something/i just ca n't think of what it is '' is actually sampled from an older kelly song , '' you remind me of something '' a remix may also refer to a non-linear re-interpretation of a given work or media other than audio such as a hybridizing process combining fragments of various works danielewski 's disjointed novel house of leaves has been compared by some to the remix concept this form of remix is also used in advertisements , creating parodies of famous movies , tv series , etc if the song is substantively dissimilar in form ( for example , it might only borrow a motif which is modified , and be completely different in all other respects ) , then it may not necessarily be a derivative work ( depending on how heavily modified the melody and chord progressions were ) assemblage audio mixing ccmixter cover version multitracking musical montage plunderphonics sound collage web literacy rave electronic dance music

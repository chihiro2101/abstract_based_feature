in those decades the experimental genre of musique concrète used tape manipulation to create sound compositions the fluid evolution of music that encompassed ska , rocksteady , reggae and dub was embraced by local music mixers who deconstructed and rebuilt tracks to suit the tastes of their audience one noteworthy figure was tom moulton who invented the dance remix as we now know it though not a dj ( a popular misconception ) , moulton had begun his career by making a homemade mix tape for a fire island dance club in the late 1960s at first , moulton was simply called upon to improve the aesthetics of dance-oriented recordings before release ( '' i did n't do the remix , i did the mix '' —tom moulton ) eventually , he moved from being a '' fix it '' man on pop records to specializing in remixes for the dance floor walter gibbons provided the dance version of the first commercial 12-inch single ( '' ten percent '' , by double exposure ) in fact his version was a re-edit of the original mix the salsoul catalog is seen ( especially in the uk and europe ) as being the '' canon '' for the disco mixer 's art form contemporaneously to disco in the mid-1970s , the dub and disco remix cultures met through jamaican immigrants to the bronx , energizing both and helping to create hip-hop music key figures included dj kool herc and grandmaster flash '' one of the first mainstream successes of this style of remix was the 1983 track rockit by herbie hancock , as remixed by grand mixer dxt & rakim 's '' paid in full '' released in october 1987 is said to have '' laid the groundwork for hip hop 's entry into the uk mainstream '' early pop remixes were fairly simple ; in the 1980s , '' extended mixes '' of songs were released to clubs and commercial outlets on vinyl 12-inch singles these typically had a duration of six to seven minutes , and often consisted of the original song with 8 or 16 bars of instruments inserted , often after the second chorus ; some were as simplistic as two copies of the song stitched end to end primarily because they featured sampled and synthesized sounds , yello and art of noise would produce a great deal of influential work for the next phase girl talk is perhaps the most famous of this movement , creating albums using sounds entirely from other music and cutting it into his own underground mixing is more difficult than the typical official remix because clean copies of separated tracks such as vocals or individual instruments are usually not available to the public some industrial groups allow , and often encourage , their fans to remix their music , notably nine inch nails , whose website contains a list of downloadable songs that can be remixed using apple 's garageband software the main single of i turn to you by melanie c , was released as the '' hex hector radio mix '' , for which hex hector won the 2001 grammy as remixer of the year some radio stations , such as the uk 's make extensive use of remixes in their formats to create a hotter , more up-beat sound than their market rivals recent technology allows for easier remixing , leading to a rise in its use in the music industry many famous artists have been involved in remix disputes osama fahmy , a nephew of hamdy , argued that while jay-z had the “ economic rights ” to use the song , he did not have the “ moral rights ” such remixes often include '' featured '' artists , adding new vocalists or musicians to the original mix an r & b remix usually has the same music as the original song but has added or altered verses that are rapped or sung by the featured artists it usually contains some if not all of the original verses of the song however they may be arranged in a different order than they originally were in the early 1990s , mariah carey became one of the first mainstream artists who re-recorded vocals for a dancefloor version , and by 1993 most of her major dance and urban-targeted versions had been re-sung , e.g carey worked with producer sean combs to create the official bad boy remix of '' fantasy '' the '' bad boy fantasy remix '' , combines the chorus from the original version and the chorus of the bad boy remix together , removing ol ' dirty bastard 's vocals from his second verse the song and its remix arguably remains as one of carey 's most important singles to date due to the success and influence of the song , carey is credited for introducing r & b and hip hop into mainstream pop culture , and for popularizing rap as a featuring act through her post-1995 songs sasha frere-jones , editor of the new yorker commented in referencing to the song 's remix : '' it became standard for r & b/hip-hop stars like missy elliott and beyoncé , to combine melodies with rapped verses you could argue that the 'fantasy ' remix was the single most important recording that she 's ever made in 2011 , the experimental metal band iwrestledabearonce used the song at the beginning and end of the video '' you know that ai n't them dogs ' real voices '' lyte was asked to provide a '' guest rap '' , and a new tradition was born in pop music this also included the reappearance of roger troutman , also from the original , but he ended the remix with an ad-lib on the outro mariah carey 's song '' heartbreaker '' was remixed , containing lyrical interpolations and an instrumental sample from '' ai n't no fun ( if the homies ca n't have none ) '' by snoop dogg in 2001 , jessica simpson released an urban remix of her song '' irresistible '' , featuring rappers lil ' bow wow and jermaine dupri , who also produced the track in 2003 the coca-cola company released a new version of their soft drink sprite with tropical flavors under the name sprite remix lessig also believes that creative commons and other licences , such as the gnu general public licence are important mechanisms which mashup and remix artists can use to mitigate the impact of copyright law lessig laid out his ideas in a book called '' remix '' which is itself free to remix under a cc by-nc license however , if the work that is distributed by the remixer is an entirely new and transformative work that is not for profit , copyright laws are not breached

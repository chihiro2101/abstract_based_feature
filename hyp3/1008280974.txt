spss is a widely used program for statistics in social science the original spss manual ( nie , bent & hull , 1970 ) has been described as one of '' sociology 's most influential books '' for allowing ordinary researchers to do their own statistical analysis the many features of spss statistics are accessible via pull-down menus or can be programmed with a proprietary 4gl command syntax language the pull-down menu interface also generates command syntax : this can be displayed in the output , although the default settings have to be changed to make the syntax visible to the user a python programmability extension can access the information in the data dictionary and data and dynamically build command syntax programs in addition , the python extension allows spss to run any of the statistics in the free software package r ) spss statistics places constraints on internal file structure , data types , data processing , and matching files , which together considerably simplify programming in addition to that cases-by-variables structure and processing , there is a separate matrix session where one can process data as matrices using matrix and linear algebra operations the graphical user interface has two views which can be toggled by clicking on one of the two tabs in the bottom left of the spss statistics window cells in both views can be manually edited , defining the file structure and allowing data entry without using command syntax spss statistics can read and write data from ascii text files ( including hierarchical files ) , other statistics packages , spreadsheets and databases prior to spss 16.0 , different versions of spss were available for windows , mac os x and unix companion software in the '' ibm spss '' family are used for data mining and text mining ( spss modeler ) , and realtime credit score ( ibm spss collaboration and deployment services ) this gave good interactive response time for the spss conversational statistical system ( scss ) , whose strong point , as with spss , was cross-tabulation comparison of statistical packages jasp , an open-source and free of charge alternative to spss that offers both frequentist and bayesian analysis methods pspp , a free spss replacement from the gnu project spss modeler

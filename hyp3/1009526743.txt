while many of those with brugada syndrome do not have any symptoms , brugada syndrome may cause fainting or sudden cardiac death due to serious abnormal heart rhythms such as ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia blackouts may be caused by brief abnormal heart rhythms that revert to a normal rhythm spontaneously however , blackouts can occur in those with brugada syndrome despite a normal heart rhythm due to a sudden drop in blood pressure , known as reflex syncope the abnormal heart rhythms seen in brugada syndrome often occur at rest , following a heavy meal , or even during sleep abnormal heart rhythms may also occur during fever or following excessive alcohol certain medications may also worsen the tendency to abnormal heart rhythms in patients with brugada syndrome and should be avoided by these patients many of the genetic mutations that have subsequently been described in association with brugada syndrome influence the sodium current in some way , or affect other ionic currents a long list of factors that can generate a brugada ecg pattern have been described , including certain medications , electrolyte disturbances such as a hypokalemia , and a ischemia to key areas of the heart , specifically the ventricular outflow tract brugada syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner , meaning that only one copy of the defective gene is needed to produce the syndrome however , a person diagnosed with the condition may be the first in their family to have brugada syndrome if it has arisen as a new mutation the gene in which mutations are most commonly found in brugada syndrome , known as scn5a , is responsible for the cardiac sodium channel however , only 20 % of cases of brugada syndrome are associated with mutations in scn5a , as in the majority of patients with brugada syndrome genetic testing is unable to identify the genetic mutation responsible however , the genetics of brugada syndrome are complex , and it is likely that the condition results from the interactions of many genes some are responsible for other proteins that form part of the sodium channel , known as sodium channel β subunits ( scn1b , scn2b , scn3b ) while others form different types of sodium channel ( scn10a ) the genes associated with brugada syndrome and their description include : some mutations associated with brugada syndrome can also cause other heart conditions brugada syndrome has been described as overlapping with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia ( arvc ) caused by a mutation in the pkp2 gene , causing a brugada ecg pattern but structural changes in the heart characteristic of arvc the abnormal heart rhythms seen in those with brugada syndrome are typically dangerous arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia , but those with brs are also more likely to experience rapid heart rates due to less dangerous arrhythmias such as av nodal reentrant tachycardia and abnormally slow heart rhythms such as sick sinus syndrome some argue that the main reason these arrhythmias arise is due to abnormally slow electrical conduction in areas of the heart , specifically the right ventricle the sodium current is a major contributor to the characteristic flow of electrical charge across the membrane of heart muscle cells that occurs with each heartbeat known as the action potential as brugada syndrome can be caused by mutation in many different genes , it is possible that different mechanisms may be responsible for the arrhythmias seen in different patients genetic testing can be helpful to identify patients with brugada syndrome , most commonly in family members of a person with brugada syndrome , but sometimes performed in a person who has died suddenly and unexpectedly quinidine is an antiarrhythmic drug that may reduce the chance of serious abnormal heart rhythms occurring in some people with brugada syndrome type 1 brugada ecg patterns are seen more frequently in asian populations ( 0 % –0.36 % ) than those in europe ( 0 % –0.25 % ) and the united states ( 0.03 % ) brugada syndrome is named after the spanish cardiologists josep and pedro brugada who described the condition in 1992 , although the association between the characteristic ecg pattern and sudden cardiac death had been reported in 1989 the first genetic mutations affecting the scn5a gene associated with the syndrome were identified by their brother ramon brugada in 1998 , with many more mutations affecting at least 19 genes subsequently identified by others

while many of those with brugada syndrome do not have any symptoms , brugada syndrome may cause fainting or sudden cardiac death due to serious abnormal heart rhythms such as ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia blackouts may be caused by brief abnormal heart rhythms that revert to a normal rhythm spontaneously if a dangerous heart rhythm does not stop by itself and is left untreated , the person may have a fatal cardiac arrest the abnormal heart rhythms seen in brugada syndrome often occur at rest , following a heavy meal , or even during sleep abnormal heart rhythms may also occur during fever or following excessive alcohol certain medications may also worsen the tendency to abnormal heart rhythms in patients with brugada syndrome and should be avoided by these patients as a genetic disorder , the syndrome is ultimately caused by changes to a person 's dna , known as mutation a long list of factors that can generate a brugada ecg pattern have been described , including certain medications , electrolyte disturbances such as a hypokalemia , and a ischemia to key areas of the heart , specifically the ventricular outflow tract brugada syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner , meaning that only one copy of the defective gene is needed to produce the syndrome however , a person diagnosed with the condition may be the first in their family to have brugada syndrome if it has arisen as a new mutation the gene in which mutations are most commonly found in brugada syndrome , known as scn5a , is responsible for the cardiac sodium channel however , only 20 % of cases of brugada syndrome are associated with mutations in scn5a , as in the majority of patients with brugada syndrome genetic testing is unable to identify the genetic mutation responsible this variation partially explains the differences in severity of the condition between different persons , ranging from a highly dangerous condition causing death at a young age to a benign condition that may not cause any problems at all however , the genetics of brugada syndrome are complex , and it is likely that the condition results from the interactions of many genes because of these complex interactions , some members of a family who carry a particular mutation may show evidence of brugada syndrome while other carrying the same mutation may not , referred to as variable penetrance several other genes have been identified in association with brugada syndrome the genes associated with brugada syndrome and their description include : some mutations associated with brugada syndrome can also cause other heart conditions whilst the heart of those with brugada syndrome may look normal , scarring or fibrosis is often seen in particular regions of the heart , specifically the right ventricular outflow tract these patterns may be present all the time , but may appear only in response to particular drugs ( see below ) , when the person has a fever , during exercise , or as a result of other triggers according to current recommendations , only a type 1 ecg pattern , occurring either spontaneously or in response to medication , can be used to confirm the diagnosis of brugada syndrome as type 2 and 3 patterns are not infrequently seen in persons without the disease some medications , particularly antiarrhythmic drugs that block the cardiac sodium current i na , can reveal a type 1 brugada pattern in susceptible people survivors of an unexplained cardiac arrest , family members of a person with brugada syndrome ) but in whom a diagnostic ecg pattern has not been seen it is most frequently used in people with brugada syndrome who have an icd and have experienced several episodes of life-threatening arrhythmias , but may also be used in people at high risk of arrhythmias but in whom an icd is not appropriate brugada syndrome is more common in people of asian descent and is the most common cause of sudden death in young males without known underlying cardiac disease in thailand and laos brugada syndrome is named after the spanish cardiologists josep and pedro brugada who described the condition in 1992 , although the association between the characteristic ecg pattern and sudden cardiac death had been reported in 1989

while many of those with brugada syndrome do not have any symptoms , brugada syndrome may cause fainting or sudden cardiac death due to serious abnormal heart rhythms such as ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia blackouts may be caused by brief abnormal heart rhythms that revert to a normal rhythm spontaneously however , blackouts can occur in those with brugada syndrome despite a normal heart rhythm due to a sudden drop in blood pressure , known as reflex syncope the abnormal heart rhythms seen in brugada syndrome often occur at rest , following a heavy meal , or even during sleep abnormal heart rhythms may also occur during fever or following excessive alcohol certain medications may also worsen the tendency to abnormal heart rhythms in patients with brugada syndrome and should be avoided by these patients the first mutations described in association with brugada syndrome were in a gene responsible for a protein or ion channel that controls the flow of sodium through the cell membrane of heart muscle cells â€“ the sodium channel many of the genetic mutations that have subsequently been described in association with brugada syndrome influence the sodium current in some way , or affect other ionic currents a long list of factors that can generate a brugada ecg pattern have been described , including certain medications , electrolyte disturbances such as a hypokalemia , and a ischemia to key areas of the heart , specifically the ventricular outflow tract however , a person diagnosed with the condition may be the first in their family to have brugada syndrome if it has arisen as a new mutation mutations in scn5a associated with brugada syndrome generally cause the flow of sodium ions to decrease however , only 20 % of cases of brugada syndrome are associated with mutations in scn5a , as in the majority of patients with brugada syndrome genetic testing is unable to identify the genetic mutation responsible over 290 mutations in the scn5a gene have been discovered to date , each altering sodium channel function in subtly different ways because of these complex interactions , some members of a family who carry a particular mutation may show evidence of brugada syndrome while other carrying the same mutation may not , referred to as variable penetrance the genes associated with brugada syndrome and their description include : some mutations associated with brugada syndrome can also cause other heart conditions those who show more than one cardiac conditions at the same time caused by a single mutation are described as having an 'overlap syndrome ' an example of an overlap syndrome is brugada and long qt syndrome ( lqt3 ) caused by a mutation in scn5a that reduces the peak sodium current but simultaneously leaves a persistent current leak brugada syndrome has been described as overlapping with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia ( arvc ) caused by a mutation in the pkp2 gene , causing a brugada ecg pattern but structural changes in the heart characteristic of arvc some argue that the main reason these arrhythmias arise is due to abnormally slow electrical conduction in areas of the heart , specifically the right ventricle i na causes the initial rapid upstroke of the action potential ( phase 0 ) , and decreasing the early peak current , as occurs in brs-associated genetic variants , leads to slowing of the electrical conduction through the heart muscle in family members who all carry a particular genetic variant associated with brugada syndrome , some family members may show evidence of brugada syndrome on their ecgs while others may not although the abnormal heart rhythms seen in brugada syndrome are generally more likely to occur at rest or even during sleep , some people with brugada syndrome experience arrhythmias during strenuous exercise quinidine is an antiarrhythmic drug that may reduce the chance of serious abnormal heart rhythms occurring in some people with brugada syndrome brugada syndrome is named after the spanish cardiologists josep and pedro brugada who described the condition in 1992 , although the association between the characteristic ecg pattern and sudden cardiac death had been reported in 1989 brugada syndrome was described as a cause for the sudden unexplained cardiac death syndrome seen in thai men in 1997

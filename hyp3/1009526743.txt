while many of those with brugada syndrome do not have any symptoms , brugada syndrome may cause fainting or sudden cardiac death due to serious abnormal heart rhythms such as ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia blackouts may be caused by brief abnormal heart rhythms that revert to a normal rhythm spontaneously if a dangerous heart rhythm does not stop by itself and is left untreated , the person may have a fatal cardiac arrest however , blackouts can occur in those with brugada syndrome despite a normal heart rhythm due to a sudden drop in blood pressure , known as reflex syncope the abnormal heart rhythms seen in brugada syndrome often occur at rest , following a heavy meal , or even during sleep abnormal heart rhythms may also occur during fever or following excessive alcohol certain medications may also worsen the tendency to abnormal heart rhythms in patients with brugada syndrome and should be avoided by these patients the first mutations described in association with brugada syndrome were in a gene responsible for a protein or ion channel that controls the flow of sodium through the cell membrane of heart muscle cells â€“ the sodium channel many of the genetic mutations that have subsequently been described in association with brugada syndrome influence the sodium current in some way , or affect other ionic currents a long list of factors that can generate a brugada ecg pattern have been described , including certain medications , electrolyte disturbances such as a hypokalemia , and a ischemia to key areas of the heart , specifically the ventricular outflow tract however , a person diagnosed with the condition may be the first in their family to have brugada syndrome if it has arisen as a new mutation the gene in which mutations are most commonly found in brugada syndrome , known as scn5a , is responsible for the cardiac sodium channel however , only 20 % of cases of brugada syndrome are associated with mutations in scn5a , as in the majority of patients with brugada syndrome genetic testing is unable to identify the genetic mutation responsible because of these complex interactions , some members of a family who carry a particular mutation may show evidence of brugada syndrome while other carrying the same mutation may not , referred to as variable penetrance the genes associated with brugada syndrome and their description include : some mutations associated with brugada syndrome can also cause other heart conditions brugada syndrome has been described as overlapping with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia ( arvc ) caused by a mutation in the pkp2 gene , causing a brugada ecg pattern but structural changes in the heart characteristic of arvc the sodium current is a major contributor to the characteristic flow of electrical charge across the membrane of heart muscle cells that occurs with each heartbeat known as the action potential given the right circumstances , this wavebreak can allow the waves of electricity to perform a u-turn within the muscle , travelling in the reverse direction before beginning to rapidly circle around a point , referred to as re-entry , and causing an abnormal heart rhythm as brugada syndrome can be caused by mutation in many different genes , it is possible that different mechanisms may be responsible for the arrhythmias seen in different patients three forms of the brugada ecg pattern have historically been described , although the type 3 pattern is no longer used in contemporary practice in family members who all carry a particular genetic variant associated with brugada syndrome , some family members may show evidence of brugada syndrome on their ecgs while others may not this means that carrying a genetic mutation associated with brugada syndrome does not necessarily imply that a person is truly affected by the condition it is most frequently used in people with brugada syndrome who have an icd and have experienced several episodes of life-threatening arrhythmias , but may also be used in people at high risk of arrhythmias but in whom an icd is not appropriate brugada syndrome is named after the spanish cardiologists josep and pedro brugada who described the condition in 1992 , although the association between the characteristic ecg pattern and sudden cardiac death had been reported in 1989 the first genetic mutations affecting the scn5a gene associated with the syndrome were identified by their brother ramon brugada in 1998 , with many more mutations affecting at least 19 genes subsequently identified by others

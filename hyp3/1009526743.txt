while many of those with brugada syndrome do not have any symptoms , brugada syndrome may cause fainting or sudden cardiac death due to serious abnormal heart rhythms such as ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia if a dangerous heart rhythm does not stop by itself and is left untreated , the person may have a fatal cardiac arrest however , blackouts can occur in those with brugada syndrome despite a normal heart rhythm due to a sudden drop in blood pressure , known as reflex syncope the abnormal heart rhythms seen in brugada syndrome often occur at rest , following a heavy meal , or even during sleep abnormal heart rhythms may also occur during fever or following excessive alcohol certain medications may also worsen the tendency to abnormal heart rhythms in patients with brugada syndrome and should be avoided by these patients the individual cells of the heart communicate with each other with electrical signals , and these electrical signals are disrupted in those with brugada syndrome the first mutations described in association with brugada syndrome were in a gene responsible for a protein or ion channel that controls the flow of sodium through the cell membrane of heart muscle cells â€“ the sodium channel many of the genetic mutations that have subsequently been described in association with brugada syndrome influence the sodium current in some way , or affect other ionic currents the ecg pattern can also be seen following excessive use of alcohol or cocaine however , a person diagnosed with the condition may be the first in their family to have brugada syndrome if it has arisen as a new mutation the gene in which mutations are most commonly found in brugada syndrome , known as scn5a , is responsible for the cardiac sodium channel mutations in scn5a associated with brugada syndrome generally cause the flow of sodium ions to decrease however , only 20 % of cases of brugada syndrome are associated with mutations in scn5a , as in the majority of patients with brugada syndrome genetic testing is unable to identify the genetic mutation responsible however , the genetics of brugada syndrome are complex , and it is likely that the condition results from the interactions of many genes because of these complex interactions , some members of a family who carry a particular mutation may show evidence of brugada syndrome while other carrying the same mutation may not , referred to as variable penetrance several other genes have been identified in association with brugada syndrome the genes associated with brugada syndrome and their description include : some mutations associated with brugada syndrome can also cause other heart conditions brugada syndrome has been described as overlapping with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia ( arvc ) caused by a mutation in the pkp2 gene , causing a brugada ecg pattern but structural changes in the heart characteristic of arvc a type 3 pattern is relatively common in healthy subjects and is no longer considered suggestive of brugada syndrome genetic testing can be helpful to identify patients with brugada syndrome , most commonly in family members of a person with brugada syndrome , but sometimes performed in a person who has died suddenly and unexpectedly in people felt to be at higher risk of sudden cardiac death , an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( icd ) may be recommended quinidine is an antiarrhythmic drug that may reduce the chance of serious abnormal heart rhythms occurring in some people with brugada syndrome brugada syndrome is more common in people of asian descent and is the most common cause of sudden death in young males without known underlying cardiac disease in thailand and laos brugada syndrome was described as a cause for the sudden unexplained cardiac death syndrome seen in thai men in 1997

while many of those with brugada syndrome do not have any symptoms , brugada syndrome may cause fainting or sudden cardiac death due to serious abnormal heart rhythms such as ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia if a dangerous heart rhythm does not stop by itself and is left untreated , the person may have a fatal cardiac arrest however , blackouts can occur in those with brugada syndrome despite a normal heart rhythm due to a sudden drop in blood pressure , known as reflex syncope the abnormal heart rhythms seen in brugada syndrome often occur at rest , following a heavy meal , or even during sleep certain medications may also worsen the tendency to abnormal heart rhythms in patients with brugada syndrome and should be avoided by these patients the individual cells of the heart communicate with each other with electrical signals , and these electrical signals are disrupted in those with brugada syndrome the first mutations described in association with brugada syndrome were in a gene responsible for a protein or ion channel that controls the flow of sodium through the cell membrane of heart muscle cells â€“ the sodium channel many of the genetic mutations that have subsequently been described in association with brugada syndrome influence the sodium current in some way , or affect other ionic currents however , a person diagnosed with the condition may be the first in their family to have brugada syndrome if it has arisen as a new mutation the gene in which mutations are most commonly found in brugada syndrome , known as scn5a , is responsible for the cardiac sodium channel however , only 20 % of cases of brugada syndrome are associated with mutations in scn5a , as in the majority of patients with brugada syndrome genetic testing is unable to identify the genetic mutation responsible this variation partially explains the differences in severity of the condition between different persons , ranging from a highly dangerous condition causing death at a young age to a benign condition that may not cause any problems at all however , the genetics of brugada syndrome are complex , and it is likely that the condition results from the interactions of many genes the genes associated with brugada syndrome and their description include : some mutations associated with brugada syndrome can also cause other heart conditions an example of an overlap syndrome is brugada and long qt syndrome ( lqt3 ) caused by a mutation in scn5a that reduces the peak sodium current but simultaneously leaves a persistent current leak some argue that the main reason these arrhythmias arise is due to abnormally slow electrical conduction in areas of the heart , specifically the right ventricle the genetic variants associated with brs support the concept as scn5a , the gene most commonly associated with the condition , along with scn10a , scn1b , scn2b and scn3b , all directly affect the sodium current i na i na causes the initial rapid upstroke of the action potential ( phase 0 ) , and decreasing the early peak current , as occurs in brs-associated genetic variants , leads to slowing of the electrical conduction through the heart muscle whilst the heart of those with brugada syndrome may look normal , scarring or fibrosis is often seen in particular regions of the heart , specifically the right ventricular outflow tract right brugada syndrome is diagnosed by identifying characteristic patterns on an electrocardiogram three forms of the brugada ecg pattern have historically been described , although the type 3 pattern is no longer used in contemporary practice the first line of treatment , suitable for all people with brugada syndrome regardless of their risk of arrhythmias , is lifestyle advice although the abnormal heart rhythms seen in brugada syndrome are generally more likely to occur at rest or even during sleep , some people with brugada syndrome experience arrhythmias during strenuous exercise brugada syndrome is named after the spanish cardiologists josep and pedro brugada who described the condition in 1992 , although the association between the characteristic ecg pattern and sudden cardiac death had been reported in 1989 the first genetic mutations affecting the scn5a gene associated with the syndrome were identified by their brother ramon brugada in 1998 , with many more mutations affecting at least 19 genes subsequently identified by others

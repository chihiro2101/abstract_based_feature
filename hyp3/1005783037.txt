for aesthetic reasons , the support structure is constructed from hollow cor-ten steel masts file : brussel midi ms96.jpg brussels-south , overhead wires suspended across multiple tracks file : roofride kyiv.jpg 3 kv dc overhead catenary in kiev electric trains that collect their current from overhead lines use a device such as a pantograph , bow collector or trolley pole it presses against the underside of the lowest overhead wire , the contact wire current collectors are electrically conductive and allow current to flow through to the train or tram and back to the feeder station through the steel wheels on one or both running rails non-electric locomotives ( such as diesels ) may pass along these tracks without affecting the overhead line , although there may be difficulties with structure gauge alternative electrical power transmission schemes for trains include third rail , ground-level power supply , batteries and electromagnetic induction this wire approximates the natural path of a wire strung between two points , a catenary curve , thus the use of '' catenary '' to describe this wire or sometimes the whole system the whole system is then subjected to mechanical tension as the pantograph moves along under the contact wire , the carbon insert on top of the pantograph becomes worn with time the zigzagging of the overhead line is not required for trolley poles for tramways , a contact wire without a messenger wire is used when overhead line systems were first conceived , good current collection was possible only at low speeds , using a single wire droppers support the auxiliary from the messenger wire , while additional droppers support the contact wire from the auxiliary earlier dropper wires provided physical support of the contact wire without joining the catenary and contact wires electrically a simpler system was proposed in the 1970s by the pirelli construction company , consisting of a single wire embedded at each support for of its length in a clipped , extruded aluminum beam with the wire contact face exposed trams and railways use the overhead line as one side of the circuit and the steel rails as the other side of the circuit trolleybuses use a second parallel overhead line for the return , and two trolley poles , one contacting each overhead wire ( pantographs are generally incompatible with parallel overhead lines parallel overhead wires are also used on the rare railways with three-phase ac railway electrification pp , 186-7 for the contact wire , cold drawn solid copper was used to insure good conductivity the messenger ( or catenary ) wire needs to be both strong and have good conductivity they used multi-strand wires ( or cables ) with 19 strands in each cable ( or wire ) tensioning the line makes waves travel faster , and also reduces sag from gravity for medium and high speeds , the wires are generally tensioned by weights or occasionally by hydraulic tensioners where weights are used , they slide up and down on a rod or tube attached to the mast , to prevent them from swaying for low speeds and in tunnels where temperatures are constant , fixed termination ( ft ) equipment may be used , with the wires terminated directly on structures at each end of the overhead line with at the continuous length of overhead line is limited due to the change in the height of the weights as the overhead line expands and contracts with temperature changes if tension is lost the pulley falls back toward the mast , and one of its teeth jams against the stop this stops further rotation , limits the damage , and keeps the undamaged part of the wire intact until it can be repaired the transition from section to section is known as a '' section break '' and is set up so that the vehicle 's pantograph is in continuous contact with one wire or the other the two wires do not touch ( although the bow collector or pantograph is briefly in contact with both wires ) in normal service , the two sections are electrically connected ; depending on the system this might be an isolator , fixed contact or a booster transformer ) the driver of the tram or trolleybus must temporarily reduce the power draw before the trolley pole passes through , to prevent arc damage to the insulator the locomotive would become trapped , but as it passes the section break the pantograph briefly shorts the two catenary lines even if the catenary is properly grounded to protect the personnel , the arc generated across the pantograph can damage the pantograph , the catenary insulator or both for these reasons neutral sections are placed in the electrification between the sections fed from different points in a national grid , or different phases , or grids which are not synchronized thumb trams draw their power from a single overhead wire at about 500 to 750 v some three-phase ac railways used three overhead wires to be able to use different electric systems on shared tracks , the sihltal line has its overhead wire right above the train , whilst the uetliberg line has its overhead wire off to one side this can result in poor electrical contact between the collector and the overhead line , resulting in electrical arcing and power surges the trams had bipolar overhead lines , consisting of two u-pipes , in which the pantographs hung and ran like shuttles

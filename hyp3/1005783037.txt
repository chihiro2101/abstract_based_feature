for aesthetic reasons , the support structure is constructed from hollow cor-ten steel masts file : roofride kyiv.jpg 3 kv dc overhead catenary in kiev electric trains that collect their current from overhead lines use a device such as a pantograph , bow collector or trolley pole it presses against the underside of the lowest overhead wire , the contact wire non-electric locomotives ( such as diesels ) may pass along these tracks without affecting the overhead line , although there may be difficulties with structure gauge this is usually achieved by supporting the contact wire from a second wire known as the ( in the us & canada ) or catenary ( in the uk ) this wire approximates the natural path of a wire strung between two points , a catenary curve , thus the use of '' catenary '' to describe this wire or sometimes the whole system this wire is attached to the contact wire at regular intervals by vertical wires known as '' droppers '' or '' drop wires '' as the pantograph moves along under the contact wire , the carbon insert on top of the pantograph becomes worn with time on curves , the '' straight '' wire between the supports causes the contact point to cross over the surface of the pantograph as the train travels around the curve for tramways , a contact wire without a messenger wire is used depot areas tend to have only a single wire and are known as '' simple equipment '' or '' trolley wire '' when overhead line systems were first conceived , good current collection was possible only at low speeds , using a single wire compound equipment uses a second support wire , known as the '' auxiliary '' , between the messenger/catenary wire and the contact wire droppers support the auxiliary from the messenger wire , while additional droppers support the contact wire from the auxiliary the auxiliary wire can be of a more conductive but less wear-resistant metal , increasing transmission efficiency trams and railways use the overhead line as one side of the circuit and the steel rails as the other side of the circuit for a trolleybus or a trolleytruck , no rails are available for the return current , as the vehicles use rubber tyres on the road surface trolleybuses use a second parallel overhead line for the return , and two trolley poles , one contacting each overhead wire ; '' беседы об электрической железной дороге '' ( discussions about the electric railway ) москва , '' транспорт '' , 1989 the wire is not round but has grooves at the sides to allow the hangers to attach to it to make the wire stronger , 0.04 % tin might be added they used multi-strand wires ( or cables ) with 19 strands in each cable ( or wire ) copper , aluminum , and/or steel were used for the strands an additional issue with at equipment is that , if balance weights are attached to both ends , the whole tension length is free to move along the track a tension length can be seen as a fixed centre point , with the two half-tension lengths expanding and contracting with temperature most systems include a brake to stop the wires from unravelling completely if a wire breaks or tension is lost this stops further rotation , limits the damage , and keeps the undamaged part of the wire intact until it can be repaired to allow maintenance to the overhead line without having to turn off the entire system , the line is broken into electrically separated portions known as '' sections '' the two wires do not touch ( although the bow collector or pantograph is briefly in contact with both wires ) in normal service , the two sections are electrically connected ; depending on the system this might be an isolator , fixed contact or a booster transformer ) on overhead wires designed for trolley poles this is done by having a neutral section between the wires , requiring an insulator the driver of the tram or trolleybus must temporarily reduce the power draw before the trolley pole passes through , to prevent arc damage to the insulator if the opposite line is de-energized , this voltage transient may trip supply breakers if the line is under maintenance , injury may occur as the catenary is suddenly energized given limited clearance such as in tunnels , the overhead wire may be replaced by a rigid overhead rail in a movable bridge that uses a rigid overhead rail , there is a need to transition from the catenary wire system into an overhead conductor rail at the bridge portal ( the last post before the movable bridge ) they have mechanical switching arrangements ( changeover switch ) to switch the 1,500 v dc overhead of the railway and the 650 v dc of the trams , called a tram square some railways used two or three overhead lines , usually to carry three-phase current some three-phase ac railways used three overhead wires the wiring in most countries is too low to allow double stack container trains such considerations have driven the move towards replacing overhead power and communications lines with buried cables where possible the trams had bipolar overhead lines , consisting of two u-pipes , in which the pantographs hung and ran like shuttles

'' беседы об электрической железной дороге '' ( discussions about the electric railway ) москва , '' транспорт '' , 1989 they used multi-strand wires ( or cables ) with 19 strands in each cable ( or wire ) all the 19 strands could be of the same metal or some strands could be of steel for strength with the remaining strands of aluminum or copper for conductivity either method is known as '' auto-tensioning '' ( at ) or '' constant tension '' and ensures that the tension is virtually independent of temperature with at the continuous length of overhead line is limited due to the change in the height of the weights as the overhead line expands and contracts with temperature changes for most 25 kv ohl equipment in the uk , the maximum tension length is to allow maintenance to the overhead line without having to turn off the entire system , the line is broken into electrically separated portions known as '' sections '' the transition from section to section is known as a '' section break '' and is set up so that the vehicle 's pantograph is in continuous contact with one wire or the other for bow collectors and pantographs , this is done by having two contact wires run side by side over the length between 2 or 4 wire supports pantograph-equipped locomotives must not run through a section break when one side is de-energized the locomotive would become trapped , but as it passes the section break the pantograph briefly shorts the two catenary lines even if the catenary is properly grounded to protect the personnel , the arc generated across the pantograph can damage the pantograph , the catenary insulator or both sometimes on a larger electrified railway , tramway or trolleybus system it is necessary to power different areas of track from different power grids , without guaranteeing synchronisation of the phases trolleybuses draw from two overhead wires at a similar voltage , and at least one of the trolleybus wires must be insulated from tram wires they have mechanical switching arrangements ( changeover switch ) to switch the 1,500 v dc overhead of the railway and the 650 v dc of the trams , called a tram square some railways used two or three overhead lines , usually to carry three-phase current a catenary is a system of overhead wires used to supply electricity to a locomotive , tram ( streetcar ) , or light rail vehicle that is equipped with a pantograph the height of overhead line can create hazards at level crossings , where it may be struck by road vehicles in october 1883 , the first permanent tram service with overhead lines was on the mödling and hinterbrühl tram in austria

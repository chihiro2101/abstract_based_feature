g acceleration for a trolleybus or a trolleytruck , no rails are available for the return current , as the vehicles use rubber tyres on the road surface trolleybuses use a second parallel overhead line for the return , and two trolley poles , one contacting each overhead wire ( pantographs are generally incompatible with parallel overhead lines parallel overhead wires are also used on the rare railways with three-phase ac railway electrification in the soviet union the following types of wires/cables were used pp , 186-7 for the contact wire , cold drawn solid copper was used to insure good conductivity the messenger ( or catenary ) wire needs to be both strong and have good conductivity to avoid this a midpoint anchor ( mpa ) , close to the centre of the tension length , restricts movement of the messenger/catenary wire by anchoring it ; the contact wire and its suspension hangers can move only within the constraints of the mpa if tension is lost the pulley falls back toward the mast , and one of its teeth jams against the stop to allow maintenance to the overhead line without having to turn off the entire system , the line is broken into electrically separated portions known as '' sections '' the two wires do not touch ( although the bow collector or pantograph is briefly in contact with both wires ) on overhead wires designed for trolley poles this is done by having a neutral section between the wires , requiring an insulator the driver of the tram or trolleybus must temporarily reduce the power draw before the trolley pole passes through , to prevent arc damage to the insulator sometimes on a larger electrified railway , tramway or trolleybus system it is necessary to power different areas of track from different power grids , without guaranteeing synchronisation of the phases ) the grids may be synchronised on a normal basis , but events may interrupt synchronisation given limited clearance such as in tunnels , the overhead wire may be replaced by a rigid overhead rail the catenary wire typically comprises messenger wire ( also called catenary wire ) and a contact wire where it meets the pantograph the gap is required for the swing bridge to be opened and closed to connect the conductor rails together when the bridge is closed , there is another conductor rail section called '' rotary overlap '' that is equipped with a motor trolleybuses draw from two overhead wires at a similar voltage , and at least one of the trolleybus wires must be insulated from tram wires this is usually done by the trolleybus wires running continuously through the crossing , with the tram conductors a few centimetres lower to be able to use different electric systems on shared tracks , the sihltal line has its overhead wire right above the train , whilst the uetliberg line has its overhead wire off to one side the catenary or messenger wire is hung at a specific tension between line structures , and a second wire is held in tension by the messenger wire , attached to it at frequent intervals by clamps and connecting wires known as droppers part of the boston , massachusetts blue line through the northeast suburbs uses overhead lines , as does the green line the height of overhead line can create hazards at level crossings , where it may be struck by road vehicles many people consider overhead lines to be '' visual pollution '' , due to the many support structures and complicated system of wires and cables that fill the air

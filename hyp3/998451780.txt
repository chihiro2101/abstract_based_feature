each competitor climbs onto a horse , which is held in a small pipe or wooden enclosure called a bucking chute when the rider is ready , the gate of the bucking chute is opened and the horse bursts out and begins to buck the rider attempts to stay on the horse for eight seconds without touching the horse with their free hand a horse who bucks in a spectacular and effective manner will score more points than a horse who bucks in a straight line with no significant changes of direction the saddle bronc rider grips a simple rein braided from cotton or polyester and attached to a leather halter worn by the horse the rider lifts on the rein and attempts to find a rhythm with the animal by spurring forwards and backwards with their feet in a sweeping motion from shoulder to flank the bareback rider does not use a saddle or rein , but uses a rigging that consists of a leather and rawhide composite piece often compared to a suitcase handle attached to a surcingle and placed just behind the horse 's withers the rider leans back and spurs with an up and down motion from the horse 's point of shoulder toward the rigging handle , spurring at each jump in rhythm with the motion of the horse bareback bronc riding began to develop as a professional rodeo sporting event around 1900 others held a loose or twisted rope tied around the horse 's girth , and other methods involved using multiple handhold leather riggings based on a surcingle in the early 1920s , when the old rodeo rules allowing two handed riding were being phased out and replaced with the newer rule of riding with one hand in the rigging and one hand in the air , earl bascom invented , designed and made rodeo 's first one-hand bareback rigging basic injuries occurred at a rate of 0.072 percent , or one in 1,405 , with injuries requiring veterinary attention at 0.036 percent , or one injury in every 2810 times the animal was used , and transport , yarding and competition were all included in the study a later prca survey of 60,971 animal performances at 198 rodeo performances and 73 sections of '' slack '' indicated 27 animals were injured , again approximately five-hundredths of 1 percent â€“ 0.0004 while it is accurate that some rough stock animals are slaughtered for horsemeat at the end of their useful careers , other bucking horses are retired at the end of their rodeo usefulness and allowed to live into old age rodeo bucking horse bronco

the exact underlying mechanism of febrile seizures is still unknown , but it is thought to be multi-factorial involving genetic and environmental factors other proposed mechanisms include the interactions of inflammation , particularly cytokines , which are released during a fever , causing elevated temperatures in the brain , which may somehow lead to a seizure diagnosis involves gathering a detailed history including the value of highest temperature recorded , timing of seizure and fever , seizure characteristics , time to return to baseline , vaccination history , illness exposures , family history , etc electrolyte imbalances ) , cns trauma , drug use and/or withdrawal , genetic conditions ( i.e gefs+ ) , fires , shivering , febrile delirium , febrile myoclonus , breath-holding spell , and convulsive syncope however , febrile seizures are still the most likely cause of convulsions in children under the age of 5 years old there is no evidence to support administering fever reducing medications such as acetaminophen at the time of a febrile seizure or to prevent the rate of recurrence seek immediate medical attention if this is the child 's first febrile seizure and take the child to the doctor once the seizure has ended to check for the cause of the fever those who have one febrile seizure have an approximately 30- 40 % chance of having another one in the next two years , with the risk being greater in those who are younger similarly , the prognosis after a complex febrile seizure is excellent , although an increased risk of death has been shown for complex febrile seizures , partly related to underlying conditions

the exact underlying mechanism of febrile seizures is still unknown , but it is thought to be multi-factorial involving genetic and environmental factors the increased activity of neurons during rapid brain development , may help explain why children , particularly younger than age 3 , are prone to febrile seizures , with occurrences decreasing after age 5 the diagnosis is made by eliminating more serious causes of seizure and fever : in particular , meningitis and encephalitis diagnosis involves gathering a detailed history including the value of highest temperature recorded , timing of seizure and fever , seizure characteristics , time to return to baseline , vaccination history , illness exposures , family history , etc however , lumbar puncture is an option that may be considered in children younger than 12 months of age since signs and symptoms of meningitis may be atypical , if the child does not return to baseline , or if the child lacks immunization against haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcal or vaccination status is unknown however , febrile seizures are still the most likely cause of convulsions in children under the age of 5 years old seek immediate medical attention if this is the child 's first febrile seizure and take the child to the doctor once the seizure has ended to check for the cause of the fever those who have one febrile seizure have an approximately 30- 40 % chance of having another one in the next two years , with the risk being greater in those who are younger similarly , the prognosis after a complex febrile seizure is excellent , although an increased risk of death has been shown for complex febrile seizures , partly related to underlying conditions the peak age for a febrile seizure is 18 months , with the most common age range being 12â€“30 months of age

the exact underlying mechanism of febrile seizures is still unknown , but it is thought to be multi-factorial involving genetic and environmental factors the increased activity of neurons during rapid brain development , may help explain why children , particularly younger than age 3 , are prone to febrile seizures , with occurrences decreasing after age 5 other proposed mechanisms include the interactions of inflammation , particularly cytokines , which are released during a fever , causing elevated temperatures in the brain , which may somehow lead to a seizure the diagnosis is made by eliminating more serious causes of seizure and fever : in particular , meningitis and encephalitis however , for complex febrile seizures , eeg and imaging with an mri of the brain may be helpful however , febrile seizures are still the most likely cause of convulsions in children under the age of 5 years old there is no evidence to support administering fever reducing medications such as acetaminophen at the time of a febrile seizure or to prevent the rate of recurrence if a child is having a febrile seizure , the following recommendations are made for caregivers : note the start time of the seizure those who have one febrile seizure have an approximately 30- 40 % chance of having another one in the next two years , with the risk being greater in those who are younger similarly , the prognosis after a complex febrile seizure is excellent , although an increased risk of death has been shown for complex febrile seizures , partly related to underlying conditions

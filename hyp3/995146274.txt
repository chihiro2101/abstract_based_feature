the exact underlying mechanism of febrile seizures is still unknown , but it is thought to be multi-factorial involving genetic and environmental factors the increased activity of neurons during rapid brain development , may help explain why children , particularly younger than age 3 , are prone to febrile seizures , with occurrences decreasing after age 5 specific cytokines implicated include elevated csf il-1Î² and serum il-6 however , for complex febrile seizures , eeg and imaging with an mri of the brain may be helpful however , febrile seizures are still the most likely cause of convulsions in children under the age of 5 years old there is no benefit from the use of phenytoin , valproate , pyridoxine , ibuprofen , zinc sulfate , diclofenac , or paracetamol there is a decrease of recurrent febrile seizures with intermittent diazepam and phenobarbital but there is a high rate of adverse effects those who have one febrile seizure have an approximately 30- 40 % chance of having another one in the next two years , with the risk being greater in those who are younger similarly , the prognosis after a complex febrile seizure is excellent , although an increased risk of death has been shown for complex febrile seizures , partly related to underlying conditions febrile seizures can occur in any ethnic group , although there have been higher rates in guamanians ( 14 % ) , japanese ( 6-9 % ) and indians ( 5-10 % ) .

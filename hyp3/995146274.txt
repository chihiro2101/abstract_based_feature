the exact underlying mechanism of febrile seizures is still unknown , but it is thought to be multi-factorial involving genetic and environmental factors the increased activity of neurons during rapid brain development , may help explain why children , particularly younger than age 3 , are prone to febrile seizures , with occurrences decreasing after age 5 however , for complex febrile seizures , eeg and imaging with an mri of the brain may be helpful however , febrile seizures are still the most likely cause of convulsions in children under the age of 5 years old there is a decrease of recurrent febrile seizures with intermittent diazepam and phenobarbital but there is a high rate of adverse effects if a child is having a febrile seizure , the following recommendations are made for caregivers : note the start time of the seizure seek immediate medical attention if this is the child 's first febrile seizure and take the child to the doctor once the seizure has ended to check for the cause of the fever those who have one febrile seizure have an approximately 30- 40 % chance of having another one in the next two years , with the risk being greater in those who are younger similarly , the prognosis after a complex febrile seizure is excellent , although an increased risk of death has been shown for complex febrile seizures , partly related to underlying conditions febrile seizures can occur in any ethnic group , although there have been higher rates in guamanians ( 14 % ) , japanese ( 6-9 % ) and indians ( 5-10 % ) .

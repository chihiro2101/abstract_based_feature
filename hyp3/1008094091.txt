in earlier forms of the roman rite ( the pre-novus ordo forms ) , some of which are still in use , a requiem mass differs in several ways from the usual mass some parts that were of relatively recent origin , including some that have been excluded in the 1970 revision of the regular mass , are omitted examples are the psalm iudica at the start of mass , the prayer said by the priest before reading the gospel ( or the blessing of the deacon , if a deacon reads it ) , and the first of the two prayers of the priest for himself before receiving communion ite missa est is replaced with requiescant in pace ( may they rest in peace ) ; the '' deo gratias '' response is replaced with '' amen '' in the liturgical reforms of the mid-20th century in the roman catholic church following the novus ordo second vatican council , there was a significant shift in the funeral rites used by the church the term '' requiem mass '' was often replaced by the term '' mass of the resurrection '' or mass of christian burial , although the former was never official terminology in the official english ritual , order of christian funerals , published by the roman catholic bishops of england and wales in 1990 , the title is given as '' funeral mass '' requiem mass remains a suitable title for other masses for the dead and for the funeral mass itself , ( as the proper antiphons remain in force , introit : '' eternal rest grant '' / '' requiem æternam dona eis domine '' ; offertory : '' lord jesus christ , king of glory , deliver the souls of all the faithful departed '' / '' lux æterna luceat eis , domine the texts used for the service experienced a similar change , with more options for the readings , some of which reinforce an overall theme of the promise of eternal life made by jesus requiem is also used to describe any sacred composition that sets to music religious texts which would be appropriate at a funeral , or to describe such compositions for liturgies other than the roman catholic mass among the earliest examples of this type are the german settings composed in the 17th century by heinrich schütz and michael praetorius , whose works are lutheran adaptations of the roman catholic requiem , and which provided inspiration for the mighty german requiem by brahms such works include : greek orthodox church—parastas russian orthodox church—panikhida anglican ( english ) requiem however , at least in the russian liturgical tradition , a requiem will often be served on the eve before the glorification ( canonization ) of a saint , in a special service known as the '' last panikhida '' the book of common prayer contained no requiem mass , but instead a service named '' the order for the burial of the dead '' prior to these additions , anglo-catholics or high church anglicans often incorporate parts of the roman catholic requiem mass as part of a funeral service—typically passages from the ordinary of the mass the text of these seven sentences , from the 1662 book of common prayer , is as follows : i am the resurrection and the life , saith the lord : he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live : and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die many of the texts in the requiem mass have been set to music , including : introit kyrie gradual tract sequence ( the dies irae ) offertory sanctus agnus dei communion pie jesu libera me in paradisum in the 16th century , more and more composers set the requiem mass 48 ( 1887–90 ) frederick delius : requiem ( 1913–16 ) maurice duruflé : requiem , op john rutter combines in his requiem ( 1985 ) some of the parts of the latin requiem with two complete psalms , psalm 130 '' out of the deep '' and his earlier composition the lord is my shepherd , and juxtaposes more biblical verses within the latin movements

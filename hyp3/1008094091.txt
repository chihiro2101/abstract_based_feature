in earlier forms of the roman rite ( the pre-novus ordo forms ) , some of which are still in use , a requiem mass differs in several ways from the usual mass examples are the psalm iudica at the start of mass , the prayer said by the priest before reading the gospel ( or the blessing of the deacon , if a deacon reads it ) , and the first of the two prayers of the priest for himself before receiving communion missale romanum , ritus servandus in celebratione missae , xiii other omissions include the use of incense at the introit and the gospel , the kiss of peace , lit candles held by acolytes when a deacon chants the gospel , and blessings there is no gloria in excelsis deo and no recitation of the credo ; the alleluia chant before the gospel is replaced by a tract , as in lent ; and the agnus dei is altered as its opening words dies irae ( '' day of wrath '' ) indicate , this poetic composition speaks of the day of judgment in fearsome terms ; it then appeals to jesus for mercy in the liturgical reforms of the mid-20th century in the roman catholic church following the novus ordo second vatican council , there was a significant shift in the funeral rites used by the church the term '' requiem mass '' was often replaced by the term '' mass of the resurrection '' or mass of christian burial , although the former was never official terminology requiem mass remains a suitable title for other masses for the dead and for the funeral mass itself , ( as the proper antiphons remain in force , introit : '' eternal rest grant '' / '' requiem æternam dona eis domine '' ; offertory : '' lord jesus christ , king of glory , deliver the souls of all the faithful departed requiem in other rites and churches requiem is also used to describe any sacred composition that sets to music religious texts which would be appropriate at a funeral , or to describe such compositions for liturgies other than the roman catholic mass among the earliest examples of this type are the german settings composed in the 17th century by heinrich schütz and michael praetorius , whose works are lutheran adaptations of the roman catholic requiem , and which provided inspiration for the mighty german requiem by brahms a rather exhaustive list of requiem composers can be found at requiem survey : requiemsurvey.org the book of common prayer contained no requiem mass , but instead a service named '' the order for the burial of the dead '' prior to these additions , anglo-catholics or high church anglicans often incorporate parts of the roman catholic requiem mass as part of a funeral service—typically passages from the ordinary of the mass the text of these seven sentences , from the 1662 book of common prayer , is as follows : i am the resurrection and the life , saith the lord : he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live : and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die many of the texts in the requiem mass have been set to music , including : introit kyrie gradual tract sequence ( the dies irae ) offertory sanctus agnus dei communion pie jesu libera me in paradisum the requiem by johannes ockeghem , written sometime in the latter half of the 15th century , is the earliest surviving polyphony setting in the early polyphonic settings of the requiem , there is considerable textural contrast within the compositions themselves : simple chordal or fauxbourdon-like passages are contrasted with other sections of contrapuntal complexity , such as in the offertory of ockeghem 's requiem 5 ( 1837 ) anton bruckner : requiem , wab 39 ( 1849 ) johannes brahms : a german requiem , op john rutter combines in his requiem ( 1985 ) some of the parts of the latin requiem with two complete psalms , psalm 130 '' out of the deep '' and his earlier composition the lord is my shepherd , and juxtaposes more biblical verses within the latin movements some composers have written purely instrumental works bearing the title of requiem , as famously exemplified by britten 's sinfonia da requiem

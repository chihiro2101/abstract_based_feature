rex was organized by new orleans businessmen in part to put on a spectacle in honor of the new orleans visit of grand duke alexei alexandrovich of russia ( remembered locally as '' grand duke alexis '' ) during the 1872 carnival season rex has held more parades in new orleans than any other krewe this was adopted because the grand duke alexis of russia had a fondness for the actress who sang the song in the musical , which was playing in new orleans at the time of the first rex parade in 1872 traditionally , the secretive membership was restricted to new orleans residents of european ancestry for most of its history , typically being elected from the membership rolls of the boston club including the first rex , louis solomon a jewish businessman rex decided to comply with the new ordinance , rather than disappear from the main event of mardi gras day the rex organization and the mistick krewe of comus still hold their annual balls together on mardi gras night the theme for each year 's parade is decided more than a year in advance , and as soon as the parade is over on mardi gras day , float artists begin work on the next year 's parade the mayor of new orleans traditionally hands over a magnum sized dong a big one fr of new orleans to rex for mardi gras day in addition to its famous parade , the rex organization also holds a private ball for its membership and invited guests on mardi gras night a rich tradition is that comus of the mistick krewe of comus extends an invitation to rex and his queen to join him and his consort at the comus ball in 1900 boeuf gras was taken out of the rex parade as it was thought outsiders to traditional mardi gras would not understand

in 1886 , adolf mayer first described the tobacco mosaic disease that could be transferred between plants , similar to bacterial infections in 1892 , dmitri ivanovsky gave the first concrete evidence for the existence of a non-bacterial infectious agent , showing that infected sap remained infectious even after filtering through the finest chamberland filters later , in 1903 , ivanovsky published a paper describing abnormal crystal intracellular inclusions in the host cells of the affected tobacco plants and argued the connection between these inclusions and the infectious agent however , ivanovsky remained rather convinced , despite repeated failures to produce evidence , that the causal agent was an unculturable bacterium , too small to be retained on the employed chamberland filters and to be detected in the light microscope in 1898 , martinus beijerinck independently replicated ivanovsky 's filtration experiments and then showed that the infectious agent was able to reproduce and multiply in the host cells of the tobacco plant paul , minnesota ) beijerinck coined the term of '' virus '' to indicate that the causal agent of tobacco mosaic disease was of non-bacterial nature tobacco mosaic virus was the first virus to be crystallized in 1958 , she speculated that the virus was hollow , not solid , and hypothesized that the rna of tmv is single-stranded the 4 genes encode a replicase ( with methyltransferase mt and rna helicase hel domains ) , an rna-dependent rna polymerase , a so-called movement protein ( mp ) and a capsid ( cp ) tmv is a thermostable virus with the direct contact with host plants through its vectors ( normally insects such as aphids and leafhoppers ) , tmv will go through the infection process and then the replication process the infection spreads by direct contact to the neighbouring cells , for its smooth entry , tmv produces a 30 kda movement protein called p30 which enlarges the plasmodesmata although tmv does not have defined transmission vectors , the virus can be easily transmitted from the infected hosts to the healthy plants , by human handling then the viral genome will further replicate to produce multiple mrnas via a -rna intermediate primed by the trna his at the +rna 3 ' end after the coat protein and rna genome of tmv have been synthesized , they spontaneously assemble into complete tmv virions in a highly organized process this constitutes one of the most destructive phases of tobacco mosaic virus infection addition of tmv to a battery electrode increases the reactive surface area by an order of magnitude , resulting in an increase in the battery 's capacity by up to six times compared to a planar electrode geometry .

in 1886 , adolf mayer first described the tobacco mosaic disease that could be transferred between plants , similar to bacterial infections in 1892 , dmitri ivanovsky gave the first concrete evidence for the existence of a non-bacterial infectious agent , showing that infected sap remained infectious even after filtering through the finest chamberland filters later , in 1903 , ivanovsky published a paper describing abnormal crystal intracellular inclusions in the host cells of the affected tobacco plants and argued the connection between these inclusions and the infectious agent tobacco mosaic virus was the first virus to be crystallized it was achieved by wendell meredith stanley in 1935 who also showed that tmv remains active even after crystallization for his work , he was awarded 1/4 of the nobel prize in chemistry in 1946 , even though it was later shown some of his conclusions ( in particular , that the crystals were pure protein , and assembled by autocatalysis ) were incorrect in 1958 , she speculated that the virus was hollow , not solid , and hypothesized that the rna of tmv is single-stranded tmv is a thermostable virus on a dried leaf , it can withstand up to 50 & nbsp ; Â°c ( 120 degree fahrenheit ) for 30 minutes with the direct contact with host plants through its vectors ( normally insects such as aphids and leafhoppers ) , tmv will go through the infection process and then the replication process the infection spreads by direct contact to the neighbouring cells , for its smooth entry , tmv produces a 30 kda movement protein called p30 which enlarges the plasmodesmata although tmv does not have defined transmission vectors , the virus can be easily transmitted from the infected hosts to the healthy plants , by human handling following entry into its host via mechanical inoculation , tmv uncoats itself to release its viral +rna strand then the viral genome will further replicate to produce multiple mrnas via a -rna intermediate primed by the trna his at the +rna 3 ' end this constitutes one of the most destructive phases of tobacco mosaic virus infection however , if tmv infects crops like grape and apple , it is almost symptomless it was hypothesized that the tmv genome will be re-coated rapidly upon entering the host cell , thus it prevents the initiation of tmv replication

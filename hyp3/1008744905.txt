in 1886 , adolf mayer first described the tobacco mosaic disease that could be transferred between plants , similar to bacterial infections paul , minnesota : american phytopathological society ) no in 1892 , dmitri ivanovsky gave the first concrete evidence for the existence of a non-bacterial infectious agent , showing that infected sap remained infectious even after filtering through the finest chamberland filters however , ivanovsky remained rather convinced , despite repeated failures to produce evidence , that the causal agent was an unculturable bacterium , too small to be retained on the employed chamberland filters and to be detected in the light microscope in 1898 , martinus beijerinck independently replicated ivanovsky 's filtration experiments and then showed that the infectious agent was able to reproduce and multiply in the host cells of the tobacco plant paul , minnesota ) beijerinck coined the term of '' virus '' to indicate that the causal agent of tobacco mosaic disease was of non-bacterial nature tobacco mosaic virus was the first virus to be crystallized for his work , he was awarded 1/4 of the nobel prize in chemistry in 1946 , even though it was later shown some of his conclusions ( in particular , that the crystals were pure protein , and assembled by autocatalysis ) were incorrect in 1955 , heinz fraenkel-conrat and robley williams showed that purified tmv rna and its capsid ( coat ) protein assemble by themselves to functional viruses , indicating that this is the most stable structure ( the one with the lowest free energy ) rather , it will over-winter in infected tobacco stalks and leaves in the soil , on the surface of contaminated seed ( tmv can even survive in contaminated tobacco products for many years ) as uncoating occurs , the methel : pol gene is translated to make the capping enzyme methel and the rna polymerase as the rod lengthens , the rna passes through a channel in its center and forms a loop at the growing end tobacco mosaic virus has been known to cause a production loss for flue cured tobacco of up to two percent in north carolina the first symptom of this virus disease is a light green coloration between the veins of young leaves this constitutes one of the most destructive phases of tobacco mosaic virus infection furthermore , the cross protection method can be administered , where the stronger strain of tmv infection is inhibited by infecting the host plant with mild strain of tmv , similar to the effect of a vaccine watson , in his memoir the double helix , cites his x-ray investigation of tmv 's helical structure as an important step in deducing the nature of the dna molecule

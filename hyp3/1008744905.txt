in 1886 , adolf mayer first described the tobacco mosaic disease that could be transferred between plants , similar to bacterial infections in 1892 , dmitri ivanovsky gave the first concrete evidence for the existence of a non-bacterial infectious agent , showing that infected sap remained infectious even after filtering through the finest chamberland filters later , in 1903 , ivanovsky published a paper describing abnormal crystal intracellular inclusions in the host cells of the affected tobacco plants and argued the connection between these inclusions and the infectious agent in 1898 , martinus beijerinck independently replicated ivanovsky 's filtration experiments and then showed that the infectious agent was able to reproduce and multiply in the host cells of the tobacco plant paul , minnesota ) beijerinck coined the term of '' virus '' to indicate that the causal agent of tobacco mosaic disease was of non-bacterial nature tobacco mosaic virus was the first virus to be crystallized the first electron microscopical images of tmv were made in 1939 by gustav kausche , edgar pfankuch and helmut ruska – the brother of nobel prize winner ernst ruska in 1958 , she speculated that the virus was hollow , not solid , and hypothesized that the rna of tmv is single-stranded ; inside the capsid helix , near the core , is the coiled rna molecule , which is made up of 6,395 ±10 nucleotides the tmv genome consists of a 6.3–6.5 kb single-stranded ( ss ) rna rather , it will over-winter in infected tobacco stalks and leaves in the soil , on the surface of contaminated seed ( tmv can even survive in contaminated tobacco products for many years ) the infection spreads by direct contact to the neighbouring cells , for its smooth entry , tmv produces a 30 kda movement protein called p30 which enlarges the plasmodesmata moreover , tmv can be transmitted from one plant to another by direct contact following entry into its host via mechanical inoculation , tmv uncoats itself to release its viral +rna strand after the coat protein and rna genome of tmv have been synthesized , they spontaneously assemble into complete tmv virions in a highly organized process furthermore , the cross protection method can be administered , where the stronger strain of tmv infection is inhibited by infecting the host plant with mild strain of tmv , similar to the effect of a vaccine in the past ten years , the application of genetic engineering on a host plant genome has been developed to allow the host plant to produce the tmv coat protein within their cells

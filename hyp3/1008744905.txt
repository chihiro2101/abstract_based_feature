in 1886 , adolf mayer first described the tobacco mosaic disease that could be transferred between plants , similar to bacterial infections paul , minnesota : american phytopathological society ) no paul , minnesota : american phytopathological society ) no later , in 1903 , ivanovsky published a paper describing abnormal crystal intracellular inclusions in the host cells of the affected tobacco plants and argued the connection between these inclusions and the infectious agent in 1898 , martinus beijerinck independently replicated ivanovsky 's filtration experiments and then showed that the infectious agent was able to reproduce and multiply in the host cells of the tobacco plant paul , minnesota ) beijerinck coined the term of '' virus '' to indicate that the causal agent of tobacco mosaic disease was of non-bacterial nature in 1955 , heinz fraenkel-conrat and robley williams showed that purified tmv rna and its capsid ( coat ) protein assemble by themselves to functional viruses , indicating that this is the most stable structure ( the one with the lowest free energy ) the investigations of tobacco mosaic disease and subsequent discovery of its viral nature were instrumental in the establishment of the general concepts of virology the tmv genome consists of a 6.3â€“6.5 kb single-stranded ( ss ) rna rather , it will over-winter in infected tobacco stalks and leaves in the soil , on the surface of contaminated seed ( tmv can even survive in contaminated tobacco products for many years ) with the direct contact with host plants through its vectors ( normally insects such as aphids and leafhoppers ) , tmv will go through the infection process and then the replication process it can also spread through phloem for longer distance movement within the plant moreover , tmv can be transmitted from one plant to another by direct contact following entry into its host via mechanical inoculation , tmv uncoats itself to release its viral +rna strand then the viral genome will further replicate to produce multiple mrnas via a -rna intermediate primed by the trna his at the +rna 3 ' end as for any plant disease , looking for resistant strains against tmv may also be advised in the past ten years , the application of genetic engineering on a host plant genome has been developed to allow the host plant to produce the tmv coat protein within their cells

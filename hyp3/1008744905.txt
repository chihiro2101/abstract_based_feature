in 1886 , adolf mayer first described the tobacco mosaic disease that could be transferred between plants , similar to bacterial infections paul , minnesota : american phytopathological society ) no in 1892 , dmitri ivanovsky gave the first concrete evidence for the existence of a non-bacterial infectious agent , showing that infected sap remained infectious even after filtering through the finest chamberland filters later , in 1903 , ivanovsky published a paper describing abnormal crystal intracellular inclusions in the host cells of the affected tobacco plants and argued the connection between these inclusions and the infectious agent in 1898 , martinus beijerinck independently replicated ivanovsky 's filtration experiments and then showed that the infectious agent was able to reproduce and multiply in the host cells of the tobacco plant paul , minnesota ) beijerinck coined the term of '' virus '' to indicate that the causal agent of tobacco mosaic disease was of non-bacterial nature tobacco mosaic virus was the first virus to be crystallized the crystallographer rosalind franklin worked for stanley for about a month at berkeley , and later designed and built a model of tmv for the 1958 world 's fair at brussels in 1958 , she speculated that the virus was hollow , not solid , and hypothesized that the rna of tmv is single-stranded the investigations of tobacco mosaic disease and subsequent discovery of its viral nature were instrumental in the establishment of the general concepts of virology ; inside the capsid helix , near the core , is the coiled rna molecule , which is made up of 6,395 ±10 nucleotides the tmv genome consists of a 6.3–6.5 kb single-stranded ( ss ) rna although tmv does not have defined transmission vectors , the virus can be easily transmitted from the infected hosts to the healthy plants , by human handling then the viral genome will further replicate to produce multiple mrnas via a -rna intermediate primed by the trna his at the +rna 3 ' end tobacco mosaic virus has been known to cause a production loss for flue cured tobacco of up to two percent in north carolina its infection does not result in plant death , but if infection occurs early in the season , plants are stunted one of the common control methods for tmv is sanitation , which includes removing infected plants and washing hands in between each planting

ciclosporin is approved by the fda to treat and prevent graft-versus-host disease in bone marrow transplantation and to prevent rejection of kidney , heart , and liver transplants in addition to these indications , ciclosporin is also used in severe atopic dermatitis , kimura disease , pyoderma gangrenosum , chronic hives , acute systemic mastocytosis , and posterior or intermediate uveitis with noninfective cause ciclosporin has also been used in people with acute severe ulcerative colitis and hives that do not respond to treatment with steroids ciclosporin use after a kidney transplantation is associated with hyperuricemia and , in some cases , gout ciclosporin 's main effect is to lower the activity of t-cells ; it does so by inhibiting calcineurin in the calcineurinâ€“phosphatase pathway and preventing the mitochondrial permeability transition pore from opening ciclosporin binds to the cytosolic protein cyclophilin ( immunophilin ) of lymphocytes , especially of t cells in t-cells , activation of the t-cell receptor normally increases intracellular calcium , which acts via calmodulin to activate calcineurin ciclosporin , by preventing the dephosphorylation of nf-at , leads to reduced t cell effector ; it does not affect cytostatic activity ciclosporin also binds to the cyclophilin d protein that constitutes part of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore ( mptp ) ciclosporin is a cyclic peptide of 11 amino acids ; it contains a single chirality ( chemistry ) , which is rarely encountered in nature the metabolites , which include cyclosporin b , c , d , e , h , and l , have less than 10 % of ciclosporin 's immunosuppressant activity and are associated with higher kidney toxicity individual ciclosporin metabolites have been isolated and characterized but do not appear to be extensively studied cyclosporin synthetase substrates include l-valine , l-leucine , l-alanine , glycine , 2-aminobutyric acid , 4-methylthreonine , and d-alanine , which is the starting amino acid in the biosynthetic process with the adenylation domain , cyclosporin synthetase generates the acyl-adenylated amino acids , then covalently binds the amino acid to phosphopantetheine through a thioester linkage per international nonproprietary name ( inn ) guidelines for drugs , the y was replaced with i so that the inn for the medication is spelled ciclosporin ciclosporin was originally brought to market by sandoz ( now novartis ) , under the brand name sandimmune , which is available as soft gelatin capsules , an oral solution , and a formulation for intravenous administration ciclosporin has been investigated as a possible neuroprotective agent in conditions such as traumatic brain injury , and has been shown in animal experiments to reduce brain damage associated with injury constitutively high levels of mitochondrial cause inappropriate mptp opening leading to a decrease in the cardiac range of function , leading to cardiac hypertrophy as an attempt to compensate for the problem csa binds to cyclophilin d to block the opening of mptp , and thus decreases the release of protein cytochrome c , which can cause programmed cell death

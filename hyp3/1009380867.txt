ciclosporin is approved by the fda to treat and prevent graft-versus-host disease in bone marrow transplantation and to prevent rejection of kidney , heart , and liver transplants sandimmune label it is also approved in the us for treating of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis , persistent nummular keratitis following adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis , and as eye drops for treating dry eyes caused by sjögren 's syndrome and meibomian gland dysfunction in addition to these indications , ciclosporin is also used in severe atopic dermatitis , kimura disease , pyoderma gangrenosum , chronic hives , acute systemic mastocytosis , and posterior or intermediate uveitis with noninfective cause it is also used , albeit infrequently , in severe rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases ciclosporin has also been used in people with acute severe ulcerative colitis and hives that do not respond to treatment with steroids the increase in blood pressure can cause cardiovascular events ; it is thus recommended that the lowest effective dose for people requiring long-term treatment be used ciclosporin use after a kidney transplantation is associated with hyperuricemia and , in some cases , gout use of azathioprine as an alternative has shown to reduce the incidence of gouty arthritis ciclosporin 's main effect is to lower the activity of t-cells ; it does so by inhibiting calcineurin in the calcineurin–phosphatase pathway and preventing the mitochondrial permeability transition pore from opening this cyclosporin—cyclophilin complex inhibits calcineurin , which is normally responsible for activating the transcription of interleukin 2 in t-cells , activation of the t-cell receptor normally increases intracellular calcium , which acts via calmodulin to activate calcineurin ciclosporin , by preventing the dephosphorylation of nf-at , leads to reduced t cell effector ; it does not affect cytostatic activity ciclosporin also binds to the cyclophilin d protein that constitutes part of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore ( mptp ) unlike most peptides , ciclosporin is not synthesized by ribosomes mark plotkin states in his book medicine quest , penguin books 2001 , pages 46-47 , that in 1996 mycology researcher kathie hodge found that it is in fact a species of cordyceps the metabolites , which include cyclosporin b , c , d , e , h , and l , have less than 10 % of ciclosporin 's immunosuppressant activity and are associated with higher kidney toxicity the success of the drug candidate ciclosporin in preventing organ rejection was shown in kidney transplants by r.y in the united states , the food and drug administration ( fda ) approved ciclosporin for clinical use in 1983 unlike the human form of the medication , the lower doses used in dogs mean the drug acts as an immunomodulator and has fewer side effects than in humans

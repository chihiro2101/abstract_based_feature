ciclosporin is approved by the fda to treat and prevent graft-versus-host disease in bone marrow transplantation and to prevent rejection of kidney , heart , and liver transplants sandimmune label it is also approved in the us for treating of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis , persistent nummular keratitis following adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis , and as eye drops for treating dry eyes caused by sjögren 's syndrome and meibomian gland dysfunction in addition to these indications , ciclosporin is also used in severe atopic dermatitis , kimura disease , pyoderma gangrenosum , chronic hives , acute systemic mastocytosis , and posterior or intermediate uveitis with noninfective cause it is also used , albeit infrequently , in severe rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases ciclosporin has also been used in people with acute severe ulcerative colitis and hives that do not respond to treatment with steroids ciclosporin use after a kidney transplantation is associated with hyperuricemia and , in some cases , gout there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans ) , agents classified by the iarc monographs , volumes 1–110 specifically leading to squamous cell skin cancer and non-hodgkin lymphoma ciclosporin 's main effect is to lower the activity of t-cells ; it does so by inhibiting calcineurin in the calcineurin–phosphatase pathway and preventing the mitochondrial permeability transition pore from opening ciclosporin binds to the cytosolic protein cyclophilin ( immunophilin ) of lymphocytes , especially of t cells this cyclosporin—cyclophilin complex inhibits calcineurin , which is normally responsible for activating the transcription of interleukin 2 ciclosporin , by preventing the dephosphorylation of nf-at , leads to reduced t cell effector ; it does not affect cytostatic activity ciclosporin also binds to the cyclophilin d protein that constitutes part of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore ( mptp ) the metabolites , which include cyclosporin b , c , d , e , h , and l , have less than 10 % of ciclosporin 's immunosuppressant activity and are associated with higher kidney toxicity with the adenylation domain , cyclosporin synthetase generates the acyl-adenylated amino acids , then covalently binds the amino acid to phosphopantetheine through a thioester linkage tolypocladium inflatum , the species currently used for mass production of cyclosporin , has the biosynthetic genes arranged into a 12-gene cluster the success of the drug candidate ciclosporin in preventing organ rejection was shown in kidney transplants by r.y ciclosporin blocks the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore , which has been found to cause much of the damage associated with head injury and neurodegenerative diseases constitutively high levels of mitochondrial cause inappropriate mptp opening leading to a decrease in the cardiac range of function , leading to cardiac hypertrophy as an attempt to compensate for the problem unlike the human form of the medication , the lower doses used in dogs mean the drug acts as an immunomodulator and has fewer side effects than in humans

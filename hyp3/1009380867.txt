ciclosporin is approved by the fda to treat and prevent graft-versus-host disease in bone marrow transplantation and to prevent rejection of kidney , heart , and liver transplants in addition to these indications , ciclosporin is also used in severe atopic dermatitis , kimura disease , pyoderma gangrenosum , chronic hives , acute systemic mastocytosis , and posterior or intermediate uveitis with noninfective cause it is also used , albeit infrequently , in severe rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases ciclosporin has also been used in people with acute severe ulcerative colitis and hives that do not respond to treatment with steroids ciclosporin causes hypertension by inducing vasoconstriction in the kidneys and increasing sodium reabsorption the increase in blood pressure can cause cardiovascular events ; it is thus recommended that the lowest effective dose for people requiring long-term treatment be used ciclosporin use after a kidney transplantation is associated with hyperuricemia and , in some cases , gout ciclosporin 's main effect is to lower the activity of t-cells ; it does so by inhibiting calcineurin in the calcineurin–phosphatase pathway and preventing the mitochondrial permeability transition pore from opening ciclosporin binds to the cytosolic protein cyclophilin ( immunophilin ) of lymphocytes , especially of t cells this cyclosporin—cyclophilin complex inhibits calcineurin , which is normally responsible for activating the transcription of interleukin 2 ciclosporin also binds to the cyclophilin d protein that constitutes part of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore ( mptp ) the mptp is found in the mitochondrial membrane of cardiac muscle cells and moves calcium ions into the mitochondria the metabolites , which include cyclosporin b , c , d , e , h , and l , have less than 10 % of ciclosporin 's immunosuppressant activity and are associated with higher kidney toxicity with the adenylation domain , cyclosporin synthetase generates the acyl-adenylated amino acids , then covalently binds the amino acid to phosphopantetheine through a thioester linkage the success of the drug candidate ciclosporin in preventing organ rejection was shown in kidney transplants by r.y per international nonproprietary name ( inn ) guidelines for drugs , the y was replaced with i so that the inn for the medication is spelled ciclosporin ciclosporin is the inn and the british approved name ( ban ) , while cyclosporine is the united states adopted name ( usan ) and cyclosporin is a former ban ciclosporin has been used experimentally to treat cardiac hypertrophy ( an increase in cell volume ) unlike the human form of the medication , the lower doses used in dogs mean the drug acts as an immunomodulator and has fewer side effects than in humans

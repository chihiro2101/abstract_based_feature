ciclosporin is approved by the fda to treat and prevent graft-versus-host disease in bone marrow transplantation and to prevent rejection of kidney , heart , and liver transplants in addition to these indications , ciclosporin is also used in severe atopic dermatitis , kimura disease , pyoderma gangrenosum , chronic hives , acute systemic mastocytosis , and posterior or intermediate uveitis with noninfective cause it is also used , albeit infrequently , in severe rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases ciclosporin has also been used in people with acute severe ulcerative colitis and hives that do not respond to treatment with steroids the increase in blood pressure can cause cardiovascular events ; it is thus recommended that the lowest effective dose for people requiring long-term treatment be used ciclosporin use after a kidney transplantation is associated with hyperuricemia and , in some cases , gout ciclosporin 's main effect is to lower the activity of t-cells ; it does so by inhibiting calcineurin in the calcineurinâ€“phosphatase pathway and preventing the mitochondrial permeability transition pore from opening calcineurin then dephosphorylates the transcription factor nfatc ( nuclear factor of activated t-cells ) , which moves to the t-cell nucleus and increases the transcription of genes for il-2 and related cytokines ciclosporin , by preventing the dephosphorylation of nf-at , leads to reduced t cell effector ; it does not affect cytostatic activity ciclosporin also binds to the cyclophilin d protein that constitutes part of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore ( mptp ) the metabolites , which include cyclosporin b , c , d , e , h , and l , have less than 10 % of ciclosporin 's immunosuppressant activity and are associated with higher kidney toxicity cyclosporin synthetase substrates include l-valine , l-leucine , l-alanine , glycine , 2-aminobutyric acid , 4-methylthreonine , and d-alanine , which is the starting amino acid in the biosynthetic process with the adenylation domain , cyclosporin synthetase generates the acyl-adenylated amino acids , then covalently binds the amino acid to phosphopantetheine through a thioester linkage the norwegian strain , tolypocladium inflatum gams , was later used for the large scale fermentation of ciclosporin ciclosporin exhibits very poor solubility in water , and , as a consequence , suspension and emulsion forms of the medication have been developed for oral administration and for injection since 2002 , a topical emulsion of ciclosporin for treating inflammation caused by keratoconjunctivitis sicca ( dry eye syndrome ) has been marketed under the trade name restasis ( 0.05 % ) ciclosporin has been used experimentally to treat cardiac hypertrophy ( an increase in cell volume ) constitutively high levels of mitochondrial cause inappropriate mptp opening leading to a decrease in the cardiac range of function , leading to cardiac hypertrophy as an attempt to compensate for the problem the medication is approved in the united states for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs

ciclosporin is approved by the fda to treat and prevent graft-versus-host disease in bone marrow transplantation and to prevent rejection of kidney , heart , and liver transplants sandimmune label it is also approved in the us for treating of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis , persistent nummular keratitis following adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis , and as eye drops for treating dry eyes caused by sjögren 's syndrome and meibomian gland dysfunction in addition to these indications , ciclosporin is also used in severe atopic dermatitis , kimura disease , pyoderma gangrenosum , chronic hives , acute systemic mastocytosis , and posterior or intermediate uveitis with noninfective cause it is also used , albeit infrequently , in severe rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases ciclosporin has also been used in people with acute severe ulcerative colitis and hives that do not respond to treatment with steroids the increase in blood pressure can cause cardiovascular events ; it is thus recommended that the lowest effective dose for people requiring long-term treatment be used ciclosporin use after a kidney transplantation is associated with hyperuricemia and , in some cases , gout ciclosporin 's main effect is to lower the activity of t-cells ; it does so by inhibiting calcineurin in the calcineurin–phosphatase pathway and preventing the mitochondrial permeability transition pore from opening ciclosporin binds to the cytosolic protein cyclophilin ( immunophilin ) of lymphocytes , especially of t cells ciclosporin , by preventing the dephosphorylation of nf-at , leads to reduced t cell effector ; it does not affect cytostatic activity ciclosporin also binds to the cyclophilin d protein that constitutes part of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore ( mptp ) the metabolites , which include cyclosporin b , c , d , e , h , and l , have less than 10 % of ciclosporin 's immunosuppressant activity and are associated with higher kidney toxicity the adenylation domain is responsible for substrate recognition and activation , whereas the thiolation domain covalently binds the adenylated amino acids to phosphopantetheine , and the condensation domain elongates the peptide chain the norwegian strain , tolypocladium inflatum gams , was later used for the large scale fermentation of ciclosporin ciclosporin is the inn and the british approved name ( ban ) , while cyclosporine is the united states adopted name ( usan ) and cyclosporin is a former ban this multi-center study is being organized by neurovive pharma and the european brain injury consortium using neurovive 's formulation of ciclosporin called neurostat ( also known by its cardioprotection trade name of ciclomulsion ) ciclosporin has been investigated as a possible neuroprotective agent in conditions such as traumatic brain injury , and has been shown in animal experiments to reduce brain damage associated with injury constitutively high levels of mitochondrial cause inappropriate mptp opening leading to a decrease in the cardiac range of function , leading to cardiac hypertrophy as an attempt to compensate for the problem unlike the human form of the medication , the lower doses used in dogs mean the drug acts as an immunomodulator and has fewer side effects than in humans

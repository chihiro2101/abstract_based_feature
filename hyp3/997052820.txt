in the journal of molluscan studies , in 2014 , puillandre , duda , meyer , olivera & bouchet presented a new classification for the old genus conus using 329 species , the authors carried out molecular phylogenetic analyses the results suggested that the authors should place all living cone snails in a single family , conidae , containing the following genera : californiconus j tucker & tenorio , 2009 conasprella thiele , 1929 † conilithes swainson , 1840 † contraconus olsson & harbison , 1953 conus linnaeus , 1758 † eoconus j tucker & tenorio , 2009 † hemiconus cossmann , 1889 † herndliconus petuch & drolshagen , 2015 kenyonia brazier , 1896 lilliconus g tucker & tenorio , 2009 pygmaeconus puillandre & tenorio , 2017 † tequestaconus petuch & drolshagen , 2015 † the authors grouped 85 % of all known cone snail species under conus they recognized 57 subgenera within conus , and 11 subgenera within the genus conasprella prior to 1993 , the family conidae contained only conus species the subfamilies included many subfamilies that had previously been classified in the family turridae , and the conus species were moved to the subfamily coninae this left the family conidae once again containing only those species that were traditionally placed in that family : the cone snail species ( 1993 ) , and the taxonomy of the gastropoda ( bouchet & rocroi , 2005 ) , this family consisted of seven subfamilies fischer , 1883—synonym : cytharinae thiele , 1929 oenopotinae bogdanov , 1987—synonym : lorinae thiele , 1925 sensu thiele raphitominae a , shell characters ) , as well as an analysis of prior molecular phylogeny studies , all of which were used to construct phylogenetic trees olivera ( 2008 ) , the mitochondrial genome of conus textile , coxi-conii intergenic sequences and conoidean evolution zardoya ( 2005 ) , patterns of cladogenesis in the venomous marine gastropod genus conus from the cape verde islands systematic biology 54 ( 4 ) :634-650 rolan ( 2005 ) , explosive radiation of cape verde conus , a marine species flock , molecular ecology 14:267-272 conorbiinae was raised to the rank of family conorbidae , consisting of three genera : artemidiconus da motta , 1991 , benthofascis iredale , 1936 , and conorbis swainson , 1840 mangeliinae and oenopotinae were combined and raised to the rank of family mangeliidae , which had previously been lumped in the turridae ) petuch & drolshage ( 2011 ) compendium of florida fossil shells , volume 1 mdm publications , wellington , florida , 432 pp , 1878 veprecula melvill , 1917 vepridaphne shuto , 1983 virgiconus ( considered a synonym of conus by some authors ) virroconus ( considered a synonym of conus by some authors ) xanthodaphne powell , 1942 zenepos finlay , 1928 zierliana gray , 1847 some species reportedly can kill a human in under five minutes , thus the name '' cigarette snail '' as supposedly one only has time to smoke a cigarette before dying '' chronological taxonomy of conus , 1758-1840 ''

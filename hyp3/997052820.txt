in the journal of molluscan studies , in 2014 , puillandre , duda , meyer , olivera & bouchet presented a new classification for the old genus conus the results suggested that the authors should place all living cone snails in a single family , conidae , containing the following genera : californiconus j tucker & tenorio , 2009 conasprella thiele , 1929 † conilithes swainson , 1840 † contraconus olsson & harbison , 1953 conus linnaeus , 1758 † eoconus j tucker & tenorio , 2009 pygmaeconus puillandre & tenorio , 2017 † tequestaconus petuch & drolshagen , 2015 † the authors grouped 85 % of all known cone snail species under conus they recognized 57 subgenera within conus , and 11 subgenera within the genus conasprella prior to 1993 , the family conidae contained only conus species '' foregut anatomy , feeding mechanisms , relationships and classification of conoidea ( toxoglossa ) ( gastropoda ) the family conidae was redefined as several subfamilies the subfamilies included many subfamilies that had previously been classified in the family turridae , and the conus species were moved to the subfamily coninae in further taxonomic changes that took place in 2009 and 2011 , based upon molecular phylogeny ( see below ) , the subfamilies that were previously in the family turridae were elevated to the status of families in their own right this left the family conidae once again containing only those species that were traditionally placed in that family : the cone snail species ( 1993 ) , and the taxonomy of the gastropoda ( bouchet & rocroi , 2005 ) , this family consisted of seven subfamilies nordsieck , 1968 ; andoniinae vera-pelaez , 2002 † siphopsinae le renard , 1995 zardoya ( 2005 ) , patterns of cladogenesis in the venomous marine gastropod genus conus from the cape verde islands systematic biology 54 ( 4 ) :634-650 rolan ( 2005 ) , explosive radiation of cape verde conus , a marine species flock , molecular ecology 14:267-272 ( 2005 ) , inferring the mode of speciation in the indo-west pacific conus ( gastropoda : conidae ) , journal of biogeography 32:1429-1439 tucker and tenorio ’ s proposed classification system for the cone shells and their allies ( and the other clades of conoidea ) is shown in tucker & tenorio cone snail taxonomy 2009 raphitominae was raised to the rank of family raphitomidae ( also previously lumped in the turridae ) ( 2011 ) the genus benthofascis ( gastropoda : conoidea ) : a revision with descriptions of new species normally , cone snails ( and many species in the superfamily conoidea ) use their venom to immobilize prey before engulfing it the biotechnology surrounding cone snails and their venom has promise for medical breakthroughs ; with more than 50,000 conotoxin to study , the possibilities are numerous technology and the fall of the mono-generic family the cone collector 15 : pp

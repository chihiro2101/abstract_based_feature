in the journal of molluscan studies , in 2014 , puillandre , duda , meyer , olivera & bouchet presented a new classification for the old genus conus the results suggested that the authors should place all living cone snails in a single family , conidae , containing the following genera : californiconus j tucker & tenorio , 2009 conasprella thiele , 1929 † conilithes swainson , 1840 † contraconus olsson & harbison , 1953 conus linnaeus , 1758 † eoconus j tucker & tenorio , 2009 † hemiconus cossmann , 1889 † herndliconus petuch & drolshagen , 2015 kenyonia brazier , 1896 lilliconus g raybaudi massilia , 1994 malagasyconus monnier & tenorio , 2015 † papilliconus tracey & craig , 2017 profundiconus kuroda , 1956 pseudolilliconus j tucker & tenorio , 2009 pygmaeconus puillandre & tenorio , 2017 † tequestaconus petuch & drolshagen , 2015 † the authors grouped 85 % of all known cone snail species under conus they recognized 57 subgenera within conus , and 11 subgenera within the genus conasprella prior to 1993 , the family conidae contained only conus species the family conidae was redefined as several subfamilies the subfamilies included many subfamilies that had previously been classified in the family turridae , and the conus species were moved to the subfamily coninae this left the family conidae once again containing only those species that were traditionally placed in that family : the cone snail species bellardi , 1888 ; mitrolumnidae sacco , 1904 ; mitromorphinae casey , 1904 ; lorinae thiele , 1925 conorbiinae de gregorio , 1880—synonym : cryptoconinae cossmann , 1896 mangeliinae p fischer , 1883—synonym : cytharinae thiele , 1929 oenopotinae bogdanov , 1987—synonym : lorinae thiele , 1925 sensu thiele raphitominae a ( 2008 ) , did tectonic activity stimulate oligo-miocene speciation in the indo-west pacific ? evolution 62:1618-1634 kohn ( 2005 ) , species-level phylogeography and evolutionary history of the hyperdiverse marine gastropod genus conus , molecular phylogenetics and evolution 34:257-272 ( 2005 ) , inferring the mode of speciation in the indo-west pacific conus ( gastropoda : conidae ) , journal of biogeography 32:1429-1439 tucker and tenorio ’ s proposed classification system for the cone shells and their allies ( and the other clades of conoidea ) is shown in tucker & tenorio cone snail taxonomy 2009 mangeliinae and oenopotinae were combined and raised to the rank of family mangeliidae , which had previously been lumped in the turridae ) this is a list of what were recognized extant genera within conidae as per j.k , from 1993 to 2011 , the family conidae was defined as including not only the cone snails , but also a large number of other genera which are commonly known as turridae cone snails can sting through a wetsuit with their harpoon-like radular tooth , which resembles a transparent needle normally , cone snails ( and many species in the superfamily conoidea ) use their venom to immobilize prey before engulfing it

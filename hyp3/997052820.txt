in the journal of molluscan studies , in 2014 , puillandre , duda , meyer , olivera & bouchet presented a new classification for the old genus conus using 329 species , the authors carried out molecular phylogenetic analyses the results suggested that the authors should place all living cone snails in a single family , conidae , containing the following genera : californiconus j tucker & tenorio , 2009 conasprella thiele , 1929 † conilithes swainson , 1840 † contraconus olsson & harbison , 1953 conus linnaeus , 1758 † eoconus j tucker & tenorio , 2009 † hemiconus cossmann , 1889 † herndliconus petuch & drolshagen , 2015 kenyonia brazier , 1896 lilliconus g raybaudi massilia , 1994 malagasyconus monnier & tenorio , 2015 † papilliconus tracey & craig , 2017 profundiconus kuroda , 1956 pseudolilliconus j tucker & tenorio , 2009 pygmaeconus puillandre & tenorio , 2017 † tequestaconus petuch & drolshagen , 2015 † the authors grouped 85 % of all known cone snail species under conus they recognized 57 subgenera within conus , and 11 subgenera within the genus conasprella prior to 1993 , the family conidae contained only conus species '' foregut anatomy , feeding mechanisms , relationships and classification of conoidea ( toxoglossa ) ( gastropoda ) the subfamilies included many subfamilies that had previously been classified in the family turridae , and the conus species were moved to the subfamily coninae in further taxonomic changes that took place in 2009 and 2011 , based upon molecular phylogeny ( see below ) , the subfamilies that were previously in the family turridae were elevated to the status of families in their own right this left the family conidae once again containing only those species that were traditionally placed in that family : the cone snail species ( 1993 ) , and the taxonomy of the gastropoda ( bouchet & rocroi , 2005 ) , this family consisted of seven subfamilies nordsieck , 1968 ; andoniinae vera-pelaez , 2002 † siphopsinae le renard , 1995 rolan ( 2005 ) , explosive radiation of cape verde conus , a marine species flock , molecular ecology 14:267-272 tucker and tenorio ’ s proposed classification system for the cone shells and their allies ( and the other clades of conoidea ) is shown in tucker & tenorio cone snail taxonomy 2009 conorbiinae was raised to the rank of family conorbidae , consisting of three genera : artemidiconus da motta , 1991 , benthofascis iredale , 1936 , and conorbis swainson , 1840 , from 1993 to 2011 , the family conidae was defined as including not only the cone snails , but also a large number of other genera which are commonly known as turridae there are approximately 30 records of humans killed by cone snails normally , cone snails ( and many species in the superfamily conoidea ) use their venom to immobilize prey before engulfing it nature article on the venom

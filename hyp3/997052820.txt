in the journal of molluscan studies , in 2014 , puillandre , duda , meyer , olivera & bouchet presented a new classification for the old genus conus the results suggested that the authors should place all living cone snails in a single family , conidae , containing the following genera : californiconus j tucker & tenorio , 2009 conasprella thiele , 1929 † conilithes swainson , 1840 † contraconus olsson & harbison , 1953 conus linnaeus , 1758 † eoconus j tucker & tenorio , 2009 † hemiconus cossmann , 1889 † herndliconus petuch & drolshagen , 2015 kenyonia brazier , 1896 lilliconus g raybaudi massilia , 1994 malagasyconus monnier & tenorio , 2015 † papilliconus tracey & craig , 2017 profundiconus kuroda , 1956 pseudolilliconus j tucker & tenorio , 2009 pygmaeconus puillandre & tenorio , 2017 † tequestaconus petuch & drolshagen , 2015 † the authors grouped 85 % of all known cone snail species under conus they recognized 57 subgenera within conus , and 11 subgenera within the genus conasprella prior to 1993 , the family conidae contained only conus species the subfamilies included many subfamilies that had previously been classified in the family turridae , and the conus species were moved to the subfamily coninae in further taxonomic changes that took place in 2009 and 2011 , based upon molecular phylogeny ( see below ) , the subfamilies that were previously in the family turridae were elevated to the status of families in their own right this left the family conidae once again containing only those species that were traditionally placed in that family : the cone snail species ) ; textiliinae da motta , 1995 ( n.a fischer , 1883—synonym : cytharinae thiele , 1929 oenopotinae bogdanov , 1987—synonym : lorinae thiele , 1925 sensu thiele raphitominae a , shell characters ) , as well as an analysis of prior molecular phylogeny studies , all of which were used to construct phylogenetic trees 133 in their phylogeny , tucker and tenorio noted the close relationship of the cone species within the various clades , corresponding to their proposed families and genera ; this also corresponded to the results of prior molecular studies by puillandre et al olivera ( 2008 ) , the mitochondrial genome of conus textile , coxi-conii intergenic sequences and conoidean evolution zardoya ( 2005 ) , patterns of cladogenesis in the venomous marine gastropod genus conus from the cape verde islands systematic biology 54 ( 4 ) :634-650 kohn ( 2005 ) , species-level phylogeography and evolutionary history of the hyperdiverse marine gastropod genus conus , molecular phylogenetics and evolution 34:257-272 tucker and tenorio ’ s proposed classification system for the cone shells and their allies ( and the other clades of conoidea ) is shown in tucker & tenorio cone snail taxonomy 2009 ( 2010 ) molecular phylogeny of conus chiangi ( azuma , 1972 ) ( gastropods : conidae ) normally , cone snails ( and many species in the superfamily conoidea ) use their venom to immobilize prey before engulfing it the venom of each cone snail species may contain as many as 200 pharmacologically active components

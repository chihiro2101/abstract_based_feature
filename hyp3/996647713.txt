johann bernoulli posed the problem of the brachistochrone to the readers of acta eruditorum in june , 1696 johann bernoulli ( june 1696 ) '' problema novum ad cujus solutionem mathematici invitantur '' ( a new problem to whose solution mathematicians are invited 5 ) assignare mobili m , viam amb , per quam gravitate sua descendens & moveri incipiens a puncto a , brevissimo tempore perveniat ad alterum punctum b '' ( given in a vertical plane two points a and b ( see figure 5 ) , assign to the moving body m , the path amb , by means of which — descending by its own weight and beginning to be moved by gravity from point a — it would arrive at the other point b in the shortest time '' ( his communication together with those of two others in a report to him first from johann bernoulli , and then from the marquis de l'hôpital , of reported solutions of the problem of the curve of quickest descent , which was publicly proposed by johann bernoulli , geometer — one with a solution of his other problem proposed afterwards by the same person '' ( the curvature of light rays in non-uniform media , and a solution of the problem which was proposed by me in the acta eruditorum of 1696 , p , curve , that is , in which a weight descends from a given point to a given point in the shortest time , and on constructing the tautochrone or the wave of light rays marquis de l'hôpital ( may 1697 ) '' domini marchionis hospitalii solutio problematis de linea celerrimi descensus '' ( lord marquis de l'hôpital 's solution of the problem of the line of fastest descent ) , acta eruditorum , 19 : 217-220 he said : bernoulli wrote the problem statement as : johann and his brother jakob bernoulli derived the same solution , but johann 's derivation was incorrect , and he tried to pass off jakob 's solution as his own johann published the solution in the journal in may of the following year , and noted that the solution is the same curve as huygens 's tautochrone curve this story gives some idea of newton 's power , since johann bernoulli took two weeks to solve it in the end , five mathematicians responded with solutions : newton , jakob bernoulli , gottfried leibniz , ehrenfried walther von tschirnhaus and guillaume de l'hôpital four of the solutions ( excluding l'hôpital 's ) were published in the same edition of the journal as johann bernoulli 's the actual solution to galileo 's problem is half a cycloid aristotle 's wheel paradox beltrami identity calculus of variations catenary cycloid newton 's minimal resistance problem tautochrone curve trochoid uniformly accelerated motion

johann bernoulli posed the problem of the brachistochrone to the readers of acta eruditorum in june , 1696 '' ( given in a vertical plane two points a and b ( see figure 5 ) , assign to the moving body m , the path amb , by means of which — descending by its own weight and beginning to be moved by gravity from point a — it would arrive at the other point b in the shortest time '' ( his communication together with those of two others in a report to him first from johann bernoulli , and then from the marquis de l'hôpital , of reported solutions of the problem of the curve of quickest descent , which was publicly proposed by johann bernoulli , geometer — one with a solution of his other problem proposed afterwards by the same person johann bernoulli ( may 1697 ) '' curvatura radii in diaphanis non uniformibus , solutioque problematis a se in actis 1696 , p 269 , propositi , de invenienda linea brachystochrona , id est , in qua grave a dato puncto ad datum punctum brevissimo tempore decurrit , & de curva synchrona seu radiorum unda construenda '' ( the curvature of light rays in non-uniform media , and a solution of the problem which was proposed by me in the acta eruditorum of 1696 , p , curve , that is , in which a weight descends from a given point to a given point in the shortest time , and on constructing the tautochrone or the wave of light rays he said : bernoulli wrote the problem statement as : johann and his brother jakob bernoulli derived the same solution , but johann 's derivation was incorrect , and he tried to pass off jakob 's solution as his own johann published the solution in the journal in may of the following year , and noted that the solution is the same curve as huygens 's tautochrone curve on 29 january 1697 when he arrived home from the royal mint , isaac newton found the challenge in a letter from johann bernoulli '' , and newton had already solved newton 's minimal resistance problem , which is considered the first of the kind in calculus of variations in the end , five mathematicians responded with solutions : newton , jakob bernoulli , gottfried leibniz , ehrenfried walther von tschirnhaus and guillaume de l'hôpital according to newtonian scholar tom whiteside , in an attempt to outdo his brother , jakob bernoulli created a harder version of the brachistochrone problem johann bernoulli 's direct method is historically important as it was the first proof that the brachistochrone is the cycloid this paper was largely ignored until 1904 when the depth of the method was first appreciated by constantin carathéodory , who stated that it shows that the cycloid is the only possible curve of quickest descent aristotle 's wheel paradox beltrami identity calculus of variations catenary cycloid newton 's minimal resistance problem tautochrone curve trochoid uniformly accelerated motion

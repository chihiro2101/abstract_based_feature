johann bernoulli posed the problem of the brachistochrone to the readers of acta eruditorum in june , 1696 johann bernoulli ( june 1696 ) '' problema novum ad cujus solutionem mathematici invitantur ( gottfried wilhelm leibniz ) ( may 1697 ) '' communicatio suae pariter , duarumque alienarum ad edendum sibi primum a dn johann bernoulli ( may 1697 ) '' curvatura radii in diaphanis non uniformibus , solutioque problematis a se in actis 1696 , p '' ( the curvature of light rays in non-uniform media , and a solution of the problem which was proposed by me in the acta eruditorum of 1696 , p , curve , that is , in which a weight descends from a given point to a given point in the shortest time , and on constructing the tautochrone or the wave of light rays johann published the solution in the journal in may of the following year , and noted that the solution is the same curve as huygens 's tautochrone curve bernoulli allowed six months for the solutions but none were received during this period newton also wrote , '' i do not love to be dunned pestered and teased by foreigners about mathematical things '' , and newton had already solved newton 's minimal resistance problem , which is considered the first of the kind in calculus of variations in his paper , jakob bernoulli gave a proof of the condition for least time similar to that below before showing that its solution is a cycloid according to newtonian scholar tom whiteside , in an attempt to outdo his brother , jakob bernoulli created a harder version of the brachistochrone problem earlier , in 1638 , galileo had tried to solve a similar problem for the path of the fastest descent from a point to a wall in his two new sciences johann bernoulli 's direct method is historically important as it was the first proof that the brachistochrone is the cycloid the small time to travel along arc mm is \frac which was shown above to be constant , and the brachistochrone is the cycloid optimal control solution to the brachistochrone problem in python

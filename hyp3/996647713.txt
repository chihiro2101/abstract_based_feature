johann bernoulli posed the problem of the brachistochrone to the readers of acta eruditorum in june , 1696 johann bernoulli ( june 1696 ) '' problema novum ad cujus solutionem mathematici invitantur '' ( his communication together with those of two others in a report to him first from johann bernoulli , and then from the marquis de l'hôpital , of reported solutions of the problem of the curve of quickest descent , which was publicly proposed by johann bernoulli , geometer — one with a solution of his other problem proposed afterwards by the same person '' ( the curvature of light rays in non-uniform media , and a solution of the problem which was proposed by me in the acta eruditorum of 1696 , p , curve , that is , in which a weight descends from a given point to a given point in the shortest time , and on constructing the tautochrone or the wave of light rays he said : bernoulli wrote the problem statement as : johann and his brother jakob bernoulli derived the same solution , but johann 's derivation was incorrect , and he tried to pass off jakob 's solution as his own johann published the solution in the journal in may of the following year , and noted that the solution is the same curve as huygens 's tautochrone curve after deriving the differential equation for the curve by the method given below , he went on to show that it does yield a cycloid on 29 january 1697 when he arrived home from the royal mint , isaac newton found the challenge in a letter from johann bernoulli newton stayed up all night to solve it and mailed the solution anonymously by the next post newton also wrote , '' i do not love to be dunned pestered and teased by foreigners about mathematical things '' , and newton had already solved newton 's minimal resistance problem , which is considered the first of the kind in calculus of variations in his paper , jakob bernoulli gave a proof of the condition for least time similar to that below before showing that its solution is a cycloid galileo studied the cycloid and gave it its name , but the connection between it and his problem had to wait for advances in mathematics this paper was largely ignored until 1904 when the depth of the method was first appreciated by constantin carathéodory , who stated that it shows that the cycloid is the only possible curve of quickest descent it may have been by trial and error , or he may have recognised immediately that it implied the curve was the cycloid

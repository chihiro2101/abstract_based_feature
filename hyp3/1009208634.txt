although the sun appears to '' rise '' from the horizon , it is actually the earth 's motion that causes the sun to appear astronomically , sunrise occurs for only an instant : the moment at which the upper limb of the sun appears tangent to the horizon however , the term sunrise commonly refers to periods of time both before and after this point : twilight , the period in the morning during which the sky is brightening , but the sun is not yet visible the stage of sunrise known as false sunrise actually occurs before the sun truly reaches the horizon because earth 's atmosphere refracts the sun 's image also , unlike most other solar measurements , sunrise occurs when the sun 's upper limb , rather than its center , appears to cross the horizon these two angles combine to define sunrise to occur when the sun 's center is 50 arcminutes below the horizon , or 90.83Â° from the zenith the offset between the dates of the solstice and the earliest or latest sunrise time is caused by the eccentricity of earth 's orbit and the tilt of its axis , and is described by the analemma , which can be used to predict the dates the sunrise equation , however , which is used to derive the time of sunrise and sunset , uses the sun 's physical center for calculation , neglecting atmospheric refraction and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc mie scattering is responsible for the light scattered by clouds , and also for the daytime halo of white light around the sun ( forward scattering of white light ) the sun appears to rise above the horizon and circle the earth , but it is actually the earth that is rotating , with the sun remaining fixed

while german dermatologist alfred blaschko described blaschko 's lines in 1901 , the genetic science took until the 1930s to approach a vocabulary for the phenomenon the term genetic chimera has been used at least since the 1944 article of belgovskii an animal chimera is a single organism that is composed of two or more different populations of genetically distinct cells that originated from different zygotes involved in sexual reproduction innate chimeras are formed from at least four parent cells ( two fertilised eggs or early embryos fused together ) this condition is either innate or it is synthetic , acquired for example through the infusion of allogeneic hematopoietic cells during transplantation or transfusion tetragametic chimerism is a form of congenital chimerism this has occurred in humans , and at one time was thought to be extremely rare although more recent evidence suggests that this is not the case affected persons may be identified by the finding of two populations of red cells or , if the zygotes are of opposite sex , ambiguous genitalia and intersex alone or in combination ; such persons sometimes also have patchy skin , hair , or eye pigmentation ( heterochromia ) most chimeras composed of both male and female cells probably do not have an intersex condition , as might be expected if the two cell populations were evenly blended throughout the body often , most or all of the cells of a single cell type will be composed of a single cell line , i.e the blood may be composed predominantly of one cell line , and the internal organs of the other cell line the existence of chimerism is problematic for dna testing , a fact with implications for family and criminal law the lydia fairchild case , for example , was brought to court after dna testing apparently showed that her children could not be hers fraud charges were filed against her and her custody of her children was challenged the charge against her was dismissed when it became clear that lydia was a chimera , with the matching dna being found in her cervical tissue microchimerism is the presence of a small number of cells that are genetically distinct from those of the host individual most people are born with a few cells genetically identical to their mothers ' and the proportion of these cells goes down in healthy individuals as they get older however , his form of microchimerism was found to be due to a vanished twin , and it is unknown whether microchimerism from a vanished twin might predispose individuals to autoimmune diseases as well germline chimerism occurs when the germ cells ( for example , sperm and egg cells ) of an organism are not genetically identical to its own it has been recently discovered that marmosets can carry the reproductive cells of their ( fraternal ) twin siblings due to placental fusion during development an individual that falls under this classification possesses two different sets of lineage ( genetic ) : one that was inherited genetically at the time of the formation of the human embryo and the other that was intentionally introduced through a medical procedure known as transplantation by utilizing transplantation and ablation in the chick embryo stage , the neural tube and the neural crest cells of the chick were ablated , and replaced with the same parts from a quail once hatched , the quail feathers were visibly apparent around the wing area , whereas the rest of the chick 's body was made of its own chicken cells a woman was found to have blood containing two different blood types another report of a human chimera was published in 1998 , where a male human had some partially developed female organs due to chimerism in 2002 , lydia fairchild was denied public assistance in washington state when dna evidence appeared to show that she was not the mother of her children debate exists surrounding true hermaphrodites in regards to a hypothetical scenario in which it could be possible for a human to self-fertilize it was discovered that one of these primates , roku , was a sexual chimera ; as four percent of roku 's blood cells contained two x chromosomes for example , subsets of blastomeres can be used to give rise to chimera with specified cell lineage from one embryo embryos that are to be used in chimeras can be further genetically altered in order to specifically contribute to only one part of chimera these kinds of chimeras can be made through either aggregation of stem cells and the diploid embryo or injection of the stem cells into the diploid embryo '' chimerism explained '' chimerism and cellular mosaicism , genetic home reference , u.s

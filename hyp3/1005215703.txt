while german dermatologist alfred blaschko described blaschko 's lines in 1901 , the genetic science took until the 1930s to approach a vocabulary for the phenomenon an animal chimera is a single organism that is composed of two or more different populations of genetically distinct cells that originated from different zygotes involved in sexual reproduction if the different cells have emerged from the same zygote , the organism is called a mosaic innate chimeras are formed from at least four parent cells ( two fertilised eggs or early embryos fused together ) this condition is either innate or it is synthetic , acquired for example through the infusion of allogeneic hematopoietic cells during transplantation or transfusion the likelihood of offspring being a chimera is increased if it is created via in vitro fertilization chimeras can often breed , but the fertility and type of offspring depends on which cell line gave rise to the ovaries or testes ; varying degrees of intersex differences may result if one set of cells is genetically female and another genetically male this condition occurs through the fertilization of two separate ova by two sperm , followed by aggregation of the two at the blastocyst or zygote stages put another way , the chimera is formed from the merging of two twin ( a similar merging presumably occurs with identical twins , but as their genotypes are not significantly distinct , the resulting individual would not be considered a chimera ) as the organism develops , it can come to possess organs that have different sets of chromosomes for example , the chimera may have a liver composed of cells with one set of chromosomes and have a kidney composed of cells with a second set of chromosomes 95 % of marmoset fraternal twins trade blood through chorionic fusions , making them hematopoietic chimeras if the blastocysts are of opposite sex , genitals of both sexes may be formed : either ovary and testis , or combined ovotestes , in one rare form of intersex , a condition previously known as true hermaphroditism most chimeras composed of both male and female cells probably do not have an intersex condition , as might be expected if the two cell populations were evenly blended throughout the body often , most or all of the cells of a single cell type will be composed of a single cell line , i.e the blood may be composed predominantly of one cell line , and the internal organs of the other cell line another case was that of karen keegan , who was also suspected ( initially ) of not being her children 's biological mother , after dna tests on her adult sons for a kidney transplant she needed , seemed to show she was not their mother microchimerism is the presence of a small number of cells that are genetically distinct from those of the host individual mothers often also have a few cells genetically identical to those of their children , and some people also have some cells genetically identical to those of their siblings ( maternal siblings only , since these cells are passed to them because their mother retained them ) while this attachment has become necessary for the male 's survival , it will eventually consume him , as both anglerfish fuse into a single hermaphrodite individual germline chimerism occurs when the germ cells ( for example , sperm and egg cells ) of an organism are not genetically identical to its own ( marmosets almost always give birth to fraternal twins a woman was found to have blood containing two different blood types another report of a human chimera was published in 1998 , where a male human had some partially developed female organs due to chimerism if a human chimera is formed from a male and female zygote fusing into a single embryo , giving an individual functional gonadal tissue of both types , such a self-fertilization is feasible in 2019 , the blood and seminal fluid of a man in reno , nevada ( who had undergone a vasectomy ) , exhibited only the genetic content of his bone marrow donor they were created by mixing cells from totipotent four cell blastocysts ; although the cells never fused , they worked together to form organs in the case where two diploid eight-cell-stage embryos are used to make a chimera , chimerism can be later found in the epiblast , primitive endoderm , and trophectoderm of the mouse blastocyst it is possible to dissect the embryo at other stages so as to accordingly give rise to one lineage of cells from an embryo selectively and not the other embryos that are to be used in chimeras can be further genetically altered in order to specifically contribute to only one part of chimera these kinds of chimeras can be made through either aggregation of stem cells and the diploid embryo or injection of the stem cells into the diploid embryo then , these injected blastocysts are implanted into a pseudo pregnant female surrogate mouse , which will bring the embryos to term and give birth to a mouse whose germline is derived from the donor mouse 's es cells

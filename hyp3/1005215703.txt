while german dermatologist alfred blaschko described blaschko 's lines in 1901 , the genetic science took until the 1930s to approach a vocabulary for the phenomenon an animal chimera is a single organism that is composed of two or more different populations of genetically distinct cells that originated from different zygotes involved in sexual reproduction if the different cells have emerged from the same zygote , the organism is called a mosaic innate chimeras are formed from at least four parent cells ( two fertilised eggs or early embryos fused together ) each population of cells keeps its own character and the resulting organism is a mixture of tissues this condition is either innate or it is synthetic , acquired for example through the infusion of allogeneic hematopoietic cells during transplantation or transfusion in nonidentical twins , innate chimerism occurs by means of blood-vessel anastomoses this condition occurs through the fertilization of two separate ova by two sperm , followed by aggregation of the two at the blastocyst or zygote stages put another way , the chimera is formed from the merging of two twin ( a similar merging presumably occurs with identical twins , but as their genotypes are not significantly distinct , the resulting individual would not be considered a chimera ) as the organism develops , it can come to possess organs that have different sets of chromosomes for example , the chimera may have a liver composed of cells with one set of chromosomes and have a kidney composed of cells with a second set of chromosomes this has occurred in humans , and at one time was thought to be extremely rare although more recent evidence suggests that this is not the case , having a thumb variations and a straight thumb , eyes of slightly different colors , differential hair growth on opposite sides of the body , etc often , most or all of the cells of a single cell type will be composed of a single cell line , i.e the blood may be composed predominantly of one cell line , and the internal organs of the other cell line the tetragametic state has important implications for organ or stem cell transplantation microchimerism is the presence of a small number of cells that are genetically distinct from those of the host individual most people are born with a few cells genetically identical to their mothers ' and the proportion of these cells goes down in healthy individuals as they get older once the male achieves adulthood , it begins its search for a female the male , less than an inch in length , bites into her skin and releases an enzyme that digests the skin of both his mouth and her body , fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level germline chimerism occurs when the germ cells ( for example , sperm and egg cells ) of an organism are not genetically identical to its own it has been recently discovered that marmosets can carry the reproductive cells of their ( fraternal ) twin siblings due to placental fusion during development an individual that falls under this classification possesses two different sets of lineage ( genetic ) : one that was inherited genetically at the time of the formation of the human embryo and the other that was intentionally introduced through a medical procedure known as transplantation specific types of transplants that could induce this condition include bone marrow transplants and organ transplants , as the recipient 's body essentially works to permanently incorporate the new blood stem cells into it chimerism has been documented in humans in several instances a woman was found to have blood containing two different blood types in 2019 , the blood and seminal fluid of a man in reno , nevada ( who had undergone a vasectomy ) , exhibited only the genetic content of his bone marrow donor however , this may be due to the fact that humans might not be aware that they have this condition to begin with each genotype functions independently in terms of reproduction , but the different intra-organism genotypes behave as a single large individual in terms of ecological responses like growth the tissues may be partially fused together following grafting to form a single growing organism that preserves both types of tissue in a single shoot '' chimerism explained '' chimerism and cellular mosaicism , genetic home reference , u.s chimera : apical origin , ontogeny and consideration in propagation plant chimeras in tissue culture ainsworth , claire ( november 15 , 2003 )

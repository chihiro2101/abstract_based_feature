while german dermatologist alfred blaschko described blaschko 's lines in 1901 , the genetic science took until the 1930s to approach a vocabulary for the phenomenon the term genetic chimera has been used at least since the 1944 article of belgovskii an animal chimera is a single organism that is composed of two or more different populations of genetically distinct cells that originated from different zygotes involved in sexual reproduction if the different cells have emerged from the same zygote , the organism is called a mosaic innate chimeras are formed from at least four parent cells ( two fertilised eggs or early embryos fused together ) this condition is either innate or it is synthetic , acquired for example through the infusion of allogeneic hematopoietic cells during transplantation or transfusion chimeras can often breed , but the fertility and type of offspring depends on which cell line gave rise to the ovaries or testes ; varying degrees of intersex differences may result if one set of cells is genetically female and another genetically male this condition occurs through the fertilization of two separate ova by two sperm , followed by aggregation of the two at the blastocyst or zygote stages for example , the chimera may have a liver composed of cells with one set of chromosomes and have a kidney composed of cells with a second set of chromosomes if the blastocysts are of opposite sex , genitals of both sexes may be formed : either ovary and testis , or combined ovotestes , in one rare form of intersex , a condition previously known as true hermaphroditism most chimeras composed of both male and female cells probably do not have an intersex condition , as might be expected if the two cell populations were evenly blended throughout the body often , most or all of the cells of a single cell type will be composed of a single cell line , i.e the blood may be composed predominantly of one cell line , and the internal organs of the other cell line the most noticeable are some male tortoiseshell cats and calico cats ( although most male tortoiseshells have an extra x chromosome responsible for the colouration ) or animals with ambiguous sex organs the existence of chimerism is problematic for dna testing , a fact with implications for family and criminal law the lydia fairchild case , for example , was brought to court after dna testing apparently showed that her children could not be hers the charge against her was dismissed when it became clear that lydia was a chimera , with the matching dna being found in her cervical tissue the tetragametic state has important implications for organ or stem cell transplantation chimeras typically have immunologic tolerance to both cell lines most people are born with a few cells genetically identical to their mothers ' and the proportion of these cells goes down in healthy individuals as they get older mothers often also have a few cells genetically identical to those of their children , and some people also have some cells genetically identical to those of their siblings ( maternal siblings only , since these cells are passed to them because their mother retained them ) sometimes in this process , more than one male will attach to a single female as a symbiote it has been recently discovered that marmosets can carry the reproductive cells of their ( fraternal ) twin siblings due to placental fusion during development an individual that falls under this classification possesses two different sets of lineage ( genetic ) : one that was inherited genetically at the time of the formation of the human embryo and the other that was intentionally introduced through a medical procedure known as transplantation an example of artificial chimerism in animals are the quail-chick chimeras in 2019 , the blood and seminal fluid of a man in reno , nevada ( who had undergone a vasectomy ) , exhibited only the genetic content of his bone marrow donor there are usually no signs or symptoms for chimerism other than a few physical symptoms such as hyperpigmentation , hypopigmentation , or possessing two different colored eyes in august 2003 , researchers at the shanghai second medical university in china reported that they had successfully fused human skin cells and rabbit ova to create the first human chimeric embryos between the stages of fertilization of the egg and the implantation of a blastocyst into the uterus , different parts of the mouse embryo retain the ability to give rise to a variety of cell lineages the inner cell mass of a diploid blastocyst , for example , can be used to make a chimera with another blastocyst of eight-cell diploid embryo ; the cells taken from the inner cell mass will give rise to the primitive endoderm and to the epiblast in the chimera mouse these kinds of chimeras can be made through either aggregation of stem cells and the diploid embryo or injection of the stem cells into the diploid embryo '' chimerism explained '' chimerism and cellular mosaicism , genetic home reference , u.s

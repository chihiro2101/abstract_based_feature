while german dermatologist alfred blaschko described blaschko 's lines in 1901 , the genetic science took until the 1930s to approach a vocabulary for the phenomenon the term genetic chimera has been used at least since the 1944 article of belgovskii an animal chimera is a single organism that is composed of two or more different populations of genetically distinct cells that originated from different zygotes involved in sexual reproduction innate chimeras are formed from at least four parent cells ( two fertilised eggs or early embryos fused together ) this condition is either innate or it is synthetic , acquired for example through the infusion of allogeneic hematopoietic cells during transplantation or transfusion in nonidentical twins , innate chimerism occurs by means of blood-vessel anastomoses chimeras can often breed , but the fertility and type of offspring depends on which cell line gave rise to the ovaries or testes ; varying degrees of intersex differences may result if one set of cells is genetically female and another genetically male put another way , the chimera is formed from the merging of two twin ( a similar merging presumably occurs with identical twins , but as their genotypes are not significantly distinct , the resulting individual would not be considered a chimera ) for example , the chimera may have a liver composed of cells with one set of chromosomes and have a kidney composed of cells with a second set of chromosomes this has occurred in humans , and at one time was thought to be extremely rare although more recent evidence suggests that this is not the case if the blastocysts are of opposite sex , genitals of both sexes may be formed : either ovary and testis , or combined ovotestes , in one rare form of intersex , a condition previously known as true hermaphroditism note that the frequency of this condition does not indicate the true prevalence of chimerism most chimeras composed of both male and female cells probably do not have an intersex condition , as might be expected if the two cell populations were evenly blended throughout the body often , most or all of the cells of a single cell type will be composed of a single cell line , i.e the blood may be composed predominantly of one cell line , and the internal organs of the other cell line the lydia fairchild case , for example , was brought to court after dna testing apparently showed that her children could not be hers microchimerism is the presence of a small number of cells that are genetically distinct from those of the host individual people who retain higher numbers of cells genetically identical to their mother 's have been observed to have higher rates of some autoimmune diseases , presumably because the immune system is responsible for destroying these cells and a common immune defect prevents it from doing so and also causes autoimmune problems however , his form of microchimerism was found to be due to a vanished twin , and it is unknown whether microchimerism from a vanished twin might predispose individuals to autoimmune diseases as well mothers often also have a few cells genetically identical to those of their children , and some people also have some cells genetically identical to those of their siblings ( maternal siblings only , since these cells are passed to them because their mother retained them ) using strong olfactory receptors , the male searches until it locates a female anglerfish the male , less than an inch in length , bites into her skin and releases an enzyme that digests the skin of both his mouth and her body , fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level this process allows for sperm to be in constant supply when the female produces an egg , so that the chimeric fish is able to have a greater number of offspring germline chimerism occurs when the germ cells ( for example , sperm and egg cells ) of an organism are not genetically identical to its own it has been recently discovered that marmosets can carry the reproductive cells of their ( fraternal ) twin siblings due to placental fusion during development the dna content of semen from an assault case in 2004 matched that of a man who had been in prison at the time of the assault , but who had been a bone marrow donor for his brother , who was later determined to have committed the crime they were created by mixing cells from totipotent four cell blastocysts ; although the cells never fused , they worked together to form organs the general methods for creating chimeric mice can be summarized either by injection or aggregation of embryonic cells from different origins in the case where two diploid eight-cell-stage embryos are used to make a chimera , chimerism can be later found in the epiblast , primitive endoderm , and trophectoderm of the mouse blastocyst es cells can be used in combination with eight-cell-and two-cell-stage embryos to make chimeras and exclusively give rise to the embryo proper these kinds of chimeras can be made through either aggregation of stem cells and the diploid embryo or injection of the stem cells into the diploid embryo es cells with the correct targeted gene are then injected into a diploid host mouse blastocyst

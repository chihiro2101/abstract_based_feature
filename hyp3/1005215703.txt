an animal chimera is a single organism that is composed of two or more different populations of genetically distinct cells that originated from different zygotes involved in sexual reproduction innate chimeras are formed from at least four parent cells ( two fertilised eggs or early embryos fused together ) this condition is either innate or it is synthetic , acquired for example through the infusion of allogeneic hematopoietic cells during transplantation or transfusion in nonidentical twins , innate chimerism occurs by means of blood-vessel anastomoses tetragametic chimerism is a form of congenital chimerism this condition occurs through the fertilization of two separate ova by two sperm , followed by aggregation of the two at the blastocyst or zygote stages as the organism develops , it can come to possess organs that have different sets of chromosomes for example , the chimera may have a liver composed of cells with one set of chromosomes and have a kidney composed of cells with a second set of chromosomes this has occurred in humans , and at one time was thought to be extremely rare although more recent evidence suggests that this is not the case 95 % of marmoset fraternal twins trade blood through chorionic fusions , making them hematopoietic chimeras if the blastocysts are of opposite sex , genitals of both sexes may be formed : either ovary and testis , or combined ovotestes , in one rare form of intersex , a condition previously known as true hermaphroditism most chimeras composed of both male and female cells probably do not have an intersex condition , as might be expected if the two cell populations were evenly blended throughout the body often , most or all of the cells of a single cell type will be composed of a single cell line , i.e the blood may be composed predominantly of one cell line , and the internal organs of the other cell line natural chimeras are almost never detected unless they exhibit abnormalities such as male/female or hermaphrodite characteristics or uneven skin pigmentation the most noticeable are some male tortoiseshell cats and calico cats ( although most male tortoiseshells have an extra x chromosome responsible for the colouration ) or animals with ambiguous sex organs most people are born with a few cells genetically identical to their mothers ' and the proportion of these cells goes down in healthy individuals as they get older using strong olfactory receptors , the male searches until it locates a female anglerfish while this attachment has become necessary for the male 's survival , it will eventually consume him , as both anglerfish fuse into a single hermaphrodite individual sometimes in this process , more than one male will attach to a single female as a symbiote once fused to a female , the males will reach sexual maturity , developing large testicles as their other organs atrophy germline chimerism occurs when the germ cells ( for example , sperm and egg cells ) of an organism are not genetically identical to its own it has been recently discovered that marmosets can carry the reproductive cells of their ( fraternal ) twin siblings due to placental fusion during development ( marmosets almost always give birth to fraternal twins an individual that falls under this classification possesses two different sets of lineage ( genetic ) : one that was inherited genetically at the time of the formation of the human embryo and the other that was intentionally introduced through a medical procedure known as transplantation a woman was found to have blood containing two different blood types another report of a human chimera was published in 1998 , where a male human had some partially developed female organs due to chimerism the first chimeric mouse was made by beatrice mintz in the 1960s through the aggregation of eight-cell-stage embryos es cells from the inner cell mass of an implanted blastocyst can contribute to all cell lineages of a mouse including the germ line in the case where two diploid eight-cell-stage embryos are used to make a chimera , chimerism can be later found in the epiblast , primitive endoderm , and trophectoderm of the mouse blastocyst these kinds of chimeras can be made through either aggregation of stem cells and the diploid embryo or injection of the stem cells into the diploid embryo chimera : apical origin , ontogeny and consideration in propagation plant chimeras in tissue culture ainsworth , claire ( november 15 , 2003 )

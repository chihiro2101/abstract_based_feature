there is no definite evidence about the life of aenesidemus , but his most important work , the pyrrhonian discourses was known to be dedicated to lucius aelius tubero , a friend of cicero and member of plato 's academy whom photius described as a colleague based on this information , scholars have assumed that aenesidemus himself was also a member of the academy furthermore , it has been assumed that he took part under the leadership of philo of larissa and probably adopted pyrrhonism either in reaction to antiochus of ascalon introduction of stoic and peripatetic dogma into the academy or philo 's acceptance of provisional beliefs what little we know of aenesidemus is by way of photius ( in his myriobiblion ) , sextus empiricus , and also to a lesser extent by diogenes laërtius and philo of alexandria consequently , he says , neither the pyrrhonists nor the others know the truth in things ; but the philosophers of other persuasions , as well as being ignorant in general , and wearing themselves out uselessly and expending themselves in ceaseless torments , are also ignorant of the very fact that they have cognition of none of the things of which they think that they have gained cognition but he who philosophizes after the fashion of pyrrho is happy not only in general but also , and especially , in the wisdom of knowing that he has firm cognition of nothing in writing the discourses aenesidemus addresses them to lucius tubero , one of his colleagues from the academy , a roman by birth , with an illustrious ancestry and a distinguished political career not one of them has said either that all things are acatalepsy , or that they are cognitive , but that they are no more of this kind than of that , or that they are sometimes of this kind , sometimes not , or that for one person they are of this kind , for another person not of this kind , and for another person not even existent at all nor do they say that all things in general , or some things , are accessible to us , or not accessible to us , but that they are no more accessible to us than not , or that they are sometimes accessible to us , sometimes not , or that they are accessible to one person but not to another but the same thing is , it might be said , no more true than false , convincing than unconvincing , or existent or non-existent ; or sometimes the one , sometimes the other ; or of such a kind for one person but not for another ) but the academics , he says , especially those from the present-day academy , are sometimes in agreement with stoic beliefs , and to tell the truth turn out to be stoics fighting with stoics aenesidemus is considered the creator of the ten modes of aenesidemus ) —although whether he invented the tropes or just systematized them from prior pyrrhonist works is unknown he therefore rejects any concept of absolute knowledge of reality , since each person has different perceptions , and they arrange their sense-gathered data in methods specific to themselves

there is no definite evidence about the life of aenesidemus , but his most important work , the pyrrhonian discourses was known to be dedicated to lucius aelius tubero , a friend of cicero and member of plato 's academy whom photius described as a colleague based on this information , scholars have assumed that aenesidemus himself was also a member of the academy furthermore , it has been assumed that he took part under the leadership of philo of larissa and probably adopted pyrrhonism either in reaction to antiochus of ascalon introduction of stoic and peripatetic dogma into the academy or philo 's acceptance of provisional beliefs what little we know of aenesidemus is by way of photius ( in his myriobiblion ) , sextus empiricus , and also to a lesser extent by diogenes laërtius and philo of alexandria in writing the discourses aenesidemus addresses them to lucius tubero , one of his colleagues from the academy , a roman by birth , with an illustrious ancestry and a distinguished political career nor indeed , do they say there is true or false , convincing or unconvincing , existent or non-existent but the same thing is , it might be said , no more true than false , convincing than unconvincing , or existent or non-existent ; or sometimes the one , sometimes the other ; or of such a kind for one person but not for another these similar considerations are set out by aenesidemus of aegae at the beginning of his discourses , to indicate the difference between the pyrrhonists and academics aenesidemus is considered the creator of the ten modes of aenesidemus ) —although whether he invented the tropes or just systematized them from prior pyrrhonist works is unknown either in the pyrrhonian discourses or some other work that did not survive , aenesidemus assimilated the theories of heraclitus , as is discussed in the outlines of pyrrhonism of sextus empiricus below , burnet discusses sextus empiricus ' reproduction of aenesidemus account of the theories of heraclitus it is as follows ( ritter and preller ( 1898 ) historia philosophiae graecae section 41 ) : '' the natural philosopher is of opinion that what surrounds us is rational and endowed with consciousness unlike other pyrrhonists who reported that following pyrrho 's prescription contained in the pyrrho philosophy produced ataraxia , aenesidemus is reported to have claimed that it produces pleasure ( perhaps in addition to , ataraxia )

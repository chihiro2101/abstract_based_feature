there is no definite evidence about the life of aenesidemus , but his most important work , the pyrrhonian discourses was known to be dedicated to lucius aelius tubero , a friend of cicero and member of plato 's academy whom photius described as a colleague based on this information , scholars have assumed that aenesidemus himself was also a member of the academy what little we know of aenesidemus is by way of photius ( in his myriobiblion ) , sextus empiricus , and also to a lesser extent by diogenes laërtius and philo of alexandria his chief work , known in ancient greek as pyrrhoneioi logoi ( πυρρώνειοι λóγοι ) and often rendered into english as the pyrrhonian discourses or pyrrhonian principles , dealt primarily with man 's need to suspend judgment due to our epistemology limitations the overall aim of the book is to establish that there is no firm basis for cognition , either through sense-perception , or indeed through thought consequently , he says , neither the pyrrhonists nor the others know the truth in things ; but the philosophers of other persuasions , as well as being ignorant in general , and wearing themselves out uselessly and expending themselves in ceaseless torments , are also ignorant of the very fact that they have cognition of none of the things of which they think that they have gained cognition and even with regard to what he knows , he has the propriety to assent no more to its affirmation than to its denial in writing the discourses aenesidemus addresses them to lucius tubero , one of his colleagues from the academy , a roman by birth , with an illustrious ancestry and a distinguished political career not one of them has said either that all things are acatalepsy , or that they are cognitive , but that they are no more of this kind than of that , or that they are sometimes of this kind , sometimes not , or that for one person they are of this kind , for another person not of this kind , and for another person not even existent at all nor do they say that all things in general , or some things , are accessible to us , or not accessible to us , but that they are no more accessible to us than not , or that they are sometimes accessible to us , sometimes not , or that they are accessible to one person but not to another ) but the academics , he says , especially those from the present-day academy , are sometimes in agreement with stoic beliefs , and to tell the truth turn out to be stoics fighting with stoics above all , the pyrrhonists , by entertaining doubts about every thesis , maintain consistency and do not conflict with themselves , whereas the academics are unaware that they are conflicting with themselves either in the pyrrhonian discourses or some other work that did not survive , aenesidemus assimilated the theories of heraclitus , as is discussed in the outlines of pyrrhonism of sextus empiricus

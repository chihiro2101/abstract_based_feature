there is no definite evidence about the life of aenesidemus , but his most important work , the pyrrhonian discourses was known to be dedicated to lucius aelius tubero , a friend of cicero and member of plato 's academy whom photius described as a colleague based on this information , scholars have assumed that aenesidemus himself was also a member of the academy furthermore , it has been assumed that he took part under the leadership of philo of larissa and probably adopted pyrrhonism either in reaction to antiochus of ascalon introduction of stoic and peripatetic dogma into the academy or philo 's acceptance of provisional beliefs what little we know of aenesidemus is by way of photius ( in his myriobiblion ) , sextus empiricus , and also to a lesser extent by diogenes laërtius and philo of alexandria his chief work , known in ancient greek as pyrrhoneioi logoi ( πυρρώνειοι λóγοι ) and often rendered into english as the pyrrhonian discourses or pyrrhonian principles , dealt primarily with man 's need to suspend judgment due to our epistemology limitations i read aenesidemus ' eight pyrrhonist discourses the overall aim of the book is to establish that there is no firm basis for cognition , either through sense-perception , or indeed through thought consequently , he says , neither the pyrrhonists nor the others know the truth in things ; but the philosophers of other persuasions , as well as being ignorant in general , and wearing themselves out uselessly and expending themselves in ceaseless torments , are also ignorant of the very fact that they have cognition of none of the things of which they think that they have gained cognition in writing the discourses aenesidemus addresses them to lucius tubero , one of his colleagues from the academy , a roman by birth , with an illustrious ancestry and a distinguished political career nor do they say that all things in general , or some things , are accessible to us , or not accessible to us , but that they are no more accessible to us than not , or that they are sometimes accessible to us , sometimes not , or that they are accessible to one person but not to another aenesidemus is considered the creator of the ten modes of aenesidemus ) —although whether he invented the tropes or just systematized them from prior pyrrhonist works is unknown when we awake again , however , it looks out through the openings of the senses , as if through windows , and coming together with the surrounding mind , it assumes the power of reason in particular , the identification of “ that which surrounds us ” with the air can not be herakleitean ; for herakleitos knew nothing of air except as a form of water ( § 27 )

there is no definite evidence about the life of aenesidemus , but his most important work , the pyrrhonian discourses was known to be dedicated to lucius aelius tubero , a friend of cicero and member of plato 's academy whom photius described as a colleague furthermore , it has been assumed that he took part under the leadership of philo of larissa and probably adopted pyrrhonism either in reaction to antiochus of ascalon introduction of stoic and peripatetic dogma into the academy or philo 's acceptance of provisional beliefs consequently , he says , neither the pyrrhonists nor the others know the truth in things ; but the philosophers of other persuasions , as well as being ignorant in general , and wearing themselves out uselessly and expending themselves in ceaseless torments , are also ignorant of the very fact that they have cognition of none of the things of which they think that they have gained cognition in writing the discourses aenesidemus addresses them to lucius tubero , one of his colleagues from the academy , a roman by birth , with an illustrious ancestry and a distinguished political career not one of them has said either that all things are acatalepsy , or that they are cognitive , but that they are no more of this kind than of that , or that they are sometimes of this kind , sometimes not , or that for one person they are of this kind , for another person not of this kind , and for another person not even existent at all nor do they say that all things in general , or some things , are accessible to us , or not accessible to us , but that they are no more accessible to us than not , or that they are sometimes accessible to us , sometimes not , or that they are accessible to one person but not to another but the same thing is , it might be said , no more true than false , convincing than unconvincing , or existent or non-existent ; or sometimes the one , sometimes the other ; or of such a kind for one person but not for another ) but the academics , he says , especially those from the present-day academy , are sometimes in agreement with stoic beliefs , and to tell the truth turn out to be stoics fighting with stoics thus the followers of pyrrho , in determining nothing , remain absolutely above reproach , whereas the academics , he says , incur a scrutiny similar to that faced by the other philosophers these similar considerations are set out by aenesidemus of aegae at the beginning of his discourses , to indicate the difference between the pyrrhonists and academics for in sleep , when the openings of the senses dose , the mind which is in us is cut off from contact with that which surrounds us , and only our connexion with it by means of respiration is preserved as a sort of root ( from which the rest may spring again ) ; and , when it is thus separated , it loses the power of memory that it had before in particular , the identification of “ that which surrounds us ” with the air can not be herakleitean ; for herakleitos knew nothing of air except as a form of water ( § 27 ) unlike other pyrrhonists who reported that following pyrrho 's prescription contained in the pyrrho philosophy produced ataraxia , aenesidemus is reported to have claimed that it produces pleasure ( perhaps in addition to , ataraxia )

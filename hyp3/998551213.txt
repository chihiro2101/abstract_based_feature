concomitant esotropia – that is , an inward squint that does not vary with the direction of gaze – mostly sets in before 12 months of age ( this constitutes 40 % of all strabismus cases ) or at the age of three or four ; constant esotropia : a constant esotropia , as the name implies , is present all the time in very rare cases , they may only occur in repeated cycles of 'one day on , one day off ' ( cyclic esotropia ) a patient can have a constant esotropia for reading , but an intermittent esotropia for distance ( but rarely vice versa ) accommodative esotropia ( also called refractive esotropia ) is an inward turning of the eyes due to efforts of accommodation the chances of an esotropia developing in a hyperopic child will depend to some degree on the amount of hyperopia present however , where the degree of error is small enough to allow the child to generate clear vision by over-accommodation , but large enough to disrupt their binocular control , esotropia will result where the esotropia is solely a consequence of uncorrected hyperopic refractive error , providing the child with the correct glasses and ensuring that these are worn all the time , is often enough to control the deviation a second type of accommodative esotropia also exists , known as 'convergence excess esotropia congenital esotropia , or infantile esotropia , is a specific sub-type of primary concomitant esotropia someone with esotropia will squint with either the right or the left eye but never with both eyes simultaneously in a left esotropia , the left eye 'squints , ' and in a right esotropia the right eye 'squints where a patient tends to consistently fixate with one eye and squint with the other , the eye that squints is likely to develop some amblyopia

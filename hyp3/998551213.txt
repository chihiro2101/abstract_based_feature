; constant esotropia : a constant esotropia , as the name implies , is present all the time a patient can have a constant esotropia for reading , but an intermittent esotropia for distance ( but rarely vice versa ) accommodative esotropia ( also called refractive esotropia ) is an inward turning of the eyes due to efforts of accommodation where the degree of hyperopia is large , the child may not be able to produce clear vision no matter how much extra-accommodation is exerted and thus no incentive exists for the over-accommodation and convergence that can give rise to the onset of esotropia however , where the degree of error is small enough to allow the child to generate clear vision by over-accommodation , but large enough to disrupt their binocular control , esotropia will result where the esotropia is solely a consequence of uncorrected hyperopic refractive error , providing the child with the correct glasses and ensuring that these are worn all the time , is often enough to control the deviation in such cases , known as 'fully accommodative esotropias , ' the esotropia will only be seen when the child removes their glasses a second type of accommodative esotropia also exists , known as 'convergence excess esotropia thus , in such cases , even when all underlying hyperopic refractive errors have been corrected , the child will continue to squint when looking at very small objects or reading small print congenital esotropia , or infantile esotropia , is a specific sub-type of primary concomitant esotropia someone with esotropia will squint with either the right or the left eye but never with both eyes simultaneously in a left esotropia , the left eye 'squints , ' and in a right esotropia the right eye 'squints esotropias can be concomitant , where the size of the deviation does not vary with direction of gazeâ€”or incomitant , where the direction of gaze does affect the size , or indeed presence , of the esotropia

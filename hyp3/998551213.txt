; constant esotropia : a constant esotropia , as the name implies , is present all the time in very rare cases , they may only occur in repeated cycles of 'one day on , one day off ' ( cyclic esotropia ) accommodative esotropia ( also called refractive esotropia ) is an inward turning of the eyes due to efforts of accommodation the over-convergence associated with the extra accommodation required to overcome a hyperopic refractive error can precipitate a loss of binocular control and lead to the development of esotropia where the esotropia is solely a consequence of uncorrected hyperopic refractive error , providing the child with the correct glasses and ensuring that these are worn all the time , is often enough to control the deviation in such cases , known as 'fully accommodative esotropias , ' the esotropia will only be seen when the child removes their glasses a second type of accommodative esotropia also exists , known as 'convergence excess esotropia many children will gradually learn to control their esotropias , sometimes with the help of orthoptic exercises congenital esotropia , or infantile esotropia , is a specific sub-type of primary concomitant esotropia someone with esotropia will squint with either the right or the left eye but never with both eyes simultaneously where a patient tends to consistently fixate with one eye and squint with the other , the eye that squints is likely to develop some amblyopia use occlusion to treat any amblyopia present and encourage alternation the term '' esotropia '' is ultimately derived from the ancient greek ἔσω ésō , meaning “ within ” , and τρόπος trópos , meaning “ a turn ” .

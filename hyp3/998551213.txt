concomitant esotropia – that is , an inward squint that does not vary with the direction of gaze – mostly sets in before 12 months of age ( this constitutes 40 % of all strabismus cases ) or at the age of three or four ; constant esotropia : a constant esotropia , as the name implies , is present all the time a patient can have a constant esotropia for reading , but an intermittent esotropia for distance ( but rarely vice versa ) accommodative esotropia ( also called refractive esotropia ) is an inward turning of the eyes due to efforts of accommodation the chances of an esotropia developing in a hyperopic child will depend to some degree on the amount of hyperopia present where the degree of error is small , the child will typically be able to maintain control because the amount of over-accommodation required to produce clear vision is also small however , where the degree of error is small enough to allow the child to generate clear vision by over-accommodation , but large enough to disrupt their binocular control , esotropia will result in such cases , known as 'fully accommodative esotropias , ' the esotropia will only be seen when the child removes their glasses a second type of accommodative esotropia also exists , known as 'convergence excess esotropia congenital esotropia , or infantile esotropia , is a specific sub-type of primary concomitant esotropia in a left esotropia , the left eye 'squints , ' and in a right esotropia the right eye 'squints ' in an alternating esotropia , the patient is able to alternate fixation between their right and left eye so that at one moment the right eye fixates and the left eye turns inward , and at the next the left eye fixates and the right turns inward where a patient tends to consistently fixate with one eye and squint with the other , the eye that squints is likely to develop some amblyopia

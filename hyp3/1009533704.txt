the epistolary formulae used in the ramesside period found its roots in the letters composed during the amarna period of the twentieth dynasty wente describes the '' satirical letter '' found on the papyrus anastasi & nbsp ; i of the nineteenth dynasty as an epistle which was commonly copied as a writing exercise by egyptian schoolchildren on ceramic ostraca ( over eighty examples of which have been found so far by archaeologists ) epistles in prose and verse were a major genre of literature among the greeks and particularly the romans christian epistles , both those in the new testament and among the early christian fathers , were written in accordance with the formalized , hellenistic tradition this reflects the amount of hellenistic influence upon the epistle writers , especially in the case of paul classicist steve reece has compared thousands of greek , roman , and jewish letters contemporary with paul and observes that paul follows many of the normal epistolary conventions the scribe ( or more correctly , the amanuensis ) who wrote down the letter may be named at the end of the epistle ( e.g after the names of the author and recipient , pauline epistles often open with the greeting , '' grace and peace to you '' '' grace '' was a common hellenistic greeting , while '' peace '' ( shalom ) was the common jewish greeting ; this reflected paul 's dual identity in jewish faith and hellenistic culture the epistles of the new testament canon are usually divided as follows : the pauline epistles , also called epistles of paul or letters of paul , are the thirteen books of the new testament attributed to paul the apostle , although the authorship of some is in dispute the pauline epistles are usually placed between the acts of the apostles and the catholic epistles in modern editions the first epistle to corinth also called '' a prior epistle of paul to the corinthians '' or '' paul â€™ s previous corinthian letter '' these are letters written by some very early christian leaders , in the 1st or 2nd century , which are not part of the new testament the ennobling word '' epistle '' is used partly because these were all written in greek , in a time period close to when the epistles of the new testament were written , and thus '' epistle '' lends additional weight of authority

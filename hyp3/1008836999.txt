birding , birdwatching , and twitching the term birding was also used for the practice of fowling or hunting with firearms as in shakespeare 's the merry wives of windsor ( 1602 ) : '' she laments sir '' moss 2004:33 the terms birding and birdwatching are today used by some interchangeably , although some participants prefer birding , partly because it includes the auditory aspects of enjoying birds in north america , many birders differentiate themselves from birdwatchers , and the term birder is unfamiliar to most lay people generally , self-described birders perceive themselves to be more versed in minutiae like identification ( aural and visual ) , molt , distribution , migration timing , and habitat usage whereas these dedicated birders may often travel specifically in search of birds , birdwatchers have been described by some enthusiasts as having a more limited scope , perhaps not venturing far from their own yards or local parks to view birds indeed , in 1969 a birding glossary appeared in birding magazine which gave the following definitions : twitching is a british term used to mean '' the pursuit of a previously located rare bird the term twitcher , sometimes misapplied as a synonym for birder , is reserved for those who travel long distances to see a rare bird that would then be ticked , or counted on a list prior terms for those who chased rarities were pot-hunter , tally-hunter , or tick-hunter a rare bird that stays long enough for people to see it is twitchable or chaseable for example , a twitcher who fails to see a rare bird has dipped out ; if other twitchers do see the bird , he may feel gripped off some birders '' count '' species they have identified audibly , while others only record species that they have identified visually moss 2004:10 the study of birds and natural history in general became increasingly prevalent in britain during the victorian era , often associated with collection , eggs and later skins being the artifacts of interest it was only in the late 19th century that the call for bird protection began leading to the rising popularity of observations on living birds the audubon society was started to protect birds from the growing trade in feathers in the united states while the royal society for the protection of birds began in britain moss 2004:72 the phrase '' bird watching '' appeared for the first time as the title of a book '' bird watching '' by edmund selous in 1901 moss 2004:88 in north america , the identification of birds , once thought possible only by shooting was made possible by the emergence of optics and field identification guides the earliest field guide in the us was birds through an opera glass ( 1889 ) by florence bailey birding in north america was focused in the early and mid-20th century in the eastern seaboard region , and was influenced by the works of ludlow griscom and later roger tory peterson bird neighbors ( 1897 ) by neltje blanchan was an early birding book which sold over 250,000 copies the organization and networking of those interested in birds began through organizations like the audubon society that was against the killing of birds and the american ornithologists ' union ( aou ) the rising popularity of the car increased the mobility of birdwatchers and this made new locations accessible to those interested in birds moss 2004:104–106 networks of birdwatchers in the uk began to form in the late 1930s under the british trust for ornithology ( bto ) moss 2004:234–235 travelling far away also led to problems in name usage , british birds like '' wheatear '' , '' heron '' and '' swallow '' needed adjectives to differentiate them in places where there were several related species moss 2004:250 the falling cost of air-travel made flying to remote birding destinations a possibility for a large number of people towards the 1980s since the second half of the 20th century an increasing number of people in developing countries have engaged in this activity , such as in the degua tembien district of ethiopia transnational birding has played an important role in this , as birders in developing countries usually take up the pastime under the influence of foreign cultures with a history of birding binoculars , an essential piece of birding equipment , became more easily available after world war ii , making the hobby of birding more widely accessible kuşcenneti national park ( knp ) at lake manyas , a ramsar site in turkey was estimated to attract birders who spent as much as us 103,320,074 annually one of the expectations of ecotourism is that the travels of birders to a place will contribute to the improvement of the local economy which and in turn ensure that the environment is valued and protected on these occasions , large numbers of birds travel north or south to wintering or nesting locations this more scientific side of the hobby is an aspect of ornithology , coordinated in the uk by the british trust for ornithology such events have been criticised , especially those claimed to aid conservation when they may actually mask serious environmental issues , or where competitive birding involves large amounts of driving competitive birdwatching events include : big day : teams have 24 hours to identify as many species as possible many countries and smaller regions ( states/provinces ) have '' rarities committees '' to check , accept or reject reports of rare birds made by birders a study suggests that males leaned towards competitive birding while females preferred recreational birdwatching moss , stephen ( 2004 ) a bird in the bush : a social history of birdwatching

birding , birdwatching , and twitching the first recorded use of the term birdwatcher was in 1891 ; bird was introduced as a verb in 1918 '' moss 2004:33 the terms birding and birdwatching are today used by some interchangeably , although some participants prefer birding , partly because it includes the auditory aspects of enjoying birds in north america , many birders differentiate themselves from birdwatchers , and the term birder is unfamiliar to most lay people generally , self-described birders perceive themselves to be more versed in minutiae like identification ( aural and visual ) , molt , distribution , migration timing , and habitat usage indeed , in 1969 a birding glossary appeared in birding magazine which gave the following definitions : twitching is a british term used to mean '' the pursuit of a previously located rare bird the term twitcher , sometimes misapplied as a synonym for birder , is reserved for those who travel long distances to see a rare bird that would then be ticked , or counted on a list the term originated in the 1950s , when it was used for the nervous behaviour of howard medhurst , a british birdwatcher the main goal of twitching is often to accumulate species on one 's lists a rare bird that stays long enough for people to see it is twitchable or chaseable for example , a twitcher who fails to see a rare bird has dipped out ; if other twitchers do see the bird , he may feel gripped off many birders maintain a life list , that is , a list of all of the species they have seen in their life , usually with details about the sighting such as date and location the american birding association has specific rules about how a bird species may be documented and recorded in such a list if it is submitted to the aba ; however , the criteria for the personal recording of these lists are very subjective some birders '' count '' species they have identified audibly , while others only record species that they have identified visually some also maintain a country list , state list , county list , yard list , year list , or any combination of these moss 2004:10 the study of birds and natural history in general became increasingly prevalent in britain during the victorian era , often associated with collection , eggs and later skins being the artifacts of interest it was only in the late 19th century that the call for bird protection began leading to the rising popularity of observations on living birds moss 2004:72 the phrase '' bird watching '' appeared for the first time as the title of a book '' bird watching '' by edmund selous in 1901 moss 2004:88 in north america , the identification of birds , once thought possible only by shooting was made possible by the emergence of optics and field identification guides bird neighbors ( 1897 ) by neltje blanchan was an early birding book which sold over 250,000 copies in the field , among the feathered : a history of birders & their guides , oxford university press , the rising popularity of the car increased the mobility of birdwatchers and this made new locations accessible to those interested in birds moss 2004:104â€“106 networks of birdwatchers in the uk began to form in the late 1930s under the british trust for ornithology ( bto ) the bto saw the potential to produce scientific results through the networks , unlike the royal society for the protection of birds ( rspb ) which like the audubon society originated from the bird protection movement transnational birding has played an important role in this , as birders in developing countries usually take up the pastime under the influence of foreign cultures with a history of birding in the 20th century most of the birding activity in north america was done on the east coast the publication of roger tory peterson 's field guide in 1934 led to the initial increase in birding the 2000 publication of '' the sibley guide to birds '' sold 500,000 copies by 2002 one of the expectations of ecotourism is that the travels of birders to a place will contribute to the improvement of the local economy which and in turn ensure that the environment is valued and protected many birders occupy themselves with observing local species ( birding in their '' local patch '' ) , but may also make specific trips to observe birds in other locales the most active times of the year for birding in temperate zones are during the spring or fall migrations when the greatest variety of birds may be seen these birdwatchers may also count all birds in a given area , as in the christmas bird count or follow carefully designed study protocols due to their accessibility and ubiquity , birds are a useful tool for environmental education and awareness on environmental issues hides ( known as blinds in north america ) or observation towers are often used to conceal the observers from birds , and/or to improve viewing conditions photography has always been a part of birding , but in the past the cost of cameras with super-telephoto lenses made this a minority , often semi-professional , interest many birdwatchers have spent their entire lives trying to see all the bird species of the world moss , stephen ( 2004 ) a bird in the bush : a social history of birdwatching

birding , birdwatching , and twitching the first recorded use of the term birdwatcher was in 1891 ; bird was introduced as a verb in 1918 the term birding was also used for the practice of fowling or hunting with firearms as in shakespeare 's the merry wives of windsor ( 1602 ) : '' she laments sir '' moss 2004:33 the terms birding and birdwatching are today used by some interchangeably , although some participants prefer birding , partly because it includes the auditory aspects of enjoying birds in north america , many birders differentiate themselves from birdwatchers , and the term birder is unfamiliar to most lay people at the most basic level , the distinction is perceived as one of dedication or intensity , though this is a subjective differentiation generally , self-described birders perceive themselves to be more versed in minutiae like identification ( aural and visual ) , molt , distribution , migration timing , and habitat usage whereas these dedicated birders may often travel specifically in search of birds , birdwatchers have been described by some enthusiasts as having a more limited scope , perhaps not venturing far from their own yards or local parks to view birds indeed , in 1969 a birding glossary appeared in birding magazine which gave the following definitions : twitching is a british term used to mean '' the pursuit of a previously located rare bird the term twitcher , sometimes misapplied as a synonym for birder , is reserved for those who travel long distances to see a rare bird that would then be ticked , or counted on a list the main goal of twitching is often to accumulate species on one 's lists some birders engage in competition to accumulate the longest species list a rare bird that stays long enough for people to see it is twitchable or chaseable twitching is highly developed in the united kingdom , the netherlands , denmark , ireland , finland and sweden many birders maintain a life list , that is , a list of all of the species they have seen in their life , usually with details about the sighting such as date and location the american birding association has specific rules about how a bird species may be documented and recorded in such a list if it is submitted to the aba ; however , the criteria for the personal recording of these lists are very subjective some birders '' count '' species they have identified audibly , while others only record species that they have identified visually some also maintain a country list , state list , county list , yard list , year list , or any combination of these moss 2004:10 the study of birds and natural history in general became increasingly prevalent in britain during the victorian era , often associated with collection , eggs and later skins being the artifacts of interest it was only in the late 19th century that the call for bird protection began leading to the rising popularity of observations on living birds the audubon society was started to protect birds from the growing trade in feathers in the united states while the royal society for the protection of birds began in britain birding in north america was focused in the early and mid-20th century in the eastern seaboard region , and was influenced by the works of ludlow griscom and later roger tory peterson the organization and networking of those interested in birds began through organizations like the audubon society that was against the killing of birds and the american ornithologists ' union ( aou ) moss 2004:104â€“106 networks of birdwatchers in the uk began to form in the late 1930s under the british trust for ornithology ( bto ) like the aou in north america , the bou had a focus mainly in collection based taxonomy in the 20th century most of the birding activity in north america was done on the east coast binoculars , an essential piece of birding equipment , became more easily available after world war ii , making the hobby of birding more widely accessible moss 2004:265 about 4 % of north americans were interested in birding in the 1970s and in the mid-1980s at least 11 % were found to watch birds at least 20 days of the year many birders occupy themselves with observing local species ( birding in their '' local patch '' ) , but may also make specific trips to observe birds in other locales on these occasions , large numbers of birds travel north or south to wintering or nesting locations early mornings are typically better as the birds are more active and vocal making them easier to spot competitive birdwatching events include : big day : teams have 24 hours to identify as many species as possible equipment commonly used for birding includes binoculars , a spotting scope with tripod , a smartphone , a notepad , and one or more field guides in the early 1950s the only way of communicating new bird sightings was through the postal system and it was generally too late for the recipients to act on the information the study of birdwatching has been of interest to students of the sociology of science dwarshuis logged 6852 bird species in 40 different countries the 2011 film the big year depicted three birders competing in an american birding association area big year , and the 2019 film birders is a short documentary

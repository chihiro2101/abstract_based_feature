the ios network operating system was developed in the 1980s for routers that had only 256 & nbsp ; kb memory and low cpu processing power when ios was developed , cisco systems ' main product line were routers cisco eventually introduced the native mode for chassis , so that they only run one operating system the ios command-line interface ( cli ) provides a fixed set of multiple-word commands the set available is determined by the '' mode '' and the privilege level of the current user cisco ios has a monolithic architecture , owing to the limited hardware resources of routers and switches in the 1980s instead the process must make a kernel call before other processes get a chance to run the cisco ios monolithic kernel does not implement memory protection for the data of different processes the cisco ios kernel does not perform any memory paging or swapping therefore the addressable memory is limited to the physical memory of the network device on which the operating system is installed in routers with hardware-based forwarding , such as the cisco 12000 series , ios computes the fib in software and loads it into the forwarding hardware ( such as an asic or network processor ) , which performs the actual packet forwarding function cisco 's ios software maintains one idb for each hardware interface in a particular cisco switch or router and one idb for each subinterface ios is shipped as a unique file that has been compiled for specific cisco network devices each ios image therefore include a feature set , which determine the command-line interface ( cli ) commands and features that are available on different cisco devices upgrading to another feature set therefore entails the installation of a new ios image on the networking device and reloading the ios operating system '' train '' is cisco-speak for '' a vehicle for delivering cisco software to a specific set of platforms and features cisco says , '' a train is a vehicle for delivering cisco software to a specific set of platforms and features ( in releases prior to cisco ios release 12.0 , the p train served as the technology train ) â€“ special release train , contains one-off releases designed to fix a certain bug or provide a new feature cisco recommends that all cisco ios devices implement the authentication , authorization , and accounting ( aaa ) security model in 2005 cisco introduced the cisco ios xr network operating system on the cisco 12000 of network routers , extending the microkernel architecture from the crs-1 routers to cisco 's widely deployed core routers

the ios network operating system was developed in the 1980s for routers that had only 256 & nbsp ; kb memory and low cpu processing power when ios was developed , cisco systems ' main product line were routers the company acquired a number of young companies that focused on network switches , such as the inventor of the first ethernet switch kalpana , and as a result cisco switches did not run the ios the cisco catalyst series would for some time run the catos in early modular chassis network switches from cisco , modules with layer 3 routing functionalities were separate devices that ran ios , while the layer 2 switch modules ran catos cisco eventually introduced the native mode for chassis , so that they only run one operating system for the nexus switches cisco developed nx-os , which is similar to ios , except that it is linux-based '' global configuration mode '' provides commands to change the system 's configuration , and '' interface configuration mode '' provides commands to change the configuration of a specific interface cisco ios has a monolithic architecture , owing to the limited hardware resources of routers and switches in the 1980s the cisco ios monolithic kernel does not implement memory protection for the data of different processes therefore the addressable memory is limited to the physical memory of the network device on which the operating system is installed this architecture was implemented by cisco in order to ensure system performance and minimize the operational overheads of the operating system in all versions of cisco ios , routing and forwarding ( switching ) are distinct functions routing and other protocols run as cisco ios processes and contribute to the routing information base ( rib ) this is processed to generate the final ip forwarding table ( fib , forwarding information base ) , which is used by the forwarding function of the router cisco 's ios software maintains one idb for each hardware interface in a particular cisco switch or router and one idb for each subinterface upgrading to another feature set therefore entails the installation of a new ios image on the networking device and reloading the ios operating system most cisco products that run ios also have one or more '' feature sets '' or '' packages '' , typically eight packages for cisco routers and five packages for cisco network switches ( in releases prior to cisco ios release 12.0 , the p train served as the technology train there were other trains from time to time , designed for specific needs â€” for example , the 12.0aa train contained new code required for cisco 's as5800 product in 2005 cisco introduced the cisco ios xr network operating system on the cisco 12000 of network routers , extending the microkernel architecture from the crs-1 routers to cisco 's widely deployed core routers

the ios network operating system was developed in the 1980s for routers that had only 256 & nbsp ; kb memory and low cpu processing power when ios was developed , cisco systems ' main product line were routers the company acquired a number of young companies that focused on network switches , such as the inventor of the first ethernet switch kalpana , and as a result cisco switches did not run the ios the cisco catalyst series would for some time run the catos in early modular chassis network switches from cisco , modules with layer 3 routing functionalities were separate devices that ran ios , while the layer 2 switch modules ran catos cisco eventually introduced the native mode for chassis , so that they only run one operating system for the nexus switches cisco developed nx-os , which is similar to ios , except that it is linux-based cisco ios has a monolithic architecture , owing to the limited hardware resources of routers and switches in the 1980s this architecture was implemented by cisco in order to ensure system performance and minimize the operational overheads of the operating system in all versions of cisco ios , routing and forwarding ( switching ) are distinct functions routing and other protocols run as cisco ios processes and contribute to the routing information base ( rib ) , cisco 7200 ) , most traffic handling , including access control list filtering and forwarding , is done at interrupt level using cisco express forwarding ( cef ) or dcef ( distributed cef ) cisco 's ios software maintains one idb for each hardware interface in a particular cisco switch or router and one idb for each subinterface ios is shipped as a unique file that has been compiled for specific cisco network devices most cisco products that run ios also have one or more '' feature sets '' or '' packages '' , typically eight packages for cisco routers and five packages for cisco network switches the available feature packs are : data adds features like bfd , ip slas , ipx , l2tpv3 , mobile ip , mpls , sctp cisco ios is versioned using three numbers and some letters , in the general form a.b ( c.d ) e , where : a is the major version number ( in releases prior to cisco ios release 12.0 , the p train served as the technology train cisco recommends that all cisco ios devices implement the authentication , authorization , and accounting ( aaa ) security model the ios xr development train used the real-time operating system microkernel ( qnx ) , so a large part of the ios source code was re-written to take advantage of the features offered by the kernel in 2005 cisco introduced the cisco ios xr network operating system on the cisco 12000 of network routers , extending the microkernel architecture from the crs-1 routers to cisco 's widely deployed core routers

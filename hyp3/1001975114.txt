the ios network operating system was developed in the 1980s for routers that had only 256 & nbsp ; kb memory and low cpu processing power when ios was developed , cisco systems ' main product line were routers the company acquired a number of young companies that focused on network switches , such as the inventor of the first ethernet switch kalpana , and as a result cisco switches did not run the ios the cisco catalyst series would for some time run the catos cisco eventually introduced the native mode for chassis , so that they only run one operating system for the nexus switches cisco developed nx-os , which is similar to ios , except that it is linux-based the ios command-line interface ( cli ) provides a fixed set of multiple-word commands the cisco ios monolithic kernel does not implement memory protection for the data of different processes this architecture was implemented by cisco in order to ensure system performance and minimize the operational overheads of the operating system in the event of an ios crash , the operating system automatically reboots and reloads the saved configuration routing and other protocols run as cisco ios processes and contribute to the routing information base ( rib ) this is processed to generate the final ip forwarding table ( fib , forwarding information base ) , which is used by the forwarding function of the router in routers with hardware-based forwarding , such as the cisco 12000 series , ios computes the fib in software and loads it into the forwarding hardware ( such as an asic or network processor ) , which performs the actual packet forwarding function each ios image therefore include a feature set , which determine the command-line interface ( cli ) commands and features that are available on different cisco devices upgrading to another feature set therefore entails the installation of a new ios image on the networking device and reloading the ios operating system most cisco products that run ios also have one or more '' feature sets '' or '' packages '' , typically eight packages for cisco routers and five packages for cisco network switches '' train '' is cisco-speak for '' a vehicle for delivering cisco software to a specific set of platforms and features starting with cisco ios release 15 , there is just a single train , the m/t train for cisco products that required very high availability , such as the cisco crs-1 , the limitations of a monolithic kernel were not acceptable in 2005 cisco introduced the cisco ios xr network operating system on the cisco 12000 of network routers , extending the microkernel architecture from the crs-1 routers to cisco 's widely deployed core routers in 2006 cisco introduced ios software modularity , which extends the microkernel architecture into the ios environment , while still providing the software upgrade capabilities .

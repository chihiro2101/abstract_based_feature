the ios network operating system was developed in the 1980s for routers that had only 256 & nbsp ; kb memory and low cpu processing power when ios was developed , cisco systems ' main product line were routers the company acquired a number of young companies that focused on network switches , such as the inventor of the first ethernet switch kalpana , and as a result cisco switches did not run the ios in early modular chassis network switches from cisco , modules with layer 3 routing functionalities were separate devices that ran ios , while the layer 2 switch modules ran catos cisco eventually introduced the native mode for chassis , so that they only run one operating system for the nexus switches cisco developed nx-os , which is similar to ios , except that it is linux-based there is no memory protection between processes and ios has a run to completion scheduler , which means that the kernel does not pre-empt a running process therefore the addressable memory is limited to the physical memory of the network device on which the operating system is installed this architecture was implemented by cisco in order to ensure system performance and minimize the operational overheads of the operating system the disadvantage of the ios architecture is that it increases the complexity of the operating system , data corruption is possible as one process can write over the data of another , and one process can destabilize the entire operating system or even cause a software-forced crash in all versions of cisco ios , routing and forwarding ( switching ) are distinct functions , cisco 7200 ) , most traffic handling , including access control list filtering and forwarding , is done at interrupt level using cisco express forwarding ( cef ) or dcef ( distributed cef ) in routers with hardware-based forwarding , such as the cisco 12000 series , ios computes the fib in software and loads it into the forwarding hardware ( such as an asic or network processor ) , which performs the actual packet forwarding function cisco 's ios software maintains one idb for each hardware interface in a particular cisco switch or router and one idb for each subinterface each ios image therefore include a feature set , which determine the command-line interface ( cli ) commands and features that are available on different cisco devices information about the ios version and feature-set running on a cisco device can be obtained with the show version command most cisco products that run ios also have one or more '' feature sets '' or '' packages '' , typically eight packages for cisco routers and five packages for cisco network switches ( in releases prior to cisco ios release 12.0 , the p train served as the technology train cisco recommends that all cisco ios devices implement the authentication , authorization , and accounting ( aaa ) security model in 2005 cisco introduced the cisco ios xr network operating system on the cisco 12000 of network routers , extending the microkernel architecture from the crs-1 routers to cisco 's widely deployed core routers in 2006 cisco introduced ios software modularity , which extends the microkernel architecture into the ios environment , while still providing the software upgrade capabilities .

the ios network operating system was developed in the 1980s for routers that had only 256 & nbsp ; kb memory and low cpu processing power when ios was developed , cisco systems ' main product line were routers the company acquired a number of young companies that focused on network switches , such as the inventor of the first ethernet switch kalpana , and as a result cisco switches did not run the ios the cisco catalyst series would for some time run the catos in early modular chassis network switches from cisco , modules with layer 3 routing functionalities were separate devices that ran ios , while the layer 2 switch modules ran catos cisco eventually introduced the native mode for chassis , so that they only run one operating system for the nexus switches cisco developed nx-os , which is similar to ios , except that it is linux-based using the embedded event manager feature , the interpreter can be scripted to react to events within the networking environment , such as interface failure or periodic timers cisco ios has a monolithic architecture , owing to the limited hardware resources of routers and switches in the 1980s there is no memory protection between processes and ios has a run to completion scheduler , which means that the kernel does not pre-empt a running process instead the process must make a kernel call before other processes get a chance to run the cisco ios monolithic kernel does not implement memory protection for the data of different processes the cisco ios kernel does not perform any memory paging or swapping in all versions of cisco ios , routing and forwarding ( switching ) are distinct functions each ios image therefore include a feature set , which determine the command-line interface ( cli ) commands and features that are available on different cisco devices information about the ios version and feature-set running on a cisco device can be obtained with the show version command most cisco products that run ios also have one or more '' feature sets '' or '' packages '' , typically eight packages for cisco routers and five packages for cisco network switches ( in releases prior to cisco ios release 12.0 , the p train served as the technology train cisco recommends that all cisco ios devices implement the authentication , authorization , and accounting ( aaa ) security model the ios xr development train used the real-time operating system microkernel ( qnx ) , so a large part of the ios source code was re-written to take advantage of the features offered by the kernel in 2006 cisco introduced ios software modularity , which extends the microkernel architecture into the ios environment , while still providing the software upgrade capabilities .

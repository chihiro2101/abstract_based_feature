the simplest primality test is trial division : given an input number , n , check whether it is evenly divisible by any prime number between 2 and ( i.e otherwise , it is prime riesel ( 1994 ) pp.2-3 for example , consider the number 100 , which is evenly divisible by these numbers : :2 , 4 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 25 , 50 note that the largest factor , 50 , is half of 100 this holds true for all n : all divisors are less than or equal to n/2 unlike the other probabilistic tests , this algorithm produces a primality certificate , and thus can be used to prove that a number is prime a combination of shor 's algorithm , an integer factorization method , with the pocklington primality test could solve the problem in o ( ( \log n ) ^3 ( \log\log n ) ^2 \log\log\log n ) near the beginning of the 20th century , it was shown that a corollary of fermat 's little theorem could be used to test for primality ) the elliptic curve primality test can be proven to run in o ( ( log & nbsp ; n ) 6 ) , if some conjectures on analytic number theory are true subsequently , lenstra and pomerance presented a version of the test which runs in time Ãµ ( ( log & nbsp ; n ) 6 ) unconditionally certain number-theoretic methods exist for testing whether a number is prime , such as the lucas test and proth 's test

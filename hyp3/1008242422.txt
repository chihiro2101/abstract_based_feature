the simplest primality test is trial division : given an input number , n , check whether it is evenly divisible by any prime number between 2 and ( i.e to observe this , rewrite the list of divisors as a list of products , each equal to 100 : :2 × 50 , & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 4 × 25 , & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 5 × 20 , & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 10 × 10 , & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 20 × 5 , & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 25 × 4 , & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 50 × 2 notice that products past 10 x 10 merely repeat numbers which appeared in earlier products unlike the other probabilistic tests , this algorithm produces a primality certificate , and thus can be used to prove that a number is prime a combination of shor 's algorithm , an integer factorization method , with the pocklington primality test could solve the problem in o ( ( \log n ) ^3 ( \log\log n ) ^2 \log\log\log n ) the first deterministic primality test significantly faster than the naive methods was the cyclotomy test ; its runtime can be proven to be o ( ( log & nbsp ; n ) c & nbsp ; log & nbsp ; log & nbsp ; log & nbsp ; n ) , where n is the number to test for primality and c is a constant independent of n ( note that running time is measured in terms of the size of the input , which in this case is ~ log & nbsp ; n , that being the number of bits needed to represent the number n similarly , under the generalized riemann hypothesis , the deterministic miller 's test , which forms the basis of the probabilistic miller–rabin test , can be proved to run in õ ( ( log & nbsp ; n ) 4 ) in 1975 , vaughan pratt showed that there existed a certificate for primality that was checkable in polynomial time , and thus that primes was in np , and therefore in np & nbsp ; ∩ & nbsp ; conp because of its tractability in practice , polynomial-time algorithms assuming the riemann hypothesis , and other similar evidence , it was long suspected but not proven that primality could be solved in polynomial time certain number-theoretic methods exist for testing whether a number is prime , such as the lucas test and proth 's test

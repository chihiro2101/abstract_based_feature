the simplest primality test is trial division : given an input number , n , check whether it is evenly divisible by any prime number between 2 and ( i.e this holds true for all n : all divisors are less than or equal to n/2 ) all even numbers greater than 2 can also be eliminated since , if an even number can divide n , so can 2 unlike the other probabilistic tests , this algorithm produces a primality certificate , and thus can be used to prove that a number is prime a combination of shor 's algorithm , an integer factorization method , with the pocklington primality test could solve the problem in o ( ( \log n ) ^3 ( \log\log n ) ^2 \log\log\log n ) near the beginning of the 20th century , it was shown that a corollary of fermat 's little theorem could be used to test for primality ) the elliptic curve primality test can be proven to run in o ( ( log & nbsp ; n ) 6 ) , if some conjectures on analytic number theory are true in 1975 , vaughan pratt showed that there existed a certificate for primality that was checkable in polynomial time , and thus that primes was in np , and therefore in np & nbsp ; ∩ & nbsp ; conp in 1992 , the adleman–huang algorithm reduced the complexity to zpp rp & nbsp ; ∩ & nbsp ; corp , which superseded pratt 's result certain number-theoretic methods exist for testing whether a number is prime , such as the lucas test and proth 's test

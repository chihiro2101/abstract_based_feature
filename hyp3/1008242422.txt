the simplest primality test is trial division : given an input number , n , check whether it is evenly divisible by any prime number between 2 and ( i.e riesel ( 1994 ) pp.2-3 for example , consider the number 100 , which is evenly divisible by these numbers : :2 , 4 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 25 , 50 note that the largest factor , 50 , is half of 100 this holds true for all n : all divisors are less than or equal to n/2 this holds true for all n : all unique divisors of n are numbers less than or equal to , so we need not search past that unlike the other probabilistic tests , this algorithm produces a primality certificate , and thus can be used to prove that a number is prime however , as this test requires a partial factorization of n & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; 1 the running time was still quite slow in the worst case the first deterministic primality test significantly faster than the naive methods was the cyclotomy test ; its runtime can be proven to be o ( ( log & nbsp ; n ) c & nbsp ; log & nbsp ; log & nbsp ; log & nbsp ; n ) , where n is the number to test for primality and c is a constant independent of n ) the elliptic curve primality test can be proven to run in o ( ( log & nbsp ; n ) 6 ) , if some conjectures on analytic number theory are true similarly , under the generalized riemann hypothesis , the deterministic miller 's test , which forms the basis of the probabilistic miller–rabin test , can be proved to run in õ ( ( log & nbsp ; n ) 4 ) in 1975 , vaughan pratt showed that there existed a certificate for primality that was checkable in polynomial time , and thus that primes was in np , and therefore in np & nbsp ; ∩ & nbsp ; conp

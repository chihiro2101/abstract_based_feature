the second law of thermodynamics image : teeter-totter.png frame a toy called the teeter-totter illustrates , in cross-section , the two aspects of time reversal invariance this is an illustration of the law of increase of entropy through boltzmann 's identification of the logarithm of the number of states with the entropy of these macroscopic laws , most notable is the second law of thermodynamics by eventually making one side of the room cooler than before and the other hotter , it seems to reduce the entropy of the room , and reverse the arrow of time other possible states of the universe ( for example , a universe at heat death equilibrium ) would actually result in no increase of entropy the time reversal of a black hole would be a hypothetical object known as a white hole effect of time reversal on some variables of classical physics however , time reversal itself is seen not to be a symmetry ( this is usually called cp violation ) time reversal violation is unrelated to the second law of thermodynamics , because due to the conservation of the cpt symmetry , the effect of time reversal is to rename particles as antiparticles and vice versa time reversal of noninvasive measurements

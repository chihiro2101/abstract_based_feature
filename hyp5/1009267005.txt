the second law of thermodynamics image : teeter-totter.png frame a toy called the teeter-totter illustrates , in cross-section , the two aspects of time reversal invariance this is an illustration of the law of increase of entropy through boltzmann 's identification of the logarithm of the number of states with the entropy by eventually making one side of the room cooler than before and the other hotter , it seems to reduce the entropy of the room , and reverse the arrow of time many analyses have been made of this ; all show that when the entropy of room and demon are taken together , this total entropy does increase other possible states of the universe ( for example , a universe at heat death equilibrium ) would actually result in no increase of entropy the laws of gravity seem to be time reversal invariant in classical mechanics ; however , specific solutions need not be effect of time reversal on some variables of classical physics time reversal transformation for fermions in quantum field theories can be represented by an 8-component spinor in which the above-mentioned t-parity can be a complex number with unit radius time reversal violation is unrelated to the second law of thermodynamics , because due to the conservation of the cpt symmetry , the effect of time reversal is to rename particles as antiparticles and vice versa strong measurements ( both classical and quantum ) are certainly disturbing , causing asymmetry due to the second law of thermodynamics

the second law of thermodynamics image : teeter-totter.png frame a toy called the teeter-totter illustrates , in cross-section , the two aspects of time reversal invariance this is an illustration of the law of increase of entropy through boltzmann 's identification of the logarithm of the number of states with the entropy of these macroscopic laws , most notable is the second law of thermodynamics in this notion , a fixed initial state of a macroscopic system corresponds to relatively low entropy because the coordinates of the molecules of the body are constrained the laws of gravity seem to be time reversal invariant in classical mechanics ; however , specific solutions need not be they are two different kinds of horizonsâ€”the horizon of a white hole is like the horizon of a black hole turned inside-out in physical and chemical kinetics , t-symmetry of the mechanical microscopic equations implies two important laws : the principle of detailed balance and the onsager reciprocal relations time reversal violation is unrelated to the second law of thermodynamics , because due to the conservation of the cpt symmetry , the effect of time reversal is to rename particles as antiparticles and vice versa strong measurements ( both classical and quantum ) are certainly disturbing , causing asymmetry due to the second law of thermodynamics surprisingly , it is true only in classical physics but not quantum , even in a thermodynamically invariant equilibrium state

the second law of thermodynamics image : teeter-totter.png frame a toy called the teeter-totter illustrates , in cross-section , the two aspects of time reversal invariance this is an illustration of the law of increase of entropy through boltzmann 's identification of the logarithm of the number of states with the entropy of these macroscopic laws , most notable is the second law of thermodynamics by eventually making one side of the room cooler than before and the other hotter , it seems to reduce the entropy of the room , and reverse the arrow of time the laws of gravity seem to be time reversal invariant in classical mechanics ; however , specific solutions need not be however , time reversal itself is seen not to be a symmetry ( this is usually called cp violation ) time reversal violation is unrelated to the second law of thermodynamics , because due to the conservation of the cpt symmetry , the effect of time reversal is to rename particles as antiparticles and vice versa thus the second law of thermodynamics is thought to originate in the initial conditions in the universe strong measurements ( both classical and quantum ) are certainly disturbing , causing asymmetry due to the second law of thermodynamics this type of asymmetry is independent of cpt symmetry but has not yet been confirmed experimentally due to extreme conditions of the checking proposal .

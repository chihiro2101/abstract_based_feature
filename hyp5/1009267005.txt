the second law of thermodynamics image : teeter-totter.png frame a toy called the teeter-totter illustrates , in cross-section , the two aspects of time reversal invariance when set into motion atop a pedestal ( rocking side to side , as in the image ) , the figure oscillates for a very long time this is an illustration of the law of increase of entropy through boltzmann 's identification of the logarithm of the number of states with the entropy of these macroscopic laws , most notable is the second law of thermodynamics many analyses have been made of this ; all show that when the entropy of room and demon are taken together , this total entropy does increase they are two different kinds of horizonsâ€”the horizon of a white hole is like the horizon of a black hole turned inside-out , the laws are invariant under simultaneous operation of time reversal , parity and charge conjugation time reversal violation is unrelated to the second law of thermodynamics , because due to the conservation of the cpt symmetry , the effect of time reversal is to rename particles as antiparticles and vice versa thus the second law of thermodynamics is thought to originate in the initial conditions in the universe strong measurements ( both classical and quantum ) are certainly disturbing , causing asymmetry due to the second law of thermodynamics

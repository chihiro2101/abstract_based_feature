according to herodotus , gelon 's ancestors came from the island of tilos in the aegean sea and were the founders of the city of gela in southern sicily gelon fought in a number of the conflicts between the various tyrant kings of sicily and earned a reputation as a formidable soldier but it was not until hippocrates was killed in a battle with the native sicel tribe of sicily at hybla that gelon 's rise to power began gelon ruled over gela and his other territories in eastern sicily peacefully for the next five years in 485 bc , the aristocracy of syracuse called the gamori , who had been forced out of the city by the common people , came to gelon seeking his aid gelon now ruled as the new tyrant of syracuse and left his brother hiero to rule over gela under gelon 's rule , syracuse soon became prosperous gelon found a powerful ally in theron , tyrant of acragas , a city west of gela , after he married theron 's daughter , demareta theron of acragas had jeopardized the independence of all of sicily from the powerful carthaginians when he defeated the tyrant terillus at himera a contingent of gelon 's men gained access to the carthaginian camp by posing as allies from the nearby city of selinus gelon died in 478 bc after ruling syracuse for seven years the city faced east towards the greek mainland and had its own harbour there is little doubt that if hamilcar had managed to defeat the large sicilian force of gelon and theron , he could have conquered the entire island of sicily if he so wished but by defeating hamilcar in 480 bc , gelon managed to keep sicily free from carthaginian invasion for the next seventy years perhaps the greatest testament to his influence over sicily is how his statue was spared as timoleon tried to erase all memory of the reign of tyrants when sicily became a democracy 150 years after gelon 's death

xml schema , published as a w3c recommendation in may 2001 , is one of several xml schema it was the first separate schema language for xml to achieve recommendation status by the w3c because of confusion between xml schema as a specific w3c specification , and the use of the same term to describe schema languages in general , some parts of the user community referred to this language as wxs , an initialism for w3c xml schema , while others referred to it as xsd , an initialism for xml schema definition see schema - w3c see w3c xml schema definition language ( xsd ) 1.1 part 1 : structures in version 1.1 the w3c has chosen to adopt xsd as the preferred name , and that is the name used in this article in its appendix of references , the xsd specification acknowledges the influence of dtds and other early xml schema efforts such as ddml , sox , xml-data , and xdr of those languages , xdr and sox continued to be used and supported for a while after xml schema was published a number of microsoft products supported xdr until the release of msxml 6.0 ( which dropped xdr in favor of xml schema ) in december 2006 technically , a schema is an abstract collection of metadata , consisting of a set of schema components : chiefly element and attribute declarations and complex and simple type definitions schema documents are organized by namespace : all the named schema components belong to a target namespace , and the target namespace is a property of the schema document as a whole a schema document may include other schema documents for the same namespace , and may import schema documents for a different namespace '' xsi '' is the conventional prefix for the namespace '' xml schema documents usually have the filename extension '' the main components of a schema are : element declarations , which define properties of elements an element may belong to a substitution group ; if element e is in the substitution group of element h , then wherever the schema permits h to appear , e may appear in its place element declarations may be global or local , allowing the same name to be used for unrelated elements in different parts of an instance document an element particle similarly represents the relationship of a complex type and an element declaration , and indicates the minimum and maximum number of times the element may appear in the content simple types ( also called data types ) constrain the textual values that may appear in an element or attribute the xml schema data model includes : the vocabulary ( element and attribute names ) the content model ( relationships and structure ) the data types this collection of information is called the post-schema-validation infoset ( psvi ) the primary reason for defining an xml schema is to formally describe an xml document ; however the resulting schema has a number of other uses that go beyond simple validation w3c xml schema 1.0 specification xsd 1.0 primer xsd 1.0 structures xsd 1.0 datatypes tools w3c xml schema 1.1 specification xsd 1.1 structures xsd 1.1 datatypes other sparql2xquery transform xml schema to owl

xml schema , published as a w3c recommendation in may 2001 , is one of several xml schema it was the first separate schema language for xml to achieve recommendation status by the w3c because of confusion between xml schema as a specific w3c specification , and the use of the same term to describe schema languages in general , some parts of the user community referred to this language as wxs , an initialism for w3c xml schema , while others referred to it as xsd , an initialism for xml schema definition see schema - w3c see w3c xml schema definition language ( xsd ) 1.1 part 1 : structures in version 1.1 the w3c has chosen to adopt xsd as the preferred name , and that is the name used in this article in its appendix of references , the xsd specification acknowledges the influence of dtds and other early xml schema efforts such as ddml , sox , xml-data , and xdr of those languages , xdr and sox continued to be used and supported for a while after xml schema was published the most obvious features offered in xsd that are not available in xml 's native document type definitions ( dtds ) are namespace awareness and datatypes , that is , the ability to define element and attribute content as containing values such as integers and dates rather than arbitrary text technically , a schema is an abstract collection of metadata , consisting of a set of schema components : chiefly element and attribute declarations and complex and simple type definitions in popular usage , however , a schema document is often referred to as a schema schema documents are organized by namespace : all the named schema components belong to a target namespace , and the target namespace is a property of the schema document as a whole a schema document may include other schema documents for the same namespace , and may import schema documents for a different namespace '' xsi '' is the conventional prefix for the namespace '' xml schema documents usually have the filename extension '' these include the element name and target namespace elements may have integrity constraints : uniqueness constraints determining that particular values must be unique within the subtree rooted at an element , and referential constraints determining that values must match the identifier of some other element simple types ( also called data types ) constrain the textual values that may appear in an element or attribute after xml schema-based validation , it is possible to express an xml document 's structure and content in terms of the data model that was implicit during validation the psvi gives a valid xml document its '' type '' and facilitates treating the document as an object , using object-oriented programming ( oop ) paradigms list of xml schemas - list of xml schemas in use on the internet sorted by purpose relax ng - another xml schema language ( an iso international standard ) that is often used with xsd datatypes xml schema editor - information about xsd tools xml schema languages - compares xsd to other xml schema languages w3c xml schema 1.0 specification xsd 1.0 primer xsd 1.0 structures xsd 1.0 datatypes tools w3c xml schema 1.1 specification xsd 1.1 structures xsd 1.1 datatypes other sparql2xquery transform xml schema to owl

xml schema , published as a w3c recommendation in may 2001 , is one of several xml schema it was the first separate schema language for xml to achieve recommendation status by the w3c because of confusion between xml schema as a specific w3c specification , and the use of the same term to describe schema languages in general , some parts of the user community referred to this language as wxs , an initialism for w3c xml schema , while others referred to it as xsd , an initialism for xml schema definition see schema - w3c see w3c xml schema definition language ( xsd ) 1.1 part 1 : structures in version 1.1 the w3c has chosen to adopt xsd as the preferred name , and that is the name used in this article in its appendix of references , the xsd specification acknowledges the influence of dtds and other early xml schema efforts such as ddml , sox , xml-data , and xdr of those languages , xdr and sox continued to be used and supported for a while after xml schema was published a number of microsoft products supported xdr until the release of msxml 6.0 ( which dropped xdr in favor of xml schema ) in december 2006 the most obvious features offered in xsd that are not available in xml 's native document type definitions ( dtds ) are namespace awareness and datatypes , that is , the ability to define element and attribute content as containing values such as integers and dates rather than arbitrary text technically , a schema is an abstract collection of metadata , consisting of a set of schema components : chiefly element and attribute declarations and complex and simple type definitions in popular usage , however , a schema document is often referred to as a schema a schema document may include other schema documents for the same namespace , and may import schema documents for a different namespace '' xsi '' is the conventional prefix for the namespace '' xml schema documents usually have the filename extension '' element declarations may be global or local , allowing the same name to be used for unrelated elements in different parts of an instance document simple types ( also called data types ) constrain the textual values that may appear in an element or attribute the schema can be used to generate human-readable documentation of an xml file structure ; this is especially useful where the authors have made use of the annotation elements schwartzbach presents '' problems with xml schema '' , rick jelliffe rick jelliffe critique in may 2009 , and david webber xsd can not require a specific root element ( so extra information is required to validate even the simplest documents ) the ability to specify wildcards ( for both elements and attributes ) that apply to all types in the schema , so that they all implement the same extensibility policy w3c xml schema 1.0 specification xsd 1.0 primer xsd 1.0 structures xsd 1.0 datatypes tools w3c xml schema 1.1 specification xsd 1.1 structures xsd 1.1 datatypes other sparql2xquery transform xml schema to owl

xml schema , published as a w3c recommendation in may 2001 , is one of several xml schema it was the first separate schema language for xml to achieve recommendation status by the w3c because of confusion between xml schema as a specific w3c specification , and the use of the same term to describe schema languages in general , some parts of the user community referred to this language as wxs , an initialism for w3c xml schema , while others referred to it as xsd , an initialism for xml schema definition see schema - w3c see w3c xml schema definition language ( xsd ) 1.1 part 1 : structures in version 1.1 the w3c has chosen to adopt xsd as the preferred name , and that is the name used in this article in its appendix of references , the xsd specification acknowledges the influence of dtds and other early xml schema efforts such as ddml , sox , xml-data , and xdr of those languages , xdr and sox continued to be used and supported for a while after xml schema was published supported its sox schema language until declaring bankruptcy in late 2004 schemas and schema documents in popular usage , however , a schema document is often referred to as a schema schema documents are organized by namespace : all the named schema components belong to a target namespace , and the target namespace is a property of the schema document as a whole a schema document may include other schema documents for the same namespace , and may import schema documents for a different namespace ( the latter mechanism requires the client invoking validation to trust the document sufficiently to know that it is being validated against the correct schema '' xsi '' is the conventional prefix for the namespace '' xml schema documents usually have the filename extension '' element declarations may be global or local , allowing the same name to be used for unrelated elements in different parts of an instance document an attribute declaration may also include a default value or a fixed value ( which is then the only value the attribute may take in addition , wildcard particles are allowed , which permit a set of different elements ( perhaps any element provided it is in a certain namespace ) it allows new data types to be constructed from these primitives by three mechanisms : restriction ( reducing the set of permitted values ) , list ( allowing a sequence of values ) , and union ( allowing a choice of values from several types ) the primary reason for defining an xml schema is to formally describe an xml document ; however the resulting schema has a number of other uses that go beyond simple validation w3c xml schema 1.0 specification xsd 1.0 primer xsd 1.0 structures xsd 1.0 datatypes tools w3c xml schema 1.1 specification xsd 1.1 structures xsd 1.1 datatypes other sparql2xquery transform xml schema to owl

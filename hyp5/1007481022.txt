xml schema , published as a w3c recommendation in may 2001 , is one of several xml schema it was the first separate schema language for xml to achieve recommendation status by the w3c because of confusion between xml schema as a specific w3c specification , and the use of the same term to describe schema languages in general , some parts of the user community referred to this language as wxs , an initialism for w3c xml schema , while others referred to it as xsd , an initialism for xml schema definition see schema - w3c see w3c xml schema definition language ( xsd ) 1.1 part 1 : structures in version 1.1 the w3c has chosen to adopt xsd as the preferred name , and that is the name used in this article in its appendix of references , the xsd specification acknowledges the influence of dtds and other early xml schema efforts such as ddml , sox , xml-data , and xdr of those languages , xdr and sox continued to be used and supported for a while after xml schema was published a number of microsoft products supported xdr until the release of msxml 6.0 ( which dropped xdr in favor of xml schema ) in december 2006 technically , a schema is an abstract collection of metadata , consisting of a set of schema components : chiefly element and attribute declarations and complex and simple type definitions schema documents are organized by namespace : all the named schema components belong to a target namespace , and the target namespace is a property of the schema document as a whole a schema document may include other schema documents for the same namespace , and may import schema documents for a different namespace elements may have integrity constraints : uniqueness constraints determining that particular values must be unique within the subtree rooted at an element , and referential constraints determining that values must match the identifier of some other element again the properties include the attribute name and target namespace an attribute use represents the relationship of a complex type and an attribute declaration , and indicates whether the attribute is mandatory or optional when it is used in that type an element particle similarly represents the relationship of a complex type and an element declaration , and indicates the minimum and maximum number of times the element may appear in the content simple types ( also called data types ) constrain the textual values that may appear in an element or attribute the schema can be used to generate code , referred to as xml data binding the schema can be used to generate human-readable documentation of an xml file structure ; this is especially useful where the authors have made use of the annotation elements significant new features in xsd 1.1 are : the ability to define assertions against the document content by means of xpath 2.0 expressions ( an idea borrowed from schematron ) w3c xml schema 1.0 specification xsd 1.0 primer xsd 1.0 structures xsd 1.0 datatypes tools w3c xml schema 1.1 specification xsd 1.1 structures xsd 1.1 datatypes other sparql2xquery transform xml schema to owl

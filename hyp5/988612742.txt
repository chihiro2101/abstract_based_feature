standard analog television signals go through several processing steps on their way to being broadcast , each of which discards information and lowers the quality of the resulting images the image is originally captured in rgb form and then processed into three signals known as ypbpr this signal closely matches a traditional black and white television signal and the y/c method of encoding was key to offering backward compatibility the resulting y and c signals are mixed together to produce composite video the s-video cable carries video using two synchronized signal and ground pairs , termed y and c as s-video maintains the two as separate signals , such detrimental low-pass filtering for luminance is unnecessary , although the chrominance signal still has limited bandwidth relative to component video compared with component video , which carries the identical luminance signal but separates the color-difference signals into cb/pb and cr/pr , the color resolution of s-video is limited by the modulation on a subcarrier frequency of 3.57 to 4.43 megahertz , depending on the standard carrying the color information as one signal means that the color has to be encoded in some way , typically in accord with ntsc , pal , or secam , depending on the applicable local standard it is possible for a player to output s-video over scart , but televisions ' scart connectors are not necessarily wired to accept it , and if not the display would show only a monochrome image the european usage of rgb video is because the rgb quality of most retro computers and consoles is better than s-video early y/c video monitors often used phono ( rca connector ) that were switchable between y/c and composite video input audio and video connector rf connector composite monitor list of video connectors video in video out

standard analog television signals go through several processing steps on their way to being broadcast , each of which discards information and lowers the quality of the resulting images once the y signal is produced , it is subtracted from the blue signal to produce pb and from the red signal to produce pr to recover the original rgb information for display , the signals are mixed with the y to produce the original blue and red , and then the sum of those is mixed with the y to recover the green the s-video cable carries video using two synchronized signal and ground pairs , termed y and c in composite video , the signals co-exist on different frequencies as s-video maintains the two as separate signals , such detrimental low-pass filtering for luminance is unnecessary , although the chrominance signal still has limited bandwidth relative to component video the european usage of rgb video is because the rgb quality of most retro computers and consoles is better than s-video the commodore 64 released in 1982 ( with the exception of the earliest revisions using a 5-pin video port ) also offers separate chroma and luma signals using a different connector early y/c video monitors often used phono ( rca connector ) that were switchable between y/c and composite video input a 7-pin socket accepts , and is pin compatible with , a standard 4-pin s-video plug 65px the 8-pin mini-din connector is used in some ati radeon video cards audio and video connector rf connector composite monitor list of video connectors video in video out

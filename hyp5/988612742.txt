the first of these signals is called y , which is created from all three original signals based on a formula that produces an overall brightness of the image , or luma once the y signal is produced , it is subtracted from the blue signal to produce pb and from the red signal to produce pr the resulting y and c signals are mixed together to produce composite video the s-video cable carries video using two synchronized signal and ground pairs , termed y and c y is the luma signal , which carries the luminance & nbsp ; – or black-and-white & nbsp ; – of the picture , including synchronization pulses c is the chroma signal , which carries the chrominance & nbsp ; – or coloring-in & nbsp ; – of the picture the luminance signal carries horizontal and vertical sync pulses in the same way as a composite video signal the signals were put on pin 1 and 5 of a 5-pin 180 degree din connector socket a 7-pin socket accepts , and is pin compatible with , a standard 4-pin s-video plug 65px the 8-pin mini-din connector is used in some ati radeon video cards image : pseudo minidin-9 diagram.png 65px 9-pin connectors are used in graphics systems that feature the ability to input video as well as output it audio and video connector rf connector composite monitor list of video connectors video in video out

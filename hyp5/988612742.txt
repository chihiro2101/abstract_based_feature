standard analog television signals go through several processing steps on their way to being broadcast , each of which discards information and lowers the quality of the resulting images the image is originally captured in rgb form and then processed into three signals known as ypbpr once the y signal is produced , it is subtracted from the blue signal to produce pb and from the red signal to produce pr the resulting y and c signals are mixed together to produce composite video to play back composite video , the y and c signals must be separated , and this is difficult to do without adding artifacts the s-video cable carries video using two synchronized signal and ground pairs , termed y and c as s-video maintains the two as separate signals , such detrimental low-pass filtering for luminance is unnecessary , although the chrominance signal still has limited bandwidth relative to component video the commodore 64 released in 1982 ( with the exception of the earliest revisions using a 5-pin video port ) also offers separate chroma and luma signals using a different connector early y/c video monitors often used phono ( rca connector ) that were switchable between y/c and composite video input a 7-pin socket accepts , and is pin compatible with , a standard 4-pin s-video plug 9-pin video in/video out audio and video connector rf connector composite monitor list of video connectors video in video out

standard analog television signals go through several processing steps on their way to being broadcast , each of which discards information and lowers the quality of the resulting images the image is originally captured in rgb form and then processed into three signals known as ypbpr the first of these signals is called y , which is created from all three original signals based on a formula that produces an overall brightness of the image , or luma the phase and amplitude of the signal represent the two original signals the resulting y and c signals are mixed together to produce composite video the s-video cable carries video using two synchronized signal and ground pairs , termed y and c as s-video maintains the two as separate signals , such detrimental low-pass filtering for luminance is unnecessary , although the chrominance signal still has limited bandwidth relative to component video compared with component video , which carries the identical luminance signal but separates the color-difference signals into cb/pb and cr/pr , the color resolution of s-video is limited by the modulation on a subcarrier frequency of 3.57 to 4.43 megahertz , depending on the standard the european usage of rgb video is because the rgb quality of most retro computers and consoles is better than s-video early y/c video monitors often used phono ( rca connector ) that were switchable between y/c and composite video input the three extra sockets may be used to supply composite video , an rgb or ypbpr video signal , or an iÂ²c interface audio and video connector rf connector composite monitor list of video connectors video in video out

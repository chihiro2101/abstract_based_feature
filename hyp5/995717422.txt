they had a brief spell as a bar band in germany , and then as a backing band for sandra barry , ( sometimes referred to as sandra barry and the boyfriends ) playing on her single '' really gon na shake '' in 1964 '' land of a thousand dances '' b/w '' in my lonely room '' was well received by critics , but sold poorly the action now set about gathering original new material for a projected lp , but recording demos in a radically different byrds-influenced psychedelic style failed to secure them their hoped-for recording deal ( the 1967/68 demos were eventually released in the 1990s under the title rolled gold ) king 's exit left ian whiteman and alan king to share vocal duties , and at this point the action decided on a brief change of name to azoth however the band soon reverted to their old name to record a new set of five demos , where they moved toward a more mid-tempo west coast-influenced psychedelic ballad style and then into folk rock ( these demos were eventually released in 1985 as the action speaks louder than words ) a 1980 compilation of the action 's parlophone tracks came with sleeve notes by paul weller ( '' the action had it in their soul '' ) and did much for their profile , while the rolled gold album demos were hailed as lost classics when they were reissued in the 1990s

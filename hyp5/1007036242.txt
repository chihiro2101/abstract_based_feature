status of the irish plenipotentiaries éamon de valera sent the irish plenipotentiaries to the 1921 negotiations in london with several draft treaties and secret instructions from his cabinet to ascertain how the association of ireland with the community of nations known as the british empire can best be reconciled with irish national aspirations '' this invitation in august had been delayed for over a month by a correspondence in which de valera argued that britain was now negotiating with a sovereign state , a position lloyd george continually denied in the meantime , de valera had been elevated to president of the republic on 26 august , primarily to be able to accredit plenipotentiaries for the negotiations , as is usual between sovereign states on 14 september all the dáil speakers unanimously commented that the plenipotentiaries were being sent to represent the sovereign irish republic , and accepted de valera 's nominations without dissent , although some argued that de valera himself should attend the conference arthur griffith ; comment on the delegates ' credentials both the irish and british sides knew that , in the event of failure , the truce agreed in july 1921 would end and the war would inevitably resume , a war that neither side wanted the ambiguous status of the plenipotentiaries was to have unforeseeable consequences within the nationalist movement when it divided over the treaty 's contents in 1921–22 plenipotentiaries usually have full powers to handle negotiations as they see fit , but de valera had given them instructions to refer back to his cabinet on any '' main question '' and with '' the complete text of the draft treaty about to be signed '' , which created difficulties the pro-treaty side was to argue that after 11 october the negotiations had been conducted on the understanding that , even though the british were not negotiating with a sovereign state , the agreement was a significant first step towards irish sovereignty this was followed by months of delay until october , when the irish delegates set up headquarters in 22 hans place , knightsbridge upon the request of arthur griffith and michael collins , the two delegations began informal negotiations , in which only two members of each negotiating team were allowed to attend on the irish side , these members were always collins and griffith , while on the british side , austen chamberlain always attended , though the second british negotiator would vary from day to day in late november , the irish delegation returned to dublin to consult the cabinet according to their instructions , and again on 3 december when they returned , collins and griffith hammered out the final details of the treaty , which included british concessions on the wording of the oath and the defence and trade clauses , along with the addition of a boundary commission to the treaty and a clause upholding irish unity michael collins later claimed that at the last minute lloyd george threatened the irish delegates with a renewal of '' terrible and immediate war '' the phrase was also cited as '' immediate and terrible war '' , '' the path to freedom notes by general michael collins '' , august 1922 ; collins did not state that the remark was made solely to barton , implying that the whole irish delegation had heard it : '' the threat of 'immediate and terrible war ' did not matter overmuch to me barton noted that : éamon de valera called a cabinet meeting to discuss the treaty on 8 december , where he came out against the treaty as signed the contents of the treaty divided the irish republic 's leadership , with the president of the republic , éamon de valera , leading the anti-treaty minority dáil éireann – volume 3 – 22 december 1921 debate on treaty the dáil voted to approve the treaty but the objectors refused to accept it , leading eventually to the irish civil war griffith , as president of the dáil , worked with michael collins , who chaired the new provisional government of the irish free state , theoretically answerable to the house of commons of southern ireland , as the treaty laid down the treaty 's provisions relating to the monarch , the governor-general , and the treaty 's own superiority in law were all deleted from the constitution of the irish free state in 1932 , following the enactment of the statute of westminster by the british parliament thus , the government of the irish free state was free to change any laws previously passed by the british parliament on their behalf lloyd george had supported the 1893 home rule bill and the slow process of the 1914 home rule act , and liaised with the irish convention members in 1917–18

éamon de valera sent the irish plenipotentiaries to the 1921 negotiations in london with several draft treaties and secret instructions from his cabinet pointedly the british side never asked to see their formal accreditation with the full status of plenipotentiaries , but considered that it had invited them as elected mps : '' to ascertain how the association of ireland with the community of nations known as the british empire can best be reconciled with irish national aspirations '' this invitation in august had been delayed for over a month by a correspondence in which de valera argued that britain was now negotiating with a sovereign state , a position lloyd george continually denied in the meantime , de valera had been elevated to president of the republic on 26 august , primarily to be able to accredit plenipotentiaries for the negotiations , as is usual between sovereign states on 14 september all the dáil speakers unanimously commented that the plenipotentiaries were being sent to represent the sovereign irish republic , and accepted de valera 's nominations without dissent , although some argued that de valera himself should attend the conference 156 , official correspondence relating to the peace negotiations june–september 1921 ( dublin , 1921 ) online version on 7 october de valera signed a letter of accreditation as '' president '' on behalf of the '' government of the republic of ireland '' ( see image ) , but the letter was never requested by the british side plenipotentiaries usually have full powers to handle negotiations as they see fit , but de valera had given them instructions to refer back to his cabinet on any '' main question '' and with '' the complete text of the draft treaty about to be signed '' , which created difficulties the pro-treaty side was to argue that after 11 october the negotiations had been conducted on the understanding that , even though the british were not negotiating with a sovereign state , the agreement was a significant first step towards irish sovereignty days after the truce that ended the anglo-irish war , de valera met lloyd george in london four times in the week starting 14 july on the irish side , these members were always collins and griffith , while on the british side , austen chamberlain always attended , though the second british negotiator would vary from day to day , '' the path to freedom notes by general michael collins '' , august 1922 ; collins did not state that the remark was made solely to barton , implying that the whole irish delegation had heard it : '' the threat of 'immediate and terrible war ' did not matter overmuch to me the cabinet decided by four votes to three to recommend the treaty to the dáil on 14 december the contents of the treaty divided the irish republic 's leadership , with the president of the republic , éamon de valera , leading the anti-treaty minority dáil éireann – volume 3 – 22 december 1921 debate on treaty the dáil voted to approve the treaty but the objectors refused to accept it , leading eventually to the irish civil war under the terms of the treaty , it required approval by : the parliament of the united kingdom , and a '' meeting summoned for the purpose of approving the treaty of the members elected to sit in the house of commons of southern ireland '' this referred to the persons elected at the 1921 irish elections called under the government of ireland act 1920 this '' parliament '' had never in fact come into operation ; one formal meeting took place in june , followed by adjournment sine die : see parliament of southern ireland june 1921 meeting the british house of commons approved the treaty on 16 december 1921 by a vote of 401 to 58 the dáil approved the new treaty after nine days of public debate on 7 january 1922 , by a vote of 64 to 57 , but it was not the assembly specified in the treaty '' preamble to the act on 11 july 1924 , the treaty was registered at the league of nations by the irish free state griffith , as president of the dáil , worked with michael collins , who chaired the new provisional government of the irish free state , theoretically answerable to the house of commons of southern ireland , as the treaty laid down nearly 10 years earlier , michael collins had argued that the treaty would give '' the freedom to achieve freedom '' even de valera 's proposals made in secret during the treaty debates differed very little in essential matters from the accepted text , and were far short of the autonomous 32-county republic that he publicly claimed to pursue

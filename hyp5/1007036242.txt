éamon de valera sent the irish plenipotentiaries to the 1921 negotiations in london with several draft treaties and secret instructions from his cabinet to ascertain how the association of ireland with the community of nations known as the british empire can best be reconciled with irish national aspirations '' this invitation in august had been delayed for over a month by a correspondence in which de valera argued that britain was now negotiating with a sovereign state , a position lloyd george continually denied in the meantime , de valera had been elevated to president of the republic on 26 august , primarily to be able to accredit plenipotentiaries for the negotiations , as is usual between sovereign states on 14 september all the dáil speakers unanimously commented that the plenipotentiaries were being sent to represent the sovereign irish republic , and accepted de valera 's nominations without dissent , although some argued that de valera himself should attend the conference 156 , official correspondence relating to the peace negotiations june–september 1921 ( dublin , 1921 ) online version on 7 october de valera signed a letter of accreditation as '' president '' on behalf of the '' government of the republic of ireland '' ( see image ) , but the letter was never requested by the british side arthur griffith ; comment on the delegates ' credentials both the irish and british sides knew that , in the event of failure , the truce agreed in july 1921 would end and the war would inevitably resume , a war that neither side wanted plenipotentiaries usually have full powers to handle negotiations as they see fit , but de valera had given them instructions to refer back to his cabinet on any '' main question '' and with '' the complete text of the draft treaty about to be signed '' , which created difficulties the pro-treaty side was to argue that after 11 october the negotiations had been conducted on the understanding that , even though the british were not negotiating with a sovereign state , the agreement was a significant first step towards irish sovereignty days after the truce that ended the anglo-irish war , de valera met lloyd george in london four times in the week starting 14 july lloyd george sent his initial proposals on 20 july that were very roughly in line with the treaty that was eventually signed on the irish side , these members were always collins and griffith , while on the british side , austen chamberlain always attended , though the second british negotiator would vary from day to day in late november , the irish delegation returned to dublin to consult the cabinet according to their instructions , and again on 3 december when they returned , collins and griffith hammered out the final details of the treaty , which included british concessions on the wording of the oath and the defence and trade clauses , along with the addition of a boundary commission to the treaty and a clause upholding irish unity michael collins later claimed that at the last minute lloyd george threatened the irish delegates with a renewal of '' terrible and immediate war '' the phrase was also cited as '' immediate and terrible war '' the british would not , i think , have declared terrible and immediate war upon us the contents of the treaty divided the irish republic 's leadership , with the president of the republic , éamon de valera , leading the anti-treaty minority though sinn féin had also campaigned to preserve the irish language , very little use was made of it in the debates dáil éireann – volume 3 – 22 december 1921 debate on treaty the dáil voted to approve the treaty but the objectors refused to accept it , leading eventually to the irish civil war under the terms of the treaty , it required approval by : the parliament of the united kingdom , and a '' meeting summoned for the purpose of approving the treaty of the members elected to sit in the house of commons of southern ireland '' '' by 6 january , the day before the final vote , de valera acknowledged the deep division within his cabinet : '' when these articles of agreement were signed , the body in which the executive authority of this assembly , and of the state , is vested became as completely split as it was possible for it to become on 25 october 1922 , a new irish constitution was enacted by the third dáil , sitting as a constituent assembly ; the british parliament confirmed the enactment on 5 december 1922 two of the other members of the delegation , robert barton and erskine childers , sided against the treaty in the civil war lloyd george had supported the 1893 home rule bill and the slow process of the 1914 home rule act , and liaised with the irish convention members in 1917–18

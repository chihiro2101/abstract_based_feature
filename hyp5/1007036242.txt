éamon de valera sent the irish plenipotentiaries to the 1921 negotiations in london with several draft treaties and secret instructions from his cabinet pointedly the british side never asked to see their formal accreditation with the full status of plenipotentiaries , but considered that it had invited them as elected mps : '' to ascertain how the association of ireland with the community of nations known as the british empire can best be reconciled with irish national aspirations '' this invitation in august had been delayed for over a month by a correspondence in which de valera argued that britain was now negotiating with a sovereign state , a position lloyd george continually denied knirck , '' the dominion of ireland : the anglo-irish treaty in an imperial context in the meantime , de valera had been elevated to president of the republic on 26 august , primarily to be able to accredit plenipotentiaries for the negotiations , as is usual between sovereign states on 14 september all the dáil speakers unanimously commented that the plenipotentiaries were being sent to represent the sovereign irish republic , and accepted de valera 's nominations without dissent , although some argued that de valera himself should attend the conference subsequently , the anti-treaty side felt that the plenipotentiaries from the existing sovereign republic had somehow been persuaded to agree to accept much less the pro-treaty side was to argue that after 11 october the negotiations had been conducted on the understanding that , even though the british were not negotiating with a sovereign state , the agreement was a significant first step towards irish sovereignty upon the request of arthur griffith and michael collins , the two delegations began informal negotiations , in which only two members of each negotiating team were allowed to attend on the irish side , these members were always collins and griffith , while on the british side , austen chamberlain always attended , though the second british negotiator would vary from day to day many points still had to be resolved , mainly surrounding the form of an oath to the monarch , but it was clear to all the politicians involved by this stage that a unitary 32-county irish republic was not on offer when they returned , collins and griffith hammered out the final details of the treaty , which included british concessions on the wording of the oath and the defence and trade clauses , along with the addition of a boundary commission to the treaty and a clause upholding irish unity michael collins later claimed that at the last minute lloyd george threatened the irish delegates with a renewal of '' terrible and immediate war '' the phrase was also cited as '' immediate and terrible war '' , '' the path to freedom notes by general michael collins '' , august 1922 ; collins did not state that the remark was made solely to barton , implying that the whole irish delegation had heard it : '' the threat of 'immediate and terrible war ' did not matter overmuch to me barton noted that : éamon de valera called a cabinet meeting to discuss the treaty on 8 december , where he came out against the treaty as signed under the terms of the treaty , it required approval by : the parliament of the united kingdom , and a '' meeting summoned for the purpose of approving the treaty of the members elected to sit in the house of commons of southern ireland '' this referred to the persons elected at the 1921 irish elections called under the government of ireland act 1920 on 19 december arthur griffith moved : '' that dáil éireann approves of the treaty between great britain and ireland , signed in london on 6 december 1921 they comprise a vital resource on the psychology of the irish war of independence and show the varying ideals that sustained the sinn féin deputies the treaty 's provisions relating to the monarch , the governor-general , and the treaty 's own superiority in law were all deleted from the constitution of the irish free state in 1932 , following the enactment of the statute of westminster by the british parliament thus , the government of the irish free state was free to change any laws previously passed by the british parliament on their behalf nearly 10 years earlier , michael collins had argued that the treaty would give '' the freedom to achieve freedom '' lloyd george had supported the 1893 home rule bill and the slow process of the 1914 home rule act , and liaised with the irish convention members in 1917–18

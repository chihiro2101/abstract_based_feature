éamon de valera sent the irish plenipotentiaries to the 1921 negotiations in london with several draft treaties and secret instructions from his cabinet pointedly the british side never asked to see their formal accreditation with the full status of plenipotentiaries , but considered that it had invited them as elected mps : '' to ascertain how the association of ireland with the community of nations known as the british empire can best be reconciled with irish national aspirations '' this invitation in august had been delayed for over a month by a correspondence in which de valera argued that britain was now negotiating with a sovereign state , a position lloyd george continually denied knirck , '' the dominion of ireland : the anglo-irish treaty in an imperial context in the meantime , de valera had been elevated to president of the republic on 26 august , primarily to be able to accredit plenipotentiaries for the negotiations , as is usual between sovereign states on 14 september all the dáil speakers unanimously commented that the plenipotentiaries were being sent to represent the sovereign irish republic , and accepted de valera 's nominations without dissent , although some argued that de valera himself should attend the conference arthur griffith ; comment on the delegates ' credentials both the irish and british sides knew that , in the event of failure , the truce agreed in july 1921 would end and the war would inevitably resume , a war that neither side wanted the pro-treaty side was to argue that after 11 october the negotiations had been conducted on the understanding that , even though the british were not negotiating with a sovereign state , the agreement was a significant first step towards irish sovereignty days after the truce that ended the anglo-irish war , de valera met lloyd george in london four times in the week starting 14 july lloyd george sent his initial proposals on 20 july that were very roughly in line with the treaty that was eventually signed this was followed by months of delay until october , when the irish delegates set up headquarters in 22 hans place , knightsbridge on the irish side , these members were always collins and griffith , while on the british side , austen chamberlain always attended , though the second british negotiator would vary from day to day many points still had to be resolved , mainly surrounding the form of an oath to the monarch , but it was clear to all the politicians involved by this stage that a unitary 32-county irish republic was not on offer when they returned , collins and griffith hammered out the final details of the treaty , which included british concessions on the wording of the oath and the defence and trade clauses , along with the addition of a boundary commission to the treaty and a clause upholding irish unity barton noted that : éamon de valera called a cabinet meeting to discuss the treaty on 8 december , where he came out against the treaty as signed the contents of the treaty divided the irish republic 's leadership , with the president of the republic , éamon de valera , leading the anti-treaty minority personal bitterness developed ; arthur griffith said of erskine childers : '' i will not reply to any damned englishman in this assembly '' , and cathal brugha reminded everyone that the position of michael collins in the ira was technically inferior to his dáil éireann – volume 3 – 22 december 1921 debate on treaty the dáil voted to approve the treaty but the objectors refused to accept it , leading eventually to the irish civil war under the terms of the treaty , it required approval by : the parliament of the united kingdom , and a '' meeting summoned for the purpose of approving the treaty of the members elected to sit in the house of commons of southern ireland '' the dáil approved the new treaty after nine days of public debate on 7 january 1922 , by a vote of 64 to 57 , but it was not the assembly specified in the treaty griffith , as president of the dáil , worked with michael collins , who chaired the new provisional government of the irish free state , theoretically answerable to the house of commons of southern ireland , as the treaty laid down two of the other members of the delegation , robert barton and erskine childers , sided against the treaty in the civil war thus , the government of the irish free state was free to change any laws previously passed by the british parliament on their behalf

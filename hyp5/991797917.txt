radiant exposure of a surface , denoted h e ( '' e '' for '' energetic '' , to avoid confusion with photometric quantities ) and measured in , is given by : h_\mathrmt , where e v is the illuminance of the surface , measured in lx ; t is the exposure duration , measured in s if the measurement is adjusted to account only for light that reacts with the photo-sensitive surface , that is , weighted by the appropriate spectral sensitivity , the exposure is still measured in radiometric units ( joules per square meter ) , rather than photometric units ( weighted by the nominal sensitivity of the human eye ) in a scene with strong or harsh lighting , the ratio between highlight and shadow luminance values may well be larger than the ratio between the film 's maximum and minimum useful exposure values in this case , adjusting the camera 's exposure settings ( which only applies changes to the whole image , not selectively to parts of the image ) only allows the photographer to choose between underexposed shadows or overexposed highlights ; it can not bring both into the useful exposure range at the same time a photograph may be described as overexposed when it has a loss of highlight detail , that is , when important bright parts of an image are '' washed out '' or effectively all white , known as '' blown-out highlights '' or '' clipped whites '' many photographers choose to control aperture and shutter independently because opening up the aperture increases exposure , but also decreases the depth of field , and a slower shutter increases exposure but also increases the opportunity for motion blur '' manual '' exposure calculations may be based on some method of light metering with a working knowledge of exposure values , the apex system and/or the zone system aperture priority ( commonly abbreviated as a , or av for aperture value ) mode gives the photographer manual control of the aperture , whilst the camera automatically adjusts the shutter speed to achieve the exposure specified by the ttl meter in each case , the actual exposure level is still determined by the camera 's exposure meter if the exposure setting indicated by an exposure meter is taken as the '' reference '' exposure , the photographer may wish to deliberately overexpose or underexpose in order to compensate for known or anticipated metering inaccuracies cameras with any kind of internal exposure meter usually feature an exposure compensation setting which is intended to allow the photographer to simply offset the exposure level from the internal meter 's estimate of appropriate exposure exposure compensation is particularly useful in combination with auto-exposure mode , as it allows the photographer to bias the exposure level without resorting to full manual exposure and losing the flexibility of auto exposure exposure time is controlled in a camera by shutter speed , and the illuminance depends on the lens aperture and the scene luminance an approximately correct exposure will be obtained on a sunny day using iso 100 film , an aperture of and a shutter speed of 1/100 of a second bulb ( photography ) exposure bracketing exposure value film speed gray card high dynamic range imaging light painting light value long exposure multiple flash photographic technique multiple exposure night photography sensitometry ( and hurterâ€“driffield curves ) shutter speed ( also called exposure time ) zebra patterning

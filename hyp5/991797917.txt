radiant exposure of a surface , denoted h e ( '' e '' for '' energetic '' , to avoid confusion with photometric quantities ) and measured in , is given by : h_\mathrmt , where e v is the illuminance of the surface , measured in lx ; t is the exposure duration , measured in s if the measurement is adjusted to account only for light that reacts with the photo-sensitive surface , that is , weighted by the appropriate spectral sensitivity , the exposure is still measured in radiometric units ( joules per square meter ) , rather than photometric units ( weighted by the nominal sensitivity of the human eye ) only in this appropriately weighted case does the h measure the effective amount of light falling on the film , such that the characteristic curve will be correct independent of the spectrum of the light many photographic materials are also sensitive to '' invisible '' light , which can be a nuisance ( see uv filter and ir filter ) , or a benefit ( see infrared photography and full-spectrum photography ) '' correct '' exposure may be defined as an exposure that achieves the effect the photographer intended peterson , bryan , '' understanding exposure '' , 2004 , : p.14 a more technical approach recognises that a photographic film ( or sensor ) has a physically limited sensitometry , ray , s.f 2000 '' the manual of photography '' focal press , , p.121 and p.245 if , for any part of the photograph , the actual exposure is outside this range , the film can not record it accurately therefore , the purpose of exposure adjustment ( and/or lighting adjustment ) is to control the physical amount of light from the subject that is allowed to fall on the film , so that 'significant ' areas of shadow and highlight detail do not exceed the film 's useful exposure range in this case , adjusting the camera 's exposure settings ( which only applies changes to the whole image , not selectively to parts of the image ) only allows the photographer to choose between underexposed shadows or overexposed highlights ; it can not bring both into the useful exposure range at the same time many photographers choose to control aperture and shutter independently because opening up the aperture increases exposure , but also decreases the depth of field , and a slower shutter increases exposure but also increases the opportunity for motion blur if the exposure setting indicated by an exposure meter is taken as the '' reference '' exposure , the photographer may wish to deliberately overexpose or underexpose in order to compensate for known or anticipated metering inaccuracies exposure compensation is particularly useful in combination with auto-exposure mode , as it allows the photographer to bias the exposure level without resorting to full manual exposure and losing the flexibility of auto exposure today , most cameras automatically determine the correct exposure at the time of taking a photograph by using a built-in light meter , or multiple point meters interpreted by a built-in computer , see metering mode negative/print film tends to bias for exposing for the shadow areas ( film dislikes being starved of light ) , with digital favouring exposure for highlights bulb ( photography ) exposure bracketing exposure value film speed gray card high dynamic range imaging light painting light value long exposure multiple flash photographic technique multiple exposure night photography sensitometry ( and hurterâ€“driffield curves ) shutter speed ( also called exposure time ) zebra patterning

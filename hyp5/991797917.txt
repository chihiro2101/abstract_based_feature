radiant exposure of a surface , denoted h e ( '' e '' for '' energetic '' , to avoid confusion with photometric quantities ) and measured in , is given by : h_\mathrmt , where e v is the illuminance of the surface , measured in lx ; t is the exposure duration , measured in s only in this appropriately weighted case does the h measure the effective amount of light falling on the film , such that the characteristic curve will be correct independent of the spectrum of the light 2000 '' the manual of photography '' focal press , , p.121 and p.245 if , for any part of the photograph , the actual exposure is outside this range , the film can not record it accurately therefore , the purpose of exposure adjustment ( and/or lighting adjustment ) is to control the physical amount of light from the subject that is allowed to fall on the film , so that 'significant ' areas of shadow and highlight detail do not exceed the film 's useful exposure range in this case , adjusting the camera 's exposure settings ( which only applies changes to the whole image , not selectively to parts of the image ) only allows the photographer to choose between underexposed shadows or overexposed highlights ; it can not bring both into the useful exposure range at the same time in manual mode , the photographer adjusts the lens aperture and/or shutter speed to achieve the desired exposure a camera in automatic exposure or autoexposure ( usually initialized as ae ) mode automatically calculates and adjusts exposure settings to match ( as closely as possible ) the subject 's mid-tone to the mid-tone of the photograph aperture priority ( commonly abbreviated as a , or av for aperture value ) mode gives the photographer manual control of the aperture , whilst the camera automatically adjusts the shutter speed to achieve the exposure specified by the ttl meter shutter priority ( often abbreviated as s , or tv for time value ) mode gives manual shutter control , with automatic aperture compensation in each case , the actual exposure level is still determined by the camera 's exposure meter if the exposure setting indicated by an exposure meter is taken as the '' reference '' exposure , the photographer may wish to deliberately overexpose or underexpose in order to compensate for known or anticipated metering inaccuracies exposure compensation is particularly useful in combination with auto-exposure mode , as it allows the photographer to bias the exposure level without resorting to full manual exposure and losing the flexibility of auto exposure exposure time is controlled in a camera by shutter speed , and the illuminance depends on the lens aperture and the scene luminance negative/print film tends to bias for exposing for the shadow areas ( film dislikes being starved of light ) , with digital favouring exposure for highlights bulb ( photography ) exposure bracketing exposure value film speed gray card high dynamic range imaging light painting light value long exposure multiple flash photographic technique multiple exposure night photography sensitometry ( and hurterâ€“driffield curves ) shutter speed ( also called exposure time ) zebra patterning

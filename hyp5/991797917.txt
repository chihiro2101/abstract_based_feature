photographers more familiar with base-2 logarithmic scales ( such as exposure values ) can convert using peterson , bryan , '' understanding exposure '' , 2004 , : p.14 a more technical approach recognises that a photographic film ( or sensor ) has a physically limited sensitometry , ray , s.f in this case , adjusting the camera 's exposure settings ( which only applies changes to the whole image , not selectively to parts of the image ) only allows the photographer to choose between underexposed shadows or overexposed highlights ; it can not bring both into the useful exposure range at the same time in manual mode , the photographer adjusts the lens aperture and/or shutter speed to achieve the desired exposure '' manual '' exposure calculations may be based on some method of light metering with a working knowledge of exposure values , the apex system and/or the zone system a camera in automatic exposure or autoexposure ( usually initialized as ae ) mode automatically calculates and adjusts exposure settings to match ( as closely as possible ) the subject 's mid-tone to the mid-tone of the photograph in each case , the actual exposure level is still determined by the camera 's exposure meter the purpose of an exposure meter is to estimate the subject 's mid-tone luminance and indicate the camera exposure settings required to record this as a mid-tone cameras with any kind of internal exposure meter usually feature an exposure compensation setting which is intended to allow the photographer to simply offset the exposure level from the internal meter 's estimate of appropriate exposure exposure compensation is particularly useful in combination with auto-exposure mode , as it allows the photographer to bias the exposure level without resorting to full manual exposure and losing the flexibility of auto exposure on low-end video camcorders , exposure compensation may be the only manual exposure control available exposure is a combination of the length of time and the illuminance at the photosensitive material exposure time is controlled in a camera by shutter speed , and the illuminance depends on the lens aperture and the scene luminance as is 3 stops '' faster '' than , with each stop meaning double the amount of light , a new shutter speed of ( 1/125 ) / ( 2·2·2 ) 1/1000 s is needed latitude is the degree by which one can over , or under expose an image , and still recover an acceptable level of quality from an exposure

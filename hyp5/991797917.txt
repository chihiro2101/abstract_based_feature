radiant exposure of a surface , denoted h e ( '' e '' for '' energetic '' , to avoid confusion with photometric quantities ) and measured in , is given by : h_\mathrmt , where e v is the illuminance of the surface , measured in lx ; t is the exposure duration , measured in s if the measurement is adjusted to account only for light that reacts with the photo-sensitive surface , that is , weighted by the appropriate spectral sensitivity , the exposure is still measured in radiometric units ( joules per square meter ) , rather than photometric units ( weighted by the nominal sensitivity of the human eye ) 2000 '' the manual of photography '' focal press , , p.121 and p.245 if , for any part of the photograph , the actual exposure is outside this range , the film can not record it accurately therefore , the purpose of exposure adjustment ( and/or lighting adjustment ) is to control the physical amount of light from the subject that is allowed to fall on the film , so that 'significant ' areas of shadow and highlight detail do not exceed the film 's useful exposure range many photographers choose to control aperture and shutter independently because opening up the aperture increases exposure , but also decreases the depth of field , and a slower shutter increases exposure but also increases the opportunity for motion blur '' manual '' exposure calculations may be based on some method of light metering with a working knowledge of exposure values , the apex system and/or the zone system shutter priority ( often abbreviated as s , or tv for time value ) mode gives manual shutter control , with automatic aperture compensation the purpose of an exposure meter is to estimate the subject 's mid-tone luminance and indicate the camera exposure settings required to record this as a mid-tone cameras with any kind of internal exposure meter usually feature an exposure compensation setting which is intended to allow the photographer to simply offset the exposure level from the internal meter 's estimate of appropriate exposure frequently calibrated in stops , also known as ev units , a '' +1 '' exposure compensation setting indicates one stop more ( twice as much ) exposure and '' –1 '' means one stop less ( half as much ) exposure exposure compensation is particularly useful in combination with auto-exposure mode , as it allows the photographer to bias the exposure level without resorting to full manual exposure and losing the flexibility of auto exposure on low-end video camcorders , exposure compensation may be the only manual exposure control available an approximately correct exposure will be obtained on a sunny day using iso 100 film , an aperture of and a shutter speed of 1/100 of a second negative/print film tends to bias for exposing for the shadow areas ( film dislikes being starved of light ) , with digital favouring exposure for highlights bulb ( photography ) exposure bracketing exposure value film speed gray card high dynamic range imaging light painting light value long exposure multiple flash photographic technique multiple exposure night photography sensitometry ( and hurter–driffield curves ) shutter speed ( also called exposure time ) zebra patterning

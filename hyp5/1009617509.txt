this theory suggested that in all cases , genes within an operon are negatively controlled by a repressor acting at a single operator located before the first gene later , it was discovered that genes could be positively regulated and also regulated at steps that follow transcription initiation today , the operon is simply defined as a cluster of genes transcribed into a single mrna molecule the first operon to be described was the lac operon in e rrna genes often exist in operons that have been found in a range of eukaryotes including chordates an operon is made up of several structural genes arranged under a common promoter and regulated by a common operator an operon contains one or more structural genes which are generally transcribed into one polycistronic mrna ( a single mrna molecule that codes for more than one protein ) however , the definition of an operon does not require the mrna to be polycistronic , though in practice , it usually is upstream of the structural genes lies a promoter sequence which provides a site for rna polymerase to bind and initiate transcription all the structural genes of an operon are turned on or off together , due to a single promoter and operator upstream to them , but sometimes more control over the gene expression is needed to achieve this aspect , some bacterial genes are located near together , but there is a specific promoter for each of them ; this is called gene clustering it is classically defined in the lac operon as a segment between the promoter and the genes of the operon the lac operon is a negatively controlled inducible operon , where the inducer molecule is allolactose the trp operon , involved in the synthesis of tryptophan ( which itself acts as the corepressor ) , is a negatively controlled repressible operon in the lac operon , lactose binds to the repressor protein and prevents it from repressing gene transcription , while in the trp operon , tryptophan binds to the repressor protein and enables it to repress gene transcription also unlike the lac operon , the trp operon contains a leader peptide and an attenuator sequence which allows for graded regulation an alternative method to predict operons is based on finding gene clusters where gene order and orientation is conserved in two or more genomes

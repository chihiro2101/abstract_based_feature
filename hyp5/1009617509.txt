this theory suggested that in all cases , genes within an operon are negatively controlled by a repressor acting at a single operator located before the first gene today , the operon is simply defined as a cluster of genes transcribed into a single mrna molecule the first operon to be described was the lac operon in e an operon is made up of several structural genes arranged under a common promoter and regulated by a common operator it is defined as a set of adjacent structural genes , plus the adjacent regulatory signals that affect transcription of the structural genes 5 the regulators of a given operon , including repressors , corepressors , and activators , are not necessarily coded for by that operon upstream of the structural genes lies a promoter sequence which provides a site for rna polymerase to bind and initiate transcription all the structural genes of an operon are turned on or off together , due to a single promoter and operator upstream to them , but sometimes more control over the gene expression is needed the main operator ( o1 ) in the lac operon is located slightly downstream of the promoter ; two additional operators , o1 and o3 are located at -82 and +412 , respectively the regulatory gene does not need to be in , adjacent to , or even near the operon to control it an inducer ( small molecule ) can displace a repressor ( protein ) from the operator site ( dna ) , resulting in an uninhibited operon control of an operon is a type of gene regulation that enables organisms to regulate the expression of various genes depending on environmental conditions negative control involves the binding of a repressor to the operator to prevent transcription in negative inducible operons , a regulatory repressor protein is normally bound to the operator , which prevents the transcription of the genes on the operon in negative repressible operons , transcription of the operon normally takes place it also contains a promoter which binds to rna polymerase and an operator which blocks transcription when bound to the protein synthesized by the repressor gene ( trp r ) that binds to the operator in the lac operon , lactose binds to the repressor protein and prevents it from repressing gene transcription , while in the trp operon , tryptophan binds to the repressor protein and enables it to repress gene transcription

the term '' operon '' was first proposed in a short paper in the proceedings of the french academy of science in 1960 this theory suggested that in all cases , genes within an operon are negatively controlled by a repressor acting at a single operator located before the first gene today , the operon is simply defined as a cluster of genes transcribed into a single mrna molecule the first operon to be described was the lac operon in e rrna genes often exist in operons that have been found in a range of eukaryotes including chordates an operon is made up of several structural genes arranged under a common promoter and regulated by a common operator it is defined as a set of adjacent structural genes , plus the adjacent regulatory signals that affect transcription of the structural genes all the structural genes of an operon are turned on or off together , due to a single promoter and operator upstream to them , but sometimes more control over the gene expression is needed thumb an operon is made up of 3 basic dna components : promoter – a nucleotide sequence that enables a gene to be transcribed it is classically defined in the lac operon as a segment between the promoter and the genes of the operon in the case of a repressor , the repressor protein physically obstructs the rna polymerase from transcribing the genes structural genes – the genes that are co-regulated by the operon the regulatory gene does not need to be in , adjacent to , or even near the operon to control it negative control involves the binding of a repressor to the operator to prevent transcription in negative inducible operons , a regulatory repressor protein is normally bound to the operator , which prevents the transcription of the genes on the operon in negative repressible operons , transcription of the operon normally takes place in the lac operon , lactose binds to the repressor protein and prevents it from repressing gene transcription , while in the trp operon , tryptophan binds to the repressor protein and enables it to repress gene transcription

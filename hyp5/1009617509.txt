this theory suggested that in all cases , genes within an operon are negatively controlled by a repressor acting at a single operator located before the first gene later , it was discovered that genes could be positively regulated and also regulated at steps that follow transcription initiation today , the operon is simply defined as a cluster of genes transcribed into a single mrna molecule the first operon to be described was the lac operon in e an operon is made up of several structural genes arranged under a common promoter and regulated by a common operator it is defined as a set of adjacent structural genes , plus the adjacent regulatory signals that affect transcription of the structural genes 5 the regulators of a given operon , including repressors , corepressors , and activators , are not necessarily coded for by that operon the location and condition of the regulators , promoter , operator and structural dna sequences can determine the effects of common mutations operator – a segment of dna to which a repressor binds it is classically defined in the lac operon as a segment between the promoter and the genes of the operon structural genes – the genes that are co-regulated by the operon in negative inducible operons , a regulatory repressor protein is normally bound to the operator , which prevents the transcription of the genes on the operon however , certain molecules called corepressors are bound by the repressor protein , causing a conformational change to the active site the activated repressor protein binds to the operator and prevents transcription while the lac operon can be activated by a chemical ( allolactose ) , the tryptophan ( trp ) operon is inhibited by a chemical ( tryptophan ) in the lac operon , lactose binds to the repressor protein and prevents it from repressing gene transcription , while in the trp operon , tryptophan binds to the repressor protein and enables it to repress gene transcription also unlike the lac operon , the trp operon contains a leader peptide and an attenuator sequence which allows for graded regulation

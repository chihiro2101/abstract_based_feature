this theory suggested that in all cases , genes within an operon are negatively controlled by a repressor acting at a single operator located before the first gene today , the operon is simply defined as a cluster of genes transcribed into a single mrna molecule the first operon to be described was the lac operon in e operons occur primarily in prokaryotes but also in some eukaryotes , including nematodes such as c an operon is made up of several structural genes arranged under a common promoter and regulated by a common operator 5 the regulators of a given operon , including repressors , corepressors , and activators , are not necessarily coded for by that operon an operon contains one or more structural genes which are generally transcribed into one polycistronic mrna ( a single mrna molecule that codes for more than one protein ) operons versus clustering of prokaryotic genes all the structural genes of an operon are turned on or off together , due to a single promoter and operator upstream to them , but sometimes more control over the gene expression is needed to achieve this aspect , some bacterial genes are located near together , but there is a specific promoter for each of them ; this is called gene clustering thumb an operon is made up of 3 basic dna components : promoter – a nucleotide sequence that enables a gene to be transcribed it is classically defined in the lac operon as a segment between the promoter and the genes of the operon structural genes – the genes that are co-regulated by the operon control of an operon is a type of gene regulation that enables organisms to regulate the expression of various genes depending on environmental conditions in negative inducible operons , a regulatory repressor protein is normally bound to the operator , which prevents the transcription of the genes on the operon the lac operon of the model bacterium escherichia coli was the first operon to be discovered and provides a typical example of operon function an alternative method to predict operons is based on finding gene clusters where gene order and orientation is conserved in two or more genomes

the term '' operon '' was first proposed in a short paper in the proceedings of the french academy of science in 1960 this theory suggested that in all cases , genes within an operon are negatively controlled by a repressor acting at a single operator located before the first gene later , it was discovered that genes could be positively regulated and also regulated at steps that follow transcription initiation today , the operon is simply defined as a cluster of genes transcribed into a single mrna molecule the first operon to be described was the lac operon in e an operon is made up of several structural genes arranged under a common promoter and regulated by a common operator an operon contains one or more structural genes which are generally transcribed into one polycistronic mrna ( a single mrna molecule that codes for more than one protein ) upstream of the structural genes lies a promoter sequence which provides a site for rna polymerase to bind and initiate transcription all the structural genes of an operon are turned on or off together , due to a single promoter and operator upstream to them , but sometimes more control over the gene expression is needed to achieve this aspect , some bacterial genes are located near together , but there is a specific promoter for each of them ; this is called gene clustering thumb an operon is made up of 3 basic dna components : promoter â€“ a nucleotide sequence that enables a gene to be transcribed it is classically defined in the lac operon as a segment between the promoter and the genes of the operon in negative inducible operons , a regulatory repressor protein is normally bound to the operator , which prevents the transcription of the genes on the operon if an inducer molecule is present , it binds to the repressor and changes its conformation so that it is unable to bind to the operator the lac operon is a negatively controlled inducible operon , where the inducer molecule is allolactose the lac operon of the model bacterium escherichia coli was the first operon to be discovered and provides a typical example of operon function in the lac operon , lactose binds to the repressor protein and prevents it from repressing gene transcription , while in the trp operon , tryptophan binds to the repressor protein and enables it to repress gene transcription

slip is defined as the relative movement of geological features present on either side of a fault plane these terms are important for distinguishing different dip-slip fault types : reverse faults and normal faults in a reverse fault , the hanging wall displaces upward , while in a normal fault the hanging wall displaces downward distinguishing between these two fault types is important for determining the stress regime of the fault movement based on the direction of slip , faults can be categorized as : strike-slip , where the offset is predominantly horizontal , parallel to the fault trace ; dip-slip , offset is predominantly vertical and/or perpendicular to the fault trace ; or oblique-slip , combining strike and dip slip in a strike-slip fault ( also known as a wrench fault , tear fault or transcurrent fault ) , the fault surface ( plane ) is usually near vertical , and the footwall moves laterally either left or right with very little vertical motion a special class of strike-slip fault is the transform fault when it forms a plate boundary an upthrown block between two normal faults dipping away from each other is a horst a reverse fault is the opposite of a normal fault—the hanging wall moves up relative to the footwall the dip of a reverse fault is relatively steep , greater than 45° a thrust fault has the same sense of motion as a reverse fault , but with the dip of the fault plane at less than 45° thrust faults typically form ramps , flats and fault-bend ( hanging wall and footwall ) folds fault-bend folds are formed by the movement of the hanging wall over a non-planar fault surface and are found associated with both extensional and thrust faults nearly all faults have some component of both dip-slip and strike-slip ; hence , defining a fault as oblique requires both dip and strike components to be measurable and significant the hade angle is defined as the complement of the dip angle ; it is the angle between the fault plane and a vertical plane that strikes parallel to the fault listric faults are similar to normal faults but the fault plane curves , the dip being steeper near the surface , then shallower with increased depth synthetic faults dip in the same direction as the major fault while the antithetic faults dip in the opposite direction

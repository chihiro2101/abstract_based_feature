a fault in ductile rocks can also release instantaneously when the strain rate is too great slip is defined as the relative movement of geological features present on either side of a fault plane a fault 's sense of slip is defined as the relative motion of the rock on each side of the fault concerning the other side the hanging wall occurs above the fault plane and the footwall occurs below it these terms are important for distinguishing different dip-slip fault types : reverse faults and normal faults in a reverse fault , the hanging wall displaces upward , while in a normal fault the hanging wall displaces downward distinguishing between these two fault types is important for determining the stress regime of the fault movement based on the direction of slip , faults can be categorized as : strike-slip , where the offset is predominantly horizontal , parallel to the fault trace ; dip-slip , offset is predominantly vertical and/or perpendicular to the fault trace ; or oblique-slip , combining strike and dip slip strike-slip faults with left-lateral motion are also known as sinistral faults and those with right-lateral motion as dextral faults a special class of strike-slip fault is the transform fault when it forms a plate boundary in a normal fault , the hanging wall moves downward , relative to the footwall a thrust fault has the same sense of motion as a reverse fault , but with the dip of the fault plane at less than 45Â° faults may be reactivated at a later time with the movement in the opposite direction to the original movement ( fault inversion ) a fault which has a component of dip-slip and a component of strike-slip is termed an oblique-slip fault the hade angle is defined as the complement of the dip angle ; it is the angle between the fault plane and a vertical plane that strikes parallel to the fault ring faults are the result of a series of overlapping normal faults , forming a circular outline synthetic faults dip in the same direction as the major fault while the antithetic faults dip in the opposite direction

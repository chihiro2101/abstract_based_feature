a fault in ductile rocks can also release instantaneously when the strain rate is too great slip is defined as the relative movement of geological features present on either side of a fault plane a fault 's sense of slip is defined as the relative motion of the rock on each side of the fault concerning the other side the two sides of a non-vertical fault are known as the hanging wall and footwall these terms are important for distinguishing different dip-slip fault types : reverse faults and normal faults in a reverse fault , the hanging wall displaces upward , while in a normal fault the hanging wall displaces downward in a strike-slip fault ( also known as a wrench fault , tear fault or transcurrent fault ) , the fault surface ( plane ) is usually near vertical , and the footwall moves laterally either left or right with very little vertical motion strike-slip faults with left-lateral motion are also known as sinistral faults and those with right-lateral motion as dextral faults a special class of strike-slip fault is the transform fault when it forms a plate boundary transform faults are also referred to as '' conservative '' plate boundaries since the lithosphere is neither created nor destroyed in a normal fault , the hanging wall moves downward , relative to the footwall low-angle normal faults with regional tectonic significance may be designated detachment faults a thrust fault has the same sense of motion as a reverse fault , but with the dip of the fault plane at less than 45Â° fault-bend folds are formed by the movement of the hanging wall over a non-planar fault surface and are found associated with both extensional and thrust faults a normal fault may therefore become a reverse fault and vice versa the hade angle is defined as the complement of the dip angle ; it is the angle between the fault plane and a vertical plane that strikes parallel to the fault synthetic faults dip in the same direction as the major fault while the antithetic faults dip in the opposite direction

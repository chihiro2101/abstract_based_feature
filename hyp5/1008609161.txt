the regions of higher friction along a fault plane , where it becomes locked , are called asperities a fault in ductile rocks can also release instantaneously when the strain rate is too great a fault 's sense of slip is defined as the relative motion of the rock on each side of the fault concerning the other side . in measuring the horizontal or vertical separation , the throw of the fault is the vertical component of the separation and the heave of the fault is the horizontal component , as in '' throw up and heave out '' these terms are important for distinguishing different dip-slip fault types : reverse faults and normal faults distinguishing between these two fault types is important for determining the stress regime of the fault movement strike-slip faults with left-lateral motion are also known as sinistral faults and those with right-lateral motion as dextral faults a special class of strike-slip fault is the transform fault when it forms a plate boundary a reverse fault is the opposite of a normal fault—the hanging wall moves up relative to the footwall a thrust fault has the same sense of motion as a reverse fault , but with the dip of the fault plane at less than 45° typically , thrust faults move within formations by forming flats and climb up sections with ramps fault-bend folds are formed by the movement of the hanging wall over a non-planar fault surface and are found associated with both extensional and thrust faults faults may be reactivated at a later time with the movement in the opposite direction to the original movement ( fault inversion ) a normal fault may therefore become a reverse fault and vice versa subduction zones are a special class of thrusts that form the largest faults on earth and give rise to the largest earthquakes synthetic and antithetic faults are terms used to describe minor faults associated with a major fault a fault that passes through different levels of the lithosphere will have many different types of fault rock developed along its surface

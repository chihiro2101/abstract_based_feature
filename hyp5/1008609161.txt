the regions of higher friction along a fault plane , where it becomes locked , are called asperities slip is defined as the relative movement of geological features present on either side of a fault plane a fault 's sense of slip is defined as the relative motion of the rock on each side of the fault concerning the other side these terms are important for distinguishing different dip-slip fault types : reverse faults and normal faults in a reverse fault , the hanging wall displaces upward , while in a normal fault the hanging wall displaces downward in a strike-slip fault ( also known as a wrench fault , tear fault or transcurrent fault ) , the fault surface ( plane ) is usually near vertical , and the footwall moves laterally either left or right with very little vertical motion strike-slip faults with left-lateral motion are also known as sinistral faults and those with right-lateral motion as dextral faults each is defined by the direction of movement of the ground as would be seen by an observer on the opposite side of the fault a special class of strike-slip fault is the transform fault when it forms a plate boundary a reverse fault is the opposite of a normal fault—the hanging wall moves up relative to the footwall a thrust fault has the same sense of motion as a reverse fault , but with the dip of the fault plane at less than 45° faults may be reactivated at a later time with the movement in the opposite direction to the original movement ( fault inversion ) a normal fault may therefore become a reverse fault and vice versa the hade angle is defined as the complement of the dip angle ; it is the angle between the fault plane and a vertical plane that strikes parallel to the fault ring faults are the result of a series of overlapping normal faults , forming a circular outline synthetic faults dip in the same direction as the major fault while the antithetic faults dip in the opposite direction a fault that passes through different levels of the lithosphere will have many different types of fault rock developed along its surface

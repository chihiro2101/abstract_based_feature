a fault in ductile rocks can also release instantaneously when the strain rate is too great slip is defined as the relative movement of geological features present on either side of a fault plane a fault 's sense of slip is defined as the relative motion of the rock on each side of the fault concerning the other side . in measuring the horizontal or vertical separation , the throw of the fault is the vertical component of the separation and the heave of the fault is the horizontal component , as in '' throw up and heave out '' the two sides of a non-vertical fault are known as the hanging wall and footwall these terms are important for distinguishing different dip-slip fault types : reverse faults and normal faults distinguishing between these two fault types is important for determining the stress regime of the fault movement in a strike-slip fault ( also known as a wrench fault , tear fault or transcurrent fault ) , the fault surface ( plane ) is usually near vertical , and the footwall moves laterally either left or right with very little vertical motion strike-slip faults with left-lateral motion are also known as sinistral faults and those with right-lateral motion as dextral faults a reverse fault is the opposite of a normal fault—the hanging wall moves up relative to the footwall a thrust fault has the same sense of motion as a reverse fault , but with the dip of the fault plane at less than 45° fault-bend folds are formed by the movement of the hanging wall over a non-planar fault surface and are found associated with both extensional and thrust faults a normal fault may therefore become a reverse fault and vice versa synthetic and antithetic faults are terms used to describe minor faults associated with a major fault synthetic faults dip in the same direction as the major fault while the antithetic faults dip in the opposite direction all faults have a measurable thickness , made up of deformed rock characteristic of the level in the crust where the faulting happened , of the rock types affected by the fault and of the presence and nature of any mineralising fluids a fault that passes through different levels of the lithosphere will have many different types of fault rock developed along its surface

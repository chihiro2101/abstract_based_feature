since 1649 and prior to the protectorate , england , ireland and later scotland had been governed as a republic by the council of state and the rump parliament the process of placing the governance of scotland on a more long term constitutional footing began shortly after the defeat of the scottish royalists and charles ii at the battle of worcester on 28 october 1651 the english rump parliament passed a declaration for union of the english and scottish parliaments , but the process was not completed until an act of union was passed on 26 june 1657 ( see tender of union ) on 20 april 1653 , after learning that parliament was attempting to stay in session despite an agreement to dissolve , and having failed to come up with a working constitution , cromwell , with the backing of the grandees in the army council , marched soldiers into the debating chamber and forcibly ended the rump 's session within a month of the rump 's dismissal , oliver cromwell on the advice of thomas harrison and with the support of other officers in the army , sent a request to congregational churches in every county to nominate those they considered fit to take part in the new government on 4 july a nominated assembly , nicknamed the '' assembly of saints '' or barebone 's parliament ( named after one of its members ) , took on the role of more traditional english parliaments the collapse of the radical consensus which had spawned the nominated assembly led to the grandees passing the instrument of government in the council of state which paved the way for the protectorate after the dissolution of barebone 's parliament , john lambert put forward a new constitution known as the instrument of government , closely modelled on the heads of proposals it made cromwell lord protector for life to undertake '' the chief magistracy and the administration of government '' the first protectorate parliament met on 3 september 1654 , and after some initial gestures approving appointments previously made by cromwell , began to work on a moderate programme of constitutional reform rather than opposing parliament 's bill , cromwell dissolved them on 22 january 1655 the impression of strength and durability of the protectorate when richard succeeded proved deceptive ; a lack of unity would destroy the protectorate he summoned a parliament in 1659 , but the republicans engaged in '' endless obstruction and filibustering '' and attacked the 'quasi-monarchal ' aspects of the protectorate , and they '' condemned oliver 's rule as a period of tyranny and economic depression '' on 7 may a committee of safety was formed on the authority of the rump parliament , displacing the protector 's council of state , and was in turn replaced by a new council of state on 19 may 1659 after richard cromwell was removed from power by the grandees of the new army , the rump parliament was instated and soon after was replaced by the committee of safety and council of state under the authority of charles fleetwood

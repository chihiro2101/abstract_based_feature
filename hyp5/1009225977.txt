since 1649 and prior to the protectorate , england , ireland and later scotland had been governed as a republic by the council of state and the rump parliament the act declaring england to be a commonwealth , which established england , together with '' all the dominions and territoryes thereunto belonging '' , as a republic , had been passed on 19 may 1649 , following the trial and execution of charles i in january of that year on 20 april 1653 , after learning that parliament was attempting to stay in session despite an agreement to dissolve , and having failed to come up with a working constitution , cromwell , with the backing of the grandees in the army council , marched soldiers into the debating chamber and forcibly ended the rump 's session within a month of the rump 's dismissal , oliver cromwell on the advice of thomas harrison and with the support of other officers in the army , sent a request to congregational churches in every county to nominate those they considered fit to take part in the new government however it proved just as difficult for the grandees to control and was in addition a subject of popular ridicule , so on 8 december 1653 mps who supported cromwell engineered its end by passing a dissolution motion at a time of day when the house usually had few members in attendance the collapse of the radical consensus which had spawned the nominated assembly led to the grandees passing the instrument of government in the council of state which paved the way for the protectorate after the dissolution of barebone 's parliament , john lambert put forward a new constitution known as the instrument of government , closely modelled on the heads of proposals however , cromwell 's power was also buttressed by his continuing popularity among the army , which he had built up during the civil wars , and which he subsequently prudently guarded the first protectorate parliament met on 3 september 1654 , and after some initial gestures approving appointments previously made by cromwell , began to work on a moderate programme of constitutional reform the generals supervised militia forces and security commissions , collected taxes and ensured support for the government in the english provinces and wales their position was further harmed by a tax proposal by major general john desborough to provide financial backing for their work , which the second protectorate parliament—instated in september 1656—voted down for fear of a permanent military state instead , cromwell was ceremonially re-installed as lord protector ( with greater powers than had previously been granted him under this title ) at westminster hall , sitting upon king edward 's chair which was specially moved from westminster abbey for the occasion however , cromwell '' had never gained the willing consent of the nation '' and the protectorate relied on armed force after richard cromwell was removed from power by the grandees of the new army , the rump parliament was instated and soon after was replaced by the committee of safety and council of state under the authority of charles fleetwood on 8 may 1660 , the convention parliament declared charles ii the lawful successor of charles i and king

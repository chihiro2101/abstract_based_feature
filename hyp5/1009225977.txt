since 1649 and prior to the protectorate , england , ireland and later scotland had been governed as a republic by the council of state and the rump parliament the act declaring england to be a commonwealth , which established england , together with '' all the dominions and territoryes thereunto belonging '' , as a republic , had been passed on 19 may 1649 , following the trial and execution of charles i in january of that year on 28 october 1651 the english rump parliament passed a declaration for union of the english and scottish parliaments , but the process was not completed until an act of union was passed on 26 june 1657 ( see tender of union ) on 20 april 1653 , after learning that parliament was attempting to stay in session despite an agreement to dissolve , and having failed to come up with a working constitution , cromwell , with the backing of the grandees in the army council , marched soldiers into the debating chamber and forcibly ended the rump 's session on 4 july a nominated assembly , nicknamed the '' assembly of saints '' or barebone 's parliament ( named after one of its members ) , took on the role of more traditional english parliaments however it proved just as difficult for the grandees to control and was in addition a subject of popular ridicule , so on 8 december 1653 mps who supported cromwell engineered its end by passing a dissolution motion at a time of day when the house usually had few members in attendance the collapse of the radical consensus which had spawned the nominated assembly led to the grandees passing the instrument of government in the council of state which paved the way for the protectorate after the dissolution of barebone 's parliament , john lambert put forward a new constitution known as the instrument of government , closely modelled on the heads of proposals it made cromwell lord protector for life to undertake '' the chief magistracy and the administration of government '' cromwell was sworn in as lord protector on 16 december 1653 the first protectorate parliament met on 3 september 1654 , and after some initial gestures approving appointments previously made by cromwell , began to work on a moderate programme of constitutional reform cromwell 's new rights and powers were laid out in the humble petition and advice , a legislative instrument which replaced the instrument of government three things undermined the protectorate : the '' anxieties of the army , the irresponsibility of the parliament and the rashness of richard cromwell '' ; what ultimately prevented the retention of the protectorate was the opposition of the '' junior officers '' and '' many of the common soldiers '' after richard cromwell was removed from power by the grandees of the new army , the rump parliament was instated and soon after was replaced by the committee of safety and council of state under the authority of charles fleetwood on 16 march 1660 , the long parliament dissolved itself after preparations were made for the convention parliament ( 1660 ) to succeed it

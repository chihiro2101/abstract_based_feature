since 1649 and prior to the protectorate , england , ireland and later scotland had been governed as a republic by the council of state and the rump parliament on 28 october 1651 the english rump parliament passed a declaration for union of the english and scottish parliaments , but the process was not completed until an act of union was passed on 26 june 1657 ( see tender of union ) the collapse of the radical consensus which had spawned the nominated assembly led to the grandees passing the instrument of government in the council of state which paved the way for the protectorate after the dissolution of barebone 's parliament , john lambert put forward a new constitution known as the instrument of government , closely modelled on the heads of proposals it made cromwell lord protector for life to undertake '' the chief magistracy and the administration of government '' cromwell was sworn in as lord protector on 16 december 1653 the first protectorate parliament met on 3 september 1654 , and after some initial gestures approving appointments previously made by cromwell , began to work on a moderate programme of constitutional reform rather than opposing parliament 's bill , cromwell dissolved them on 22 january 1655 after a royalist uprising led by john penruddock , cromwell ( influenced by lambert ) divided england into military districts ruled by army major-generals who answered only to him the lord protector became aware of the contribution the jewish community made to the economic success of holland , now england 's leading commercial rival but , most notably , the office of lord protector was still not to become hereditary , though cromwell was now able to nominate his own successor cromwell 's new rights and powers were laid out in the humble petition and advice , a legislative instrument which replaced the instrument of government the impression of strength and durability of the protectorate when richard succeeded proved deceptive ; a lack of unity would destroy the protectorate on 7 may a committee of safety was formed on the authority of the rump parliament , displacing the protector 's council of state , and was in turn replaced by a new council of state on 19 may 1659 after richard cromwell was removed from power by the grandees of the new army , the rump parliament was instated and soon after was replaced by the committee of safety and council of state under the authority of charles fleetwood

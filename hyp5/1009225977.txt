since 1649 and prior to the protectorate , england , ireland and later scotland had been governed as a republic by the council of state and the rump parliament the act declaring england to be a commonwealth , which established england , together with '' all the dominions and territoryes thereunto belonging '' , as a republic , had been passed on 19 may 1649 , following the trial and execution of charles i in january of that year on 28 october 1651 the english rump parliament passed a declaration for union of the english and scottish parliaments , but the process was not completed until an act of union was passed on 26 june 1657 ( see tender of union ) on 20 april 1653 , after learning that parliament was attempting to stay in session despite an agreement to dissolve , and having failed to come up with a working constitution , cromwell , with the backing of the grandees in the army council , marched soldiers into the debating chamber and forcibly ended the rump 's session however it proved just as difficult for the grandees to control and was in addition a subject of popular ridicule , so on 8 december 1653 mps who supported cromwell engineered its end by passing a dissolution motion at a time of day when the house usually had few members in attendance the collapse of the radical consensus which had spawned the nominated assembly led to the grandees passing the instrument of government in the council of state which paved the way for the protectorate after the dissolution of barebone 's parliament , john lambert put forward a new constitution known as the instrument of government , closely modelled on the heads of proposals it made cromwell lord protector for life to undertake '' the chief magistracy and the administration of government '' he had the power to call and dissolve parliaments but was obliged under the instrument to seek the majority vote of the council of state cromwell was sworn in as lord protector on 16 december 1653 the first protectorate parliament met on 3 september 1654 , and after some initial gestures approving appointments previously made by cromwell , began to work on a moderate programme of constitutional reform their position was further harmed by a tax proposal by major general john desborough to provide financial backing for their work , which the second protectorate parliament—instated in september 1656—voted down for fear of a permanent military state the impression of strength and durability of the protectorate when richard succeeded proved deceptive ; a lack of unity would destroy the protectorate he summoned a parliament in 1659 , but the republicans engaged in '' endless obstruction and filibustering '' and attacked the 'quasi-monarchal ' aspects of the protectorate , and they '' condemned oliver 's rule as a period of tyranny and economic depression '' on 7 may a committee of safety was formed on the authority of the rump parliament , displacing the protector 's council of state , and was in turn replaced by a new council of state on 19 may 1659

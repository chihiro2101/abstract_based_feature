the field of molecular evolution came into its own in the 1960s and 1970s , following the rise of molecular biology the advent of protein sequencing allowed molecular biologists to create phylogenies based on sequence comparison , and to use the differences between sequence homology as a molecular clock to estimate the time since the last universal common ancestor in the late 1960s , the neutral theory of molecular evolution provided a theoretical basis for the molecular clock , though both the clock and the neutral theory were controversial , since most evolutionary biologists held strongly to panselectionism , with natural selection as the only important cause of evolutionary change after the 1970s , nucleic acid sequencing allowed molecular evolution to reach beyond proteins to highly conserved ribosomal rna sequences , the foundation of a reconceptualization of the early history of life the content and structure of a genome is the product of the molecular and population genetic forces which act upon that genome novel genetic variants will arise through mutation and will spread and be maintained in populations due to genetic drift or natural selection most mutations that occur are single nucleotide polymorphisms which modify single bases of the dna sequence , resulting in point mutations among these mutations , some will be neutral or beneficial and will remain in the genome unless lost via genetic drift , and others will be detrimental and will be eliminated from the genome by natural selection the resulting independent inheritance of genes results in more efficient selection , meaning that regions with higher recombination will harbor fewer detrimental mutations , more selectively favored variants , and fewer errors in replication and repair gene conversion is a type of recombination that is the product of dna repair where nucleotide damage is corrected using an homologous genomic region as a template gene conversion is often responsible for homogenizing sequences of duplicate genes over long time periods , reducing nucleotide divergence '' nearly neutral '' variants whose selection coefficient is close to a threshold value of 1 / the effective population size will also be affected by chance as well as by selection and mutation with a smaller effective population size , a larger variety of mutations will behave as if they are neutral due to inefficiency of selection greater ability to survive or reproduce , are favored in subsequent generations , thereby increasing the instance of underlying genetic variants in a population selection can be the product of natural selection , artificial selection , or sexual selection in contrast sexual selection is a product of mate choice and can favor the spread of genetic variants which act counter to natural selection but increase desirability to the opposite sex or increase mating success for instance , sexual selection could be more likely to affect molecular evolution of the sex chromosomes due to clustering of sex specific genes on the x , y , z or w examples of such selfish elements include transposable elements , meiotic drivers , killer x chromosomes , selfish mitochondria , and self-propagating introns genome size is influenced by the amount of repetitive dna as well as number of genes in an organism first , repetitive genetic elements can comprise large portions of the genome for many organisms , thereby inflating dna content of the haploid genome hence , in small populations repetitive content and other junk dna can accumulate without placing the organism at a competitive disadvantage genome size , independent of gene content , correlates poorly with most physiological traits and many eukaryotes , including mammals , harbor very large amounts of repetitive dna however , birds likely have experienced strong selection for reduced genome size , in response to changing energetic needs for flight transposable elements are self-replicating , selfish genetic elements which are capable of proliferating within host genomes many transposable elements are related to viruses , and share several proteins in common the number of chromosomes in an organism 's genome also does not necessarily correlate with the amount of dna in its genome human chromosome 2 was created from a fusion of two chimpanzee chromosomes and still contains central telomeres as well as a vestigial second centromere different organisms house different numbers of genes within their genomes as well as different patterns in the distribution of genes throughout the genome some organisms , such as most bacteria , drosophila , and arabidopsis have particularly compact genomes with little repetitive content or non-coding dna other organisms , like mammals or maize , have large amounts of repetitive dna , long introns , and substantial spacing between different genes the content and distribution of genes within the genome can influence the rate at which certain types of mutations occur and can influence the subsequent evolution of different species genes with longer introns are more likely to recombine due to increased physical distance over the coding sequence mitochondrial and chloroplast dna varies across taxa , but membrane-bound proteins , especially electron transport chain constituents are most often encoded in the organelle in a rare departure , some species of mussels are known to inherit mitochondria from father to son hence , there is higher probability of genetic modifications , in regions such as prophages , which is proportional to the probability of de novo formation of genes the nearly neutral theory expanded the neutralist perspective , suggesting that several mutations are nearly neutral , which means both random drift and natural selection is relevant to their dynamics research in molecular evolution is also published in journals of genetics , molecular biology , genomics , systematics , and

the history of molecular evolution starts in the early 20th century with comparative biochemistry , and the use of '' fingerprinting '' methods such as immune assays , gel electrophoresis and paper chromatography in the 1950s to explore homologous proteins the field of molecular evolution came into its own in the 1960s and 1970s , following the rise of molecular biology the advent of protein sequencing allowed molecular biologists to create phylogenies based on sequence comparison , and to use the differences between sequence homology as a molecular clock to estimate the time since the last universal common ancestor after the 1970s , nucleic acid sequencing allowed molecular evolution to reach beyond proteins to highly conserved ribosomal rna sequences , the foundation of a reconceptualization of the early history of life . forces in molecular evolution the content and structure of a genome is the product of the molecular and population genetic forces which act upon that genome novel genetic variants will arise through mutation and will spread and be maintained in populations due to genetic drift or natural selection mutations are permanent , transmissible changes to the genetic material ( dna or rna ) of a cell or virus most mutations that occur are single nucleotide polymorphisms which modify single bases of the dna sequence , resulting in point mutations using the mutation rate per generation and the number of nucleotide differences between two sequences , divergence times can be estimated effectively via the molecular clock recombination is a process that results in genetic exchange between chromosomes or chromosomal regions gene conversion is a type of recombination that is the product of dna repair where nucleotide damage is corrected using an homologous genomic region as a template gene conversion is often responsible for homogenizing sequences of duplicate genes over long time periods , reducing nucleotide divergence genetic drift is the change of allele frequencies from one generation to the next due to stochastic effects of random sampling in finite populations '' nearly neutral '' variants whose selection coefficient is close to a threshold value of 1 / the effective population size will also be affected by chance as well as by selection and mutation selection can be the product of natural selection , artificial selection , or sexual selection natural selection is any selective process that occurs due to the fitness of an organism to its environment for instance , sexual selection could be more likely to affect molecular evolution of the sex chromosomes due to clustering of sex specific genes on the x , y , z or w this is because there can be a selective advantage for selfish dna in spite of a host cost examples of such selfish elements include transposable elements , meiotic drivers , killer x chromosomes , selfish mitochondria , and self-propagating introns genome size is influenced by the amount of repetitive dna as well as number of genes in an organism first , repetitive genetic elements can comprise large portions of the genome for many organisms , thereby inflating dna content of the haploid genome secondly , the number of genes is not necessarily indicative of the number of developmental stages or tissue types in an organism an organism with few developmental stages or tissue types may have large numbers of genes that influence non-developmental phenotypes , inflating gene content relative to developmental gene families neutral explanations for genome size suggest that when population sizes are small , many mutations become nearly neutral hence , in small populations repetitive content and other junk dna can accumulate without placing the organism at a competitive disadvantage many bacteria have also experienced selection for small genome size , as time of replication and energy consumption are so tightly correlated with fitness many transposable elements are related to viruses , and share several proteins in common the number of chromosomes in an organism 's genome also does not necessarily correlate with the amount of dna in its genome the ant myrmecia pilosula has only a single pair of chromosomes whereas the adders-tongue fern ophioglossum reticulatum has up to 1260 chromosomes reduced linkage through creation of additional chromosomes should effectively increase the efficiency of selection polyploidy , especially allopolyploidy , which occurs often in plants , can also result in reproductive incompatibilities with parental species agrodiatus blue butterflies have diverse chromosome numbers ranging from n 10 to n 134 and additionally have one of the highest rates of speciation identified to date different organisms house different numbers of genes within their genomes as well as different patterns in the distribution of genes throughout the genome hence , there is higher probability of genetic modifications , in regions such as prophages , which is proportional to the probability of de novo formation of genes evolution of proteins is studied by comparing the sequences and structures of proteins from many organisms representing distinct evolutionary clades other journals dedicated to molecular evolution include journal of molecular evolution and molecular phylogenetics and evolution research in molecular evolution is also published in journals of genetics , molecular biology , genomics , systematics , and evolutionary biology

the history of molecular evolution starts in the early 20th century with comparative biochemistry , and the use of '' fingerprinting '' methods such as immune assays , gel electrophoresis and paper chromatography in the 1950s to explore homologous proteins the field of molecular evolution came into its own in the 1960s and 1970s , following the rise of molecular biology the advent of protein sequencing allowed molecular biologists to create phylogenies based on sequence comparison , and to use the differences between sequence homology as a molecular clock to estimate the time since the last universal common ancestor in the late 1960s , the neutral theory of molecular evolution provided a theoretical basis for the molecular clock , though both the clock and the neutral theory were controversial , since most evolutionary biologists held strongly to panselectionism , with natural selection as the only important cause of evolutionary change after the 1970s , nucleic acid sequencing allowed molecular evolution to reach beyond proteins to highly conserved ribosomal rna sequences , the foundation of a reconceptualization of the early history of life . forces in molecular evolution the content and structure of a genome is the product of the molecular and population genetic forces which act upon that genome mutations are permanent , transmissible changes to the genetic material ( dna or rna ) of a cell or virus most mutations that occur are single nucleotide polymorphisms which modify single bases of the dna sequence , resulting in point mutations among these mutations , some will be neutral or beneficial and will remain in the genome unless lost via genetic drift , and others will be detrimental and will be eliminated from the genome by natural selection using the mutation rate per generation and the number of nucleotide differences between two sequences , divergence times can be estimated effectively via the molecular clock recombination can also generate particular types of mutations if chromosomes are misaligned gene conversion is a type of recombination that is the product of dna repair where nucleotide damage is corrected using an homologous genomic region as a template genetic drift is the change of allele frequencies from one generation to the next due to stochastic effects of random sampling in finite populations '' nearly neutral '' variants whose selection coefficient is close to a threshold value of 1 / the effective population size will also be affected by chance as well as by selection and mutation with a smaller effective population size , a larger variety of mutations will behave as if they are neutral due to inefficiency of selection selection can be the product of natural selection , artificial selection , or sexual selection for instance , sexual selection could be more likely to affect molecular evolution of the sex chromosomes due to clustering of sex specific genes on the x , y , z or w examples of such selfish elements include transposable elements , meiotic drivers , killer x chromosomes , selfish mitochondria , and self-propagating introns genome size is influenced by the amount of repetitive dna as well as number of genes in an organism the c-value paradox refers to the lack of correlation between organism 'complexity ' and genome size first , repetitive genetic elements can comprise large portions of the genome for many organisms , thereby inflating dna content of the haploid genome many bacteria have also experienced selection for small genome size , as time of replication and energy consumption are so tightly correlated with fitness transposable elements are self-replicating , selfish genetic elements which are capable of proliferating within host genomes changes in chromosome number can play a key role in speciation , as differing chromosome numbers can serve as a barrier to reproduction in hybrids the content and distribution of genes within the genome can influence the rate at which certain types of mutations occur and can influence the subsequent evolution of different species genes with longer introns are more likely to recombine due to increased physical distance over the coding sequence as such , long introns may facilitate ectopic recombination , and result in higher rates of new gene formation mitochondrial and chloroplast dna varies across taxa , but membrane-bound proteins , especially electron transport chain constituents are most often encoded in the organelle in addition to duplicating whole genes , sometimes only a domain or part of a protein is duplicated so that the resulting gene is an elongated version of the parental gene retrogenes often insert into new genomic locations , and often develop new expression patterns and functions chimeric genes form when duplication , deletion , or incomplete retrotransposition combine portions of two different coding sequences to produce a novel gene sequence de novo gene birth can also give rise to new genes from previously non-coding dna mutation of a stop codon to a regular codon or a frameshift may cause an extended protein that includes a previously non-coding sequence . in vitro molecular evolution experiments subtle changes in dna very often have effects , but sometimes these effects are too small for natural selection to act on other journals dedicated to molecular evolution include journal of molecular evolution and molecular phylogenetics and evolution van de peer , '' genome evolution : gene and genome duplications and the origin of novel gene

the history of molecular evolution starts in the early 20th century with comparative biochemistry , and the use of '' fingerprinting '' methods such as immune assays , gel electrophoresis and paper chromatography in the 1950s to explore homologous proteins the field of molecular evolution came into its own in the 1960s and 1970s , following the rise of molecular biology the advent of protein sequencing allowed molecular biologists to create phylogenies based on sequence comparison , and to use the differences between sequence homology as a molecular clock to estimate the time since the last universal common ancestor in the late 1960s , the neutral theory of molecular evolution provided a theoretical basis for the molecular clock , though both the clock and the neutral theory were controversial , since most evolutionary biologists held strongly to panselectionism , with natural selection as the only important cause of evolutionary change after the 1970s , nucleic acid sequencing allowed molecular evolution to reach beyond proteins to highly conserved ribosomal rna sequences , the foundation of a reconceptualization of the early history of life . forces in molecular evolution the content and structure of a genome is the product of the molecular and population genetic forces which act upon that genome novel genetic variants will arise through mutation and will spread and be maintained in populations due to genetic drift or natural selection mutations are permanent , transmissible changes to the genetic material ( dna or rna ) of a cell or virus most mutations that occur are single nucleotide polymorphisms which modify single bases of the dna sequence , resulting in point mutations mutations are stochastic and typically occur randomly across genes among these mutations , some will be neutral or beneficial and will remain in the genome unless lost via genetic drift , and others will be detrimental and will be eliminated from the genome by natural selection because mutations are extremely rare , they accumulate very slowly across generations using the mutation rate per generation and the number of nucleotide differences between two sequences , divergence times can be estimated effectively via the molecular clock damaged bases are first excised , the damaged strand is then aligned with an undamaged homolog , and dna synthesis repairs the excised region using the undamaged strand as a guide gene conversion is often responsible for homogenizing sequences of duplicate genes over long time periods , reducing nucleotide divergence some existing variants have no effect on fitness and may increase or decrease in frequency simply due to chance '' nearly neutral '' variants whose selection coefficient is close to a threshold value of 1 / the effective population size will also be affected by chance as well as by selection and mutation with a smaller effective population size , a larger variety of mutations will behave as if they are neutral due to inefficiency of selection greater ability to survive or reproduce , are favored in subsequent generations , thereby increasing the instance of underlying genetic variants in a population natural selection is any selective process that occurs due to the fitness of an organism to its environment in contrast sexual selection is a product of mate choice and can favor the spread of genetic variants which act counter to natural selection but increase desirability to the opposite sex or increase mating success artificial selection , also known as selective breeding , is imposed by an outside entity , typically humans , in order to increase the frequency of desired traits for instance , sexual selection could be more likely to affect molecular evolution of the sex chromosomes due to clustering of sex specific genes on the x , y , z or w the c-value paradox refers to the lack of correlation between organism 'complexity ' and genome size first , repetitive genetic elements can comprise large portions of the genome for many organisms , thereby inflating dna content of the haploid genome an organism with few developmental stages or tissue types may have large numbers of genes that influence non-developmental phenotypes , inflating gene content relative to developmental gene families neutral explanations for genome size suggest that when population sizes are small , many mutations become nearly neutral birds , unlike humans , produce nucleated red blood cells , and larger nuclei lead to lower levels of oxygen transport many bacteria have also experienced selection for small genome size , as time of replication and energy consumption are so tightly correlated with fitness transposable elements are self-replicating , selfish genetic elements which are capable of proliferating within host genomes mutation of a stop codon to a regular codon or a frameshift may cause an extended protein that includes a previously non-coding sequence the formation of novel genes from scratch typically can not occur within genomic regions of high gene density it uses dna , rna , or protein sequences to resolve questions in systematics , i.e the nearly neutral theory expanded the neutralist perspective , suggesting that several mutations are nearly neutral , which means both random drift and natural selection is relevant to their dynamics whereas , homologous proteins encoded by the genome of a single species are called paralogs the society for molecular biology and evolution publishes the journals '' molecular biology and evolution '' and '' genome biology and evolution '' and holds an annual international meeting van de peer , '' genome evolution : gene and genome duplications and the origin of novel gene functions ''

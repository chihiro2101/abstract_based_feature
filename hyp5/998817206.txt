the history of molecular evolution starts in the early 20th century with comparative biochemistry , and the use of '' fingerprinting '' methods such as immune assays , gel electrophoresis and paper chromatography in the 1950s to explore homologous proteins the field of molecular evolution came into its own in the 1960s and 1970s , following the rise of molecular biology in the late 1960s , the neutral theory of molecular evolution provided a theoretical basis for the molecular clock , though both the clock and the neutral theory were controversial , since most evolutionary biologists held strongly to panselectionism , with natural selection as the only important cause of evolutionary change after the 1970s , nucleic acid sequencing allowed molecular evolution to reach beyond proteins to highly conserved ribosomal rna sequences , the foundation of a reconceptualization of the early history of life . forces in molecular evolution the content and structure of a genome is the product of the molecular and population genetic forces which act upon that genome novel genetic variants will arise through mutation and will spread and be maintained in populations due to genetic drift or natural selection mutations result from errors in dna replication during cell division and by exposure to radiation , chemicals , and other environmental stressors , or viruses and transposable elements most mutations that occur are single nucleotide polymorphisms which modify single bases of the dna sequence , resulting in point mutations most organisms display a strong bias in the types of mutations that occur with strong influence in gc-content mutations are stochastic and typically occur randomly across genes among these mutations , some will be neutral or beneficial and will remain in the genome unless lost via genetic drift , and others will be detrimental and will be eliminated from the genome by natural selection using the mutation rate per generation and the number of nucleotide differences between two sequences , divergence times can be estimated effectively via the molecular clock recombination can also generate particular types of mutations if chromosomes are misaligned damaged bases are first excised , the damaged strand is then aligned with an undamaged homolog , and dna synthesis repairs the excised region using the undamaged strand as a guide '' nearly neutral '' variants whose selection coefficient is close to a threshold value of 1 / the effective population size will also be affected by chance as well as by selection and mutation with a smaller effective population size , a larger variety of mutations will behave as if they are neutral due to inefficiency of selection selection can be the product of natural selection , artificial selection , or sexual selection in contrast sexual selection is a product of mate choice and can favor the spread of genetic variants which act counter to natural selection but increase desirability to the opposite sex or increase mating success artificial selection , also known as selective breeding , is imposed by an outside entity , typically humans , in order to increase the frequency of desired traits for instance , sexual selection could be more likely to affect molecular evolution of the sex chromosomes due to clustering of sex specific genes on the x , y , z or w genome size is influenced by the amount of repetitive dna as well as number of genes in an organism first , repetitive genetic elements can comprise large portions of the genome for many organisms , thereby inflating dna content of the haploid genome an organism with few developmental stages or tissue types may have large numbers of genes that influence non-developmental phenotypes , inflating gene content relative to developmental gene families neutral explanations for genome size suggest that when population sizes are small , many mutations become nearly neutral genome size , independent of gene content , correlates poorly with most physiological traits and many eukaryotes , including mammals , harbor very large amounts of repetitive dna transposable elements are self-replicating , selfish genetic elements which are capable of proliferating within host genomes different organisms house different numbers of genes within their genomes as well as different patterns in the distribution of genes throughout the genome other organisms , like mammals or maize , have large amounts of repetitive dna , long introns , and substantial spacing between different genes the content and distribution of genes within the genome can influence the rate at which certain types of mutations occur and can influence the subsequent evolution of different species as such , long introns may facilitate ectopic recombination , and result in higher rates of new gene formation in addition to the nuclear genome , endosymbiont organelles contain their own genetic material typically as circular plasmids retrogenes often insert into new genomic locations , and often develop new expression patterns and functions selectionist hypotheses argue that selection is the driving force of molecular evolution biases in codon usage are usually explained with reference to the ability of even weak selection to shape molecular evolution thus , despite the difference in mutation rates , it is essential to incorporate nucleic acid evolution into the discussion of protein evolution the society for molecular biology and evolution publishes the journals '' molecular biology and evolution '' and '' genome

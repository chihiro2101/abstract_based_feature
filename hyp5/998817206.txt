the history of molecular evolution starts in the early 20th century with comparative biochemistry , and the use of '' fingerprinting '' methods such as immune assays , gel electrophoresis and paper chromatography in the 1950s to explore homologous proteins the field of molecular evolution came into its own in the 1960s and 1970s , following the rise of molecular biology in the late 1960s , the neutral theory of molecular evolution provided a theoretical basis for the molecular clock , though both the clock and the neutral theory were controversial , since most evolutionary biologists held strongly to panselectionism , with natural selection as the only important cause of evolutionary change after the 1970s , nucleic acid sequencing allowed molecular evolution to reach beyond proteins to highly conserved ribosomal rna sequences , the foundation of a reconceptualization of the early history of life . forces in molecular evolution the content and structure of a genome is the product of the molecular and population genetic forces which act upon that genome mutations are permanent , transmissible changes to the genetic material ( dna or rna ) of a cell or virus most mutations that occur are single nucleotide polymorphisms which modify single bases of the dna sequence , resulting in point mutations mutations are stochastic and typically occur randomly across genes among these mutations , some will be neutral or beneficial and will remain in the genome unless lost via genetic drift , and others will be detrimental and will be eliminated from the genome by natural selection because mutations are extremely rare , they accumulate very slowly across generations while the number of mutations which appears in any single generation may vary , over very long time periods they will appear to accumulate at a regular pace recombination counteracts physical linkage between adjacent genes , thereby reducing genetic hitchhiking gene conversion is a type of recombination that is the product of dna repair where nucleotide damage is corrected using an homologous genomic region as a template damaged bases are first excised , the damaged strand is then aligned with an undamaged homolog , and dna synthesis repairs the excised region using the undamaged strand as a guide gene conversion is often responsible for homogenizing sequences of duplicate genes over long time periods , reducing nucleotide divergence selection can be the product of natural selection , artificial selection , or sexual selection natural selection is any selective process that occurs due to the fitness of an organism to its environment for instance , sexual selection could be more likely to affect molecular evolution of the sex chromosomes due to clustering of sex specific genes on the x , y , z or w this is because there can be a selective advantage for selfish dna in spite of a host cost the c-value paradox refers to the lack of correlation between organism 'complexity ' and genome size first , repetitive genetic elements can comprise large portions of the genome for many organisms , thereby inflating dna content of the haploid genome the number of chromosomes in an organism 's genome also does not necessarily correlate with the amount of dna in its genome human chromosome 2 was created from a fusion of two chimpanzee chromosomes and still contains central telomeres as well as a vestigial second centromere different organisms house different numbers of genes within their genomes as well as different patterns in the distribution of genes throughout the genome other organisms , like mammals or maize , have large amounts of repetitive dna , long introns , and substantial spacing between different genes the content and distribution of genes within the genome can influence the rate at which certain types of mutations occur and can influence the subsequent evolution of different species as such , long introns may facilitate ectopic recombination , and result in higher rates of new gene formation in addition to the nuclear genome , endosymbiont organelles contain their own genetic material typically as circular plasmids chimeric genes form when duplication , deletion , or incomplete retrotransposition combine portions of two different coding sequences to produce a novel gene sequence de novo genes may evolve from transcripts that are already expressed at low levels mutation of a stop codon to a regular codon or a frameshift may cause an extended protein that includes a previously non-coding sequence these events are tolerated if the consequence of these genetic events does not interfere in cellular activities protein evolution describes the changes over time in protein shape , function , and composition overall , the level of polymorphisms in proteins seems to be fairly constant protein evolution is inescapably tied to changes and selection of dna polymorphisms and mutations because protein sequences change in response to alterations in the dna sequence the society for molecular biology and evolution publishes the journals '' molecular biology and evolution '' and '' genome biology and evolution '' and holds an annual international meeting research in molecular evolution is also published in journals of genetics , molecular biology , genomics , systematics , and evolutionary biology

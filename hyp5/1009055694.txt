to prove that the development of '' faster , better and cheaper '' spacecraft was possible ( with three years for development and a cost under 150 & nbsp ; million for the lander , and 25 million for the rover ) to show that it was possible to send a load of scientific instruments to another planet with a simple system and at one-fifteenth the cost of a viking mission ( for comparison , the viking missions cost 935 & nbsp ; million in 1974 or 3.5 & nbsp ; billion in 1997 dollars ) to demonstrate nasa 's commitment to low-cost planetary exploration by finishing the mission with a total expenditure of 280 & nbsp ; million , including the launch vehicle and mission operations the mars pathfinder conducted different investigations on the martian soil using three scientific instruments the lander contained a stereo camera with spatial filters on an expandable pole called imager for mars pathfinder ( imp ) , and the atmospheric structure instrument/meteorology package ( asi/met ) which acts as a mars meteorological station , collecting data about pressure , temperature , and winds the met structure included three windsocks mounted at three heights on a pole , the topmost at about one meter ( yard ) and generally registered winds from the west the sojourner rover had an alpha proton x-ray spectrometer ( apxs ) , which was used to analyze the components of the rocks and soil it provided images of the apxs 's target area and the rover 's tracks on the ground the landing site was an ancient flood plain in mars 's northern hemisphere called '' ares vallis '' ( '' the valley of ares '' , the ancient greek equivalent of the ancient roman deity mars ) and is among the rockiest parts of mars mars pathfinder directly entered mars atmosphere in a retrograde direction from a hyperbolic trajectory at 6.1 & nbsp ; km/s using an atmospheric entry aeroshell ( capsule ) that was derived from the original viking mars lander design the aeroshell consisted of a back shell and a specially designed ablative heatshield to slow to 370 & nbsp ; m/s ( 830 & nbsp ; mph ) where a supersonic disk-gap-band parachute was inflated to slow its descent through the thin martian atmosphere to 68 & nbsp ; m/s ( about 150 & nbsp ; mph ) the lander 's on-board computer used redundant on-board accelerometers to determine the timing of the parachute inflation when the lander reached 1.6 & nbsp ; km above the surface , a radar was used by the on-board computer to determine altitude and descent velocity the airbags were made of four inter-connected multi-layer vectran bags that surrounded the tetrahedron lander the lander 's on-board computer estimated the best time to fire the rockets and cut the bridle so that the lander velocity would be reduced to about 0 & nbsp ; m/s between 15 and 25 & nbsp ; m above the ground after 2.3 seconds , while the rockets were still firing , the lander cut the bridle loose about 21.5 & nbsp ; m above the ground and fell to the ground the lander impacted at 14 & nbsp ; m/s and limited the impact to only 18 & nbsp ; g of deceleration the first bounce was 15.7 & nbsp ; m high and continued bouncing for at least 15 additional bounces ( accelerometer data recording did not continue through all of the bounces ) once the lander stopped rolling , the airbags deflated and retracted toward the lander using four winches mounted on the lander '' petals '' designed to right itself from any initial orientation , the lander happened to roll right side up onto its base petal during sol 1 , the first martian solar day the lander spent on the planet , the lander took pictures and made some meteorologic measurements the rover made measurements of the elements found in those rocks and in the martian soil , while the lander took pictures of the sojourner and the surrounding terrain , in addition to making climate observations sojourner travelled approximately 100 metres in total , never more than 12 & nbsp ; m from the pathfinder station during its 83 sols of operation , it sent 550 photographs to earth and analyzed the chemical properties of 16 locations near the lander the apxs works by irradiating rocks and soil samples with alpha particles ( helium nuclei , which consist of two protons and two neutrons ) '' magnetic properties experiments on the mars pathfinder lander : preliminary results '' jpl mars pathfinder article mars pathfinder litograph set , nasa mars pathfinder nasa/jpl website mars pathfinder 360 view ( released february 26 , 2016 )

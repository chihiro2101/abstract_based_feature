to prove that the development of '' faster , better and cheaper '' spacecraft was possible ( with three years for development and a cost under 150 & nbsp ; million for the lander , and 25 million for the rover ) to show that it was possible to send a load of scientific instruments to another planet with a simple system and at one-fifteenth the cost of a viking mission ( for comparison , the viking missions cost 935 & nbsp ; million in 1974 or 3.5 & nbsp ; billion in 1997 dollars ) to demonstrate nasa 's commitment to low-cost planetary exploration by finishing the mission with a total expenditure of 280 & nbsp ; million , including the launch vehicle and mission operations the mars pathfinder conducted different investigations on the martian soil using three scientific instruments the lander contained a stereo camera with spatial filters on an expandable pole called imager for mars pathfinder ( imp ) , and the atmospheric structure instrument/meteorology package ( asi/met ) which acts as a mars meteorological station , collecting data about pressure , temperature , and winds the sojourner rover had an alpha proton x-ray spectrometer ( apxs ) , which was used to analyze the components of the rocks and soil the rover also had two black-and-white cameras and a color one it provided images of the apxs 's target area and the rover 's tracks on the ground the pixels of this colour camera were arranged in such a way , that out of the 16 pixel of a 4Ã—4 pixel block , 12 pixel were sensitive to green , 2 pixel to red and 2 pixel were sensitive to infrared as well as blue as all cameras had lenses made out of zinc selenide , which blocks light below a wavelength of 500 & nbsp ; nm , no blue light actually reached these '' blue/infrared '' pixels , which therefore recorded only infrared the cameras ' optical resolution was sufficient to resolve 0.6 & nbsp ; cm details across a 0.65 & nbsp ; m range imager for mars pathfinder ( imp ) , ( includes magnetometer and anemometer ) atmospheric and meteorology sensors ( asi/met ) mars pathfinder directly entered mars atmosphere in a retrograde direction from a hyperbolic trajectory at 6.1 & nbsp ; km/s using an atmospheric entry aeroshell ( capsule ) that was derived from the original viking mars lander design another twenty seconds later the lander was separated and lowered from the backshell on a 20 & nbsp ; m bridle ( tether ) when the lander reached 1.6 & nbsp ; km above the surface , a radar was used by the on-board computer to determine altitude and descent velocity the lander 's on-board computer estimated the best time to fire the rockets and cut the bridle so that the lander velocity would be reduced to about 0 & nbsp ; m/s between 15 and 25 & nbsp ; m above the ground after 2.3 seconds , while the rockets were still firing , the lander cut the bridle loose about 21.5 & nbsp ; m above the ground and fell to the ground once the lander stopped rolling , the airbags deflated and retracted toward the lander using four winches mounted on the lander '' petals '' the lander had to wait until sunrise to send its first digital signals and images to earth during sol 1 , the first martian solar day the lander spent on the planet , the lander took pictures and made some meteorologic measurements once the data was received , the engineers realized that one of the airbags had n't fully deflated and could be a problem for the forthcoming traverse of sojourners descent ramp as the next sols progressed it approached some rocks , which the scientists named '' barnacle bill '' , '' yogi '' , and '' scooby-doo '' , after famous cartoon characters the rover made measurements of the elements found in those rocks and in the martian soil , while the lander took pictures of the sojourner and the surrounding terrain , in addition to making climate observations the sojourner is a six-wheeled 65 & nbsp ; cm long vehicle , 48 & nbsp ; cm wide , 30 & nbsp ; cm tall and weighing 10.5 & nbsp ; kg mars reconnaissance orbiter spotted the pathfinder lander in january 2007 ( left ) curiosity rover perseverance rover spirit rover list of software bugs jpl mars pathfinder article mars pathfinder litograph set , nasa mars pathfinder nasa/jpl website mars pathfinder 360 view ( released february 26 , 2016 )

to prove that the development of '' faster , better and cheaper '' spacecraft was possible ( with three years for development and a cost under 150 & nbsp ; million for the lander , and 25 million for the rover ) to show that it was possible to send a load of scientific instruments to another planet with a simple system and at one-fifteenth the cost of a viking mission ( for comparison , the viking missions cost 935 & nbsp ; million in 1974 or 3.5 & nbsp ; billion in 1997 dollars ) to demonstrate nasa 's commitment to low-cost planetary exploration by finishing the mission with a total expenditure of 280 & nbsp ; million , including the launch vehicle and mission operations the mars pathfinder conducted different investigations on the martian soil using three scientific instruments the lander contained a stereo camera with spatial filters on an expandable pole called imager for mars pathfinder ( imp ) , and the atmospheric structure instrument/meteorology package ( asi/met ) which acts as a mars meteorological station , collecting data about pressure , temperature , and winds the met structure included three windsocks mounted at three heights on a pole , the topmost at about one meter ( yard ) and generally registered winds from the west the sojourner rover had an alpha proton x-ray spectrometer ( apxs ) , which was used to analyze the components of the rocks and soil a third camera with the same resolution but taking color images was located on the back , near the apxs , and rotated by 90° the pixels of this colour camera were arranged in such a way , that out of the 16 pixel of a 4×4 pixel block , 12 pixel were sensitive to green , 2 pixel to red and 2 pixel were sensitive to infrared as well as blue the rover could compress the front cameras ' images using the block truncation coding ( btc ) algorithm , but it could only do the same for the back camera 's images if the colour information was discarded the cameras ' optical resolution was sufficient to resolve 0.6 & nbsp ; cm details across a 0.65 & nbsp ; m range scientists chose it because they found it to be a relatively safe surface to land on and one that contained a wide variety of rocks deposited during a catastrophic flood after the landing , at , succeeded , the lander received the name the carl sagan memorial station in honor of the astronomer mars pathfinder directly entered mars atmosphere in a retrograde direction from a hyperbolic trajectory at 6.1 & nbsp ; km/s using an atmospheric entry aeroshell ( capsule ) that was derived from the original viking mars lander design another twenty seconds later the lander was separated and lowered from the backshell on a 20 & nbsp ; m bridle ( tether ) when the lander reached 1.6 & nbsp ; km above the surface , a radar was used by the on-board computer to determine altitude and descent velocity once the lander was 355 m above the ground , airbags were inflated in less than a second using three gas generators the lander 's on-board computer estimated the best time to fire the rockets and cut the bridle so that the lander velocity would be reduced to about 0 & nbsp ; m/s between 15 and 25 & nbsp ; m above the ground the lander impacted at 14 & nbsp ; m/s and limited the impact to only 18 & nbsp ; g of deceleration once the lander stopped rolling , the airbags deflated and retracted toward the lander using four winches mounted on the lander '' petals '' once the data was received , the engineers realized that one of the airbags had n't fully deflated and could be a problem for the forthcoming traverse of sojourners descent ramp the rover made measurements of the elements found in those rocks and in the martian soil , while the lander took pictures of the sojourner and the surrounding terrain , in addition to making climate observations analysis of the yogi rock again using the apxs showed that it was a basaltic rock , more primitive than barnacle bill using much more sophisticated instruments , spirit rover found that magnetite could explain the magnetic nature of the dust and soil on mars although the mission was planned to last from a week to a month , the rover operated successfully for almost three months the name sojourner was chosen for the mars pathfinder rover when 12-year old valerie ambroise , of bridgeport , connecticut , won a year-long , worldwide competition in which students up to 18 years old were invited to select a heroine and submit an essay about her historical accomplishments jpl mars pathfinder article mars pathfinder litograph set , nasa ( 1997 ) poster : mars pathfinder –roving the red planet , nasa

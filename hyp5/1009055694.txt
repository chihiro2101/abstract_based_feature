to prove that the development of '' faster , better and cheaper '' spacecraft was possible ( with three years for development and a cost under 150 & nbsp ; million for the lander , and 25 million for the rover ) to show that it was possible to send a load of scientific instruments to another planet with a simple system and at one-fifteenth the cost of a viking mission ( for comparison , the viking missions cost 935 & nbsp ; million in 1974 or 3.5 & nbsp ; billion in 1997 dollars ) to demonstrate nasa 's commitment to low-cost planetary exploration by finishing the mission with a total expenditure of 280 & nbsp ; million , including the launch vehicle and mission operations the mars pathfinder conducted different investigations on the martian soil using three scientific instruments the rover also had two black-and-white cameras and a color one a third camera with the same resolution but taking color images was located on the back , near the apxs , and rotated by 90° it provided images of the apxs 's target area and the rover 's tracks on the ground the rover could compress the front cameras ' images using the block truncation coding ( btc ) algorithm , but it could only do the same for the back camera 's images if the colour information was discarded the cameras ' optical resolution was sufficient to resolve 0.6 & nbsp ; cm details across a 0.65 & nbsp ; m range imager for mars pathfinder ( imp ) , ( includes magnetometer and anemometer ) atmospheric and meteorology sensors ( asi/met ) scientists chose it because they found it to be a relatively safe surface to land on and one that contained a wide variety of rocks deposited during a catastrophic flood mars pathfinder directly entered mars atmosphere in a retrograde direction from a hyperbolic trajectory at 6.1 & nbsp ; km/s using an atmospheric entry aeroshell ( capsule ) that was derived from the original viking mars lander design twenty seconds later the heatshield was pyrotechnically released another twenty seconds later the lander was separated and lowered from the backshell on a 20 & nbsp ; m bridle ( tether ) once the lander was 355 m above the ground , airbags were inflated in less than a second using three gas generators however , as the airbags were designed for no more than about 15 & nbsp ; m/s vertical impacts , three solid retrorockets were mounted above the lander in the backshell the lander arrived at night at 2:56:55 mars local solar time ( 16:56:55 utc ) on july 4 , 1997 the lander had to wait until sunrise to send its first digital signals and images to earth the landing site was located at 19.30° north latitude and 33.52° west longitude in ares vallis , only 19 kilometres southwest of the center of the 200 & nbsp ; km wide landing site ellipse during sol 1 , the first martian solar day the lander spent on the planet , the lander took pictures and made some meteorologic measurements to solve the problem , they sent commands to the lander to raise one of its petals and perform additional retraction to flatten the airbag the procedure was a success and on sol 2 , sojourner was released , stood up and backed down one of two ramps the sojourner rover exit from the lander occurred on sol 2 , after its landing on july 4 , 1997 the sojourner is a six-wheeled 65 & nbsp ; cm long vehicle , 48 & nbsp ; cm wide , 30 & nbsp ; cm tall and weighing 10.5 & nbsp ; kg using much more sophisticated instruments , spirit rover found that magnetite could explain the magnetic nature of the dust and soil on mars the battery was used to heat the probe 's electronics to slightly above the expected nighttime temperatures on mars jpl mars pathfinder article mars pathfinder litograph set , nasa mars pathfinder nasa/jpl website mars pathfinder 360 view ( released february 26 , 2016 )

to prove that the development of '' faster , better and cheaper '' spacecraft was possible ( with three years for development and a cost under 150 & nbsp ; million for the lander , and 25 million for the rover ) to show that it was possible to send a load of scientific instruments to another planet with a simple system and at one-fifteenth the cost of a viking mission ( for comparison , the viking missions cost 935 & nbsp ; million in 1974 or 3.5 & nbsp ; billion in 1997 dollars ) to demonstrate nasa 's commitment to low-cost planetary exploration by finishing the mission with a total expenditure of 280 & nbsp ; million , including the launch vehicle and mission operations the mars pathfinder conducted different investigations on the martian soil using three scientific instruments the sojourner rover had an alpha proton x-ray spectrometer ( apxs ) , which was used to analyze the components of the rocks and soil the rover also had two black-and-white cameras and a color one the pixels of this colour camera were arranged in such a way , that out of the 16 pixel of a 4×4 pixel block , 12 pixel were sensitive to green , 2 pixel to red and 2 pixel were sensitive to infrared as well as blue the rover could compress the front cameras ' images using the block truncation coding ( btc ) algorithm , but it could only do the same for the back camera 's images if the colour information was discarded imager for mars pathfinder ( imp ) , ( includes magnetometer and anemometer ) atmospheric and meteorology sensors ( asi/met ) the landing site was an ancient flood plain in mars 's northern hemisphere called '' ares vallis '' ( '' the valley of ares '' , the ancient greek equivalent of the ancient roman deity mars ) and is among the rockiest parts of mars scientists chose it because they found it to be a relatively safe surface to land on and one that contained a wide variety of rocks deposited during a catastrophic flood the airbags were made of four inter-connected multi-layer vectran bags that surrounded the tetrahedron lander however , as the airbags were designed for no more than about 15 & nbsp ; m/s vertical impacts , three solid retrorockets were mounted above the lander in the backshell the lander 's on-board computer estimated the best time to fire the rockets and cut the bridle so that the lander velocity would be reduced to about 0 & nbsp ; m/s between 15 and 25 & nbsp ; m above the ground after 2.3 seconds , while the rockets were still firing , the lander cut the bridle loose about 21.5 & nbsp ; m above the ground and fell to the ground the first bounce was 15.7 & nbsp ; m high and continued bouncing for at least 15 additional bounces ( accelerometer data recording did not continue through all of the bounces ) 74 minutes after landing , the petals were deployed with sojourner rover and the solar panels attached on the inside the lander had to wait until sunrise to send its first digital signals and images to earth during sol 1 , the first martian solar day the lander spent on the planet , the lander took pictures and made some meteorologic measurements the rover made measurements of the elements found in those rocks and in the martian soil , while the lander took pictures of the sojourner and the surrounding terrain , in addition to making climate observations sojourner travelled approximately 100 metres in total , never more than 12 & nbsp ; m from the pathfinder station during its 83 sols of operation , it sent 550 photographs to earth and analyzed the chemical properties of 16 locations near the lander the apxs ( apxs ) was used to determine its composition , the spectrometer taking ten hours to make a full scan of the sample andesite is different from the rocks found in meteorites that have come from mars communication failed after october 7 , with a final data transmission received from pathfinder at 10:23 utc on september 27 , 1997 mission managers tried to restore full communications during the following five months , but the mission was terminated on march 10 , 1998 ( 1997 ) poster : mars pathfinder –roving the red planet , nasa mars pathfinder nasa/jpl website mars pathfinder 360 view ( released february 26 , 2016 )

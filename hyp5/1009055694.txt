to prove that the development of '' faster , better and cheaper '' spacecraft was possible ( with three years for development and a cost under 150 & nbsp ; million for the lander , and 25 million for the rover ) to show that it was possible to send a load of scientific instruments to another planet with a simple system and at one-fifteenth the cost of a viking mission ( for comparison , the viking missions cost 935 & nbsp ; million in 1974 or 3.5 & nbsp ; billion in 1997 dollars ) to demonstrate nasa 's commitment to low-cost planetary exploration by finishing the mission with a total expenditure of 280 & nbsp ; million , including the launch vehicle and mission operations the mars pathfinder conducted different investigations on the martian soil using three scientific instruments the lander contained a stereo camera with spatial filters on an expandable pole called imager for mars pathfinder ( imp ) , and the atmospheric structure instrument/meteorology package ( asi/met ) which acts as a mars meteorological station , collecting data about pressure , temperature , and winds the met structure included three windsocks mounted at three heights on a pole , the topmost at about one meter ( yard ) and generally registered winds from the west the sojourner rover had an alpha proton x-ray spectrometer ( apxs ) , which was used to analyze the components of the rocks and soil a third camera with the same resolution but taking color images was located on the back , near the apxs , and rotated by 90° the pixels of this colour camera were arranged in such a way , that out of the 16 pixel of a 4×4 pixel block , 12 pixel were sensitive to green , 2 pixel to red and 2 pixel were sensitive to infrared as well as blue as all cameras had lenses made out of zinc selenide , which blocks light below a wavelength of 500 & nbsp ; nm , no blue light actually reached these '' blue/infrared '' pixels , which therefore recorded only infrared imager for mars pathfinder ( imp ) , ( includes magnetometer and anemometer ) atmospheric and meteorology sensors ( asi/met ) the landing site was an ancient flood plain in mars 's northern hemisphere called '' ares vallis '' ( '' the valley of ares '' , the ancient greek equivalent of the ancient roman deity mars ) and is among the rockiest parts of mars mars pathfinder directly entered mars atmosphere in a retrograde direction from a hyperbolic trajectory at 6.1 & nbsp ; km/s using an atmospheric entry aeroshell ( capsule ) that was derived from the original viking mars lander design the lander 's on-board computer estimated the best time to fire the rockets and cut the bridle so that the lander velocity would be reduced to about 0 & nbsp ; m/s between 15 and 25 & nbsp ; m above the ground after 2.3 seconds , while the rockets were still firing , the lander cut the bridle loose about 21.5 & nbsp ; m above the ground and fell to the ground designed to right itself from any initial orientation , the lander happened to roll right side up onto its base petal during sol 1 , the first martian solar day the lander spent on the planet , the lander took pictures and made some meteorologic measurements to solve the problem , they sent commands to the lander to raise one of its petals and perform additional retraction to flatten the airbag the procedure was a success and on sol 2 , sojourner was released , stood up and backed down one of two ramps the sojourner rover exit from the lander occurred on sol 2 , after its landing on july 4 , 1997 the rover made measurements of the elements found in those rocks and in the martian soil , while the lander took pictures of the sojourner and the surrounding terrain , in addition to making climate observations the sojourner is a six-wheeled 65 & nbsp ; cm long vehicle , 48 & nbsp ; cm wide , 30 & nbsp ; cm tall and weighing 10.5 & nbsp ; kg the results indicated that '' barnacle bill '' is much like earth 's andesites , confirming past volcano activity analysis of the yogi rock again using the apxs showed that it was a basaltic rock , more primitive than barnacle bill another rock , named moe , was found to have certain marks on its surface , demonstrating erosion caused by the wind the lander sent more than 2.3 billion bits ( 287.5 megabytes ) of information including 16,500 pictures and made 8.5 million measurements of the atmospheric pressure , temperature and wind speed jpl mars pathfinder article mars pathfinder litograph set , nasa mars pathfinder nasa/jpl website mars pathfinder 360 view ( released february 26 , 2016 )

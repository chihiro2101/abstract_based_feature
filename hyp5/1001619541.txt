perovskite structures are adopted by many oxides that have the chemical formula abo 3 the idealized form is a cubic structure ( space group pmm , no although the perovskite structure is named after catio 3 , this mineral forms a non-idealized form in the idealized cubic unit cell of such a compound , the type ' a ' atom sits at cube corner position ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , the type ' b ' atom sits at the body-center position ( 1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2 ) and oxygen atoms sit at face centered positions ( 1/2 , 1/2 , 0 ) , ( 1/2 , 0 , 1/2 ) and ( 0 , 1/2 , 1/2 ) three general categories of cation-pairing are possible : a 2+ b 4+ x 2− 3 , or 2:4 perovskites ; a 3+ b 3+ x 2− 3 , or 3:3 perovskites ; and a + b 5+ x 2− 3 , or 1:5 perovskites complex perovskite structures contain two different b-site cations this results in the possibility of ordered and disordered variants perovskites may be structured in layers , with the structure separated by thin sheets of intrusive material different forms of intrusions , based on the chemical makeup of the intrusion , are defined as : aurivillius phase : the intruding layer is composed of a 2+ ion , occurring every n layers , leading to an overall chemical formula of - perovskites can be deposited as epitaxial thin films on top of other perovskites , using techniques such as pulsed laser deposition and molecular-beam epitaxy the perovskite structure is adopted at high pressure by bridgmanite , a silicate with the formula ( mg , fe ) sio 3 , which is the most common mineral in the earth 's mantle at the high pressure conditions of the earth 's lower mantle , the pyroxene enstatite , mgsio 3 , transforms into a denser perovskite-structured polymorph ; this phase may be the most common mineral in the earth this phase has the orthorhombically distorted perovskite structure ( gdfeo 3 -type structure ) that is stable at pressures from ~24 gpa to ~110 gpa at higher pressures , silicate perovskite , commonly known as silicate perovskite , transforms to post-perovskite a large family of metallic perovskite compounds can be represented by rt 3 m ( r : rare-earth or other relatively large ion , t : transition metal ion and m : light metalloids ) because of the flexibility of bond angles inherent in the perovskite structure there are many different types of distortions which can occur from the ideal structure they measured values of the diffusion length exceeding 1 & nbsp ; μm for the mixed perovskite , an order of magnitude greater than the 100 & nbsp ; nm for the pure iodide in 1997 , scintillation properties of cerium doped lutetium aluminum perovskite ( luap : ce ) single crystals were reported ( includes a java applet with which the structure can be interactively rotated ) de : perowskit kristallstruktur

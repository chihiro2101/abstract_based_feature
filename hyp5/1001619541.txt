perovskite structures are adopted by many oxides that have the chemical formula abo 3 the idealized form is a cubic structure ( space group pmm , no although the perovskite structure is named after catio 3 , this mineral forms a non-idealized form barium titanate is an example of a perovskite which can take on the rhombohedral ( space group r3m , no in the idealized cubic unit cell of such a compound , the type ' a ' atom sits at cube corner position ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , the type ' b ' atom sits at the body-center position ( 1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2 ) and oxygen atoms sit at face centered positions ( 1/2 , 1/2 , 0 ) , ( 1/2 , 0 , 1/2 ) and ( 0 , 1/2 , 1/2 ) three general categories of cation-pairing are possible : a 2+ b 4+ x 2− 3 , or 2:4 perovskites ; a 3+ b 3+ x 2− 3 , or 3:3 perovskites ; and a + b 5+ x 2− 3 , or 1:5 perovskites tilting of the bo 6 octahedra reduces the coordination of an undersized a cation from 12 to as low as 8 complex perovskite structures contain two different b-site cations their oxide ion-conducting properties were first discovered in the 1970s by takahashi et al the well-defined and unique structures at the interfaces between the film and substrate can be used for interface engineering , where new types properties can arise as pressure increases , the sio 4 4− tetrahedral units in the dominant silica-bearing minerals become unstable compared with sio 6 8− octahedral units at the pressure and temperature conditions of the lower mantle , the second most abundant material is likely the rock-salt structure ( mg , fe ) o oxide , periclase this phase has the orthorhombically distorted perovskite structure ( gdfeo 3 -type structure ) that is stable at pressures from ~24 gpa to ~110 gpa at higher pressures , silicate perovskite , commonly known as silicate perovskite , transforms to post-perovskite although the most common perovskite compounds contain oxygen , there are a few perovskite compounds that form without oxygen because of the flexibility of bond angles inherent in the perovskite structure there are many different types of distortions which can occur from the ideal structure planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells can be manufactured in simplified device architectures ( without complex nanostructures ) using only vapor deposition in 1997 , scintillation properties of cerium doped lutetium aluminum perovskite ( luap : ce ) single crystals were reported finally , the excellent demonstration of perovskite nanocrystal scintillators for x-ray imaging screen was reported and it is triggering more research efforts for perovskite scintillators

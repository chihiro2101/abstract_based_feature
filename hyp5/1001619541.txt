perovskite structures are adopted by many oxides that have the chemical formula abo 3 the idealized form is a cubic structure ( space group pmm , no although the perovskite structure is named after catio 3 , this mineral forms a non-idealized form the relative ion size requirements for stability of the cubic structure are quite stringent , so slight buckling and distortion can produce several lower-symmetry distorted versions , in which the coordination numbers of a cations , b cations or both are reduced conversely , off-centering of an undersized b cation within its octahedron allows it to attain a stable bonding pattern complex perovskite structures contain two different b-site cations their oxide ion-conducting properties were first discovered in the 1970s by takahashi et al perovskites can be deposited as epitaxial thin films on top of other perovskites , using techniques such as pulsed laser deposition and molecular-beam epitaxy the perovskite structure is adopted at high pressure by bridgmanite , a silicate with the formula ( mg , fe ) sio 3 , which is the most common mineral in the earth 's mantle perovskite materials exhibit many interesting and intriguing properties from both the theoretical and the application point of view these compounds are used as sensors and catalyst electrodes in certain types of sofc and are candidates for memory devices and spintronics applications many superconductor ceramic materials ( the high temperature superconductors ) have perovskite-like structures , often with 3 or more metals including copper , and some oxygen positions left vacant because of the flexibility of bond angles inherent in the perovskite structure there are many different types of distortions which can occur from the ideal structure alexander weber-bargioni demonstrated that perovskite pv cells could reach a theoretical peak efficiency of 31 % the film thickness of about 500 to 600 & nbsp ; nm implies that the electron and hole diffusion lengths were at least of this order they measured values of the diffusion length exceeding 1 & nbsp ; Î¼m for the mixed perovskite , an order of magnitude greater than the 100 & nbsp ; nm for the pure iodide although the stability of perovskite leds is not yet as good as iii-v or organic leds , there are plenty of ongoing research to solve this problem , such as incorporating organic molecules or potassium dopants in perovskite leds in 1997 , scintillation properties of cerium doped lutetium aluminum perovskite ( luap : ce ) single crystals were reported until eleven years later , one group in japan proposed ruddlesden-popper solution-based hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite crystals as low-cost scintillators

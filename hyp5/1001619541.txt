perovskite structures are adopted by many oxides that have the chemical formula abo 3 the idealized form is a cubic structure ( space group pmm , no although the perovskite structure is named after catio 3 , this mineral forms a non-idealized form barium titanate is an example of a perovskite which can take on the rhombohedral ( space group r3m , no tilting of the bo 6 octahedra reduces the coordination of an undersized a cation from 12 to as low as 8 perovskites may be structured in layers , with the structure separated by thin sheets of intrusive material their oxide ion-conducting properties were first discovered in the 1970s by takahashi et al this can happen through several mechanisms , from mismatch strain between the substrate and film , change in the oxygen octahedral rotation , compositional changes , and quantum confinement at the pressure and temperature conditions of the lower mantle , the second most abundant material is likely the rock-salt structure ( mg , fe ) o oxide , periclase at the high pressure conditions of the earth 's lower mantle , the pyroxene enstatite , mgsio 3 , transforms into a denser perovskite-structured polymorph ; this phase may be the most common mineral in the earth this phase has the orthorhombically distorted perovskite structure ( gdfeo 3 -type structure ) that is stable at pressures from ~24 gpa to ~110 gpa although the most common perovskite compounds contain oxygen , there are a few perovskite compounds that form without oxygen perovskite materials exhibit many interesting and intriguing properties from both the theoretical and the application point of view methylammonium tin halides and methylammonium lead halides are of interest for use in dye-sensitized solar cells among the methylammonium halides studied so far the most common is the methylammonium lead triiodide they also showed that carrier lifetimes in the mixed perovskite are longer than in the pure iodide for , open-circuit voltage ( v oc ) typically approaches 1 & nbsp ; v , while for with low cl content , v oc > 1.1 & nbsp ; v has been reported those properties made luap : ce scintillators attractive for commercials and they were used quite often in high energy physics experiments finally , the excellent demonstration of perovskite nanocrystal scintillators for x-ray imaging screen was reported and it is triggering more research efforts for perovskite scintillators

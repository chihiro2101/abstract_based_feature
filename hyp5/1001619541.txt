perovskite structures are adopted by many oxides that have the chemical formula abo 3 the idealized form is a cubic structure ( space group pmm , no 99 ) phases are the most common non-cubic variants although the perovskite structure is named after catio 3 , this mineral forms a non-idealized form the diagram to the right shows edges for an equivalent unit cell with a in the cube corner position , b at the body center , and o at face-centered positions tilting of the bo 6 octahedra reduces the coordination of an undersized a cation from 12 to as low as 8 conversely , off-centering of an undersized b cation within its octahedron allows it to attain a stable bonding pattern complex perovskite structures contain two different b-site cations perovskites can be deposited as epitaxial thin films on top of other perovskites , using techniques such as pulsed laser deposition and molecular-beam epitaxy the perovskite structure is adopted at high pressure by bridgmanite , a silicate with the formula ( mg , fe ) sio 3 , which is the most common mineral in the earth 's mantle this phase has the orthorhombically distorted perovskite structure ( gdfeo 3 -type structure ) that is stable at pressures from ~24 gpa to ~110 gpa however , it can not be transported from depths of several hundred km to the earth 's surface without transforming back into less dense materials many superconductor ceramic materials ( the high temperature superconductors ) have perovskite-like structures , often with 3 or more metals including copper , and some oxygen positions left vacant one prime example is yttrium barium copper oxide which can be insulating or superconducting depending on the oxygen content they are also some interests for scintillator as they have large light yield for radiation conversion among the methylammonium halides studied so far the most common is the methylammonium lead triiodide planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells can be manufactured in simplified device architectures ( without complex nanostructures ) using only vapor deposition in 1997 , scintillation properties of cerium doped lutetium aluminum perovskite ( luap : ce ) single crystals were reported until eleven years later , one group in japan proposed ruddlesden-popper solution-based hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite crystals as low-cost scintillators

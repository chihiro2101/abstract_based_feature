the opiliones are known for having exceptionally long legs relative to their body size ; however , some species are short-legged as in all arachnida , the body in the opiliones has two tagmata , the anterior cephalothorax or prosoma , and the posterior 10-segmented abdomen or opisthosoma the most easily discernible difference between harvestmen and spiders is that in harvestmen , the connection between the cephalothorax and abdomen is broad , so that the body appears to be a single oval structure in some highly derived species , the first five abdominal segments are fused into a dorsal shield called the scute , which in most such species is fused with the carapace the feeding apparatus ( stomotheca ) differs from most arachnids in that opiliones can swallow chunks of solid food , not only liquids most opiliones , except for cyphophthalmi , have a single pair of eyes in the middle of the head , oriented sideways a 305-million-year-old fossilized harvestman with two pairs of eyes was reported in 2014 a pair of spiracles is located between the base of the fourth pair of legs and the abdomen , with one opening on each side in more active species , spiracles are also found upon the tibia of the legs they have a gonopore on the ventral cephalothorax , and the copulation is direct as opiliones penis , unlike other arachnids the legs continue to twitch after they are detached because 'pacemakers ' are located in the ends of the first long segment ( femur ) of their legs these pacemakers send signals via the nerves to the muscles to extend the leg and then the leg relaxes between signals while some harvestman 's legs twitch for a minute , others have been recorded to twitch up to an hour typical body length does not exceed , and some species are smaller than 1 & nbsp ; mm , although the largest known species , trogulus torosus ( trogulidae ) , grows as long as because their eyes can not form images , they use their second pair of legs as antennae to explore their environment unlike most other arachnids , harvestmen do not have a sucking stomach or a filtering mechanism although parthenogenesis species do occur , most harvestmen reproduce sexually sometimes , the male guards the female after copulation , and in many species , the males defend territories harvestmen variously pass through four to eight nymphal instars to reach maturity , with most known species having six instars most species are nocturnal and colored in hues of brown , although a number of diurnal species are known , some of which have vivid patterns in yellow , green , and black with varied reddish and blackish mottling and reticulation many species of harvestmen easily tolerate members of their own species , with aggregations of many individuals often found at protected sites near water these aggregations may number 200 individuals in the laniatores , and more than 70,000 in certain eupnoi harvestmen clean their legs after eating by drawing each leg in turn through their jaws predators of harvestmen include a variety of animals , including some mammals , amphibians , and other arachnids like spiders and scorpions some of these defenses have been attributed and restricted to specific groups of harvestmen studies on the biology and ecology of michigan phalangida ( opiliones ) a new species of pseudotrogulus roewer and assignment of the genus to the hernandariinae ( opiliones , gonyleptidae ) some hard-bodied harvestmen have epizoic cyanobacteria and liverworts growing on their bodies that suggest potential benefits for camouflage against large backgrounds to avoid detection by diurnal predators epizoic cyanobacteria associated with a neotropical harvestman ( opiliones : sclerosomatidae ) from costa rica lines of defense in the harvestman hoplobunus mexicanus ( arachnida : opiliones ) : aposematism , stridulation , thanatosis , and irritant chemicals other harvestmen may exhibit mimicry to resemble other species ’ appearances this may have an aposematic role by mimicking the coloration of glandular emissions of two other quinone-producing species mimicry ( müllerian mimicry ) occurring between brazilian harvestmen that resemble others could be explained by convergent evolution arachnids such as spiders practice this mechanism when threatened or even to avoid being eaten by female spiders after mating chemical and behavioral defenses of the neotropical harvestman camarana flavipalpi ( arachnida : opiliones ) behavioral repertory of the neotropical harvestman ilhaia cuspidata ( opiliones , gonyleptidae ) freezing – or the complete halt of movement – has been documented in the family sclerosomatidae while this can mean an increased likelihood of immediate survival , it also leads to reduced food and water intake costs and benefits of freezing behaviour in the harvestman eumesosoma roeweri ( arachnida , opiliones ) all troglobitic species ( of all animal taxa ) are considered to be at least threatened in brazil 2017 the opiliones tree of life : shedding light on harvestmen relationships through transcriptomics the 410-million-year-old eophalangium sheari is known from two specimens , one a female , the other a male kustarachne tenuipes was shown in 2004 to be a harvestman , after residing for almost one hundred years in its own arachnid order , the '' kustarachnida ''

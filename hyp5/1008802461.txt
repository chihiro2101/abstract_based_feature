the opiliones are known for having exceptionally long legs relative to their body size ; however , some species are short-legged as in all arachnida , the body in the opiliones has two tagmata , the anterior cephalothorax or prosoma , and the posterior 10-segmented abdomen or opisthosoma the most easily discernible difference between harvestmen and spiders is that in harvestmen , the connection between the cephalothorax and abdomen is broad , so that the body appears to be a single oval structure in some highly derived species , the first five abdominal segments are fused into a dorsal shield called the scute , which in most such species is fused with the carapace in some species , the two posterior abdominal segments are reduced the second pair of legs is longer than the others and function as antennae or feelers in short-legged species , this may not be obvious the stomotheca is formed by extensions of the coxae of the pedipalps and the first pair of legs most opiliones , except for cyphophthalmi , have a single pair of eyes in the middle of the head , oriented sideways eyes in cyphophthalmi , when present , are located laterally , near the ozopores a 305-million-year-old fossilized harvestman with two pairs of eyes was reported in 2014 this find indicates that the eyes in cyphophthalmi are not homologous to the eyes of other harvestmen in more active species , spiracles are also found upon the tibia of the legs they have a gonopore on the ventral cephalothorax , and the copulation is direct as opiliones penis , unlike other arachnids while some harvestman 's legs twitch for a minute , others have been recorded to twitch up to an hour typical body length does not exceed , and some species are smaller than 1 & nbsp ; mm , although the largest known species , trogulus torosus ( trogulidae ) , grows as long as the leg span of many species is much greater than the body length and sometimes exceeds and to in southeast asia some are scavengers , feeding upon dead organisms , bird dung , and other feces material because their eyes can not form images , they use their second pair of legs as antennae to explore their environment the males of some species offer a secretion ( nuptial gift ) from their chelicerae to the female before copulation these aggregations may number 200 individuals in the laniatores , and more than 70,000 in certain eupnoi opiliones display a variety of primary and secondary defenses against predation , ranging from morphological traits such as body armor to behavioral responses to chemical secretions particular patterns or color markings on harvestmen 's bodies can reduce detection by disrupting the animals ' outlines or providing camouflage chemical and behavioral defenses of a neotropical cavernicolous harvestman : goniosoma spelaeum ( opiliones , laniatores , gonyleptidae ) studies on the biology and ecology of michigan phalangida ( opiliones ) a new species of pseudotrogulus roewer and assignment of the genus to the hernandariinae ( opiliones , gonyleptidae ) on the occurrence of epizoic cyanobacteria and liverworts on a neotropical harvestman ( arachnida : opiliones ) biotropica proud , d.n epizoic cyanobacteria associated with a neotropical harvestman ( opiliones : sclerosomatidae ) from costa rica this mechanism is thought to be commonly used during daylight , when they could be easily seen by any predators other harvestmen may exhibit mimicry to resemble other species ’ appearances some gonyleptidae individuals that produce translucid secretions have orange markings on their carapaces arachnids such as spiders practice this mechanism when threatened or even to avoid being eaten by female spiders after mating thanatosis as an adaptive male mating strategy in the nuptial gift–giving spider pisaura mirabilis observations on the defensive behaviors of a neotropical gonyleptidae ( arachnida , opiliones ) chemical and behavioral defenses of the neotropical harvestman camarana flavipalpi ( arachnida : opiliones ) behavioral repertory of the neotropical harvestman ilhaia cuspidata ( opiliones , gonyleptidae ) the ecological significance of leg autotomy for climbing temperate species of harvestmen ( arachnida , opiliones , sclerosomatidae ) leg autotomy and its potential fitness costs for two species of harvestmen ( arachnida , opiliones ) that act as a shield against predators ; this is the most effective defense they use which creates a strong and unpleasant taste as a consequence , most known fossils have been preserved within amber the 410-million-year-old eophalangium sheari is known from two specimens , one a female , the other a male while the two described nemastomoides species are currently grouped as dyspnoi , they look more like eupnoi an unnamed long-legged harvestman was reported from the early cretaceous of koonwarra , victoria , australia , which may be a eupnoi

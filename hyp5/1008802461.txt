the opiliones are known for having exceptionally long legs relative to their body size ; however , some species are short-legged the most easily discernible difference between harvestmen and spiders is that in harvestmen , the connection between the cephalothorax and abdomen is broad , so that the body appears to be a single oval structure other differences include the fact that opiliones have no venom glands in their chelicerae , so pose no danger to humans in some highly derived species , the first five abdominal segments are fused into a dorsal shield called the scute , which in most such species is fused with the carapace in some species , the two posterior abdominal segments are reduced in short-legged species , this may not be obvious the feeding apparatus ( stomotheca ) differs from most arachnids in that opiliones can swallow chunks of solid food , not only liquids the stomotheca is formed by extensions of the coxae of the pedipalps and the first pair of legs eyes in cyphophthalmi , when present , are located laterally , near the ozopores this find indicates that the eyes in cyphophthalmi are not homologous to the eyes of other harvestmen harvestmen have a pair of prosomatic defensive scent glands ( ozopores ) that secrete a peculiar-smelling fluid when disturbed in more active species , spiracles are also found upon the tibia of the legs the legs continue to twitch after they are detached because 'pacemakers ' are located in the ends of the first long segment ( femur ) of their legs the twitching has been hypothesized to function as an evolutionary advantage by keeping the attention of a predator while the harvestman escapes typical body length does not exceed , and some species are smaller than 1 & nbsp ; mm , although the largest known species , trogulus torosus ( trogulidae ) , grows as long as the leg span of many species is much greater than the body length and sometimes exceeds and to in southeast asia many species are omnivorous , eating primarily small insects and all kinds of plant material and fungi such a broad range is unusual in other arachnids , which are typically pure predators most hunting harvestmen ambush their prey , although active hunting is also found although parthenogenesis species do occur , most harvestmen reproduce sexually the males of some species offer a secretion ( nuptial gift ) from their chelicerae to the female before copulation in some species , males also exhibit post-copulatory behavior in which the male specifically seeks out and shakes the female 's sensory leg depending on circumstances such as temperature , the eggs may hatch at any time after the first 20 days , up to about half a year after being laid many species of harvestmen easily tolerate members of their own species , with aggregations of many individuals often found at protected sites near water predators of harvestmen include a variety of animals , including some mammals , amphibians , and other arachnids like spiders and scorpions opiliones display a variety of primary and secondary defenses against predation , ranging from morphological traits such as body armor to behavioral responses to chemical secretions some of these defenses have been attributed and restricted to specific groups of harvestmen primary defenses help the harvestmen avoid encountering a potential predator , and include crypsis , aposematism , and mimicry markings on legs can cause an interruption of the leg outline and loss of leg proportion recognition chemical and behavioral defenses of a neotropical cavernicolous harvestman : goniosoma spelaeum ( opiliones , laniatores , gonyleptidae ) within the genus leiobunum are multiple species with cryptic coloration that changes over ontogeny to match the habitat used at each life stage a new species of pseudotrogulus roewer and assignment of the genus to the hernandariinae ( opiliones , gonyleptidae ) on the occurrence of epizoic cyanobacteria and liverworts on a neotropical harvestman ( arachnida : opiliones ) biotropica proud , d.n epizoic cyanobacteria associated with a neotropical harvestman ( opiliones : sclerosomatidae ) from costa rica mimicry : imitative depiction of discharged defensive secretion on carapace of an opilionid lines of defense in the harvestman hoplobunus mexicanus ( arachnida : opiliones ) : aposematism , stridulation , thanatosis , and irritant chemicals other harvestmen may exhibit mimicry to resemble other species ’ appearances this may have an aposematic role by mimicking the coloration of glandular emissions of two other quinone-producing species mimicry ( müllerian mimicry ) occurring between brazilian harvestmen that resemble others could be explained by convergent evolution arachnids such as spiders practice this mechanism when threatened or even to avoid being eaten by female spiders after mating the ecological significance of leg autotomy for climbing temperate species of harvestmen ( arachnida , opiliones , sclerosomatidae ) four species of opiliones are on the brazilian national list of endangered species , all of them cave-dwelling : giupponia chagasi , iandumoema uai , pachylospeleus strinatii and spaeleoleptes spaeleus a fossil of halitherses grimaldii , a long-legged dyspnoi with large eyes , was found in burmese amber dating from approximately 100 mya

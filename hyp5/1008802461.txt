the opiliones are known for having exceptionally long legs relative to their body size ; however , some species are short-legged as in all arachnida , the body in the opiliones has two tagmata , the anterior cephalothorax or prosoma , and the posterior 10-segmented abdomen or opisthosoma the most easily discernible difference between harvestmen and spiders is that in harvestmen , the connection between the cephalothorax and abdomen is broad , so that the body appears to be a single oval structure in some highly derived species , the first five abdominal segments are fused into a dorsal shield called the scute , which in most such species is fused with the carapace in short-legged species , this may not be obvious the feeding apparatus ( stomotheca ) differs from most arachnids in that opiliones can swallow chunks of solid food , not only liquids the stomotheca is formed by extensions of the coxae of the pedipalps and the first pair of legs most opiliones , except for cyphophthalmi , have a single pair of eyes in the middle of the head , oriented sideways this find indicates that the eyes in cyphophthalmi are not homologous to the eyes of other harvestmen they have a gonopore on the ventral cephalothorax , and the copulation is direct as opiliones penis , unlike other arachnids these pacemakers send signals via the nerves to the muscles to extend the leg and then the leg relaxes between signals while some harvestman 's legs twitch for a minute , others have been recorded to twitch up to an hour the twitching has been hypothesized to function as an evolutionary advantage by keeping the attention of a predator while the harvestman escapes typical body length does not exceed , and some species are smaller than 1 & nbsp ; mm , although the largest known species , trogulus torosus ( trogulidae ) , grows as long as the leg span of many species is much greater than the body length and sometimes exceeds and to in southeast asia such a broad range is unusual in other arachnids , which are typically pure predators most hunting harvestmen ambush their prey , although active hunting is also found unlike most other arachnids , harvestmen do not have a sucking stomach or a filtering mechanism rather , they ingest small particles of their food , thus making them vulnerable to internal parasites such as gregarines the males of some species offer a secretion ( nuptial gift ) from their chelicerae to the female before copulation depending on circumstances such as temperature , the eggs may hatch at any time after the first 20 days , up to about half a year after being laid gregarious behavior is likely a strategy against climatic odds , but also against predators , combining the effect of scent secretions , and reducing the probability of any particular individual being eaten predators of harvestmen include a variety of animals , including some mammals , amphibians , and other arachnids like spiders and scorpions primary defenses help the harvestmen avoid encountering a potential predator , and include crypsis , aposematism , and mimicry chemical and behavioral defenses of a neotropical cavernicolous harvestman : goniosoma spelaeum ( opiliones , laniatores , gonyleptidae ) within the genus leiobunum are multiple species with cryptic coloration that changes over ontogeny to match the habitat used at each life stage a new species of pseudotrogulus roewer and assignment of the genus to the hernandariinae ( opiliones , gonyleptidae ) on the occurrence of epizoic cyanobacteria and liverworts on a neotropical harvestman ( arachnida : opiliones ) biotropica proud , d.n epizoic cyanobacteria associated with a neotropical harvestman ( opiliones : sclerosomatidae ) from costa rica mimicry : imitative depiction of discharged defensive secretion on carapace of an opilionid lines of defense in the harvestman hoplobunus mexicanus ( arachnida : opiliones ) : aposematism , stridulation , thanatosis , and irritant chemicals other harvestmen may exhibit mimicry to resemble other species ’ appearances arachnids such as spiders practice this mechanism when threatened or even to avoid being eaten by female spiders after mating behavioral repertory of the neotropical harvestman ilhaia cuspidata ( opiliones , gonyleptidae ) while this can mean an increased likelihood of immediate survival , it also leads to reduced food and water intake to deflect attacks and enhance escape , long-legged species – commonly known as daddy long-legs – from the eupnoi suborder , use two mechanisms it potentially serves to confuse and deflect any identification of the exact location of their bodies overwintering aggregations of leiobunum paessleri in caves and mines ( arachnida , opiliones ) cellar spiders ( pholcidae ) that are commonly mistaken for daddy long-legs ( opiliones ) also exhibit this behavior when their webs are disturbed or even during courtship the ecological significance of leg autotomy for climbing temperate species of harvestmen ( arachnida , opiliones , sclerosomatidae ) these secretions have successfully protected the harvestmen against wandering spiders ( ctenidae ) , wolf spiders ( lycosidae ) and formica exsectoides ants while the two described nemastomoides species are currently grouped as dyspnoi , they look more like eupnoi an unnamed long-legged harvestman was reported from the early cretaceous of koonwarra , victoria , australia , which may be a eupnoi

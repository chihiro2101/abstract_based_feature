the opiliones are known for having exceptionally long legs relative to their body size ; however , some species are short-legged as in all arachnida , the body in the opiliones has two tagmata , the anterior cephalothorax or prosoma , and the posterior 10-segmented abdomen or opisthosoma the most easily discernible difference between harvestmen and spiders is that in harvestmen , the connection between the cephalothorax and abdomen is broad , so that the body appears to be a single oval structure in some species , the two posterior abdominal segments are reduced in short-legged species , this may not be obvious the feeding apparatus ( stomotheca ) differs from most arachnids in that opiliones can swallow chunks of solid food , not only liquids the stomotheca is formed by extensions of the coxae of the pedipalps and the first pair of legs most opiliones , except for cyphophthalmi , have a single pair of eyes in the middle of the head , oriented sideways eyes in cyphophthalmi , when present , are located laterally , near the ozopores a 305-million-year-old fossilized harvestman with two pairs of eyes was reported in 2014 this find indicates that the eyes in cyphophthalmi are not homologous to the eyes of other harvestmen harvestmen have a pair of prosomatic defensive scent glands ( ozopores ) that secrete a peculiar-smelling fluid when disturbed in more active species , spiracles are also found upon the tibia of the legs they have a gonopore on the ventral cephalothorax , and the copulation is direct as opiliones penis , unlike other arachnids while some harvestman 's legs twitch for a minute , others have been recorded to twitch up to an hour the twitching has been hypothesized to function as an evolutionary advantage by keeping the attention of a predator while the harvestman escapes typical body length does not exceed , and some species are smaller than 1 & nbsp ; mm , although the largest known species , trogulus torosus ( trogulidae ) , grows as long as most species live for a year such a broad range is unusual in other arachnids , which are typically pure predators most hunting harvestmen ambush their prey , although active hunting is also found because their eyes can not form images , they use their second pair of legs as antennae to explore their environment unlike most other arachnids , harvestmen do not have a sucking stomach or a filtering mechanism sometimes , the male guards the female after copulation , and in many species , the males defend territories in some species , males also exhibit post-copulatory behavior in which the male specifically seeks out and shakes the female 's sensory leg depending on circumstances such as temperature , the eggs may hatch at any time after the first 20 days , up to about half a year after being laid harvestmen variously pass through four to eight nymphal instars to reach maturity , with most known species having six instars many species of harvestmen easily tolerate members of their own species , with aggregations of many individuals often found at protected sites near water these aggregations may number 200 individuals in the laniatores , and more than 70,000 in certain eupnoi predators of harvestmen include a variety of animals , including some mammals , amphibians , and other arachnids like spiders and scorpions opiliones display a variety of primary and secondary defenses against predation , ranging from morphological traits such as body armor to behavioral responses to chemical secretions particular patterns or color markings on harvestmen 's bodies can reduce detection by disrupting the animals ' outlines or providing camouflage chemical and behavioral defenses of a neotropical cavernicolous harvestman : goniosoma spelaeum ( opiliones , laniatores , gonyleptidae ) some hard-bodied harvestmen have epizoic cyanobacteria and liverworts growing on their bodies that suggest potential benefits for camouflage against large backgrounds to avoid detection by diurnal predators lines of defense in the harvestman hoplobunus mexicanus ( arachnida : opiliones ) : aposematism , stridulation , thanatosis , and irritant chemicals some animals respond to attacks by simulating an apparent death to avoid either detection or further attacks evidence of circadian rhythm in antipredator behaviour in the orb-weaving spider larinioides cornutus chemical and behavioral defenses of the neotropical harvestman camarana flavipalpi ( arachnida : opiliones ) freezing – or the complete halt of movement – has been documented in the family sclerosomatidae to deflect attacks and enhance escape , long-legged species – commonly known as daddy long-legs – from the eupnoi suborder , use two mechanisms the mating system of leiobunum vittatum say 1821 ( arachnida : opiliones : palpatores ) : resource defense polygyny in the striped harvestman several opiliones in argentina appear to be vulnerable , if not endangered more than 20 fossil species are known from the cenozoic , three from the mesozoic , and at least seven from the paleozoic an unnamed long-legged harvestman was reported from the early cretaceous of koonwarra , victoria , australia , which may be a eupnoi

the opiliones are known for having exceptionally long legs relative to their body size ; however , some species are short-legged as in all arachnida , the body in the opiliones has two tagmata , the anterior cephalothorax or prosoma , and the posterior 10-segmented abdomen or opisthosoma the most easily discernible difference between harvestmen and spiders is that in harvestmen , the connection between the cephalothorax and abdomen is broad , so that the body appears to be a single oval structure other differences include the fact that opiliones have no venom glands in their chelicerae , so pose no danger to humans in some highly derived species , the first five abdominal segments are fused into a dorsal shield called the scute , which in most such species is fused with the carapace some such opiliones only have this shield in the males in some species , the two posterior abdominal segments are reduced in short-legged species , this may not be obvious the feeding apparatus ( stomotheca ) differs from most arachnids in that opiliones can swallow chunks of solid food , not only liquids most opiliones , except for cyphophthalmi , have a single pair of eyes in the middle of the head , oriented sideways eyes in cyphophthalmi , when present , are located laterally , near the ozopores this find indicates that the eyes in cyphophthalmi are not homologous to the eyes of other harvestmen a pair of spiracles is located between the base of the fourth pair of legs and the abdomen , with one opening on each side in more active species , spiracles are also found upon the tibia of the legs they have a gonopore on the ventral cephalothorax , and the copulation is direct as opiliones penis , unlike other arachnids all species lay eggs while some harvestman 's legs twitch for a minute , others have been recorded to twitch up to an hour the leg span of many species is much greater than the body length and sometimes exceeds and to in southeast asia many species are omnivorous , eating primarily small insects and all kinds of plant material and fungi most hunting harvestmen ambush their prey , although active hunting is also found although parthenogenesis species do occur , most harvestmen reproduce sexually the males of some species offer a secretion ( nuptial gift ) from their chelicerae to the female before copulation sometimes , the male guards the female after copulation , and in many species , the males defend territories in some species , males also exhibit post-copulatory behavior in which the male specifically seeks out and shakes the female 's sensory leg harvestmen variously pass through four to eight nymphal instars to reach maturity , with most known species having six instars predators of harvestmen include a variety of animals , including some mammals , amphibians , and other arachnids like spiders and scorpions primary defenses help the harvestmen avoid encountering a potential predator , and include crypsis , aposematism , and mimicry chemical and behavioral defenses of a neotropical cavernicolous harvestman : goniosoma spelaeum ( opiliones , laniatores , gonyleptidae ) many species have also been able to camouflage their bodies by covering with secretions and debris from the leaf litter found in their environments a new species of pseudotrogulus roewer and assignment of the genus to the hernandariinae ( opiliones , gonyleptidae ) on the occurrence of epizoic cyanobacteria and liverworts on a neotropical harvestman ( arachnida : opiliones ) biotropica proud , d.n some harvestmen have elaborate and brightly colored patterns or appendages which contrast with the body coloration , potentially serving as an aposematic warning to potential predators lines of defense in the harvestman hoplobunus mexicanus ( arachnida : opiliones ) : aposematism , stridulation , thanatosis , and irritant chemicals this mechanism is thought to be commonly used during daylight , when they could be easily seen by any predators other harvestmen may exhibit mimicry to resemble other species ’ appearances some animals respond to attacks by simulating an apparent death to avoid either detection or further attacks arachnids such as spiders practice this mechanism when threatened or even to avoid being eaten by female spiders after mating thanatosis as an adaptive male mating strategy in the nuptial gift–giving spider pisaura mirabilis to deflect attacks and enhance escape , long-legged species – commonly known as daddy long-legs – from the eupnoi suborder , use two mechanisms it potentially serves to confuse and deflect any identification of the exact location of their bodies leg autotomy and its potential fitness costs for two species of harvestmen ( arachnida , opiliones ) 2017 the opiliones tree of life : shedding light on harvestmen relationships through transcriptomics while the two described nemastomoides species are currently grouped as dyspnoi , they look more like eupnoi

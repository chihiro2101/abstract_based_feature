in some countries , the terms caller display , calling line identification presentation ( clip ) , call capture , or just calling line identity are used ; call display is the predominant marketing name used in canada ( although some customers still refer to it colloquially as '' caller id '' ) the concept of calling number identification as a service for pots subscribers originated from automatic number identification ( ani ) as a part of toll free number service in the united states ani was originally a service in a non-electronic central office that identified the telephone number of the line from which a call was originated in addition to the caller 's telephone number , caller id may also transmit the subscriber 's name , when available the displayed caller id also depends on the equipment originating the call most service providers , however , allow the caller to block caller id presentation through the vertical service code 67 generally , although not absolutely , the service provider simply passes whatever calling line id appears on those pri access trunks transparently across the public switched telephone network ( pstn ) these gateways egress calls to the local calling area , thus avoiding long distance toll charges itsps also allow a local user to have a number located in '' foreign '' exchange ; the new york caller could have a los angeles number , for example when that user places a call , the calling line id would be that of a los angeles number , although they are actually located in new york with cellphones , the biggest issue appears to be in the passing of calling line id information through the network calling line identity ( cli ) localisation is the process of presenting a localised calling line identity to the recipient of a telephone call because a localised cli is displayed on the called party 's device , the call is perceived as local and recognisable to the caller rather than a withheld , unknown or premium rate number the presented telephone number is adjusted depending on the area code of the dialed number his work on caller id devices and early prototypes was received in the smithsonian institution , national museum of american history in 2000 patent 4,242,539 , filed originally on may 8 , 1976 , and a resulting patent re-examined at the patent office by at & t , was successfully licensed to most of the major telecommunications and computer companies in the world initially , the operating telephone companies wanted to have the caller id function performed by the central office as a voice announcement and charged on a per-call basis the first market trial for caller id and other '' custom local area signaling services '' ( class ) was conducted by bell atlantic in may 1984 bell atlantic was the second local telephone company to deploy caller id in new jersey 's hudson county , followed by us west communications ( now centurylink ) in 1989 if the telephone call is answered too quickly after the first ring , caller id information may not be transmitted to the recipient there are two types of caller id : number only and name+number number-only caller id is called single data message format ( sdmf ) , which provides the caller 's telephone number , the date and time of the call name+number caller id is called multiple data message format ( mdmf ) , which in addition to the information provided by sdmf format , can also provide the directory listed name for the particular number instead of sending the caller id in between the first and second ring , some systems ( such as in the uk ) use line reversal to announce the caller id , or caller id signals are simply sent without any announcement caller id spoofing is the practice of causing the telephone network to display a number on the recipient 's caller id display that is different than that of the actual originating station many telephone services , such as isdn pri based pbx installations , and voice over ip services , permit the caller to configure customized caller id information the large number of phone numbers dilute the number of complaints against the company and phone number

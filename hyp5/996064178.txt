there is a debate about whether or not youth culture exists some researchers argue that youth 's values and morals are not distinct from those of their parents , which means that youth culture is not a separate culture just because people see the presence of what seems to be a youth culture today does not mean that this phenomenon extends to all generations of young people others argue that there are definite elements of youth society that constitute culture , and that these elements differ from those of their parents ' culture have used the terror management theory ( tmt ) to argue for the existence of youth culture the psychological importance of youth culture : a terror management approach tmt is a psychological concept that hypothesizes that culture originates from an attempt to cope with the knowledge of mortality tested the following hypothesis : '' if youth culture serves to help adolescents deal with problems of vulnerability and finiteness , then reminders of mortality should lead to increased allegiance to cultural practice and belief of the youth '' their results supported their hypothesis and the results of previous studies , suggesting that youth culture is , in fact , a culture schwartz and merten used the language of adolescents to argue for the presence of youth culture as distinct from the rest of society the language of adolescence : an anthropological approach to the youth culture schwartz argued that high school students used their vocabulary to create meanings that are distinct to adolescents this difference indicates cultural differences between adolescents and adults , which supports the presence of a separate youth culture throughout the 20th century , youths had a strong influence on both lifestyle and culture the flappers and the mods are two great examples of the impact of youth culture on society '' the flappers exemplified how youth culture was influential in fashion and lifestyle mods also are a great example of a youth culture movement inspiring a popular lifestyle the mods were young men and women who came from all classes , and they believed that their fashion choices '' gave them entr√©e everywhere , '' and their fashion choices empowered them '' the mod style and embrace of modern technology spread from the uk overseas to america , as well as other countries , proving it to be an extremely influential youth culture movement the presence of youth culture is a relatively recent historical phenomenon there are several dominant theories about the emergence of youth culture in the 20th century james coleman argues that age segregation is the root of a separate youth culture these interactions allow adolescents to develop shared experiences and meanings , which are the root of youth culture particularistic norms are guidelines for behavior that vary from one individual to another modernization and universalistic norms have encouraged the growth of youth culture psychological theorists have noted the role of youth culture in identity development some psychologists have theorized that the formation of youth culture is an attempt to adopt an identity that reconciles these two conflicting expectations for example , parsons ( 1951 ) posited that adolescence is a time when young people are transitioning from reliance on parents to autonomy parents , peers , youth culture and autonomy in adolescence the impact of youth culture on deviance and sexual behavior is debatable some scholars have claimed that the activism of youth during the vietnam war was symbolic of a youth culture whose values were against those of mainstream american culture

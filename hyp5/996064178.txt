there is a debate about whether or not youth culture exists some researchers argue that youth 's values and morals are not distinct from those of their parents , which means that youth culture is not a separate culture just because people see the presence of what seems to be a youth culture today does not mean that this phenomenon extends to all generations of young people additionally , peer influence varies greatly between contexts and by sex , age , and social status , making a single '' youth culture '' difficult , if not impossible , to define others argue that there are definite elements of youth society that constitute culture , and that these elements differ from those of their parents ' culture have used the terror management theory ( tmt ) to argue for the existence of youth culture youth & society , 31 ( 2 ) , 152-167 tmt is a psychological concept that hypothesizes that culture originates from an attempt to cope with the knowledge of mortality tested the following hypothesis : '' if youth culture serves to help adolescents deal with problems of vulnerability and finiteness , then reminders of mortality should lead to increased allegiance to cultural practice and belief of the youth '' their results supported their hypothesis and the results of previous studies , suggesting that youth culture is , in fact , a culture schwartz and merten used the language of adolescents to argue for the presence of youth culture as distinct from the rest of society according to schwartz , this reflects a difference in social structures and the way that adults and teens experience social reality this difference indicates cultural differences between adolescents and adults , which supports the presence of a separate youth culture throughout the 20th century , youths had a strong influence on both lifestyle and culture the flappers and the mods are two great examples of the impact of youth culture on society instead of an upright , corseted posture , they preferred '' a 'lop-sided ' stance characterized by 'sunken chests and round shoulders , ' which suggested fatigue rather than beauty '' the flappers exemplified how youth culture was influential in fashion and lifestyle mods also are a great example of a youth culture movement inspiring a popular lifestyle there are several dominant theories about the emergence of youth culture in the 20th century one historical theory credits the emergence of youth culture to the beginning of compulsory education james coleman argues that age segregation is the root of a separate youth culture another theory posits that some types of cultures facilitate the development of youth culture , while others do not the goal of this stage of life is to answer the question , '' who am i ? '' this can be difficult in many societies in which adolescents are simultaneously expected to behave like children and take on adult roles parents , peers , youth culture and autonomy in adolescence for decades , adults have worried that youth subcultures were the root of moral degradation and changing values in younger generations researchers have characterized youth culture as embodying values that are '' in conflict with those of the adult world '' if adolescents ' values are similar to their parents ' , this raises the question of why adults insist that adolescents inhabit a separate world with different values one reason may be that the similarities between adolescent and adult values are relatively invisible compared to the differences between these two groups however , teen culture may also have benefits for the adolescent some scholars have claimed that the activism of youth during the vietnam war was symbolic of a youth culture whose values were against those of mainstream american culture additionally , the movement utilised social media ( which can be considered an aspect of youth culture ) to schedule , coordinate , and publicize events

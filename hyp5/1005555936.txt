in humans , staphylococcus aureus is part of the normal microbiota present in the upper respiratory tract , and on skin and in the gut mucosa after 72 hours , mrsa can take hold in human tissues and eventually become resistant to treatment the initial presentation of mrsa is small red bumps that resemble pimples , spider bites , or boils ; they may be accompanied by fever and , occasionally , rashes within a few days , the bumps become larger and more painful ; they eventually open into deep , pus-filled boils people who are hospitalized , including the elderly , are often immunocompromised and susceptible to infection of all kinds , including mrsa ; an infection by mrsa is called healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant s prisons and military barracks can be crowded and confined , and poor hygiene practices may proliferate , thus putting inhabitants at increased risk of contracting mrsa the earliest reports were made by the centers for disease control and prevention in us state prisons aureus cases per month antibiotic use in livestock increases the risk that mrsa will develop among the livestock ; strains mrsa st 398 and cc398 are transmissible to humans domestic pets are susceptible to mrsa infection by transmission from their owners ; conversely , mrsa-infected pets can also transmit mrsa to humans locker rooms , gyms , and related athletic facilities offer potential sites for mrsa contamination and infection a study linked mrsa to the abrasions caused by artificial turf in 2015 , los angeles dodgers infielder justin turner was infected while the team visited the new york mets in october 2015 , new york giants tight end daniel fells was hospitalized with a serious mrsa infection mrsa is becoming a critical problem in children ; studies found 4.6 % of patients in u.s health-care facilities , ( presumably ) including hospital nurseries , were infected or colonized with mrsa furthermore , with mrsa 's high contagion rate , a common risk factor is individuals who are in constant contact with someone who has injected drugs in the past year this does still depend how strong the non-infected individual 's immune system is and how long both individuals remain in contact antimicrobial resistance is genetically based ; resistance is mediated by the acquisition of extrachromosomal genetic elements containing genes that confer resistance to certain antibiotics examples of such elements include plasmids , transposable element , and genomic islands , which can be transferred between bacteria through horizontal gene transfer sccmec contains additional genes beyond meca , including the cytolysin gene psm-mec , which may suppress virulence in ha-acquired mrsa strains in addition , this locus encodes strain-dependent gene regulatory rnas known as psm-mecrna owing to the size of the sccmec element and the constraints of horizontal gene transfer , a minimum of five clones are thought to be responsible for the spread of mrsa infections , with clonal complex ( cc ) 8 most prevalent sccmec is thought to have originated in the closely related staphylococcus sciuri species and transferred horizontally to s different sccmec genotypes confer different microbiological characteristics , such as different antimicrobial resistance rates conversely , ca-mrsa is associated with types iv and v , which are smaller and lack resistance genes other than meca meca is a biomarker gene responsible for resistance to methicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics meca encodes penicillin-binding protein 2a ( pbp2a ) , which differs from other penicillin-binding proteins as its active site does not bind methicillin or other β-lactam antibiotics detection of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains from clinical samples in tehran by detection of the meca and nuc genes this is achieved by mecr1-mediated cleavage of meci , which alleviates meci repression aureus ( mssa ) gives rise to a number of genetically different mrsa lineages historically , major mrsa clones st2470-mrsa-i , st239-mrsa-iii , st5-mrsa-ii , and st5-mrsa-iv were responsible for causing hospital-acquired mrsa ( ha-mrsa ) infections st239-mrsa-iii , known as the brazilian clone , was highly transmissible compared to others and distributed in argentina , czech republic , and portugal in the uk , the most common strains of mrsa are emrsa15 and emrsa16 emrsa 15 is also found to be one of the common mrsa strains in asia these strains are genetic characteristics of ha-mrsa this is further proven by molecular typing of ca-mrsa strains and genome comparison between ca-mrsa and ha-mrsa , which indicate that novel mrsa strains integrated sccmec into mssa separately on its own by mid-2000 , ca-mrsa was introduced into healthcare systems and distinguishing ca-mrsa from ha-mrsa became a difficult process community-acquired mrsa is more easily treated and more virulent than hospital-acquired mrsa ( ha-mrsa ) other community-acquired strains of mrsa are st8 : usa500 and st59 : usa1000 in many nations of the world , mrsa strains with different genetic background types have come to predominate among ca-mrsa strains ; usa300 easily tops the list in the u.s for example , in australia , st93 strains are common , while in continental europe st80 strains , which carry sccmec type iv , predominate a mrsa strain , cc398 , is found in intensively reared production animals ( primarily pigs , but also cattle and poultry ) , where it can be transmitted to humans as la-mrsa ( livestock-associated mrsa ) diagnostic microbiology laboratories and reference laboratories are key for identifying outbreaks of mrsa normally , a bacterium must be cultured from blood , urine , sputum , or other body-fluid samples , and in sufficient quantities to perform confirmatory tests early-on aureus to be resistant to oxacillin aureus is a gram-positive , spherical ( coccus ) bacterium about 1 micron in diameter aureus ( mssa ) , mrsa is slow-growing on a variety of media and has been found to exist in mixed colonies of mssa the meca gene , which confers resistance to a number of antibiotics , is always present in mrsa and usually absent in mssa ; however , in some instances , the meca gene is present in mssa but is not expressed polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) testing is the most precise method for identifying mrsa strains aureus have emerged that are resistant to oxacillin , clindamycin , teicoplanin , and erythromycin these resistant strains may or may not possess the meca gene if a concentration greater than 32 μg/ml is necessary to inhibit growth , it is said to be resistant mrsa can be identified by swabbing the nostrils and isolating the bacteria found there excluding medical facility , current us guidance does not require workers with mrsa infections to be routinely excluded from the general workplace the national institutes of health recommend that those with wound drainage that can not be covered and contained with a clean , dry bandage and those who can not maintain good hygiene practices be reassigned reducing use of antibiotic classes that promote mrsa colonisation , especially fluoroquinolones , is recommended in current guidelines loss of control occurs because colonised people are discharged back into the community and then readmitted ; when the number of colonised people in the community reaches a certain threshold , the '' search and destroy '' strategy is overwhelmed mrsa colonization is also found in nonsurgical wounds such as traumatic wounds , burns , and chronic ulcers ( i.e as of early 2005 , the number of deaths in the united kingdom attributed to mrsa has been estimated by various sources to lie in the area of 3,000 per year livestock associated mrsa ( la-mrsa ) has been observed in korea , brazil , switzerland , malaysia , india , great britain , denmark , and china the first report of community-associated mrsa ( ca-mrsa ) occurred in 1981 , and in 1982 , a large outbreak of ca-mrsa occurred among intravenous drug users in detroit , michigan several studies , however , including one by blot and colleagues , that have adjusted for underlying disease still found mrsa bacteremia to have a higher attributable mortality than methicillin-susceptible s phage therapy has been used for years in mrsa in eastern countries , and studies are ongoing in western countries

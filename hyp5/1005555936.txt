in humans , staphylococcus aureus is part of the normal microbiota present in the upper respiratory tract , and on skin and in the gut mucosa however , along with similar bacterial species that can colonize and act symbiotically , they can cause disease if they begin to take over the tissues they have colonized or invade other tissues ; the resultant infection has been called a '' pathobiont '' after 72 hours , mrsa can take hold in human tissues and eventually become resistant to treatment the initial presentation of mrsa is small red bumps that resemble pimples , spider bites , or boils ; they may be accompanied by fever and , occasionally , rashes within a few days , the bumps become larger and more painful ; they eventually open into deep , pus-filled boils about 75 percent of ca-mrsa infections are localized to skin and soft tissue and usually can be treated effectively people who are hospitalized , including the elderly , are often immunocompromised and susceptible to infection of all kinds , including mrsa ; an infection by mrsa is called healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant s both surgical and nonsurgical wounds can be infected with ha-mrsa surgical site infections occur on the skin surface , but can spread to internal organs and blood to cause sepsis people in nursing homes are at risk for all the reasons above , further complicated by their generally weaker immune systems prisons and military barracks can be crowded and confined , and poor hygiene practices may proliferate , thus putting inhabitants at increased risk of contracting mrsa cases of mrsa in such populations were first reported in the united states and later in canada the earliest reports were made by the centers for disease control and prevention in us state prisons domestic pets are susceptible to mrsa infection by transmission from their owners ; conversely , mrsa-infected pets can also transmit mrsa to humans locker rooms , gyms , and related athletic facilities offer potential sites for mrsa contamination and infection three studies by the texas state department of health found the infection rate among football players was 16 times the national average mrsa is becoming a critical problem in children ; studies found 4.6 % of patients in u.s health-care facilities , ( presumably ) including hospital nurseries , were infected or colonized with mrsa the unsanitary methods of injection causes an access point for the mrsa to enter the blood stream and begin infecting the host furthermore , with mrsa 's high contagion rate , a common risk factor is individuals who are in constant contact with someone who has injected drugs in the past year a defining characteristic of mrsa is its ability to thrive in the presence of penicillin-like antibiotics , which normally prevent bacterial growth by inhibiting synthesis of cell wall material this is due to a resistance gene , meca , which stops β-lactam antibiotics from inactivating the enzymes ( transpeptidases ) critical for cell wall synthesis staphylococcal gene cassette mec ( sccmec ) is a genomic island of unknown origin containing the antibiotic resistance gene meca sccmec also contains ccra and ccrb ; both genes encode recombinases that mediate the site-specific integration and excision of the sccmec element from the s owing to the size of the sccmec element and the constraints of horizontal gene transfer , a minimum of five clones are thought to be responsible for the spread of mrsa infections , with clonal complex ( cc ) 8 most prevalent types i–iii sccmec are large elements that typically contain additional resistance genes and are characteristically isolated from ha-mrsa strains conversely , ca-mrsa is associated with types iv and v , which are smaller and lack resistance genes other than meca carriage of large plasmids , such as sccmeci–iii , is costly to the bacteria , resulting in a compensatory decrease in virulence expression mrsa is able to thrive in hospital settings with increased antibiotic resistance but decreased virulence – ha-mrsa targets immunocompromised , hospitalized hosts , thus a decrease in virulence is not maladaptive meca is a biomarker gene responsible for resistance to methicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics sahebnasagh r , saderi h , owlia p detection of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains from clinical samples in tehran by detection of the meca and nuc genes meca is further controlled by two co-repressors , blai and blar1 the arginine catabolic mobile element ( acme ) is a virulence factor present in many mrsa strains but not prevalent in mssa aureus and facilitates stable skin colonization , wound infection , and person-to-person transmission aureus ( mssa ) gives rise to a number of genetically different mrsa lineages these genetic variations within different mrsa strains possibly explain the variability in virulence and associated mrsa infections the first mrsa strain , st250 mrsa-1 , originated from sccmec and st250-mssa integration historically , major mrsa clones st2470-mrsa-i , st239-mrsa-iii , st5-mrsa-ii , and st5-mrsa-iv were responsible for causing hospital-acquired mrsa ( ha-mrsa ) infections st239-mrsa-iii , known as the brazilian clone , was highly transmissible compared to others and distributed in argentina , czech republic , and portugal in the uk , the most common strains of mrsa are emrsa15 and emrsa16 emrsa 15 is also found to be one of the common mrsa strains in asia community-acquired mrsa ( ca-mrsa ) strains emerged in late 1990 to 2000 , infecting healthy people who had not been in contact with healthcare facilities community-acquired mrsa is more easily treated and more virulent than hospital-acquired mrsa ( ha-mrsa ) the genetic mechanism for the enhanced virulence in ca-mrsa remains an active area of research the panton–valentine leukocidin ( pvl ) genes are of particular interest because they are a unique feature of ca-mrsa in the united states , most cases of ca-mrsa are caused by a cc8 strain designated st8 : usa300 , which carries sccmec type iv , panton–valentine leukocidin , psm-alpha and enterotoxins q and k , and st1 : usa400 in many nations of the world , mrsa strains with different genetic background types have come to predominate among ca-mrsa strains ; usa300 easily tops the list in the u.s , usa300 was found only rarely in a study of mrsa strains from outbreaks in 1996 and 2000 as well as in surveillance from 2004–06 diagnostic microbiology laboratories and reference laboratories are key for identifying outbreaks of mrsa aureus ( mssa ) , mrsa is slow-growing on a variety of media and has been found to exist in mixed colonies of mssa specialized culture media have been developed to better differentiate between mssa and mrsa and , in some cases , such media can be used to identify specific strains that are resistant to different antibiotics aureus has also developed resistance to vancomycin ( vrsa ) the centers for disease control and prevention offers suggestions for preventing the contraction and spread of mrsa infection which are applicable to those in community settings , including incarcerated populations , childcare center employees , and athletes to prevent the spread of mrsa , the recommendations are to wash hands thoroughly and regularly using soap and water or an alcohol-based sanitizer to prevent the spread of staphylococci or mrsa in the workplace , employers are encouraged to make available adequate facilities that support good hygiene glycopeptides , cephalosporins , and in particular , quinolones are associated with an increased risk of colonisation of mrsa mupirocin 2 % ointment can be effective at reducing the size of lesions as shown in an animal study with diabetic mice , the topical application of a mixture of sugar ( 70 % ) and 3 % povidone-iodine paste is an effective agent for the treatment of diabetic ulcers with mrsa infection maintaining the necessary cleanliness may be difficult for people if they do not have access to facilities such as public toilets with handwashing facilities four to six weeks of antibiotic treatment is often recommended , and is dependent upon the extent of mrsa infection many of these infections are less serious , but the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) estimate that there are 80,461 invasive mrsa infections and 11,285 deaths due to mrsa annually aureus infections attributable to mrsa had reached 50 % the observed increased mortality among mrsa-infected people arguably may be the result of the increased underlying morbidity of these people

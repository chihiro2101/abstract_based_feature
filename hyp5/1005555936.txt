in humans , staphylococcus aureus is part of the normal microbiota present in the upper respiratory tract , and on skin and in the gut mucosa after 72 hours , mrsa can take hold in human tissues and eventually become resistant to treatment the initial presentation of mrsa is small red bumps that resemble pimples , spider bites , or boils ; they may be accompanied by fever and , occasionally , rashes about 75 percent of ca-mrsa infections are localized to skin and soft tissue and usually can be treated effectively people who are hospitalized , including the elderly , are often immunocompromised and susceptible to infection of all kinds , including mrsa ; an infection by mrsa is called healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant s transmission can occur between healthcare providers and patients because some providers may neglect to perform preventative hand-washing between examinations prisons and military barracks can be crowded and confined , and poor hygiene practices may proliferate , thus putting inhabitants at increased risk of contracting mrsa cases of mrsa in such populations were first reported in the united states and later in canada the earliest reports were made by the centers for disease control and prevention in us state prisons for example , in february 2008 , the tulsa county jail in oklahoma started treating an average of 12 s antibiotic use in livestock increases the risk that mrsa will develop among the livestock ; strains mrsa st 398 and cc398 are transmissible to humans domestic pets are susceptible to mrsa infection by transmission from their owners ; conversely , mrsa-infected pets can also transmit mrsa to humans locker rooms , gyms , and related athletic facilities offer potential sites for mrsa contamination and infection three studies by the texas state department of health found the infection rate among football players was 16 times the national average in 2013 , lawrence tynes , carl nicks , and johnthan banks of the tampa bay buccaneers were diagnosed with mrsa tynes and nicks apparently did not contract the infection from each other , but whether banks contracted it from either individual is unknown mrsa is becoming a critical problem in children ; studies found 4.6 % of patients in u.s health-care facilities , ( presumably ) including hospital nurseries , were infected or colonized with mrsa antimicrobial resistance is genetically based ; resistance is mediated by the acquisition of extrachromosomal genetic elements containing genes that confer resistance to certain antibiotics examples of such elements include plasmids , transposable element , and genomic islands , which can be transferred between bacteria through horizontal gene transfer staphylococcal gene cassette mec ( sccmec ) is a genomic island of unknown origin containing the antibiotic resistance gene meca sccmec contains additional genes beyond meca , including the cytolysin gene psm-mec , which may suppress virulence in ha-acquired mrsa strains types i–iii sccmec are large elements that typically contain additional resistance genes and are characteristically isolated from ha-mrsa strains in 2001 , and can be explained by the fitness differences associated with carriage of a large or small sccmec plasmid meca is a biomarker gene responsible for resistance to methicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics as such , pbp2a can continue to catalyze the transpeptidation reaction required for peptidoglycan cross-linking , enabling cell wall synthesis even in the presence of antibiotics as a consequence of the inability of pbp2a to interact with β-lactam moieties , acquisition of meca confers resistance to all β-lactam antibiotics in addition to methicillin sahebnasagh r , saderi h , owlia p in the presence of a β-lactam antibiotic , mecr1 initiates a signal transduction cascade that leads to transcriptional activation of meca this is achieved by mecr1-mediated cleavage of meci , which alleviates meci repression the arginine catabolic mobile element ( acme ) is a virulence factor present in many mrsa strains but not prevalent in mssa aureus and facilitates stable skin colonization , wound infection , and person-to-person transmission aureus ( mssa ) gives rise to a number of genetically different mrsa lineages these genetic variations within different mrsa strains possibly explain the variability in virulence and associated mrsa infections the first mrsa strain , st250 mrsa-1 , originated from sccmec and st250-mssa integration historically , major mrsa clones st2470-mrsa-i , st239-mrsa-iii , st5-mrsa-ii , and st5-mrsa-iv were responsible for causing hospital-acquired mrsa ( ha-mrsa ) infections st239-mrsa-iii , known as the brazilian clone , was highly transmissible compared to others and distributed in argentina , czech republic , and portugal in the uk , the most common strains of mrsa are emrsa15 and emrsa16 under the new international typing system , this strain is now called mrsa252 emrsa 15 is also found to be one of the common mrsa strains in asia community-acquired mrsa ( ca-mrsa ) strains emerged in late 1990 to 2000 , infecting healthy people who had not been in contact with healthcare facilities this is further proven by molecular typing of ca-mrsa strains and genome comparison between ca-mrsa and ha-mrsa , which indicate that novel mrsa strains integrated sccmec into mssa separately on its own community-acquired mrsa is more easily treated and more virulent than hospital-acquired mrsa ( ha-mrsa ) the genetic mechanism for the enhanced virulence in ca-mrsa remains an active area of research other community-acquired strains of mrsa are st8 : usa500 and st59 : usa1000 a mrsa strain , cc398 , is found in intensively reared production animals ( primarily pigs , but also cattle and poultry ) , where it can be transmitted to humans as la-mrsa ( livestock-associated mrsa ) polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) testing is the most precise method for identifying mrsa strains these resistant strains may or may not possess the meca gene aureus has also developed resistance to vancomycin ( vrsa ) resistance to antibiotics in s aureus can be quantified by determining the amount of the antibiotic that must be used to inhibit growth mrsa can be identified by swabbing the nostrils and isolating the bacteria found there excluding medical facility , current us guidance does not require workers with mrsa infections to be routinely excluded from the general workplace to prevent the spread of staphylococci or mrsa in the workplace , employers are encouraged to make available adequate facilities that support good hygiene one of the few countries not to have been overwhelmed by mrsa is the netherlands : an important part of the success of the dutch strategy may have been to attempt eradication of carriage upon discharge from hospital as of 2013 , whether strategies to eradicate mrsa colonization of people in nursing homes reduced infection rates was not known as shown in an animal study with diabetic mice , the topical application of a mixture of sugar ( 70 % ) and 3 % povidone-iodine paste is an effective agent for the treatment of diabetic ulcers with mrsa infection the effective treatment of mrsa with linezolid has been successful in 87 % of people examples of soft-tissue infections from mrsa include ulcers , impetigo , abscesses , and ssis mrsa accounts for 26 % of lung infections in those with cystic fibrosis health departments recommend that the pet be taken to the veterinarian if mrsa infections keep occurring in the people who have contact with the pet aureus in their noses ; of these , 2.5 & nbsp ; million ( 2.6 % of carriers ) carry mrsa aureus infections attributable to mrsa had reached 50 % the delivery of inhaled antibiotics along with systematic administration to treat mrsa are being developed

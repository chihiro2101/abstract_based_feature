in humans , staphylococcus aureus is part of the normal microbiota present in the upper respiratory tract , and on skin and in the gut mucosa however , along with similar bacterial species that can colonize and act symbiotically , they can cause disease if they begin to take over the tissues they have colonized or invade other tissues ; the resultant infection has been called a '' pathobiont '' after 72 hours , mrsa can take hold in human tissues and eventually become resistant to treatment about 75 percent of ca-mrsa infections are localized to skin and soft tissue and usually can be treated effectively people who are hospitalized , including the elderly , are often immunocompromised and susceptible to infection of all kinds , including mrsa ; an infection by mrsa is called healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant s generally , those infected by mrsa stay infected for just under 10 days , if treated by a doctor , although effects may vary from person to person surgical site infections occur on the skin surface , but can spread to internal organs and blood to cause sepsis people in nursing homes are at risk for all the reasons above , further complicated by their generally weaker immune systems prisons and military barracks can be crowded and confined , and poor hygiene practices may proliferate , thus putting inhabitants at increased risk of contracting mrsa cases of mrsa in such populations were first reported in the united states and later in canada for example , in february 2008 , the tulsa county jail in oklahoma started treating an average of 12 s antibiotic use in livestock increases the risk that mrsa will develop among the livestock ; strains mrsa st 398 and cc398 are transmissible to humans locker rooms , gyms , and related athletic facilities offer potential sites for mrsa contamination and infection a study linked mrsa to the abrasions caused by artificial turf in 2013 , lawrence tynes , carl nicks , and johnthan banks of the tampa bay buccaneers were diagnosed with mrsa in october 2015 , new york giants tight end daniel fells was hospitalized with a serious mrsa infection health-care facilities , ( presumably ) including hospital nurseries , were infected or colonized with mrsa the unsanitary methods of injection causes an access point for the mrsa to enter the blood stream and begin infecting the host furthermore , with mrsa 's high contagion rate , a common risk factor is individuals who are in constant contact with someone who has injected drugs in the past year antimicrobial resistance is genetically based ; resistance is mediated by the acquisition of extrachromosomal genetic elements containing genes that confer resistance to certain antibiotics examples of such elements include plasmids , transposable element , and genomic islands , which can be transferred between bacteria through horizontal gene transfer a defining characteristic of mrsa is its ability to thrive in the presence of penicillin-like antibiotics , which normally prevent bacterial growth by inhibiting synthesis of cell wall material this is due to a resistance gene , meca , which stops β-lactam antibiotics from inactivating the enzymes ( transpeptidases ) critical for cell wall synthesis sccmec contains additional genes beyond meca , including the cytolysin gene psm-mec , which may suppress virulence in ha-acquired mrsa strains in addition , this locus encodes strain-dependent gene regulatory rnas known as psm-mecrna sccmec also contains ccra and ccrb ; both genes encode recombinases that mediate the site-specific integration and excision of the sccmec element from the s currently , six unique sccmec types ranging in size from 21–67 kb have been identified ; they are designated types i–vi and are distinguished by variation in mec and ccr gene complexes owing to the size of the sccmec element and the constraints of horizontal gene transfer , a minimum of five clones are thought to be responsible for the spread of mrsa infections , with clonal complex ( cc ) 8 most prevalent types i–iii sccmec are large elements that typically contain additional resistance genes and are characteristically isolated from ha-mrsa strains meca encodes penicillin-binding protein 2a ( pbp2a ) , which differs from other penicillin-binding proteins as its active site does not bind methicillin or other β-lactam antibiotics as such , pbp2a can continue to catalyze the transpeptidation reaction required for peptidoglycan cross-linking , enabling cell wall synthesis even in the presence of antibiotics as a consequence of the inability of pbp2a to interact with β-lactam moieties , acquisition of meca confers resistance to all β-lactam antibiotics in addition to methicillin the dna sequences bound by meci and blai are identical ; therefore , blai can also bind the meca operator to repress transcription of meca the arginine catabolic mobile element ( acme ) is a virulence factor present in many mrsa strains but not prevalent in mssa aureus and facilitates stable skin colonization , wound infection , and person-to-person transmission these genetic variations within different mrsa strains possibly explain the variability in virulence and associated mrsa infections historically , major mrsa clones st2470-mrsa-i , st239-mrsa-iii , st5-mrsa-ii , and st5-mrsa-iv were responsible for causing hospital-acquired mrsa ( ha-mrsa ) infections st239-mrsa-iii , known as the brazilian clone , was highly transmissible compared to others and distributed in argentina , czech republic , and portugal in the uk , the most common strains of mrsa are emrsa15 and emrsa16 emrsa 15 is also found to be one of the common mrsa strains in asia this is further proven by molecular typing of ca-mrsa strains and genome comparison between ca-mrsa and ha-mrsa , which indicate that novel mrsa strains integrated sccmec into mssa separately on its own by mid-2000 , ca-mrsa was introduced into healthcare systems and distinguishing ca-mrsa from ha-mrsa became a difficult process community-acquired mrsa is more easily treated and more virulent than hospital-acquired mrsa ( ha-mrsa ) in taiwan , st59 strains , some of which are resistant to many non-beta-lactam antibiotics , have arisen as common causes of skin and soft tissue infections in the community diagnostic microbiology laboratories and reference laboratories are key for identifying outbreaks of mrsa the meca gene , which confers resistance to a number of antibiotics , is always present in mrsa and usually absent in mssa ; however , in some instances , the meca gene is present in mssa but is not expressed aureus has also developed resistance to vancomycin ( vrsa ) rapid culture and sensitivity testing and molecular testing identifies carriers and reduces infection rates combined with extra sanitary measures for those in contact with infected people , swab screening people admitted to hospitals has been found to be effective in minimizing the spread of mrsa in hospitals in the united states , denmark , finland , and the netherlands to prevent the spread of mrsa , the recommendations are to wash hands thoroughly and regularly using soap and water or an alcohol-based sanitizer in hospital settings , contact isolation can be stopped after one to three cultures come back negative glycopeptides , cephalosporins , and in particular , quinolones are associated with an increased risk of colonisation of mrsa mathematical models describe one way in which a loss of infection control can occur after measures for screening and isolation seem to be effective for years , as happened in the uk as of 2013 , no randomized clinical trials had been conducted to understand how to treat nonsurgical wounds that had been colonized , but not infected , with mrsa , and insufficient studies had been conducted to understand how to treat surgical wounds that had been colonized with mrsa as shown in an animal study with diabetic mice , the topical application of a mixture of sugar ( 70 % ) and 3 % povidone-iodine paste is an effective agent for the treatment of diabetic ulcers with mrsa infection maintaining the necessary cleanliness may be difficult for people if they do not have access to facilities such as public toilets with handwashing facilities antibiotics effective against mrsa can be given by iv , oral , or a combination of both , and depend on the specific circumstances and patient characteristics both ca-mrsa and ha-mrsa are resistant to traditional anti-staphylococcal beta-lactam antibiotics , such as cephalexin ca-mrsa has a greater spectrum of antimicrobial susceptibility to sulfa drugs ( like co-trimoxazole ( trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ) , tetracyclines ( like doxycycline and minocycline ) and clindamycin ( for osteomyelitis ) more information is needed to determine the effectiveness of specific antibiotics therapy in surgical site infections ( ssis ) treatment is not standardized for other instances of mrsa infection in a wide range of tissues in many countries , outbreaks of mrsa infection were reported to be transmitted between hospitals mrsa is frequently a media topic , especially if well-known personalities have announced that they have or have had the infection mrsa will be included in experiments and cultured on the international space station to observe the effects of zero gravity on its evolution

in humans , staphylococcus aureus is part of the normal microbiota present in the upper respiratory tract , and on skin and in the gut mucosa after 72 hours , mrsa can take hold in human tissues and eventually become resistant to treatment about 75 percent of ca-mrsa infections are localized to skin and soft tissue and usually can be treated effectively surgical site infections occur on the skin surface , but can spread to internal organs and blood to cause sepsis prisons and military barracks can be crowded and confined , and poor hygiene practices may proliferate , thus putting inhabitants at increased risk of contracting mrsa aureus cases per month antibiotic use in livestock increases the risk that mrsa will develop among the livestock ; strains mrsa st 398 and cc398 are transmissible to humans domestic pets are susceptible to mrsa infection by transmission from their owners ; conversely , mrsa-infected pets can also transmit mrsa to humans locker rooms , gyms , and related athletic facilities offer potential sites for mrsa contamination and infection in october 2006 , a high-school football player was temporarily paralyzed from mrsa-infected turf burns his infection returned in january 2007 and required three surgeries to remove infected tissue , and three weeks of hospital stay in 2013 , lawrence tynes , carl nicks , and johnthan banks of the tampa bay buccaneers were diagnosed with mrsa tynes and nicks apparently did not contract the infection from each other , but whether banks contracted it from either individual is unknown mrsa is becoming a critical problem in children ; studies found 4.6 % of patients in u.s health-care facilities , ( presumably ) including hospital nurseries , were infected or colonized with mrsa parents should be especially cautious of children who participate in activities where sports equipment is shared , such as football helmets and uniforms the unsanitary methods of injection causes an access point for the mrsa to enter the blood stream and begin infecting the host furthermore , with mrsa 's high contagion rate , a common risk factor is individuals who are in constant contact with someone who has injected drugs in the past year antimicrobial resistance is genetically based ; resistance is mediated by the acquisition of extrachromosomal genetic elements containing genes that confer resistance to certain antibiotics sccmec contains additional genes beyond meca , including the cytolysin gene psm-mec , which may suppress virulence in ha-acquired mrsa strains owing to the size of the sccmec element and the constraints of horizontal gene transfer , a minimum of five clones are thought to be responsible for the spread of mrsa infections , with clonal complex ( cc ) 8 most prevalent different genotypes are also associated with different types of infections in contrast , ca-mrsa tends to carry lower-fitness cost sccmec elements to offset the increased virulence and toxicity expression required to infect healthy hosts meca is a biomarker gene responsible for resistance to methicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics meca encodes penicillin-binding protein 2a ( pbp2a ) , which differs from other penicillin-binding proteins as its active site does not bind methicillin or other β-lactam antibiotics as a consequence of the inability of pbp2a to interact with β-lactam moieties , acquisition of meca confers resistance to all β-lactam antibiotics in addition to methicillin sahebnasagh r , saderi h , owlia p in the presence of a β-lactam antibiotic , mecr1 initiates a signal transduction cascade that leads to transcriptional activation of meca blai and blar1 are homologous to meci and mecr1 , respectively , and normally function as regulators of blaz , which is responsible for penicillin resistance the dna sequences bound by meci and blai are identical ; therefore , blai can also bind the meca operator to repress transcription of meca the arginine catabolic mobile element ( acme ) is a virulence factor present in many mrsa strains but not prevalent in mssa aureus and facilitates stable skin colonization , wound infection , and person-to-person transmission aureus ( mssa ) gives rise to a number of genetically different mrsa lineages these genetic variations within different mrsa strains possibly explain the variability in virulence and associated mrsa infections the first mrsa strain , st250 mrsa-1 , originated from sccmec and st250-mssa integration emrsa 15 is also found to be one of the common mrsa strains in asia community-acquired mrsa ( ca-mrsa ) strains emerged in late 1990 to 2000 , infecting healthy people who had not been in contact with healthcare facilities this is further proven by molecular typing of ca-mrsa strains and genome comparison between ca-mrsa and ha-mrsa , which indicate that novel mrsa strains integrated sccmec into mssa separately on its own community-acquired mrsa is more easily treated and more virulent than hospital-acquired mrsa ( ha-mrsa ) the st8 : usa300 strain results in skin infections , necrotizing fasciitis , and toxic shock syndrome , whereas the st1 : usa400 strain results in necrotizing pneumonia and pulmonary sepsis other community-acquired strains of mrsa are st8 : usa500 and st59 : usa1000 in many nations of the world , mrsa strains with different genetic background types have come to predominate among ca-mrsa strains ; usa300 easily tops the list in the u.s for example , in australia , st93 strains are common , while in continental europe st80 strains , which carry sccmec type iv , predominate in taiwan , st59 strains , some of which are resistant to many non-beta-lactam antibiotics , have arisen as common causes of skin and soft tissue infections in the community , usa300 was found only rarely in a study of mrsa strains from outbreaks in 1996 and 2000 as well as in surveillance from 2004–06 diagnostic microbiology laboratories and reference laboratories are key for identifying outbreaks of mrsa aureus ( mssa ) , mrsa is slow-growing on a variety of media and has been found to exist in mixed colonies of mssa polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) testing is the most precise method for identifying mrsa strains specialized culture media have been developed to better differentiate between mssa and mrsa and , in some cases , such media can be used to identify specific strains that are resistant to different antibiotics aureus have emerged that are resistant to oxacillin , clindamycin , teicoplanin , and erythromycin one strain is only partially susceptible to vancomycin and is called vancomycin-intermediate s aureus can be quantified by determining the amount of the antibiotic that must be used to inhibit growth aureus is inhibited at a concentration of vancomycin less than or equal to 4 μg/ml , it is said to be susceptible if a concentration greater than 32 μg/ml is necessary to inhibit growth , it is said to be resistant in health-care settings , isolating those with mrsa from those without the infection is one method to prevent transmission combined with extra sanitary measures for those in contact with infected people , swab screening people admitted to hospitals has been found to be effective in minimizing the spread of mrsa in hospitals in the united states , denmark , finland , and the netherlands the centers for disease control and prevention offers suggestions for preventing the contraction and spread of mrsa infection which are applicable to those in community settings , including incarcerated populations , childcare center employees , and athletes to prevent the spread of mrsa , the recommendations are to wash hands thoroughly and regularly using soap and water or an alcohol-based sanitizer workers with active infections are excluded from activities where skin-to-skin contact is likely to occur mrsa colonization is also found in nonsurgical wounds such as traumatic wounds , burns , and chronic ulcers ( i.e four to six weeks of antibiotic treatment is often recommended , and is dependent upon the extent of mrsa infection ( bmj 2007 ) mrsa alone was associated with 8 % of nosocomial infections reported to the cdc national healthcare safety network from january 2006 to october 2007 according to the cdc , the most recent estimates of the incidence of healthcare-associated infections that are attributable to mrsa in the united states indicate a decline in such infection rates phage therapy has been used for years in mrsa in eastern countries , and studies are ongoing in western countries

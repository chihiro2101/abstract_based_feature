in humans , staphylococcus aureus is part of the normal microbiota present in the upper respiratory tract , and on skin and in the gut mucosa after 72 hours , mrsa can take hold in human tissues and eventually become resistant to treatment within a few days , the bumps become larger and more painful ; they eventually open into deep , pus-filled boils people who are hospitalized , including the elderly , are often immunocompromised and susceptible to infection of all kinds , including mrsa ; an infection by mrsa is called healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant s generally , those infected by mrsa stay infected for just under 10 days , if treated by a doctor , although effects may vary from person to person people in nursing homes are at risk for all the reasons above , further complicated by their generally weaker immune systems prisons and military barracks can be crowded and confined , and poor hygiene practices may proliferate , thus putting inhabitants at increased risk of contracting mrsa cases of mrsa in such populations were first reported in the united states and later in canada in the news media , hundreds of reports of mrsa outbreaks in prisons appeared between 2000 and 2008 antibiotic use in livestock increases the risk that mrsa will develop among the livestock ; strains mrsa st 398 and cc398 are transmissible to humans domestic pets are susceptible to mrsa infection by transmission from their owners ; conversely , mrsa-infected pets can also transmit mrsa to humans locker rooms , gyms , and related athletic facilities offer potential sites for mrsa contamination and infection three studies by the texas state department of health found the infection rate among football players was 16 times the national average in october 2006 , a high-school football player was temporarily paralyzed from mrsa-infected turf burns in 2013 , lawrence tynes , carl nicks , and johnthan banks of the tampa bay buccaneers were diagnosed with mrsa in october 2015 , new york giants tight end daniel fells was hospitalized with a serious mrsa infection health-care facilities , ( presumably ) including hospital nurseries , were infected or colonized with mrsa children and adults who come in contact with day-care centers , playgrounds , locker rooms , camps , dormitories , classrooms and other school settings , and gyms and workout facilities are at higher risk of contracting mrsa the unsanitary methods of injection causes an access point for the mrsa to enter the blood stream and begin infecting the host furthermore , with mrsa 's high contagion rate , a common risk factor is individuals who are in constant contact with someone who has injected drugs in the past year antimicrobial resistance is genetically based ; resistance is mediated by the acquisition of extrachromosomal genetic elements containing genes that confer resistance to certain antibiotics a defining characteristic of mrsa is its ability to thrive in the presence of penicillin-like antibiotics , which normally prevent bacterial growth by inhibiting synthesis of cell wall material this is due to a resistance gene , meca , which stops β-lactam antibiotics from inactivating the enzymes ( transpeptidases ) critical for cell wall synthesis staphylococcal gene cassette mec ( sccmec ) is a genomic island of unknown origin containing the antibiotic resistance gene meca sccmec contains additional genes beyond meca , including the cytolysin gene psm-mec , which may suppress virulence in ha-acquired mrsa strains owing to the size of the sccmec element and the constraints of horizontal gene transfer , a minimum of five clones are thought to be responsible for the spread of mrsa infections , with clonal complex ( cc ) 8 most prevalent different sccmec genotypes confer different microbiological characteristics , such as different antimicrobial resistance rates different genotypes are also associated with different types of infections conversely , ca-mrsa is associated with types iv and v , which are smaller and lack resistance genes other than meca in 2001 , and can be explained by the fitness differences associated with carriage of a large or small sccmec plasmid carriage of large plasmids , such as sccmeci–iii , is costly to the bacteria , resulting in a compensatory decrease in virulence expression mrsa is able to thrive in hospital settings with increased antibiotic resistance but decreased virulence – ha-mrsa targets immunocompromised , hospitalized hosts , thus a decrease in virulence is not maladaptive meca is a biomarker gene responsible for resistance to methicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics meca encodes penicillin-binding protein 2a ( pbp2a ) , which differs from other penicillin-binding proteins as its active site does not bind methicillin or other β-lactam antibiotics detection of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains from clinical samples in tehran by detection of the meca and nuc genes the arginine catabolic mobile element ( acme ) is a virulence factor present in many mrsa strains but not prevalent in mssa historically , major mrsa clones st2470-mrsa-i , st239-mrsa-iii , st5-mrsa-ii , and st5-mrsa-iv were responsible for causing hospital-acquired mrsa ( ha-mrsa ) infections in the uk , the most common strains of mrsa are emrsa15 and emrsa16 emrsa16 has been found to be identical to the st36 : usa200 strain , which circulates in the united states , and to carry the sccmec type ii , enterotoxin a and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 genes community-acquired mrsa ( ca-mrsa ) strains emerged in late 1990 to 2000 , infecting healthy people who had not been in contact with healthcare facilities this is further proven by molecular typing of ca-mrsa strains and genome comparison between ca-mrsa and ha-mrsa , which indicate that novel mrsa strains integrated sccmec into mssa separately on its own other community-acquired strains of mrsa are st8 : usa500 and st59 : usa1000 in many nations of the world , mrsa strains with different genetic background types have come to predominate among ca-mrsa strains ; usa300 easily tops the list in the u.s for example , in australia , st93 strains are common , while in continental europe st80 strains , which carry sccmec type iv , predominate diagnostic microbiology laboratories and reference laboratories are key for identifying outbreaks of mrsa aureus is a gram-positive , spherical ( coccus ) bacterium about 1 micron in diameter polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) testing is the most precise method for identifying mrsa strains specialized culture media have been developed to better differentiate between mssa and mrsa and , in some cases , such media can be used to identify specific strains that are resistant to different antibiotics aureus have emerged that are resistant to oxacillin , clindamycin , teicoplanin , and erythromycin one strain is only partially susceptible to vancomycin and is called vancomycin-intermediate s aureus is inhibited at a concentration of vancomycin less than or equal to 4 μg/ml , it is said to be susceptible in health-care settings , isolating those with mrsa from those without the infection is one method to prevent transmission mrsa can be identified by swabbing the nostrils and isolating the bacteria found there to prevent the spread of mrsa , the recommendations are to wash hands thoroughly and regularly using soap and water or an alcohol-based sanitizer workers with active infections are excluded from activities where skin-to-skin contact is likely to occur to prevent the spread of staphylococci or mrsa in the workplace , employers are encouraged to make available adequate facilities that support good hygiene glycopeptides , cephalosporins , and in particular , quinolones are associated with an increased risk of colonisation of mrsa reducing use of antibiotic classes that promote mrsa colonisation , especially fluoroquinolones , is recommended in current guidelines one of the few countries not to have been overwhelmed by mrsa is the netherlands : an important part of the success of the dutch strategy may have been to attempt eradication of carriage upon discharge from hospital in surgical wounds , evidence is weak ( high risk of bias ) that linezolid may be better than vancomycin to eradicate mrsa ssis aureus infections attributable to mrsa had reached 50 % the first report of community-associated mrsa ( ca-mrsa ) occurred in 1981 , and in 1982 , a large outbreak of ca-mrsa occurred among intravenous drug users in detroit , michigan , concluded that mrsa bacteremia is associated with increased mortality as compared with mssa bacteremia ( odds ratio 1.93 ; 95 % ) according to the cdc , the most recent estimates of the incidence of healthcare-associated infections that are attributable to mrsa in the united states indicate a decline in such infection rates

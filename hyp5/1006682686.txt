kensington gardens , is called the birds ' island , where baby peter reaches by flight , or by sailing in a paper boat or thrush 's nest walt disney 's 1953 peter pan suggests neverland is located in space , adding a '' star '' to peter 's directions : '' second star to the right , and straight on till morning the peter pan ( 2003 film ) ( produced by universal pictures , columbia pictures , revolution studios , red wagon entertainment and allied stars ltd ) repeats this representation , as the darling children are flown through the solar system to reach neverland in the 1991 film hook (

there are many more suns and moons than on the mainland , making time difficult to track ( 1911 ) peter & wendy , chapter 10 although neverland is widely thought of as a place where children do n't grow up , barrie wrote that the lost boys eventually do grow up , having to leave , and fairies there lived typically short lifespans in the 2011 miniseries neverland , in which neverland is said to be another planet entirely , time has frozen due to external cosmic forces converging on the planet , preventing anyone living there from ageing barrie 's play and novel , most of the adventures in

pirates ' ship are played out in a greater number of more elaborate locations the home underground has also been replaced by an intricate tree house structure which is prominent on the landscape rather than concealed , as the lost boys have successfully taken over their part of neverland this structure is possibly a continued development of peter 's '' house atop the trees '' which he occupies following hook 's defeat and the lost boys ' return to the mainland , presumably because he no longer has to hide nor house a large community the mermaids ' lagoon is directly connected to the lost boys ' tree house structure by a giant clam-shell pulley system , possibly because they have become allies to the lost boys in peter 's absence the maze of regrets is a maze in peter pan in

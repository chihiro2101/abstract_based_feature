the name of the tree in latin , fagus ( from whence the generic epithet ) , is cognate with english '' beech '' and of indo-european origin , and played an important role in early debates on the geographical origins of the indo-european people , the beech argument greek φηγός is from the same root , but the word was transferred to the oak tree ( e.g recent classification systems of the genus recognize 10 to 13 species in two distinct subgenera , engleriana and fagus patterns of molecular and morphological differentiation in fagus ( fagaceae ) : phylogenetic implications the engleriana subgenus is found only in east asia , and is notably distinct from the fagus subgenus in that these beeches are low-branching trees , often made up of several major trunks with yellowish bark the better known fagus subgenus beeches are high-branching with tall , stout trunks and smooth silver-grey bark the classification of the european beech , f research suggests that beeches in eurasia differentiated fairly late in evolutionary history , during the miocene the evolutionary history of fagus in western eurasia : evidence from genes , morphology and the fossil record – european beech fagus × taurica popl the european beech ( fagus sylvatica ) is the most commonly cultivated , although few important differences are seen between species aside from detail elements such as leaf shape the leaves of beech trees are entire or sparsely toothed , from long and broad the fruit is a small , sharply three-angled nut long , borne singly or in pairs in soft-spined husks long , known as cupules some suggest that it was introduced by neolithic tribes who planted the trees for their edible nuts beech is not native to ireland ; however , it was widely planted from the 18th century , and can become a problem shading out the native woodland understory today , beech is widely planted for hedging and in deciduous woodlands , and mature , regenerating stands occur throughout mainland britain at elevations below about fagus sylvatica is one of the most common hardwood trees in north central europe , in france alone constituting about 15 % of all nonconifers as a naturally growing forest tree , beech marks the important border between the european deciduous forest zone and the northern pine forest zone in denmark and scania at the southernmost peak of the scandinavian peninsula , south-west of the natural spruce boundary , it is the most common forest tree some research suggests that early agriculture patterns supported the spread of beech in continental europe the primeval beech forests of the carpathians are also an example of a singular , complete , and comprehensive forest dominated by a single tree species - the beech tree the american beech ( fagus grandifolia ) occurs across much of the eastern united states and southeastern canada , with a disjunct population in mexico beech leaf disease is a disease spread by the newly discovered nematode , litylenchus crenatae mccannii beech is also used to smoke westphalian ham , traditional andouille ( an offal sausage ) from normandy , and some cheeses beech wood is used for the stocks of military rifles when traditionally preferred woods such as walnut are scarce or unavailable or as a lower-cost alternative the beech most commonly grown as an ornamental tree is the european beech ( fagus sylvatica ) , widely cultivated in north america and its native europe

the name of the tree in latin , fagus ( from whence the generic epithet ) , is cognate with english '' beech '' and of indo-european origin , and played an important role in early debates on the geographical origins of the indo-european people , the beech argument recent classification systems of the genus recognize 10 to 13 species in two distinct subgenera , engleriana and fagus patterns of molecular and morphological differentiation in fagus ( fagaceae ) : phylogenetic implications the engleriana subgenus is found only in east asia , and is notably distinct from the fagus subgenus in that these beeches are low-branching trees , often made up of several major trunks with yellowish bark further differentiating characteristics include the whitish bloom on the underside of the leaves , the visible tertiary leaf veins , and a long , smooth cupule-peduncle the better known fagus subgenus beeches are high-branching with tall , stout trunks and smooth silver-grey bark the classification of the european beech , f sylvatica , is complex , with a variety of different names proposed for different species and subspecies within this region ( for example f genetic differentiation and phylogeny of beech on the balkan peninsula research suggests that beeches in eurasia differentiated fairly late in evolutionary history , during the miocene the following is a partial list of taxa which have been accepted as species at one point : fagus chienii w.c.cheng fagus crenata blume fagus engleriana seemen ex diels â€“ chinese beech fagus grandifolia ehrh fagus longipetiolata seemen fagus lucida rehder & e.h.wilson fagus orientalis lipsky fagus sylvatica l beeches are monoecious , bearing both male and female flowers on the same plant the small flowers are unisexual , the female flowers borne in pairs , the male flowers wind-pollinating catkins they are produced in spring shortly after the new leaves appear the husk can have a variety of spine- to scale-like appendages , the character of which is , in addition to leaf shape , one of the primary ways beeches are differentiated the nuts are edible , though bitter ( though not nearly as bitter as acorns ) with a high tannin content , and are called beechnuts or beechmast fagus sylvatica was a late entrant to great britain after the last glaciation , and may have been restricted to basic soils in the south of england large areas of the chilterns are covered with beech woods , which are habitat to the common bluebell and other flora the cwm clydach national nature reserve in southeast wales was designated for its beech woodlands , which are believed to be on the western edge of their natural range in this steep limestone gorge today , beech is widely planted for hedging and in deciduous woodlands , and mature , regenerating stands occur throughout mainland britain at elevations below about the most northern known naturally growing ( not planted ) beech trees are found in a small grove north of bergen on the west coast of norway beeches are also used as food plants by some species of lepidoptera beech bark disease is a fungal infection that attacks the american beech through damage caused by scale insects in modern german , the word for '' book '' is buch , with buche meaning '' beech tree '' the beech most commonly grown as an ornamental tree is the european beech ( fagus sylvatica ) , widely cultivated in north america and its native europe

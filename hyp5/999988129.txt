the name of the tree in latin , fagus ( from whence the generic epithet ) , is cognate with english '' beech '' and of indo-european origin , and played an important role in early debates on the geographical origins of the indo-european people , the beech argument recent classification systems of the genus recognize 10 to 13 species in two distinct subgenera , engleriana and fagus patterns of molecular and morphological differentiation in fagus ( fagaceae ) : phylogenetic implications the engleriana subgenus is found only in east asia , and is notably distinct from the fagus subgenus in that these beeches are low-branching trees , often made up of several major trunks with yellowish bark further differentiating characteristics include the whitish bloom on the underside of the leaves , the visible tertiary leaf veins , and a long , smooth cupule-peduncle the better known fagus subgenus beeches are high-branching with tall , stout trunks and smooth silver-grey bark the populations in this area represent a range of often overlapping morphotypes , and genetic analysis does not clearly support separate species within its family , the fagaceae , recent research has suggested that fagus is the evolutionarily most basal group the southern beeches ( genus nothofagus ) previously thought closely related to beeches , are now treated as members of a separate family , the nothofagaceae ( which remains a member of the order fagales ) they are found in australia , new zealand , new guinea , new caledonia , argentina , and chile ( principally patagonia and tierra del fuego ) fagus longipetiolata seemen fagus lucida rehder & e.h.wilson fagus orientalis lipsky fagus sylvatica l the leaves of beech trees are entire or sparsely toothed , from long and broad beeches are monoecious , bearing both male and female flowers on the same plant the small flowers are unisexual , the female flowers borne in pairs , the male flowers wind-pollinating catkins beech is not native to ireland ; however , it was widely planted from the 18th century , and can become a problem shading out the native woodland understory today , beech is widely planted for hedging and in deciduous woodlands , and mature , regenerating stands occur throughout mainland britain at elevations below about preston , pearman & dines ( 2002 ) new atlas of the british flora in denmark and scania at the southernmost peak of the scandinavian peninsula , south-west of the natural spruce boundary , it is the most common forest tree near the city of larvik is the largest naturally occurring beech forest in norway , b√∏keskogen research has linked the establishment of beech stands in scandinavia and germany with cultivation and fire disturbance , i.e the primeval beech forests of the carpathians are also an example of a singular , complete , and comprehensive forest dominated by a single tree species - the beech tree grandifolia , this beech is one of the most common hardwoods in its native range beech grows on a wide range of soil types , acidic or basic , provided they are not waterlogged since the beech tree has such delicate bark , carvings , such as lovers ' initials and other forms of graffiti , remain because the tree is unable to heal itself slats of beech wood are washed in caustic soda to leach out any flavour or aroma characteristics and are spread around the bottom of fermentation tanks for budweiser beer the beech most commonly grown as an ornamental tree is the european beech ( fagus sylvatica ) , widely cultivated in north america and its native europe

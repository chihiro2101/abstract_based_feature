file : porphyrin.svg porphin is the simplest porphyrin , a rare compound of theoretical interest unlike the natural porphyrin ligands , oep 2− is highly symmetrical file : h2tpp.png tetraphenylporphyrin ( h 2 tpp ) is another synthetic analogue of protoporphyrin ix unlike the natural porphyrin ligands , tpp 2− is highly symmetrical porphyrins are the conjugate acids of ligands that bind metals to form complexes some iron-containing porphyrins are called hemes various cytochromes are also hemoproteins a benzoporphyrin is a porphyrin with a benzene ring fused to one of the pyrrole units these include corrins , chlorins , bacteriochlorophylls , and corphins chlorins ( 2,3-dihydroporphyrin ) are more reduced , contain more hydrogen than porphyrins , i.e a geoporphyrin , also known as a petroporphyrin , is a porphyrin of geologic origin abelsonite is possibly the only geoporphyrin mineral , as it is rare for porphyrins to occur in isolation and form crystals the first synthetic porphyrin isomer was reported by emanual vogel and coworkers in 1986 this inspired vogel and sessler to took up the challenge of preparing 18porphyrin- ( 2.1.0.1 ) and named it as corrphycene or porphycerin the field of organic geochemistry had its origins in the isolation of porphyrins from petroleum petroleum is sometimes '' fingerprinted '' by analysis of trace amounts of nickel and vanadyl porphyrins an example of a host–guest complex that was constructed from a macrocycle composed of four porphyrins

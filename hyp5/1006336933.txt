file : porphyrin.svg porphin is the simplest porphyrin , a rare compound of theoretical interest unlike the natural porphyrin ligands , oep 2− is highly symmetrical unlike the natural porphyrin ligands , tpp 2− is highly symmetrical porphyrins are the conjugate acids of ligands that bind metals to form complexes the metal ion usually has a charge of 2+ or 3+ some iron-containing porphyrins are called hemes a benzoporphyrin is a porphyrin with a benzene ring fused to one of the pyrrole units several other heterocycles are related to porphyrins chlorins ( 2,3-dihydroporphyrin ) are more reduced , contain more hydrogen than porphyrins , i.e one pyrrole has been converted to a pyrroline a geoporphyrin , also known as a petroporphyrin , is a porphyrin of geologic origin they can occur in crude oil , oil shale , coal , or sedimentary rocks abelsonite is possibly the only geoporphyrin mineral , as it is rare for porphyrins to occur in isolation and form crystals the third porphyrin that is 18porphyrin- ( 2.1.1.0 ) , was reported by callot and vogel-sessler the field of organic geochemistry had its origins in the isolation of porphyrins from petroleum phthalocyanines , which are structurally related to porphyrins , are used in commerce as dyes and catalysts , but porphyrins are not an example of a host–guest complex that was constructed from a macrocycle composed of four porphyrins

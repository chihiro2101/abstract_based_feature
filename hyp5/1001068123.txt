early usage of the term carried negative connotations , implying fraud or immoral behavior ( usually on the part of an insured party ) economists use this term to describe inefficiencies that can occur when risks are displaced or can not be fully evaluated , rather than a description of the ethics or morals of the involved parties often what is described as '' moral hazards '' in the insurance literature is upon closer reading , a description of the closely related concept , adverse selection mcdonough , head of the new york federal reserve , helped the counter-parties of long term capital management avoid losses by taking over the firm this move was criticized by former fed chair , paul volcker and others as increasing moral hazard '' fed chair , alan greenspan , while conceding the risk of moral hazard , defended the policy to orderly unwind long term capital by saying the world economy is at stake economist paul krugman described moral hazard as '' any situation in which one person makes the decision about how much risk to take , while someone else bears the cost if things go badly mortgage securitization enables mortgage originators to pass on the risk that the mortgages they originate might default and not hold the mortgages on their balance sheets and assume the risk in one kind of mortgage securitization , known as '' agency securitizations , '' default risk is retained by the securitizing agency that buys the mortgages from originators these agencies thus have an incentive to monitor originators and check loan quality they are similar to the '' covered bonds '' that are commonly used in western europe in that the securitizing agency retains default risk economist mark zandi of moody 's analytics described moral hazard as a root cause of the subprime mortgage crisis he wrote that '' the risks inherent in mortgage lending became so widely dispersed that no one was forced to worry about the quality of any single loan '' moral hazard can also occur with borrowers securitization of mortgages in america started in 1983 at salomon brothers and where the risk of each mortgage passed to the next purchaser instead of remaining with the original mortgaging institution in a purely capitalist scenario , the last one holding the risk ( like a game of musical chairs ) is the one who faces the potential losses others believe that financial bailouts of lending institutions do not encourage risky lending behavior since there is no guarantee to lending institutions that a bailout will occur decreased valuation of a corporation before any bailout would prevent risky , speculative business decisions by executives who fail to conduct proper due diligence in their business transactions therefore , asset managers may have been in a situation of moral hazard , where they would take on more risk than appropriate for a given client because they did n't bear the cost of failure because loan originators were paid on a per-mortgage basis , they had an incentive to produce as many mortgages as possible , even if they were risky because these institutions did n't expect to hold on to the loans until maturity , they could pass on the risk to the buyer of the loans therefore , mortgage loan originators may have been in a situation of moral hazard , because they did n't bear the costs of the risky mortgages they were underwriting in insurance markets , moral hazard occurs when the behavior of the insured party changes in a way that raises costs for the insurer since the insured party no longer bears the full costs of that behavior a party makes a decision about how much risk to take , while another party bears the costs if things go badly , and the party insulated from risk behaves differently from how it would if it were fully exposed to the risk the individual taking greater risks during the period would be ex-ante moral hazard whereas lying about a fictitious health problem to defraud the insurance company would be ex post moral hazard the entrepreneur becoming overly risky would be ex ante moral hazard , but willful default ( wrongly claiming the venture failed when it was profitable ) is ex post moral hazard conflict of interest externality feedback free rider problem game theory information economics offset hypothesis perverse incentive risk compensation samaritan 's dilemma systemic risk unintended consequences

early usage of the term carried negative connotations , implying fraud or immoral behavior ( usually on the part of an insured party ) the concept of moral hazard was the subject of renewed study by economists in the 1960s , beginning with economist ken arrow , and did not imply immoral behavior or fraud often what is described as '' moral hazards '' in the insurance literature is upon closer reading , a description of the closely related concept , adverse selection '' fed chair , alan greenspan , while conceding the risk of moral hazard , defended the policy to orderly unwind long term capital by saying the world economy is at stake economist paul krugman described moral hazard as '' any situation in which one person makes the decision about how much risk to take , while someone else bears the cost if things go badly '' financial bailouts of lending institutions by governments , central banks or other institutions can encourage risky lending in the future if those that take the risks come to believe that they will not have to carry the full burden of potential losses mortgage securitization enables mortgage originators to pass on the risk that the mortgages they originate might default and not hold the mortgages on their balance sheets and assume the risk in one kind of mortgage securitization , known as '' agency securitizations , '' default risk is retained by the securitizing agency that buys the mortgages from originators they are similar to the '' covered bonds '' that are commonly used in western europe in that the securitizing agency retains default risk under both models , investors take on only interest-rate risk , not default risk instead , the securitizing entity passes on default risk to investors during the years leading up to the subprime mortgage crisis , private label securitizations grew as a share of overall mortgage securitization by purchasing and securitizing low-quality , high-risk mortgages he wrote that '' the risks inherent in mortgage lending became so widely dispersed that no one was forced to worry about the quality of any single loan '' moral hazard can also occur with borrowers the risk and the burdens of loss became apparent to lehman brothers , which who did not benefit from a bailout , and other financial institutions and mortgage companies such as citibank and countrywide financial corporation , whose valuation plunged during the subprime mortgage crisis many scholars and journalists have argued that moral hazard played a role in the 2008 financial crisis , since numerous actors in the financial market may have had an incentive to increase their exposure to risk in general , there are three ways in which moral hazard may have manifested itself in the lead up to the financial crisis therefore , asset managers may have been in a situation of moral hazard , where they would take on more risk than appropriate for a given client because they did n't bear the cost of failure mortgage loan originators , such as washington mutual , may have had an incentive to understate the risk of loans they originated because the loans were often sold to mortgage pools ( see mortgage-backed security ) because loan originators were paid on a per-mortgage basis , they had an incentive to produce as many mortgages as possible , even if they were risky economists distinguish moral hazard from adverse selection , another problem that arises in the insurance industry , which is caused by hidden information , rather than hidden actions in insurance markets , moral hazard occurs when the behavior of the insured party changes in a way that raises costs for the insurer since the insured party no longer bears the full costs of that behavior according to contract theory , moral hazard results from a situation in which a hidden action occurs the individual taking greater risks during the period would be ex-ante moral hazard whereas lying about a fictitious health problem to defraud the insurance company would be ex post moral hazard in the literature , two reasons have been discussed why moral hazard may imply that the first-best solution ( the solution that would be attained under complete information ) is not achieved secondly , the agent may be risk-neutral but wealth-constrained and so the agent can not make a payment to the principal and there is a trade-off between providing incentives and minimizing the agent 's limited-liability rent conflict of interest externality feedback free rider problem game theory information economics offset hypothesis perverse incentive risk compensation samaritan 's dilemma systemic risk unintended consequences

dembe and boden point out , however , that prominent mathematicians who studied decision-making in the 18th century used '' moral '' to mean '' subjective '' , which may cloud the true ethical significance in the term the concept of moral hazard was the subject of renewed study by economists in the 1960s , beginning with economist ken arrow , and did not imply immoral behavior or fraud often what is described as '' moral hazards '' in the insurance literature is upon closer reading , a description of the closely related concept , adverse selection this move was criticized by former fed chair , paul volcker and others as increasing moral hazard economist paul krugman described moral hazard as '' any situation in which one person makes the decision about how much risk to take , while someone else bears the cost if things go badly '' financial bailouts of lending institutions by governments , central banks or other institutions can encourage risky lending in the future if those that take the risks come to believe that they will not have to carry the full burden of potential losses lending institutions need to take risks by making loans , and the riskiest loans usually have the potential for making the highest return in one kind of mortgage securitization , known as '' agency securitizations , '' default risk is retained by the securitizing agency that buys the mortgages from originators the securitizing entity , therefore , has relatively little incentive to monitor originators and maintain loan quality '' private label '' securitization refers to securitizations structured by financial institutions such as investment banks , commercial banks , and non-bank mortgage lenders during the years leading up to the subprime mortgage crisis , private label securitizations grew as a share of overall mortgage securitization by purchasing and securitizing low-quality , high-risk mortgages he wrote that '' the risks inherent in mortgage lending became so widely dispersed that no one was forced to worry about the quality of any single loan borrowers may not act prudently ( in the view of the lender ) when they invest or spend funds recklessly securitization of mortgages in america started in 1983 at salomon brothers and where the risk of each mortgage passed to the next purchaser instead of remaining with the original mortgaging institution investors bought securities and hedged against the risk of default and prepayment , pushing those risks further along in a purely capitalist scenario , the last one holding the risk ( like a game of musical chairs ) is the one who faces the potential losses in the sub-prime crisis , however , national credit authorities ( the federal reserve in the us ) assumed the ultimate risk on behalf of the citizenry at large others believe that financial bailouts of lending institutions do not encourage risky lending behavior since there is no guarantee to lending institutions that a bailout will occur asset managers may have had an incentive to take on more risk when managing other people 's money , particularly if they were paid as a percentage of the fund 's profits mortgage loan originators , such as washington mutual , may have had an incentive to understate the risk of loans they originated because the loans were often sold to mortgage pools ( see mortgage-backed security ) '' too big to fail '' banks may have believed they were essentially invincible to failure , thus putting them in a position of moral hazard : they could take on big risks - thus increasing their expected payoff - thinking that the federal government would bail them out in the event of a major failure therefore , large banks may have been in a situation of moral hazard , because they did n't bear the costs of a catastrophic collapse others have argued that moral hazard could not have played a role in the financial crisis for three main reasons a second type of behavior that may change is the reaction to the negative consequences of risk once they have occurred and insurance is provided to cover their costs consider a potential case of moral hazard in the health care market caused by the purchase of health insurance in economic theory , moral hazard is a situation in which the behavior of one party may change to the detriment of another after the transaction has taken place the individual taking greater risks during the period would be ex-ante moral hazard whereas lying about a fictitious health problem to defraud the insurance company would be ex post moral hazard

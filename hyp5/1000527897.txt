the traditional arguments for industrial policies go back as far as the 18th century historically , there is a growing consensus that most developed countries , including united kingdom , united states , germany , and france , have intervened actively in their domestic economy through industrial policies more recently , the rapid growth of east asian economies , or the newly industrialized countries ( nics ) , has also been associated with active industrial policies that selectively promoted manufacturing and facilitated technology transfer and industrial upgrading many of these domestic policy choices , however , are now seen as detrimental to free trade and are hence limited by various international agreements such as wto trims or trips instead , the recent focus for industrial policy has shifted towards the promotion of local business clusters and the integration into global value chains however contemporary industry policy generally accepts globalization as a given , and focuses less on the decline of older industries , and more on the growth of emergent industries 163â€“84 while the east asian tigers provided successful examples of heterodox interventions and protectionist industrial policies , industrial policies such as import-substitution-industrialization ( isi ) have failed in many other regions such as latin america and sub-saharan africa one question is which kinds of industrial policy are most effective in promoting economic development of particular relevance for developing countries are the conditions under which industrial policies may also contribute to poverty reduction , such as a focus on specific industries or the promotion of linkages between larger companies and smaller local enterprises .

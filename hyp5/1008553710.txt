mary of burgundy was born in brussels at the ducal castle of coudenberg , to charles the bold , then known as the count of charolais , and his wife isabella of bourbon philip the good died in 1467 and mary 's father assumed control of the burgundian state as soon as louis succeeded in producing a male heir who survived infancy , the future king charles viii of france , louis wanted him to be the one to marry mary , even though he was thirteen years younger than mary nicholas i , duke of lorraine , was a few years older than mary and controlled a duchy that lay alongside burgundian territory , but his plan to combine his domain with hers was ended by his death in battle in 1473 burgundy , fearing french military power , sent an embassy to france to negotiate a marriage between mary and the six-year-old dauphin ( later king charles viii ) , but returned home without a betrothal ; the french king 's demands of cession of territories to the french crown were deemed unacceptable louis was swift to re-engage hostilities with maximilian and forced him to agree to the treaty of arras ( 1482 ) , by which franche-comt√© and artois passed for a time to french rule , only to be recovered by the treaty of senlis of 1493 , which established peace in the low countries mary 's marriage into the house of habsburg proved to be a disaster for france because the burgundian inheritance later brought it into conflict with spain and the holy roman empire

gustave caillebotte was born on 19 august 1848 to an upper-class parisian family living in the rue du faubourg-saint-denis his father , martial caillebotte ( 1799–1874 ) , was the inheritor of the family 's military textile business and was also a judge at the seine department 's tribunal de commerce caillebotte 's father was twice widowed before marrying caillebotte 's mother , céleste daufresne ( 1819–1878 ) , who had two more sons after gustave : rené ( 1851–1876 ) and martial ( 1853–1910 ) anne distel , et al , gustave caillebotte : urban impressionist , abbeville press , new york , 1995 , , p 311 caillebotte was born at home on rue du faubourg-saint-denis in paris , and lived there until 1866 , when his father had a home built on 77 rue de miromesnil beginning in 1860 , the caillebotte family began spending many of their summers in yerres , a town on the yerres river about south of paris , where martial caillebotte , sr after the war , caillebotte began visiting the studio of painter léon bonnat , where he began to study painting seriously in 1873 , caillebotte entered the école des beaux-arts , but apparently did not spend much time there around 1874 , caillebotte had met and befriended several artists working outside the académie des beaux-arts , including edgar degas and giuseppe de nittis , and attended ( but did not participate in ) the first impressionist exhibition of 1874 312 the '' impressionists '' – also called the '' independents '' , '' intransigents '' , and '' intentionalists '' – had broken away from the academic painters showing in the annual salons caillebotte made his debut in the second impressionist exhibition in 1876 , showing eight paintings , including , les raboteurs de parquet ( the floor scrapers ) ( 1875 ) , his earliest masterpiece 19 its subject matter , the depiction of labourers preparing a wooden floor ( thought to have been that of the artist 's own studio ) was considered '' vulgar '' by some critics and this is the probable reason for its rejection by the salon of 1875 a second version , in a more realistic style resembling that of degas , also was exhibited , demonstrating caillebotte 's range of technique and his adept restatement of the same subject matter the second period of pointillism , whose main representative was georges seurat , announced its influence in the late works that caillebotte painted at his country house in petit gennevilliers 13 the tilted ground common to these paintings is characteristic of caillebotte 's work , which may have been strongly influenced by japanese prints and the new technology of photography , although evidence of his use of photography is lacking 38 cropping and '' zooming-in '' , techniques that commonly are found in caillebotte 's oeuvre , may also be the result of his interest in photography , but may just as likely be derived from his intense interest in perspective effects many of his paintings depict members of his family ; young man at his window ( jeune homme à la fenêtre ) ( 1875 ) shows rené in the home on rue de miromesnil ; the orange trees ( les orangers ) ( 1878 ) , depicts martial jr and his cousin zoé in the garden of the family property at yerres ; and portraits in the country ( portraits à la campagne ) ( 1875 ) includes caillebotte 's mother along with his aunt , cousin , and a family friend there are scenes of dining , card playing , piano playing , reading , and sewing , all executed in an intimate , unobtrusive manner that portrays the quiet ritual of upper-class indoor life anne distel , et al he often used a soft impressionistic technique reminiscent of renoir to convey the tranquil nature of the countryside , in sharp contrast to the flatter , smoother strokes of his urban paintings 3 in man on a balcony ( 1880 ) , he invites the viewer to share the balcony with his subject and join in observing the scene of the city reaching into the distance , again by using unusual perspective anne distel , et al 110 caillebotte 's still life paintings focus primarily on food , some at table ready to be eaten and some ready to be purchased , as in a series of paintings he made of meat at a butcher shop rounding out his subject matter , he painted a few nudes , including homme au bain ( 1884 ) and nude on a couch ( 1882 ) , which , although provocative in its realism , is ambivalent in its mood — neither overtly erotic nor suggestive of mythology — themes common to many nude paintings of women during that era caillebotte 's sizable allowance , along with the inheritance he received after the death of his father in 1874 and his mother in 1878 , allowed him to paint without the pressure to sell his work 24–25 forty of caillebotte 's own works are held by the musée d'orsay caillebotte - dans un café.jpg dans un café ( 1880 ) musée des beaux-arts de rouen file : g caillebotte at museumsyndicate caillebotte at webmuseum caillebotte at the artchive cailebotte at cgfa cailebotte at musée d'orsay 200 works by gustave caillebotte the caillebotte brothers , painter and photographer kirk varnedoe , gustave caillebotte caillebotte 's man at his bath caillebotte works at the art institute of chicago

frequency analysis for simple substitution ciphers in a simple substitution cipher , each letter of the plaintext is replaced with another , and any particular letter in the plaintext will always be transformed into the same letter in the ciphertext for instance , if all occurrences of the letter turn into the letter , a ciphertext message containing numerous instances of the letter would suggest to a cryptanalyst that represents the basic use of frequency analysis is to first count the frequency of ciphertext letters and then associate guessed plaintext letters with them thus the cryptanalyst may need to try several combinations of mappings between ciphertext and plaintext letters more complex use of statistics can be conceived , such as considering counts of pairs of letters ( bigrams ) , triplets ( trigrams ) , and so on suppose eve has intercepted the cryptogram below , and it is known to be encrypted using a simple substitution cipher as follows : for this example , uppercase letters are used to denote ciphertext , lowercase letters are used to denote plaintext ( or guesses at such ) , and ~ is used to express a guess that ciphertext letter represents the plaintext letter eve could use frequency analysis to help solve the message along the following lines : counts of the letters in the cryptogram show that is the most common single letter , most common bigram , and is the most common trigram the second most common letter in the cryptogram is ; since the first and second most frequent letters in the english language , and are accounted for , eve guesses that ~ , the third most frequent letter the weight of the insect was very remarkable , and , taking all things into consideration , i could hardly blame jupiter for his opinion respecting it a disadvantage of all these attempts to defeat frequency counting attacks is that it increases complication of both enciphering and deciphering , leading to mistakes frequency analysis requires only a basic understanding of the statistics of the plaintext language and some problem solving skills , and , if performed by hand , tolerance for extensive letter bookkeeping

frequency analysis for simple substitution ciphers for instance , if all occurrences of the letter turn into the letter , a ciphertext message containing numerous instances of the letter would suggest to a cryptanalyst that represents the basic use of frequency analysis is to first count the frequency of ciphertext letters and then associate guessed plaintext letters with them more s in the ciphertext than anything else suggests that corresponds to in the plaintext , but this is not certain ; and are also very common in english , so might be either of them also this is done to provide more information to the cryptanalyst , for instance , and nearly always occur together in that order in english , even though itself is rare eve could use frequency analysis to help solve the message along the following lines : counts of the letters in the cryptogram show that is the most common single letter , most common bigram , and is the most common trigram is the most common letter in the english language , is the most common bigram , and is the most common trigram the second most common letter in the cryptogram is ; since the first and second most frequent letters in the english language , and are accounted for , eve guesses that ~ , the third most frequent letter this would not always be the case , however ; the variation in statistics for individual plaintexts can mean that initial guesses are incorrect it may be necessary to backtrack incorrect guesses or to analyze the available statistics in much more depth than the somewhat simplified justifications given in the above example it is also possible that the plaintext does not exhibit the expected distribution of letter frequencies these included : homophonic substitution : use of homophones & mdash ; several alternatives to the most common letters in otherwise monoalphabetic substitution ciphers

frequency analysis for simple substitution ciphers in a simple substitution cipher , each letter of the plaintext is replaced with another , and any particular letter in the plaintext will always be transformed into the same letter in the ciphertext for instance , if all occurrences of the letter turn into the letter , a ciphertext message containing numerous instances of the letter would suggest to a cryptanalyst that represents the basic use of frequency analysis is to first count the frequency of ciphertext letters and then associate guessed plaintext letters with them more s in the ciphertext than anything else suggests that corresponds to in the plaintext , but this is not certain ; and are also very common in english , so might be either of them also thus the cryptanalyst may need to try several combinations of mappings between ciphertext and plaintext letters eve could use frequency analysis to help solve the message along the following lines : counts of the letters in the cryptogram show that is the most common single letter , most common bigram , and is the most common trigram the second most common letter in the cryptogram is ; since the first and second most frequent letters in the english language , and are accounted for , eve guesses that ~ , the third most frequent letter these included : homophonic substitution : use of homophones & mdash ; several alternatives to the most common letters in otherwise monoalphabetic substitution ciphers the rotor machines of the first half of the 20th century ( for example , the enigma machine ) were essentially immune to straightforward frequency analysis several of the ciphers used by the axis powers were breakable using frequency analysis , for example , some of the consular ciphers used by the japanese etaoin shrdlu letter frequencies arabic letter frequency index of coincidence topics in cryptography zipf 's law a void , a novel by georges perec

frequency analysis for simple substitution ciphers in a simple substitution cipher , each letter of the plaintext is replaced with another , and any particular letter in the plaintext will always be transformed into the same letter in the ciphertext for instance , if all occurrences of the letter turn into the letter , a ciphertext message containing numerous instances of the letter would suggest to a cryptanalyst that represents the basic use of frequency analysis is to first count the frequency of ciphertext letters and then associate guessed plaintext letters with them more s in the ciphertext than anything else suggests that corresponds to in the plaintext , but this is not certain ; and are also very common in english , so might be either of them also eve could use frequency analysis to help solve the message along the following lines : counts of the letters in the cryptogram show that is the most common single letter , most common bigram , and is the most common trigram is the most common letter in the english language , is the most common bigram , and is the most common trigram the second most common letter in the cryptogram is ; since the first and second most frequent letters in the english language , and are accounted for , eve guesses that ~ , the third most frequent letter filling in these guesses , eve gets : in turn , these guesses suggest still others ( for example , '' '' could be '' '' , implying ~ and so on , and it is relatively straightforward to deduce the rest of the letters , eventually yielding the plaintext at this point , it would be a good idea for eve to insert spaces and punctuation : hereupon legrand arose , with a grave and stately air , and brought me the beetle from a glass case in which it was enclosed there were two round black spots near one extremity of the back , and a long one near the other several of the ciphers used by the axis powers were breakable using frequency analysis , for example , some of the consular ciphers used by the japanese

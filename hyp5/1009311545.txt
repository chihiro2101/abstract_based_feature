thumb the time of sunset varies throughout the year , and is determined by the viewer 's position on earth , specified by latitude and longitude , altitude , and time zone during winter and spring , the days get longer and sunsets occur later every day until the day of the latest sunset , which occurs after the summer solstice likewise , the earliest sunset does not occur on the winter solstice , but rather about two weeks earlier , again depending on the viewer 's latitude further , because the light from the sun is refracted as it passes through the earth 's atmosphere , the sun is still visible after it is geometrically below the horizon light from the bottom edge of the sun 's disk is refracted more than light from the top , since refraction increases as the angle of elevation decreases at sunrise and sunset , when the path through the atmosphere is longer , the blue and green components are removed almost completely , leaving the longer wavelength orange and red hues we see at those times mie scattering is responsible for the light scattered by clouds , and also for the daytime halo of white light around the sun ( forward scattering of white light ) sunset colors are typically more brilliant than sunrise colors , because the evening air contains more particles than morning air the english words '' orient '' and '' occident '' , meaning '' east '' and '' west '' , respectively , are descended from latin words meaning '' sunrise '' and '' sunset '' the colors of the martian sunset differ from those on earth instead , the air is full of red dust , blown into the atmosphere by high winds , so its sky color is mainly determined by a mie theory process , resulting in more blue hues than an earth sunset full physical explanation in simple terms the colors of twilight and sunset geolocation service to calculate the time of sunrise and sunset

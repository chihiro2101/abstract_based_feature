john kaplan , robert weisberg , guyora binder , , to understand larceny , one must understand the distinction between custody and possession ( lexis 2001 ) a person has possession of property when he has actual physical control over the property ( actual possession ) or he has the right to exercise considerable control over the disposition or use of the property ( constructive possession ) this is to be contrasted to , for example , a person who has obtained actual possession of the property by fraud thus merely knocking an article from a person 's hand was not larceny , as long as the defendant did not thereafter take it the overcoat was secured to the mannequin by a chain , a fact the defendant first discovered when the chain drew taut the court held that the defendant 's control over the property , although momentary , was sufficient to constitute a taking the taking may be either direct or indirect ; that is , accomplished by the criminal himself or an innocent agent as professor wayne lafave noted , at its most literal this requirement renders the rotating of a doughnut a larceny , but not the rotating of a pie , lafave , criminal law 3rd ed 11 as all of the doughnut is moved through rotation while the pie 's exact center remains in the same place when rotated as was his custom he turned the wheelbarrow upside down to avoid water collecting in the tub if a person picks up a package of steaks intending to steal them then changes her or his mind and puts the steak back in the meat counter , the crime of larceny has been committed but the state will have a difficult time proving it the court read asportation as merely a corroborative element of possession and control , and thus not necessary to establish possession and control of a car because transportation is the purpose of a car additionally , the model penal code eliminates the asportation requirement and instead requires that the defendant '' exercise unlawful control '' the drafters noted that historically the asportation requirement distinguished larceny ( a felony ) and attempted larceny ( a misdemeanor ) they reasoned , therefore , that asportation was an irrelevant requirement because in modern criminal law , like the model penal code , ยง5.01 the sentencing consequences between an attempted and completed crime are negligible from its creation larceny is a common law offense the subject matter of larceny has been tangible personal property , for example , one can steal a person 's social security card and use the information to obtain a credit card and make transactions however , using the social security number is not larceny because the information , although of substantial value , is not tangible personal property with a physical existence : items that can be seen , held , and felt ( or in technical terms , property that has a '' corporeal existence '' ) for example , north carolina has statutes that make it a crime to steal choses in action , growing crops and so on the restriction of the scope of larceny to personal property may have practical consequences modernly , severance of a fixture from the realty would convert the fixture from real property back to personal property however , the common law stated that if the severance and carrying away of a fixture were one continuous act , no larceny would occur therefore , it is possible for the person who has title to the property to steal the property from a person who had lawful possession some states may also charge certain types of larceny as '' robbery '' , '' burglary '' , '' theft '' , '' shoplifting '' , '' conversion '' , and other terms if a third party transfers possession of property to an employee for delivery to his employer , the employee has possession of the property and his conversion of the property would be embezzlement rather than larceny

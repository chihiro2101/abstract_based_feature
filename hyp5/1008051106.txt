john kaplan , robert weisberg , guyora binder , , to understand larceny , one must understand the distinction between custody and possession a person has custody if he has actual physical control of the property , but the person who has constructive possession has substantially restricted the custodian 's right to use the property examples of custody would be a store customer examining the goods of a merchant , or an employee who has been given the property of his employer to be used in his employment this is to be contrasted to , for example , a person who has obtained actual possession of the property by fraud originally , the caption element required an actual physical taking of the property from the victim 's person these actions were held not to be larceny because the defendant never had complete control over the disposition and use of the coat the taking may be either direct or indirect ; that is , accomplished by the criminal himself or an innocent agent for example , boyce & perkins , criminal law , 3rd ed the defendant intending to steal the wheelbarrow turned it over but was apprehended by the owner before he could push the wheelbarrow away the court held that the defendant 's acts did not satisfy the asportation element of larceny because the movement of the wheelbarrow had merely been preparatory to the carrying away contrary to popular belief , it is not necessary that the property be removed from the owner 's premises or be taken off his property for an asportation to be complete however , if the thief conceals the steaks by sticking them inside clothing , his or her intent is rather clear the drafters noted that historically the asportation requirement distinguished larceny ( a felony ) and attempted larceny ( a misdemeanor ) they reasoned , therefore , that asportation was an irrelevant requirement because in modern criminal law , like the model penal code , ยง5.01 the sentencing consequences between an attempted and completed crime are negligible the subject matter of larceny has been tangible personal property , for example , one can steal a person 's social security card and use the information to obtain a credit card and make transactions however , using the social security number is not larceny because the information , although of substantial value , is not tangible personal property acts of common law larceny can not be committed against intangible things , such as love or affection , identity ( identity theft is a type of fraud ) , or intellectual property , such as information and ideas for example , if a person stole the coca-cola formula , the crime would be larceny but the grade of the offense would be determined by the value of the paper on which the formula was recorded not the value of the recipe however , the common law stated that if the severance and carrying away of a fixture were one continuous act , no larceny would occur the defendant 's actions in this example would thus merely constitute damage to real property , and would further not result in possession of stolen property since no larceny had taken place however , intent to steal includes other states of mind such as the intent to recklessly deprive the owner of the property permanently the chief impediment to conviction was the doctrine of possessorial immunity which said that a person who had acquired possession lawfully , that is with the consent of the owner , could not be prosecuted for larceny if a third party transfers possession of property to an employee for delivery to his employer , the employee has possession of the property and his conversion of the property would be embezzlement rather than larceny this rule does not apply if the teller intending to steal the property places the money in the till merely as a temporary repository or to hide his peculation the effect would be that the state could aggregate the value of the various items taken in determining whether the crime was a felony or misdemeanor

as with various other aspects of fish life , zoologists have developed empirical classifications for fish migrations two terms in particular have been in long-standing wide usage : anadromous fish migrate from the sea up ( greek : ἀνά aná , '' up '' and δρόμος drómos , '' course '' ) into fresh water to spawn , such as salmon , striped bass , moyle , p.b catadromous fish migrate from fresh water down ( greek : κατά kata , '' down '' and δρόμος dromos , '' course '' ) into the sea to spawn , such as eels tyus , h.m taylor and francis group , crc press , boca raton , london , new york myers coined the inclusive term diadromous to refer to all fish that migrate between the sea and fresh water diadromous proved a useful word , but terms proposed by myers for other types of diadromous fish did not catch on image : capelin-iceland.svg thumb right migration of icelandic capelin forage fish often make great migrations between their spawning , feeding and nursery grounds wide triangular journeys such as these may be important because forage fish , when feeding , can not distinguish their own offspring capelin are a forage fish of the smelt family found in the atlantic and arctic oceans the capelin move inshore in large schools to spawn and migrate in spring and summer to feed in plankton rich areas between iceland , greenland , and jan mayen the spawning migration starts north of iceland in december or january these high trophic level oceanodromous species undertake migrations of significant but variable distances across oceans for feeding , often on forage fish , or reproduction , and also have wide geographic distributions thus , these species are found both inside the 200 mile exclusive economic zones and in the high seas outside these zones they are pelagic species , which means they mostly live in the open ocean and do not live near the sea floor , although they may spend part of their life cycle in nearshore waters pacific fishery management council : background : highly migratory species highly migratory species can be compared with straddling stock and transboundary stock several pacific salmon ( chinook , coho and steelhead ) have been introduced into the us great lakes , and have become potamodromous , migrating between their natal waters to feeding grounds entirely within fresh water a number of large marine fishes , such as the tuna , migrate north and south annually , following temperature variations in the ocean because salmonids live an anadromous lifestyle , they encounter a larger range of viruses from both freshwater and marine ecosystems united nations : introduction to the convention on migratory species living north sea – international project on tackling fish migration problems in the north sea region fish migration network – worldwide network of specialist working on the theme fish migration

as with various other aspects of fish life , zoologists have developed empirical classifications for fish migrations two terms in particular have been in long-standing wide usage : anadromous fish migrate from the sea up ( greek : ἀνά aná , '' up '' and δρόμος drómos , '' course '' ) into fresh water to spawn , such as salmon , striped bass , moyle , p.b pearson benjamin cummings , san francisco , ca catadromous fish migrate from fresh water down ( greek : κατά kata , '' down '' and δρόμος dromos , '' course '' ) into the sea to spawn , such as eels tyus , h.m myers coined the inclusive term diadromous to refer to all fish that migrate between the sea and fresh water diadromous proved a useful word , but terms proposed by myers for other types of diadromous fish did not catch on these included amphidromous ( fish that migrate from fresh water to the seas , or vice versa , but not for the purpose of breeding ) , potamodromous ( fish whose migrations occur wholly within fresh water ) , and oceanodromous ( fish that live and migrate wholly in the sea ) image : capelin-iceland.svg thumb right migration of icelandic capelin forage fish often make great migrations between their spawning , feeding and nursery grounds wide triangular journeys such as these may be important because forage fish , when feeding , can not distinguish their own offspring the capelin move inshore in large schools to spawn and migrate in spring and summer to feed in plankton rich areas between iceland , greenland , and jan mayen the diagram on the right shows the main spawning grounds and larval drift routes in a paper published in 2009 , researchers from iceland recount their application of an interacting particle model to the capelin stock around iceland , successfully predicting the spawning migration route for 2008 barbaro1 a , einarsson b , birnir1 b , sigurðsson s , valdimarsson s , pálsson ók , sveinbjörnsson s and sigurðsson p ( 2009 ) '' modelling and simulations of the migration of pelagic fish '' journal of marine science , 66 ( 5 ) :826-838 the term highly migratory species ( hms ) has its origins in article 64 of the united nations convention on the law of the sea ( unclos ) the convention does not provide an operational definition of the term , but in an annex ( unclos annex 1 ) lists the species considered highly migratory by parties to the convention salmon are capable of going hundreds of kilometers upriver , and humans must install fish ladders in dams to enable the salmon to get past a number of large marine fishes , such as the tuna , migrate north and south annually , following temperature variations in the ocean sometimes fish can be dispersed by birds that eat fish eggs united nations : introduction to the convention on migratory species living north sea – international project on tackling fish migration problems in the north sea region fish migration network – worldwide network of specialist working on the theme fish migration

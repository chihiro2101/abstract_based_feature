as with various other aspects of fish life , zoologists have developed empirical classifications for fish migrations two terms in particular have been in long-standing wide usage : anadromous fish migrate from the sea up ( greek : ἀνά aná , '' up '' and δρόμος drómos , '' course '' ) into fresh water to spawn , such as salmon , striped bass , moyle , p.b the haematophagous feeding stage of anadromous populations of sea lamprey petromyzon marinus : low host selectivity and wide range of habitats catadromous fish migrate from fresh water down ( greek : κατά kata , '' down '' and δρόμος dromos , '' course '' ) into the sea to spawn , such as eels tyus , h.m myers coined the inclusive term diadromous to refer to all fish that migrate between the sea and fresh water diadromous proved a useful word , but terms proposed by myers for other types of diadromous fish did not catch on these included amphidromous ( fish that migrate from fresh water to the seas , or vice versa , but not for the purpose of breeding ) , potamodromous ( fish whose migrations occur wholly within fresh water ) , and oceanodromous ( fish that live and migrate wholly in the sea ) image : capelin-iceland.svg thumb right migration of icelandic capelin forage fish often make great migrations between their spawning , feeding and nursery grounds for example , one stock of herrings have their spawning ground in southern norway , their feeding ground in iceland , and their nursery ground in northern norway wide triangular journeys such as these may be important because forage fish , when feeding , can not distinguish their own offspring capelin are a forage fish of the smelt family found in the atlantic and arctic oceans the capelin move inshore in large schools to spawn and migrate in spring and summer to feed in plankton rich areas between iceland , greenland , and jan mayen around iceland maturing capelin make large northward feeding migrations in spring and summer these high trophic level oceanodromous species undertake migrations of significant but variable distances across oceans for feeding , often on forage fish , or reproduction , and also have wide geographic distributions it can be challenging to determine the population structure of highly migratory species using physical tagging traditional genetic markers such as short-range pcr products , microsatellites and snp-arrays have struggled to identify population structure and distinguish fish stocks from separate ocean basins specifically , lake nicaragua bull sharks migrate to the atlantic ocean and zambezi bull sharks migrate to the indian ocean the survival rate for fish eggs that have passed through a bird 's digestive tract is low ueda h and tsukamoto k ( eds ) ( 2013 ) physiology and ecology of fish migration crc press

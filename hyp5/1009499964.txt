as with various other aspects of fish life , zoologists have developed empirical classifications for fish migrations two terms in particular have been in long-standing wide usage : anadromous fish migrate from the sea up ( greek : ἀνά aná , '' up '' and δρόμος drómos , '' course '' ) into fresh water to spawn , such as salmon , striped bass , moyle , p.b the haematophagous feeding stage of anadromous populations of sea lamprey petromyzon marinus : low host selectivity and wide range of habitats catadromous fish migrate from fresh water down ( greek : κατά kata , '' down '' and δρόμος dromos , '' course '' ) into the sea to spawn , such as eels tyus , h.m myers coined the inclusive term diadromous to refer to all fish that migrate between the sea and fresh water these included amphidromous ( fish that migrate from fresh water to the seas , or vice versa , but not for the purpose of breeding ) , potamodromous ( fish whose migrations occur wholly within fresh water ) , and oceanodromous ( fish that live and migrate wholly in the sea ) image : capelin-iceland.svg thumb right migration of icelandic capelin forage fish often make great migrations between their spawning , feeding and nursery grounds wide triangular journeys such as these may be important because forage fish , when feeding , can not distinguish their own offspring the capelin move inshore in large schools to spawn and migrate in spring and summer to feed in plankton rich areas between iceland , greenland , and jan mayen the term highly migratory species ( hms ) has its origins in article 64 of the united nations convention on the law of the sea ( unclos ) the convention does not provide an operational definition of the term , but in an annex ( unclos annex 1 ) lists the species considered highly migratory by parties to the convention they are pelagic species , which means they mostly live in the open ocean and do not live near the sea floor , although they may spend part of their life cycle in nearshore waters pacific fishery management council : background : highly migratory species highly migratory species can be compared with straddling stock and transboundary stock similar population genomics methods have also provided improved insight towards population structure in striped marlin other examples of anadromous fishes are sea trout , three-spined stickleback , sea lamprey and shad both these habitats are fresh water , yet bull sharks will also migrate to and from the ocean , malden , ma colorado pikeminnow migrations also display a high degree of homing and the fish may make upstream or downstream migrations to reach very specific spawning locations in whitewater canyons the number of mx genes can differ among species of fish , with numbers ranging from 1-9 and some outliers like gadiformes that have totally lost their mx genes united nations : introduction to the convention on migratory species living north sea – international project on tackling fish migration problems in the north sea region fish migration network – worldwide network of specialist working on the theme fish migration

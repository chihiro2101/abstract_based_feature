as with various other aspects of fish life , zoologists have developed empirical classifications for fish migrations two terms in particular have been in long-standing wide usage : anadromous fish migrate from the sea up ( greek : ἀνά aná , '' up '' and δρόμος drómos , '' course '' ) into fresh water to spawn , such as salmon , striped bass , moyle , p.b and the sea lamprey silva , s the haematophagous feeding stage of anadromous populations of sea lamprey petromyzon marinus : low host selectivity and wide range of habitats catadromous fish migrate from fresh water down ( greek : κατά kata , '' down '' and δρόμος dromos , '' course '' ) into the sea to spawn , such as eels tyus , h.m myers coined the inclusive term diadromous to refer to all fish that migrate between the sea and fresh water like the two well known terms , it was formed from classical greek ( dia , '' through '' ; and dromous , '' running '' ) diadromous proved a useful word , but terms proposed by myers for other types of diadromous fish did not catch on these included amphidromous ( fish that migrate from fresh water to the seas , or vice versa , but not for the purpose of breeding ) , potamodromous ( fish whose migrations occur wholly within fresh water ) , and oceanodromous ( fish that live and migrate wholly in the sea ) image : capelin-iceland.svg thumb right migration of icelandic capelin forage fish often make great migrations between their spawning , feeding and nursery grounds capelin are a forage fish of the smelt family found in the atlantic and arctic oceans the capelin move inshore in large schools to spawn and migrate in spring and summer to feed in plankton rich areas between iceland , greenland , and jan mayen capelin on the way to feeding grounds is coloured green , capelin on the way back is blue , and the breeding grounds are red barbaro1 a , einarsson b , birnir1 b , sigurðsson s , valdimarsson s , pálsson ók , sveinbjörnsson s and sigurðsson p ( 2009 ) '' modelling and simulations of the migration of pelagic fish '' journal of marine science , 66 ( 5 ) :826-838 the term highly migratory species ( hms ) has its origins in article 64 of the united nations convention on the law of the sea ( unclos ) pacific fishery management council : background : highly migratory species highly migratory species can be compared with straddling stock and transboundary stock freshwater ( potamodromous ) fish migrations are usually shorter , typically from lake to stream or vice versa , for spawning purposes sometimes fish can be dispersed by birds that eat fish eggs the number of mx genes can differ among species of fish , with numbers ranging from 1-9 and some outliers like gadiformes that have totally lost their mx genes

as with various other aspects of fish life , zoologists have developed empirical classifications for fish migrations two terms in particular have been in long-standing wide usage : anadromous fish migrate from the sea up ( greek : ἀνά aná , '' up '' and δρόμος drómos , '' course '' ) into fresh water to spawn , such as salmon , striped bass , moyle , p.b the haematophagous feeding stage of anadromous populations of sea lamprey petromyzon marinus : low host selectivity and wide range of habitats catadromous fish migrate from fresh water down ( greek : κατά kata , '' down '' and δρόμος dromos , '' course '' ) into the sea to spawn , such as eels tyus , h.m taylor and francis group , crc press , boca raton , london , new york myers coined the inclusive term diadromous to refer to all fish that migrate between the sea and fresh water diadromous proved a useful word , but terms proposed by myers for other types of diadromous fish did not catch on these included amphidromous ( fish that migrate from fresh water to the seas , or vice versa , but not for the purpose of breeding ) , potamodromous ( fish whose migrations occur wholly within fresh water ) , and oceanodromous ( fish that live and migrate wholly in the sea ) image : capelin-iceland.svg thumb right migration of icelandic capelin forage fish often make great migrations between their spawning , feeding and nursery grounds for example , one stock of herrings have their spawning ground in southern norway , their feeding ground in iceland , and their nursery ground in northern norway around iceland maturing capelin make large northward feeding migrations in spring and summer barbaro1 a , einarsson b , birnir1 b , sigurðsson s , valdimarsson s , pálsson ók , sveinbjörnsson s and sigurðsson p ( 2009 ) '' modelling and simulations of the migration of pelagic fish '' journal of marine science , 66 ( 5 ) :826-838 pacific fishery management council : background : highly migratory species highly migratory species can be compared with straddling stock and transboundary stock traditional genetic markers such as short-range pcr products , microsatellites and snp-arrays have struggled to identify population structure and distinguish fish stocks from separate ocean basins several pacific salmon ( chinook , coho and steelhead ) have been introduced into the us great lakes , and have become potamodromous , migrating between their natal waters to feeding grounds entirely within fresh water both these habitats are fresh water , yet bull sharks will also migrate to and from the ocean specifically , lake nicaragua bull sharks migrate to the atlantic ocean and zambezi bull sharks migrate to the indian ocean , malden , ma colorado pikeminnow migrations also display a high degree of homing and the fish may make upstream or downstream migrations to reach very specific spawning locations in whitewater canyons they also concluded that the trout mx genes were “ differentially expressed constitutively in tissues ” and that this expression is increased during development

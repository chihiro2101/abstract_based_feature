the data link provides for the transfer of data frames between hosts connected to the physical link within the semantics of the osi network architecture , the protocols of the data link layer respond to service requests from the network layer , and perform their function by issuing service requests to the physical layer that transfer can be reliable or unreliable ; many data link protocols do not have acknowledgments of successful frame reception and acceptance , and some data link protocols might not even perform any check for transmission errors in contrast to the hierarchical and routable addresses of the network layer , layer 2 addresses are flat , meaning that no part of the address can be used to identify the logical or physical group to which the address belongs in some networks , such as ieee 802 local area networks , the data link layer is described in more detail with media access control ( mac ) and logical link control ( llc ) sublayers ; this means that the ieee 802.2 llc protocol can be used with all of the ieee 802 mac layers , such as ethernet , token ring , ieee 802.11 , etc other data-link-layer protocols , such as hdlc , are specified to include both sublayers , although some other protocols , such as cisco hdlc , use hdlc 's low-level framing as a mac layer in combination with a different llc layer in the itu-t g.hn standard , which provides a way to create a high-speed ( up to 1 gigabit/s ) local area network using existing home wiring ( power lines , phone lines and coaxial cables ) , the data link layer is divided into three sub-layers ( application protocol convergence , logical link control and media access control ) the data link layer has two sublayers : logical link control ( llc ) and media access control ( mac ) the uppermost sublayer , llc , multiplexes protocols running at the top of the data link layer , and optionally provides flow control , acknowledgment , and error notification mac may refer to the sublayer that determines who is allowed to access the media at any one time ( e.g the media access control sublayer also performs frame synchronization , which determines the start and end of each frame of data in the transmission bitstream data-link-layer flow control is not used in lan protocols such as ethernet , but in modems and wireless networks in the medium access control ( mac ) sublayer : multiple access methods for channel-access control , for example csma/cd protocols for collision detection and re-transmission in ethernet bus networks and hub networks , or the csma/ca protocol for collision avoidance in wireless networks the tcp/ip link layer has the operating scope of the link a host is connected to , and only concerns itself with hardware issues to the point of obtaining hardware ( mac ) addresses for locating hosts on the link and transmitting data frames onto the link

the data link provides for the transfer of data frames between hosts connected to the physical link within the semantics of the osi network architecture , the protocols of the data link layer respond to service requests from the network layer , and perform their function by issuing service requests to the physical layer that transfer can be reliable or unreliable ; many data link protocols do not have acknowledgments of successful frame reception and acceptance , and some data link protocols might not even perform any check for transmission errors in those cases , higher-level protocols must provide flow control , error checking , acknowledgments , and retransmission the frame header contains the source and destination addresses that indicate which device originated the frame and which device is expected to receive and process it in contrast to the hierarchical and routable addresses of the network layer , layer 2 addresses are flat , meaning that no part of the address can be used to identify the logical or physical group to which the address belongs other data-link-layer protocols , such as hdlc , are specified to include both sublayers , although some other protocols , such as cisco hdlc , use hdlc 's low-level framing as a mac layer in combination with a different llc layer the data link layer has two sublayers : logical link control ( llc ) and media access control ( mac ) the uppermost sublayer , llc , multiplexes protocols running at the top of the data link layer , and optionally provides flow control , acknowledgment , and error notification the llc provides addressing and control of the data link there are generally two forms of media access control : distributed and centralized more sophisticated error detection and correction algorithms are designed to reduce the risk that multiple transmission errors in the data would cancel each other out and go undetected in the internet protocol suite ( tcp/ip ) , osi 's data link layer functionality is contained within its lowest layer , the link layer datalink layer simulation , written in c datalink layer , part 2 : error detection and correction de : osi-modell schicht 2 â€“ sicherungsschicht

the data link provides for the transfer of data frames between hosts connected to the physical link within the semantics of the osi network architecture , the protocols of the data link layer respond to service requests from the network layer , and perform their function by issuing service requests to the physical layer the frame header contains the source and destination addresses that indicate which device originated the frame and which device is expected to receive and process it other data-link-layer protocols , such as hdlc , are specified to include both sublayers , although some other protocols , such as cisco hdlc , use hdlc 's low-level framing as a mac layer in combination with a different llc layer in the itu-t g.hn standard , which provides a way to create a high-speed ( up to 1 gigabit/s ) local area network using existing home wiring ( power lines , phone lines and coaxial cables ) , the data link layer is divided into three sub-layers ( application protocol convergence , logical link control and media access control ) the data link layer has two sublayers : logical link control ( llc ) and media access control ( mac ) . logical link control sublayer the llc provides addressing and control of the data link mac may refer to the sublayer that determines who is allowed to access the media at any one time ( e.g the media access control sublayer also performs frame synchronization , which determines the start and end of each frame of data in the transmission bitstream it entails one of several methods : timing-based detection , character counting , byte stuffing , and bit stuffing in addition to framing , the data link layer may also perform mechanisms to detect and recover from transmission errors for a receiver to detect transmission errors , the sender must add redundant information as an error detection code to the frame sent datalink layer simulation , written in c datalink layer , part 2 : error detection and correction de : osi-modell schicht 2 â€“ sicherungsschicht

the data link provides for the transfer of data frames between hosts connected to the physical link within the semantics of the osi network architecture , the protocols of the data link layer respond to service requests from the network layer , and perform their function by issuing service requests to the physical layer that transfer can be reliable or unreliable ; many data link protocols do not have acknowledgments of successful frame reception and acceptance , and some data link protocols might not even perform any check for transmission errors in those cases , higher-level protocols must provide flow control , error checking , acknowledgments , and retransmission in contrast to the hierarchical and routable addresses of the network layer , layer 2 addresses are flat , meaning that no part of the address can be used to identify the logical or physical group to which the address belongs other data-link-layer protocols , such as hdlc , are specified to include both sublayers , although some other protocols , such as cisco hdlc , use hdlc 's low-level framing as a mac layer in combination with a different llc layer the data link layer has two sublayers : logical link control ( llc ) and media access control ( mac ) . logical link control sublayer the uppermost sublayer , llc , multiplexes protocols running at the top of the data link layer , and optionally provides flow control , acknowledgment , and error notification the llc provides addressing and control of the data link the media access control sublayer also performs frame synchronization , which determines the start and end of each frame of data in the transmission bitstream in addition to framing , the data link layer may also perform mechanisms to detect and recover from transmission errors in the internet protocol suite ( tcp/ip ) , osi 's data link layer functionality is contained within its lowest layer , the link layer in particular , tcp/ip does not dictate a strict hierarchical sequence of encapsulation requirements , as is attributed to osi protocols

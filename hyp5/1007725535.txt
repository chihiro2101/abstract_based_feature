the data link provides for the transfer of data frames between hosts connected to the physical link within the semantics of the osi network architecture , the protocols of the data link layer respond to service requests from the network layer , and perform their function by issuing service requests to the physical layer that transfer can be reliable or unreliable ; many data link protocols do not have acknowledgments of successful frame reception and acceptance , and some data link protocols might not even perform any check for transmission errors the frame header contains the source and destination addresses that indicate which device originated the frame and which device is expected to receive and process it in contrast to the hierarchical and routable addresses of the network layer , layer 2 addresses are flat , meaning that no part of the address can be used to identify the logical or physical group to which the address belongs the data link layer has two sublayers : logical link control ( llc ) and media access control ( mac ) the uppermost sublayer , llc , multiplexes protocols running at the top of the data link layer , and optionally provides flow control , acknowledgment , and error notification the llc provides addressing and control of the data link mac may refer to the sublayer that determines who is allowed to access the media at any one time ( e.g the media access control sublayer also performs frame synchronization , which determines the start and end of each frame of data in the transmission bitstream similarly , bit stuffing replaces these start and end marks with flags consisting of a special bit pattern ( e.g in addition to framing , the data link layer may also perform mechanisms to detect and recover from transmission errors when the receiver obtains a frame with an error detection code it recomputes it and verifies whether the received error detection code matches the computed error detection code in the internet protocol suite ( tcp/ip ) , osi 's data link layer functionality is contained within its lowest layer , the link layer

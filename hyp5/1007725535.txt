the data link provides for the transfer of data frames between hosts connected to the physical link within the semantics of the osi network architecture , the protocols of the data link layer respond to service requests from the network layer , and perform their function by issuing service requests to the physical layer that transfer can be reliable or unreliable ; many data link protocols do not have acknowledgments of successful frame reception and acceptance , and some data link protocols might not even perform any check for transmission errors in contrast to the hierarchical and routable addresses of the network layer , layer 2 addresses are flat , meaning that no part of the address can be used to identify the logical or physical group to which the address belongs other data-link-layer protocols , such as hdlc , are specified to include both sublayers , although some other protocols , such as cisco hdlc , use hdlc 's low-level framing as a mac layer in combination with a different llc layer the data link layer has two sublayers : logical link control ( llc ) and media access control ( mac ) . logical link control sublayer the uppermost sublayer , llc , multiplexes protocols running at the top of the data link layer , and optionally provides flow control , acknowledgment , and error notification the llc provides addressing and control of the data link it specifies which mechanisms are to be used for addressing stations over the transmission medium and for controlling the data exchanged between the originator and recipient machines mac may refer to the sublayer that determines who is allowed to access the media at any one time ( e.g in addition to framing , the data link layer may also perform mechanisms to detect and recover from transmission errors the link-layer functionality was described in rfc 1122 and is defined differently than the data link layer of osi , and encompasses all methods that affect the local link in particular , tcp/ip does not dictate a strict hierarchical sequence of encapsulation requirements , as is attributed to osi protocols

the original intent was a single standard for all buses in the computer the working group soon came up with the idea of using point-to-point communication in the form of insertion rings the use of insertion rings is credited to manolis katevenis who suggested it at one of the early meetings of the working group the working group for developing the standard was led by david b stein gjessing â€™ s group at the university of oslo used formal methods to verify the coherence protocol and dolphin server technology implemented a node controller chip including the cache coherence logic dolphin interconnect solutions implemented a pci and pci-express connected derivative of sci that provides non-coherent shared memory access this implementation was used by sun microsystems for its high-end clusters , thales group and several others including volume applications for message passing within hpc clustering and medical imaging it was also used by sequent computer systems as the processor memory bus in their numa-q systems scalability for large systems is achieved through a distributed directory-based cache coherence model ) in sci each node contains a directory with a pointer to the next node in a linked list that shares a particular cache line in distributed switching systems , each node can be connected to a ring of arbitrary length and either all or some of the nodes can be connected to two or more rings instead , sci uses a distributed directory-based cache coherence protocol with a linked list of nodes containing processors that share a particular cache line each node holds a directory for the main memory of the node with a tag for each line of memory ( same line length as the cache line ) gustavson led a group called the scalable coherent interface and serial express users , developers , and manufacturers association and maintained a web site for the technology starting in 1996

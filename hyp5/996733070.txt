soon after the fastbus ( ieee 960 ) follow-on futurebus ( ieee 896 ) project in 1987 , some engineers predicted it would already be too slow for the high performance computing marketplace by the time it would be released in the early 1990s another working group of the standards association of the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ( ieee ) spun off to form a standard targeted at this market in july 1988 it was essentially a subset of futurebus features that could be easily implemented at high speed , along with minor additions to make it easier to connect to other systems , such as vmebus the use of insertion rings is credited to manolis katevenis who suggested it at one of the early meetings of the working group stein gjessing ’ s group at the university of oslo used formal methods to verify the coherence protocol and dolphin server technology implemented a node controller chip including the cache coherence logic dolphin interconnect solutions implemented a pci and pci-express connected derivative of sci that provides non-coherent shared memory access this implementation was used by sun microsystems for its high-end clusters , thales group and several others including volume applications for message passing within hpc clustering and medical imaging sci was often used to implement non-uniform memory access architectures scalability for large systems is achieved through a distributed directory-based cache coherence model ( the other popular models for cache coherency are based on system-wide eavesdropping ( snooping ) of memory transactions – a scheme which is not very scalable ) in sci each node contains a directory with a pointer to the next node in a linked list that shares a particular cache line instead , sci uses a distributed directory-based cache coherence protocol with a linked list of nodes containing processors that share a particular cache line gustavson led a group called the scalable coherent interface and serial express users , developers , and manufacturers association and maintained a web site for the technology starting in 1996 dolphin interconnect solutions list of device bandwidths numalink quickring hippi ieee 1355 rapidio myrinet qsnet futurebus infiniband

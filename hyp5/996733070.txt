another working group of the standards association of the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ( ieee ) spun off to form a standard targeted at this market in july 1988 the working group soon came up with the idea of using point-to-point communication in the form of insertion rings the use of insertion rings is credited to manolis katevenis who suggested it at one of the early meetings of the working group stein gjessing â€™ s group at the university of oslo used formal methods to verify the coherence protocol and dolphin server technology implemented a node controller chip including the cache coherence logic different versions and derivatives of sci were implemented by companies like dolphin interconnect solutions , convex , data general aviion ( using cache controller and link controller chips from dolphin ) , sequent and cray research sci was often used to implement non-uniform memory access architectures it was also used by sequent computer systems as the processor memory bus in their numa-q systems ) in sci each node contains a directory with a pointer to the next node in a linked list that shares a particular cache line sci defines a 64-bit flat address space ( 16 exabytes ) where 16 bits are used for identifying a node ( 65,536 nodes ) and 48 bits for address within the node ( 256 terabytes ) in distributed switching systems , each node can be connected to a ring of arbitrary length and either all or some of the nodes can be connected to two or more rings a packet contains a header with address command and status information , payload ( from 0 through optional lengths of data ) and a crc check symbol the simplest form applied in earlier systems was based on clearing the cache contents between context switches and disabling the cache for data that were shared between two or more processors each node holds a directory for the main memory of the node with a tag for each line of memory ( same line length as the cache line ) sci is a standard for connecting the different resources within a multiprocessor computer system , and it is not as widely known to the public as for example the ethernet family for connecting different systems

soon after the fastbus ( ieee 960 ) follow-on futurebus ( ieee 896 ) project in 1987 , some engineers predicted it would already be too slow for the high performance computing marketplace by the time it would be released in the early 1990s another working group of the standards association of the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ( ieee ) spun off to form a standard targeted at this market in july 1988 most of the developers had their background from high-speed computer buses stein gjessing ’ s group at the university of oslo used formal methods to verify the coherence protocol and dolphin server technology implemented a node controller chip including the cache coherence logic different versions and derivatives of sci were implemented by companies like dolphin interconnect solutions , convex , data general aviion ( using cache controller and link controller chips from dolphin ) , sequent and cray research dolphin interconnect solutions implemented a pci and pci-express connected derivative of sci that provides non-coherent shared memory access sci was often used to implement non-uniform memory access architectures it was also used by sequent computer systems as the processor memory bus in their numa-q systems ) in sci each node contains a directory with a pointer to the next node in a linked list that shares a particular cache line in distributed switching systems , each node can be connected to a ring of arbitrary length and either all or some of the nodes can be connected to two or more rings instead , sci uses a distributed directory-based cache coherence protocol with a linked list of nodes containing processors that share a particular cache line each node holds a directory for the main memory of the node with a tag for each line of memory ( same line length as the cache line ) the overhead for the directory based cache coherence is a constant percentage of the node ’ s memory and cache gustavson led a group called the scalable coherent interface and serial express users , developers , and manufacturers association and maintained a web site for the technology starting in 1996

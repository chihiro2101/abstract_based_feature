soon after the fastbus ( ieee 960 ) follow-on futurebus ( ieee 896 ) project in 1987 , some engineers predicted it would already be too slow for the high performance computing marketplace by the time it would be released in the early 1990s in response , a '' superbus '' study group was formed in november 1987 another working group of the standards association of the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ( ieee ) spun off to form a standard targeted at this market in july 1988 the original intent was a single standard for all buses in the computer the working group for developing the standard was led by david b dolphin interconnect solutions implemented a pci and pci-express connected derivative of sci that provides non-coherent shared memory access it was also used by sequent computer systems as the processor memory bus in their numa-q systems scalability for large systems is achieved through a distributed directory-based cache coherence model ( the other popular models for cache coherency are based on system-wide eavesdropping ( snooping ) of memory transactions â€“ a scheme which is not very scalable ) in sci each node contains a directory with a pointer to the next node in a linked list that shares a particular cache line the simplest form applied in earlier systems was based on clearing the cache contents between context switches and disabling the cache for data that were shared between two or more processors modern systems with point-to point links use broadcast methods with snoop filter options to improve performance each node holds a directory for the main memory of the node with a tag for each line of memory ( same line length as the cache line ) gustavson led a group called the scalable coherent interface and serial express users , developers , and manufacturers association and maintained a web site for the technology starting in 1996

soon after the fastbus ( ieee 960 ) follow-on futurebus ( ieee 896 ) project in 1987 , some engineers predicted it would already be too slow for the high performance computing marketplace by the time it would be released in the early 1990s another working group of the standards association of the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ( ieee ) spun off to form a standard targeted at this market in july 1988 most of the developers had their background from high-speed computer buses this avoided the lumped capacitance , limited physical length/speed of light problems and stub reflections in addition to allowing parallel transactions the use of insertion rings is credited to manolis katevenis who suggested it at one of the early meetings of the working group dolphin interconnect solutions implemented a pci and pci-express connected derivative of sci that provides non-coherent shared memory access it was also used by sequent computer systems as the processor memory bus in their numa-q systems scalability for large systems is achieved through a distributed directory-based cache coherence model ( the other popular models for cache coherency are based on system-wide eavesdropping ( snooping ) of memory transactions â€“ a scheme which is not very scalable sci can be used to build systems with different types of switching topologies from centralized to fully distributed switching : with a central switch , each node is connected to the switch with a ringlet ( in this case a two-node ring ) each node holds a directory for the main memory of the node with a tag for each line of memory ( same line length as the cache line ) sci is a standard for connecting the different resources within a multiprocessor computer system , and it is not as widely known to the public as for example the ethernet family for connecting different systems these different implementations interface to very intricate mechanisms in processors and memory systems and each vendor has to preserve some degrees of compatibility for both hardware and software gustavson led a group called the scalable coherent interface and serial express users , developers , and manufacturers association and maintained a web site for the technology starting in 1996

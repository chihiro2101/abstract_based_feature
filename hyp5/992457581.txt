john hobson , a geneticist involved in a project concerned with manipulating dna , awakes in his hotel room in thames , new zealand , after a nightmare of falling from a great height hobson checks the time in his car , finding the vehicle 's clock is also frozen at 6:12 investigating a car sitting at an intersection , hobson sees that the driver 's seatbelt is still fastened hobson concludes that some force has altered the clocks to show the same time and then stopped them , suggesting an intelligence behind the event , which hobson dubs '' the effect '' during the night , hobson hears sounds from outside approaching hobson travels to the research unit , where he worked to reactivate dormant genes in humans and animals using high-frequency sound waves and radiation hobson finds perrin in a radiation chamber , dead at the controls of the sound wave machine hobson decides he perished before the effect – as dead animal tissue did not vanish hobson retrieves perrin 's papers , then begins journeying to wellington , hoping to find survivors or clues as to what happened hobson reaches an area of bushland near turangi , his path blocked by a truck the gunman is apirana maketu , a māori and a lance-corporal in the new zealand army api heard the same sound that hobson heard – albeit earlier in the day and coming from the side of the lake that hobson was standing on believing it to be a car , api laid the roadblock to catch anyone coming south the soldier is both relieved and worried to find that hobson has experienced the same dread hobson plans to run tests to see if he can determine the nature of the effect and the reason why he and api survived visiting the beehive , api speculates that they could be lab rats on some kind of duplicate earth ; it is they who disappeared perrin believed that hobson 's dna was altered due to radiation , which caused his child 's autism perrin charges hobson with negligence , as the sample slides for insects and animals in the machine are blank , while the ones for plants are normal the idea was to put the machine out of action temporarily , ruining perrin 's chance to use hobson 's theories as he reads perrin 's notes , hobson realises that this sabotage almost certainly caused the effect perhaps the rest of humanity evolved , or is unchanged and wondering where hobson and a handful of others have gone to

john hobson , a geneticist involved in a project concerned with manipulating dna , awakes in his hotel room in thames , new zealand , after a nightmare of falling from a great height hobson checks the time in his car , finding the vehicle 's clock is also frozen at 6:12 investigating a car sitting at an intersection , hobson sees that the driver 's seatbelt is still fastened hobson concludes that some force has altered the clocks to show the same time and then stopped them , suggesting an intelligence behind the event , which hobson dubs '' the effect '' hobson wonders if he has gone mad , but dismisses the idea hobson reassures himself that he can keep the entity at bay with mental effort the next morning hobson procures weapons and supplies , and leaves for auckland , finding the city deserted the machine appears to have short-circuited , but there is no evidence indicating how perrin died hobson decides he perished before the effect – as dead animal tissue did not vanish en route to rotorua , hobson sees a creature in his headlights back-tracking , he finds the alternate route also cut off the gunman is apirana maketu , a māori and a lance-corporal in the new zealand army api heard the same sound that hobson heard – albeit earlier in the day and coming from the side of the lake that hobson was standing on api and hobson set up dwellings in a hotel and hunt for survivors hobson plans to run tests to see if he can determine the nature of the effect and the reason why he and api survived hobson believes that api is a psychopath she is taken to the hotel and made comfortable , but neither api nor hobson are medically trained breaking open perrin 's box , hobson realises his colleagues considered him unbalanced and kept him under surveillance this event cements for hobson his long-growing misgivings about the experiments , and what he believes are perrin 's motives for pursuing them perhaps hobson caused the effect , or is dreaming all this in a barbiturate coma , or is in hell or purgatory perhaps the rest of humanity evolved , or is unchanged and wondering where hobson and a handful of others have gone to

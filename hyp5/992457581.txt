john hobson , a geneticist involved in a project concerned with manipulating dna , awakes in his hotel room in thames , new zealand , after a nightmare of falling from a great height it is quiet outside , with nobody in sight hobson checks the time in his car , finding the vehicle 's clock is also frozen at 6:12 investigating a car sitting at an intersection , hobson sees that the driver 's seatbelt is still fastened a garden yields the first sign of life hobson has found – a worm dug up from the soil hobson wills the entity to leave , and the sounds retreat the next morning hobson procures weapons and supplies , and leaves for auckland , finding the city deserted the unit 's head , perrin , believed that awakening the dormant genes would lead to a quantum leap in evolution hobson finds perrin in a radiation chamber , dead at the controls of the sound wave machine hobson decides he perished before the effect – as dead animal tissue did not vanish at rotorua , after realising everyone else is dead , hobson almost commits suicide when he comes across live fish in a stream , hobson concludes that the effect did not penetrate water he is startled when an electronic howling noise booms out across lake taupo from the far side hobson reaches an area of bushland near turangi , his path blocked by a truck the gunman is apirana maketu , a māori and a lance-corporal in the new zealand army he remained at his post for two days before setting out to find survivors api heard the same sound that hobson heard – albeit earlier in the day and coming from the side of the lake that hobson was standing on a radio transceiver is set up , and the duo transmit words and morse code across the world three weeks after the effect , hobson is left alone while api goes to get a new car the idea was to put the machine out of action temporarily , ruining perrin 's chance to use hobson 's theories recovering from the nightmare of falling , all he can remember of the dream he was ripped from , he notices that his wrist watch has stopped at 6:12

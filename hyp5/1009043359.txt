in the roman britain period , the area of modern kent that lay east of the river medway was a civitas known as cantiaca during the late third and fourth centuries , roman britain had been raided repeatedly by franks , saxons , picts , and scoti it is also likely that germanic-speaking mercenaries from northern gaul , known as foederati , would have been hired to supplement official roman troops during this period , with land in kent as payment there is evidence that over the fourth and early fifth centuries , rural villas were abandoned , suggesting that the romano-british elite were moving to the comparative safety of fortified urban centres however , urban centres also witnessed decline ; canterbury evidenced a declining population and reduced activity from the late third century onward , while dover was abandoned by the end of the fourth century according to the anglo-saxon chronicle , produced in late anglo-saxon england and not considered an accurate record of events in the fifth century , in 418 many romans left britain via kent , taking much of their wealth with them currently , many scholars accept that there was significant regional variation , with the former view being more applicable in the south and east and the latter in the north and west 173-174 in kent , archaeological and historical evidence suggests that a large-scale immigration of germanic peoples did indeed take place 24 however , some of the romano-british population likely remained , as the roman name for the area , cantiaca , influenced the name of the new anglo-saxon kingdom , the cantware ( '' dwellers of kent '' ) in east kent , fifth century cemeteries mostly comprise solely of inhumation burials , with a distinct kentish character this may suggest that west kent at this point was independent of east kent , and part of the kingdom of essex north of the thames estuary in the sixth century the kingdom of kent had some relationship with the merovingian-governed kingdom of francia , which was then extending its influence in northwestern europe textual sources suggest that kent may have been under merovingian control for part of this century archeological evidence of frankish material culture from this period has been found in kent , but not in other areas of lowland britain , suggesting a trade monopoly with the frankish kingdom they are relatively absent between the sein and the somme across the english channel from the saxons in sussex , suggesting that trade was established between particular tribal or ethnic groups rather than by geography archaeological evidence suggests that at some point in the sixth century , east kent annexed west kent firmly in the control of an elite class , kent is the first anglo-saxon kingdom to appear in the historical record in 597 the anglo-saxon chronicle refers to wars in sixth-century britain , but most were in the west and did not affect kent ; the one exception was a battle between the kentish and west saxons in 568 , during which æthelberht 's forces were pushed back into kent according to bede , the christianization of anglo-saxon england began in kent under æthelberht 's reign when the benedictine monk augustine arrived on the ebbsfleet peninsula in 597 , bringing the gregorian mission with him various seventh and eighth century documents attest to the fact that kent was governed by two kings , a dominant one in the east and a subordinate in the west , likely reflecting the earlier divide middle and late anglo-saxon kent in the seventh century , kent 's power waned as that of mercia and northumbria grew , but it remained the fourth wealthiest kingdom in england , according to the tribal hidage with 15,000 hides of land recorded in the seventh or eighth century this suggests that from the seventh century onward , kings in kent were establishing control over the kingdom 's economic structure the anglo-saxon chronicle records that kent was first attacked by viking raiders in the late eighth century alfred had defeated guthrum the old and allowed vikings by treaty to settle in east anglia and the north east

in the roman britain period , the area of modern kent that lay east of the river medway was a civitas known as cantiaca during the late third and fourth centuries , roman britain had been raided repeatedly by franks , saxons , picts , and scoti it is also likely that germanic-speaking mercenaries from northern gaul , known as foederati , would have been hired to supplement official roman troops during this period , with land in kent as payment there is evidence that over the fourth and early fifth centuries , rural villas were abandoned , suggesting that the romano-british elite were moving to the comparative safety of fortified urban centres however , urban centres also witnessed decline ; canterbury evidenced a declining population and reduced activity from the late third century onward , while dover was abandoned by the end of the fourth century in 407 , the roman legions left britain in order to deal with incursions into the empire 's continental heartlands according to the anglo-saxon chronicle , produced in late anglo-saxon england and not considered an accurate record of events in the fifth century , in 418 many romans left britain via kent , taking much of their wealth with them according to archaeologist martin welch , the fifth century witnessed '' a radical transformation of what became kent , politically , socially and in terms of physical landscape '' 24 however , some of the romano-british population likely remained , as the roman name for the area , cantiaca , influenced the name of the new anglo-saxon kingdom , the cantware ( '' dwellers of kent '' ) according to the chronicle , in 455 hengist and horsa fought vortigern at ægelesthrep ( probably aylesford in kent ) , in which battle horsa was killed a similar account is provided in bede 's ecclesiastical history : that the people of kent and isle of wight were descended from jutish settlers , and that horsa was killed in battle against the britons , adding that his body was buried in east kent this may suggest that west kent at this point was independent of east kent , and part of the kingdom of essex north of the thames estuary in the sixth century the kingdom of kent had some relationship with the merovingian-governed kingdom of francia , which was then extending its influence in northwestern europe archaeological evidence suggests that at some point in the sixth century , east kent annexed west kent the monk bede refers to kent as ruled by æthelberht at this period , making him the earliest reliably attested anglo-saxon monarch the anglo-saxon chronicle refers to wars in sixth-century britain , but most were in the west and did not affect kent ; the one exception was a battle between the kentish and west saxons in 568 , during which æthelberht 's forces were pushed back into kent in the seventh century , kent 's power waned as that of mercia and northumbria grew , but it remained the fourth wealthiest kingdom in england , according to the tribal hidage with 15,000 hides of land recorded in the seventh or eighth century in the late seventh century , kent gradually came to be dominated by mercia the loss of lundenwic probably broke kent 's monopoly on cross-channel trade and its control of the thames , eroding its economic influence according to bede 's later account , in 676 the mercian king æthelred i led an attack that destroyed many kentish churches in 686 kent was conquered by cædwalla of wessex ; within a year , cædwalla 's brother mul was killed in a kentish revolt , and cædwalla returned to devastate the kingdom again this suggests that from the seventh century onward , kings in kent were establishing control over the kingdom 's economic structure the anglo-saxon chronicle records that kent was first attacked by viking raiders in the late eighth century as many as 350 viking ships sailed from boulogne to the south coast of kent in 892 kings of kent kentish royal legend white horse of kent

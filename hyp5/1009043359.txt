in the roman britain period , the area of modern kent that lay east of the river medway was a civitas known as cantiaca as the closest part of britain to mainland europe , it is likely that kent would have experienced many attacks from seafaring raiders , resulting in the construction of four saxon shore along the kentish coast : regulbium , rutupiae , dubris , and portus lemanis it is also likely that germanic-speaking mercenaries from northern gaul , known as foederati , would have been hired to supplement official roman troops during this period , with land in kent as payment however , urban centres also witnessed decline ; canterbury evidenced a declining population and reduced activity from the late third century onward , while dover was abandoned by the end of the fourth century in 410 , the roman emperor honorius sent a letter to his british subjects announcing that they must thenceforth look after their own defence and could no longer rely on the imperial military to protect them according to the anglo-saxon chronicle , produced in late anglo-saxon england and not considered an accurate record of events in the fifth century , in 418 many romans left britain via kent , taking much of their wealth with them according to archaeologist martin welch , the fifth century witnessed '' a radical transformation of what became kent , politically , socially and in terms of physical landscape '' 173-174 in kent , archaeological and historical evidence suggests that a large-scale immigration of germanic peoples did indeed take place stuart brookes and susan harrington , the kingdom and people of kent , ad 400-600 ( 2010 ) , p 24 however , some of the romano-british population likely remained , as the roman name for the area , cantiaca , influenced the name of the new anglo-saxon kingdom , the cantware ( '' dwellers of kent '' ) the germanic migration to britain is noted in textual sources from the late anglo-saxon period , most notably bede 's ecclesiastical history of the english people and the anglo-saxon chronicle ; both rely on oral history from the fifth century , and were attempts to establish origin myths that would justify the politics of the time a similar account is provided in bede 's ecclesiastical history : that the people of kent and isle of wight were descended from jutish settlers , and that horsa was killed in battle against the britons , adding that his body was buried in east kent little archaeological evidence of these early settlements exists , but one prominent example is a grubenhaus at lower warbank , keston that was built atop the site of a former roman villa , adjacent to a romano-british trackway through the north downs in east kent , fifth century cemeteries mostly comprise solely of inhumation burials , with a distinct kentish character this may suggest that west kent at this point was independent of east kent , and part of the kingdom of essex north of the thames estuary in the sixth century the kingdom of kent had some relationship with the merovingian-governed kingdom of francia , which was then extending its influence in northwestern europe archaeological evidence suggests that at some point in the sixth century , east kent annexed west kent to the south lay the weald , a dense forest of no value to the kentish elite , leaving the fertile area west of the kingdom attractive for conquest , particularly the river darenth and the dip slopes of the north downs to the west of the medway established kingdom and christianisation : 597–650 the anglo-saxon chronicle refers to wars in sixth-century britain , but most were in the west and did not affect kent ; the one exception was a battle between the kentish and west saxons in 568 , during which æthelberht 's forces were pushed back into kent according to bede , the christianization of anglo-saxon england began in kent under æthelberht 's reign when the benedictine monk augustine arrived on the ebbsfleet peninsula in 597 , bringing the gregorian mission with him during this period , anglo-saxon kings moved around their kingdoms continually , subsisting on goods from the local populations and reciprocating with gifts various seventh and eighth century documents attest to the fact that kent was governed by two kings , a dominant one in the east and a subordinate in the west , likely reflecting the earlier divide in the late seventh century , kent gradually came to be dominated by mercia the anglo-saxon chronicle records that kent was first attacked by viking raiders in the late eighth century

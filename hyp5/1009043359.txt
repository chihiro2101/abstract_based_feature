decline of romano-british kent in the roman britain period , the area of modern kent that lay east of the river medway was a civitas known as cantiaca as the closest part of britain to mainland europe , it is likely that kent would have experienced many attacks from seafaring raiders , resulting in the construction of four saxon shore along the kentish coast : regulbium , rutupiae , dubris , and portus lemanis it is also likely that germanic-speaking mercenaries from northern gaul , known as foederati , would have been hired to supplement official roman troops during this period , with land in kent as payment there is evidence that over the fourth and early fifth centuries , rural villas were abandoned , suggesting that the romano-british elite were moving to the comparative safety of fortified urban centres however , urban centres also witnessed decline ; canterbury evidenced a declining population and reduced activity from the late third century onward , while dover was abandoned by the end of the fourth century according to the anglo-saxon chronicle , produced in late anglo-saxon england and not considered an accurate record of events in the fifth century , in 418 many romans left britain via kent , taking much of their wealth with them according to archaeologist martin welch , the fifth century witnessed '' a radical transformation of what became kent , politically , socially and in terms of physical landscape '' 24 however , some of the romano-british population likely remained , as the roman name for the area , cantiaca , influenced the name of the new anglo-saxon kingdom , the cantware ( '' dwellers of kent '' ) the germanic migration to britain is noted in textual sources from the late anglo-saxon period , most notably bede 's ecclesiastical history of the english people and the anglo-saxon chronicle ; both rely on oral history from the fifth century , and were attempts to establish origin myths that would justify the politics of the time after arriving at ypwinesfleot ( ebba 's creek , modern ebbsfleet near ramsgate ) in kent in 449 , hengist and horsa led the defeat of the picts before turning on the british and inviting more germanic tribes to colonise britain among these were the old saxons , the angles , and the jutes ; the latter settled in kent and the isle of wight , establishing the peoples known as the cantware and wihtwara according to the chronicle , in 455 hengist and horsa fought vortigern at ægelesthrep ( probably aylesford in kent ) , in which battle horsa was killed a similar account is provided in bede 's ecclesiastical history : that the people of kent and isle of wight were descended from jutish settlers , and that horsa was killed in battle against the britons , adding that his body was buried in east kent fifth-century ceramics have also been found at a number of villa sites around kent , suggesting reoccupation of these locations during this period this may suggest that west kent at this point was independent of east kent , and part of the kingdom of essex north of the thames estuary in the sixth century the kingdom of kent had some relationship with the merovingian-governed kingdom of francia , which was then extending its influence in northwestern europe archaeological evidence suggests that at some point in the sixth century , east kent annexed west kent the monk bede refers to kent as ruled by æthelberht at this period , making him the earliest reliably attested anglo-saxon monarch the anglo-saxon chronicle refers to wars in sixth-century britain , but most were in the west and did not affect kent ; the one exception was a battle between the kentish and west saxons in 568 , during which æthelberht 's forces were pushed back into kent according to bede , the christianization of anglo-saxon england began in kent under æthelberht 's reign when the benedictine monk augustine arrived on the ebbsfleet peninsula in 597 , bringing the gregorian mission with him various seventh and eighth century documents attest to the fact that kent was governed by two kings , a dominant one in the east and a subordinate in the west , likely reflecting the earlier divide in the seventh century , kent 's power waned as that of mercia and northumbria grew , but it remained the fourth wealthiest kingdom in england , according to the tribal hidage with 15,000 hides of land recorded in the seventh or eighth century this suggests that from the seventh century onward , kings in kent were establishing control over the kingdom 's economic structure kings of kent kentish royal legend white horse of kent

decline of romano-british kent in the roman britain period , the area of modern kent that lay east of the river medway was a civitas known as cantiaca as the closest part of britain to mainland europe , it is likely that kent would have experienced many attacks from seafaring raiders , resulting in the construction of four saxon shore along the kentish coast : regulbium , rutupiae , dubris , and portus lemanis it is also likely that germanic-speaking mercenaries from northern gaul , known as foederati , would have been hired to supplement official roman troops during this period , with land in kent as payment however , urban centres also witnessed decline ; canterbury evidenced a declining population and reduced activity from the late third century onward , while dover was abandoned by the end of the fourth century according to the anglo-saxon chronicle , produced in late anglo-saxon england and not considered an accurate record of events in the fifth century , in 418 many romans left britain via kent , taking much of their wealth with them stuart brookes and susan harrington , the kingdom and people of kent , ad 400-600 ( 2010 ) , p 24 however , some of the romano-british population likely remained , as the roman name for the area , cantiaca , influenced the name of the new anglo-saxon kingdom , the cantware ( '' dwellers of kent '' ) according to the anglo-saxon chronicle , a '' king of the britons '' known as vortigern invited two germanic leaders , hengist and horsa ( '' stallion '' and '' horse '' ) , to britain to help defend against pictish raiders among these were the old saxons , the angles , and the jutes ; the latter settled in kent and the isle of wight , establishing the peoples known as the cantware and wihtwara according to the chronicle , in 455 hengist and horsa fought vortigern at ægelesthrep ( probably aylesford in kent ) , in which battle horsa was killed a similar account is provided in bede 's ecclesiastical history : that the people of kent and isle of wight were descended from jutish settlers , and that horsa was killed in battle against the britons , adding that his body was buried in east kent fifth-century ceramics have also been found at a number of villa sites around kent , suggesting reoccupation of these locations during this period this may suggest that west kent at this point was independent of east kent , and part of the kingdom of essex north of the thames estuary textual sources suggest that kent may have been under merovingian control for part of this century archeological evidence of frankish material culture from this period has been found in kent , but not in other areas of lowland britain , suggesting a trade monopoly with the frankish kingdom sixth century kentish artefacts have been found in continental europe , in particular in the areas of modern charente , western normandy , the rhineland , frisia , thuringia , and southern scandinavia archaeological evidence suggests that at some point in the sixth century , east kent annexed west kent the anglo-saxon chronicle refers to wars in sixth-century britain , but most were in the west and did not affect kent ; the one exception was a battle between the kentish and west saxons in 568 , during which æthelberht 's forces were pushed back into kent various seventh and eighth century documents attest to the fact that kent was governed by two kings , a dominant one in the east and a subordinate in the west , likely reflecting the earlier divide in the seventh century , kent 's power waned as that of mercia and northumbria grew , but it remained the fourth wealthiest kingdom in england , according to the tribal hidage with 15,000 hides of land recorded in the seventh or eighth century ecgberht was succeeded by his brother , hlothere , who ruled from 674 to 686 before being overthrown and killed by one of ecgberht 's sons , eadric , who had allied with the south saxons ; eadric then ruled until 687 this suggests that from the seventh century onward , kings in kent were establishing control over the kingdom 's economic structure the anglo-saxon chronicle records that kent was first attacked by viking raiders in the late eighth century kent and southeast england would have been an attractive target because of its wealthy minsters , often located on exposed coastal locations

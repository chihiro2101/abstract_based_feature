in the roman britain period , the area of modern kent that lay east of the river medway was a civitas known as cantiaca its name had been taken from an older common brittonic place-name , cantium ( '' corner of land '' or '' land on the edge '' ) used in the preceding pre-roman iron age , although the extent of this tribal area is unknown during the late third and fourth centuries , roman britain had been raided repeatedly by franks , saxons , picts , and scoti as the closest part of britain to mainland europe , it is likely that kent would have experienced many attacks from seafaring raiders , resulting in the construction of four saxon shore along the kentish coast : regulbium , rutupiae , dubris , and portus lemanis it is also likely that germanic-speaking mercenaries from northern gaul , known as foederati , would have been hired to supplement official roman troops during this period , with land in kent as payment there is evidence that over the fourth and early fifth centuries , rural villas were abandoned , suggesting that the romano-british elite were moving to the comparative safety of fortified urban centres however , urban centres also witnessed decline ; canterbury evidenced a declining population and reduced activity from the late third century onward , while dover was abandoned by the end of the fourth century according to the anglo-saxon chronicle , produced in late anglo-saxon england and not considered an accurate record of events in the fifth century , in 418 many romans left britain via kent , taking much of their wealth with them currently , many scholars accept that there was significant regional variation , with the former view being more applicable in the south and east and the latter in the north and west 24 however , some of the romano-british population likely remained , as the roman name for the area , cantiaca , influenced the name of the new anglo-saxon kingdom , the cantware ( '' dwellers of kent '' ) according to the anglo-saxon chronicle , a '' king of the britons '' known as vortigern invited two germanic leaders , hengist and horsa ( '' stallion '' and '' horse '' ) , to britain to help defend against pictish raiders according to the chronicle , in 455 hengist and horsa fought vortigern at ægelesthrep ( probably aylesford in kent ) , in which battle horsa was killed conversely , in west kent cemeteries such orpington mix cremations with inhumations , which is more typical of saxon cemeteries north of the river thames this may suggest that west kent at this point was independent of east kent , and part of the kingdom of essex north of the thames estuary in the sixth century the kingdom of kent had some relationship with the merovingian-governed kingdom of francia , which was then extending its influence in northwestern europe archaeological evidence suggests that at some point in the sixth century , east kent annexed west kent firmly in the control of an elite class , kent is the first anglo-saxon kingdom to appear in the historical record in 597 the monk bede refers to kent as ruled by æthelberht at this period , making him the earliest reliably attested anglo-saxon monarch during this period , anglo-saxon kings moved around their kingdoms continually , subsisting on goods from the local populations and reciprocating with gifts in the seventh century , kent 's power waned as that of mercia and northumbria grew , but it remained the fourth wealthiest kingdom in england , according to the tribal hidage with 15,000 hides of land recorded in the seventh or eighth century however the period was tumultuous for the kentish royal family ; kent was ruled by ecgberht from 664 to 673 , but between 664 and 667 two royal cousins , æthelred and æthelberht , were killed at eastry royal hall , perhaps because they were a threat to ecgberht ecgberht was succeeded by his brother , hlothere , who ruled from 674 to 686 before being overthrown and killed by one of ecgberht 's sons , eadric , who had allied with the south saxons ; eadric then ruled until 687 canterbury grew into the economic and political centre of kent during the seventh century , as evidenced by rubbish pits , metalworking , timber halls , and sunken-feature buildings from the period the anglo-saxon chronicle records that kent was first attacked by viking raiders in the late eighth century as many as 350 viking ships sailed from boulogne to the south coast of kent in 892

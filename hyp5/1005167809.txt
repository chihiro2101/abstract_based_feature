in plant biology , pectin consists of a complex set of polysaccharides ( see below ) that are present in most primary cell walls and are particularly abundant in the non-woody parts of terrestrial plants pectin is a major component of the middle lamella , where it helps to bind cells together , but is also found in primary cell walls pectin is deposited by exocytosis into the cell wall via vesicles produced in the golgi pectin is an important cell wall polysaccharide that allows primary cell wall extension and plant growth pectin is a natural part of the human diet , but does not contribute significantly to nutrition the daily intake of pectin from fruits and vegetables can be estimated to be around 5 & nbsp ; g if approximately 500 & nbsp ; g of fruits and vegetables are consumed per day pectin is thus a soluble dietary fiber pectin has been observed to have some function in repairing the dna of some types of plant seeds , usually desert plants the effect depends upon the source of pectin ; apple and citrus pectins were more effective than orange pulp fiber pectin pectins , also known as pectic polysaccharides , are rich in galacturonic acid rhamnogalacturonan i pectins ( rg-i ) contain a backbone of the repeating disaccharide : 4 ) -α-d-galacturonic acid- ( 1,2 ) -α-l-rhamnose- ( 1 the neutral sugars are mainly d-galactose , l-arabinose and d-xylose , with the types and proportions of neutral sugars varying with the origin of pectin in nature , around 80 percent of carboxyl groups of galacturonic acid are esterified with methanol while low-ester/low-methoxy pectins need calcium to form a gel , they can do so at lower soluble solids and higher ph-values than high-ester pectins the non-esterified galacturonic acid units can be either free acids ( carboxyl groups ) or salts with sodium , potassium , or calcium the salts of partially esterified pectins are called pectinates , if the degree of esterification is below 5 percent the salts are called pectates , the insoluble acid form , pectic acid some plants , such as sugar beet , potatoes and pears , contain pectins with acetylated galacturonic acid in addition to methyl esters here , some of the galacturonic acid is converted with ammonia to carboxylic acid amide from these materials , pectin is extracted by adding hot dilute acid at ph-values from 1.5 – 3.5 the main use for pectin is as a gelling agent , thickening agent and stabilizer in food typical levels of pectin used as a food additive are between 0.5 and 1.0 % – this is about the same amount of pectin as in fresh fruit pectin was first isolated and described in 1825 by henri braconnot , though the action of pectin to make jams and marmalades was known long before pectin was first sold as a liquid extract , but is now most often used as dried powder , which is easier than a liquid to store and handle

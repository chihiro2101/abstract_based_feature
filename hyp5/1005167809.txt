in plant biology , pectin consists of a complex set of polysaccharides ( see below ) that are present in most primary cell walls and are particularly abundant in the non-woody parts of terrestrial plants pectin is a major component of the middle lamella , where it helps to bind cells together , but is also found in primary cell walls pectin is deposited by exocytosis into the cell wall via vesicles produced in the golgi pectin is an important cell wall polysaccharide that allows primary cell wall extension and plant growth the daily intake of pectin from fruits and vegetables can be estimated to be around 5 & nbsp ; g if approximately 500 & nbsp ; g of fruits and vegetables are consumed per day in human digestion , pectin binds to cholesterol in the gastrointestinal tract and slows glucose absorption by trapping carbohydrates pectin is thus a soluble dietary fiber pectin has been observed to have some function in repairing the dna of some types of plant seeds , usually desert plants the effect depends upon the source of pectin ; apple and citrus pectins were more effective than orange pulp fiber pectin pectins , also known as pectic polysaccharides , are rich in galacturonic acid homogalacturonans are linear chains of α- ( 1–4 ) -linked d-galacturonic acid rhamnogalacturonan i pectins ( rg-i ) contain a backbone of the repeating disaccharide : 4 ) -α-d-galacturonic acid- ( 1,2 ) -α-l-rhamnose- ( 1 another structural type of pectin is rhamnogalacturonan ii ( rg-ii ) , which is a less frequent , complex , highly branched polysaccharide isolated pectin has a molecular weight of typically 60,000–130,000 g/mol , varying with origin and extraction conditions in nature , around 80 percent of carboxyl groups of galacturonic acid are esterified with methanol lm-pectins ) , with more or less than half of all the galacturonic acid esterified some plants , such as sugar beet , potatoes and pears , contain pectins with acetylated galacturonic acid in addition to methyl esters here , some of the galacturonic acid is converted with ammonia to carboxylic acid amide from these materials , pectin is extracted by adding hot dilute acid at ph-values from 1.5 – 3.5 in some countries , pectin is also available as a solution or an extract , or as a blended powder , for home jam making typical levels of pectin used as a food additive are between 0.5 and 1.0 % – this is about the same amount of pectin as in fresh fruit pectin was first isolated and described in 1825 by henri braconnot , though the action of pectin to make jams and marmalades was known long before to obtain well-set jams from fruits that had little or only poor quality pectin , pectin-rich fruits or their extracts were mixed into the recipe

in plant biology , pectin consists of a complex set of polysaccharides ( see below ) that are present in most primary cell walls and are particularly abundant in the non-woody parts of terrestrial plants pectin is a major component of the middle lamella , where it helps to bind cells together , but is also found in primary cell walls pectin is deposited by exocytosis into the cell wall via vesicles produced in the golgi the amount , structure and chemical composition of pectin differs among plants , within a plant over time , and in various parts of a plant pectin is an important cell wall polysaccharide that allows primary cell wall extension and plant growth during fruit ripening , pectin is broken down by the enzymes pectinase and pectinesterase , in which process the fruit becomes softer as the middle lamellae break down and cells become separated from each other a similar process of cell separation caused by the breakdown of pectin occurs in the abscission zone of the petioles of deciduous plants at leaf fall pectin has been observed to have some function in repairing the dna of some types of plant seeds , usually desert plants the effect depends upon the source of pectin ; apple and citrus pectins were more effective than orange pulp fiber pectin pectins , also known as pectic polysaccharides , are rich in galacturonic acid homogalacturonans are linear chains of α- ( 1–4 ) -linked d-galacturonic acid rhamnogalacturonan i pectins ( rg-i ) contain a backbone of the repeating disaccharide : 4 ) -α-d-galacturonic acid- ( 1,2 ) -α-l-rhamnose- ( 1 the neutral sugars are mainly d-galactose , l-arabinose and d-xylose , with the types and proportions of neutral sugars varying with the origin of pectin isolated pectin has a molecular weight of typically 60,000–130,000 g/mol , varying with origin and extraction conditions these bonds form as water is bound by sugar and forces pectin strands to stick together the salts of partially esterified pectins are called pectinates , if the degree of esterification is below 5 percent the salts are called pectates , the insoluble acid form , pectic acid some plants , such as sugar beet , potatoes and pears , contain pectins with acetylated galacturonic acid in addition to methyl esters amidated pectin is a modified form of pectin treating the initial pectin with dilute acid leads to low-esterified pectins pectin also reduces syneresis in jams and marmalades and increases the gel strength of low-calorie jams for conventional jams and marmalades that contain above 60 % sugar and soluble fruit solids , high-ester pectins are used pectin was first isolated and described in 1825 by henri braconnot , though the action of pectin to make jams and marmalades was known long before later , in the 1920s and 1930s , factories were built that commercially extracted pectin from dried apple pomace and later citrus peel in regions that produced apple juice in both the us and europe

pectin is a major component of the middle lamella , where it helps to bind cells together , but is also found in primary cell walls pectin is deposited by exocytosis into the cell wall via vesicles produced in the golgi the amount , structure and chemical composition of pectin differs among plants , within a plant over time , and in various parts of a plant pectin is an important cell wall polysaccharide that allows primary cell wall extension and plant growth pectin is a natural part of the human diet , but does not contribute significantly to nutrition in human digestion , pectin binds to cholesterol in the gastrointestinal tract and slows glucose absorption by trapping carbohydrates pectin is thus a soluble dietary fiber the effect depends upon the source of pectin ; apple and citrus pectins were more effective than orange pulp fiber pectin pectins , also known as pectic polysaccharides , are rich in galacturonic acid rhamnogalacturonan i pectins ( rg-i ) contain a backbone of the repeating disaccharide : 4 ) -α-d-galacturonic acid- ( 1,2 ) -α-l-rhamnose- ( 1 these bonds form as water is bound by sugar and forces pectin strands to stick together while low-ester/low-methoxy pectins need calcium to form a gel , they can do so at lower soluble solids and higher ph-values than high-ester pectins normally low-ester pectins form gels with a range of ph from 2.6 to 7.0 and with a soluble solids content between 10 and 70 % some plants , such as sugar beet , potatoes and pears , contain pectins with acetylated galacturonic acid in addition to methyl esters amidated pectin is a modified form of pectin amidated pectins behave like low-ester pectins but need less calcium and are more tolerant of excess calcium high-ester pectins set at higher temperatures than low-ester pectins from these materials , pectin is extracted by adding hot dilute acid at ph-values from 1.5 – 3.5 when this process includes ammonium hydroxide ( nh 3 ( aq ) ) , amidated pectins are obtained with low-ester pectins and amidated pectins , less sugar is needed , so that diet products can be made in medicine , pectin increases viscosity and volume of feces so that it is used against constipation and diarrhea in europe , pectins are differentiated into the e numbers e440 ( i ) for non-amidated pectins and e440 ( ii ) for amide pectins pectin was first isolated and described in 1825 by henri braconnot , though the action of pectin to make jams and marmalades was known long before

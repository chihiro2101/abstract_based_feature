in plant biology , pectin consists of a complex set of polysaccharides ( see below ) that are present in most primary cell walls and are particularly abundant in the non-woody parts of terrestrial plants pectin is a major component of the middle lamella , where it helps to bind cells together , but is also found in primary cell walls pectin is deposited by exocytosis into the cell wall via vesicles produced in the golgi the amount , structure and chemical composition of pectin differs among plants , within a plant over time , and in various parts of a plant pectin is an important cell wall polysaccharide that allows primary cell wall extension and plant growth a similar process of cell separation caused by the breakdown of pectin occurs in the abscission zone of the petioles of deciduous plants at leaf fall the daily intake of pectin from fruits and vegetables can be estimated to be around 5 & nbsp ; g if approximately 500 & nbsp ; g of fruits and vegetables are consumed per day pectin has been observed to have some function in repairing the dna of some types of plant seeds , usually desert plants the effect depends upon the source of pectin ; apple and citrus pectins were more effective than orange pulp fiber pectin pectins , also known as pectic polysaccharides , are rich in galacturonic acid in high-ester/high-methoxy pectins at soluble solids content above 60 % and a ph-value between 2.8 and 3.6 , hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions bind the individual pectin chains together while low-ester/low-methoxy pectins need calcium to form a gel , they can do so at lower soluble solids and higher ph-values than high-ester pectins the non-esterified galacturonic acid units can be either free acids ( carboxyl groups ) or salts with sodium , potassium , or calcium some plants , such as sugar beet , potatoes and pears , contain pectins with acetylated galacturonic acid in addition to methyl esters amidated pectin is a modified form of pectin here , some of the galacturonic acid is converted with ammonia to carboxylic acid amide pears , apples , guavas , quince , plums , gooseberries , and oranges and other citrus fruits contain large amounts of pectin , while soft fruits , like cherries , grapes , and strawberries , contain small amounts of pectin an old technique of precipitating pectin with aluminium salts is no longer used ( apart from alcohols and polyvalent cations , pectin also precipitates with proteins and detergents ) typical levels of pectin used as a food additive are between 0.5 and 1.0 % â€“ this is about the same amount of pectin as in fresh fruit pectin is also used in wound healing preparations and specialty medical adhesives , such as colostomy devices pectin was first isolated and described in 1825 by henri braconnot , though the action of pectin to make jams and marmalades was known long before to obtain well-set jams from fruits that had little or only poor quality pectin , pectin-rich fruits or their extracts were mixed into the recipe later , in the 1920s and 1930s , factories were built that commercially extracted pectin from dried apple pomace and later citrus peel in regions that produced apple juice in both the us and europe

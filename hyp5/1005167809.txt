in plant biology , pectin consists of a complex set of polysaccharides ( see below ) that are present in most primary cell walls and are particularly abundant in the non-woody parts of terrestrial plants pectin is a major component of the middle lamella , where it helps to bind cells together , but is also found in primary cell walls pectin is deposited by exocytosis into the cell wall via vesicles produced in the golgi the amount , structure and chemical composition of pectin differs among plants , within a plant over time , and in various parts of a plant pectin is an important cell wall polysaccharide that allows primary cell wall extension and plant growth during fruit ripening , pectin is broken down by the enzymes pectinase and pectinesterase , in which process the fruit becomes softer as the middle lamellae break down and cells become separated from each other a similar process of cell separation caused by the breakdown of pectin occurs in the abscission zone of the petioles of deciduous plants at leaf fall the effect depends upon the source of pectin ; apple and citrus pectins were more effective than orange pulp fiber pectin pectins , also known as pectic polysaccharides , are rich in galacturonic acid another structural type of pectin is rhamnogalacturonan ii ( rg-ii ) , which is a less frequent , complex , highly branched polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan ii is classified by some authors within the group of substituted galacturonans since the rhamnogalacturonan ii backbone is made exclusively of d-galacturonic acid units isolated pectin has a molecular weight of typically 60,000â€“130,000 g/mol , varying with origin and extraction conditions while low-ester/low-methoxy pectins need calcium to form a gel , they can do so at lower soluble solids and higher ph-values than high-ester pectins the non-esterified galacturonic acid units can be either free acids ( carboxyl groups ) or salts with sodium , potassium , or calcium some plants , such as sugar beet , potatoes and pears , contain pectins with acetylated galacturonic acid in addition to methyl esters amidated pectin is a modified form of pectin the main raw materials for pectin production are dried citrus peels or apple pomace , both by-products of juice production the main use for pectin is as a gelling agent , thickening agent and stabilizer in food for household use , pectin is an ingredient in gelling sugar ( also known as '' jam sugar '' ) where it is diluted to the right concentration with sugar and some citric acid to adjust ph for conventional jams and marmalades that contain above 60 % sugar and soluble fruit solids , high-ester pectins are used pectin is also used in wound healing preparations and specialty medical adhesives , such as colostomy devices pectin was first isolated and described in 1825 by henri braconnot , though the action of pectin to make jams and marmalades was known long before pectin was first sold as a liquid extract , but is now most often used as dried powder , which is easier than a liquid to store and handle

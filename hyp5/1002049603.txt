the music historian donald jay grout has written : '' the sacre is undoubtedly the most famous composition of the early 20th century & nbsp ; the academic and critic jan smaczny , echoing bernstein , calls it one of the 20th century 's most influential compositions , providing '' endless stimulation for performers and listeners '' 258 ross has described the rite as a prophetic work , presaging the '' second avant-garde '' era in classical composition—music of the body rather than of the mind , in which '' melodies would follow the patterns of speech ; rhythms would match the energy of dance & nbsp ; varèse , according to ross , was particularly drawn to the '' cruel harmonies and stimulating rhythms '' of the rite , which he employed to full effect in his concert work amériques ( 1921 ) , scored for a massive orchestra with added sound effects including a lion 's roar and a wailing siren 137 aaron copland , to whom stravinsky was a particular inspiration in the former 's student days , considered the rite a masterpiece that had created '' the decade of the displaced accent and the polytonal chord '' ross cites the music of copland 's ballet billy the kid as coming directly from the '' spring rounds '' section of the rite el país , 9 november 2016 after the premiere the writer léon vallas opined that stravinsky had written music 30 years ahead of its time , suitable to be heard in 1940 coincidentally , it was in that year that walt disney released fantasia , an animated feature film using music from the rite and other classical compositions , conducted by stokowski the rite of spring sequence , he says , overwhelmed him and determined his future career in music : '' i hope stravinsky appreciated that hundreds—perhaps thousands—of musicians were turned onto the rite of spring & nbsp ; before the first gramophone disc recordings of the rite were issued in 1929 , stravinsky had helped to produce a pianola version of the work for the london branch of the aeolian company 118–19 according to the critic edward greenfield , stravinsky was not technically a great conductor but , greenfield says , in the 1960 recording with the columbia symphony orchestra the composer inspired a performance with '' extraordinary thrust and resilience '' in 1926 , as part of his preparation for that year 's performance with the concertgebouw orchestra , stravinsky rewrote the '' evocation of the ancestors '' section and made substantial changes to the '' sacrificial dance '' stravinsky continued to revise the work , and in 1943 rewrote the '' sacrificial dance '' in 1948 boosey & hawkes issued a corrected version of the 1929 score ( b & h 16333 ) , although stravinsky 's substantial 1943 amendment of the '' sacrificial dance '' was not incorporated into the new version and remained unperformed , to the composer 's disappointment

258 ross has described the rite as a prophetic work , presaging the '' second avant-garde '' era in classical composition—music of the body rather than of the mind , in which '' melodies would follow the patterns of speech ; rhythms would match the energy of dance & nbsp ; 76 among 20th-century composers most influenced by the rite is stravinsky 's near contemporary , edgard varèse , who had attended the 1913 premiere varèse , according to ross , was particularly drawn to the '' cruel harmonies and stimulating rhythms '' of the rite , which he employed to full effect in his concert work amériques ( 1921 ) , scored for a massive orchestra with added sound effects including a lion 's roar and a wailing siren 137 aaron copland , to whom stravinsky was a particular inspiration in the former 's student days , considered the rite a masterpiece that had created '' the decade of the displaced accent and the polytonal chord '' ross cites the music of copland 's ballet billy the kid as coming directly from the '' spring rounds '' section of the rite coincidentally , it was in that year that walt disney released fantasia , an animated feature film using music from the rite and other classical compositions , conducted by stokowski the rite of spring sequence , he says , overwhelmed him and determined his future career in music : '' i hope stravinsky appreciated that hundreds—perhaps thousands—of musicians were turned onto the rite of spring & nbsp ; in later life stravinsky claimed distaste for the adaptation , though as ross remarks , he said nothing critical at the time ; according to ross , the composer paul hindemith observed that '' igor appears to love it '' before the first gramophone disc recordings of the rite were issued in 1929 , stravinsky had helped to produce a pianola version of the work for the london branch of the aeolian company the pleyela version of the rite of spring was issued in 1921 ; the british pianolist rex lawson first recorded the work in this form in 1990 in 1926 , as part of his preparation for that year 's performance with the concertgebouw orchestra , stravinsky rewrote the '' evocation of the ancestors '' section and made substantial changes to the '' sacrificial dance '' in 1948 boosey & hawkes issued a corrected version of the 1929 score ( b & h 16333 ) , although stravinsky 's substantial 1943 amendment of the '' sacrificial dance '' was not incorporated into the new version and remained unperformed , to the composer 's disappointment the 1948 score provided copyright protection to the work in america , where it had lapsed , but boosey ( who acquired the editions russe catalogue ) did not have the rights to the revised finale 36 ( note 30 ) in 2000 , kalmus music publishers brought out an edition where former philadelphia orchestra librarian clint nieweg made over 21,000 corrections to the score and parts

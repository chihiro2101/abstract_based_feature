the music historian donald jay grout has written : '' the sacre is undoubtedly the most famous composition of the early 20th century & nbsp ; the academic and critic jan smaczny , echoing bernstein , calls it one of the 20th century 's most influential compositions , providing '' endless stimulation for performers and listeners '' 258 ross has described the rite as a prophetic work , presaging the '' second avant-garde '' era in classical composition—music of the body rather than of the mind , in which '' melodies would follow the patterns of speech ; rhythms would match the energy of dance & nbsp ; 76 among 20th-century composers most influenced by the rite is stravinsky 's near contemporary , edgard varèse , who had attended the 1913 premiere varèse , according to ross , was particularly drawn to the '' cruel harmonies and stimulating rhythms '' of the rite , which he employed to full effect in his concert work amériques ( 1921 ) , scored for a massive orchestra with added sound effects including a lion 's roar and a wailing siren 137 aaron copland , to whom stravinsky was a particular inspiration in the former 's student days , considered the rite a masterpiece that had created '' the decade of the displaced accent and the polytonal chord '' ross cites the music of copland 's ballet billy the kid as coming directly from the '' spring rounds '' section of the rite the rite of spring sequence , he says , overwhelmed him and determined his future career in music : '' i hope stravinsky appreciated that hundreds—perhaps thousands—of musicians were turned onto the rite of spring & nbsp ; in later life stravinsky claimed distaste for the adaptation , though as ross remarks , he said nothing critical at the time ; according to ross , the composer paul hindemith observed that '' igor appears to love it '' before the first gramophone disc recordings of the rite were issued in 1929 , stravinsky had helped to produce a pianola version of the work for the london branch of the aeolian company the pleyela version of the rite of spring was issued in 1921 ; the british pianolist rex lawson first recorded the work in this form in 1990 118–19 according to the critic edward greenfield , stravinsky was not technically a great conductor but , greenfield says , in the 1960 recording with the columbia symphony orchestra the composer inspired a performance with '' extraordinary thrust and resilience '' after the revival of the work in 1920 stravinsky , who had not heard the music for seven years , made numerous revisions to the score , which was finally published in 1921 ( edition russe de musique , rv 197/197b in 1926 , as part of his preparation for that year 's performance with the concertgebouw orchestra , stravinsky rewrote the '' evocation of the ancestors '' section and made substantial changes to the '' sacrificial dance ''

in 1877 an act of parliament authorised construction of the lewes and east grinstead railway ( l & egr ) the line was sponsored by local landowners , including the earl of sheffield a year later another act enabled the london , brighton and south coast railway company ( lb & scr ) , chaired by samuel laing , to acquire and operate the line the line had six stations , but only barcombe was within walking distance of a village thus sheffield park station was built for the earl of sheffield , and newick and chailey for newick park and reedens , the homes of two other sponsors a branch ran from a junction at horsted keynes to and on the lb & scr main line however , only the section between east grinstead and horsted keynes ( and thence to haywards heath via ardingly ) was laid as such ; south of the junction at horsted keynes the line was single track with passing loops at stations goods traffic on the line consisted of local produce ; milk : farm products and coal , and timber to and from albert turner & son , a sawmill the only time sheffield park received a substantial number of passengers was when lord sheffield entertained the australian cricket team , with a match between them and lord sheffield 's own team on 31 july 1943 , newlyweds ronald knapp and winifred standing were killed when they were pulled under a train from lewes to east grinstead in 1954 , long before the beeching axe , the branch line committee of british railways proposed closing the line from east grinstead to culver junction near lewes an acrimonious battle between british railways and the users of the bluebell line then ensued , and lasted three years british railways took the case to the house of commons in 1957 , resulting in a public inquiry british railways were censured , but later the transport commission persuaded parliament to repeal the special section of the act on 15 march 1959 a group that included the future president of the society , bernard holden , met in ardingly and formed the lewes and east grinstead railway preservation society the society 's initial aim was to reopen the whole line from east grinstead to culver junction as a commercial service , using a two-car dmu in 1960 the interim line was opened , running from sheffield park to bluebell halt , south of horsted keynes the bluebell railway preservation society completed the extension from horsted keynes to kingscote in april 1994 , re-laying track through sharpthorne tunnel , which at is the longest on a uk heritage railway at the north end of sharpthorne tunnel , the line passes through the site of the former west hoathly railway station at Â£25,000 per train and now undertaken by gb railfreight , this practice continued periodically as funds became available the section from east grinstead to culver junction was closed in 1958 , and the lewes to uckfield line in 1969 by british rail

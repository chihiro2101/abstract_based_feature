in medicine , it is used in bone cement and to replace eye lenses ( taiwan ) , sumimoto chemical company ltd ( japan ) , evonik industries ( germany ) , basf ( germany ) , dow chemical company ( u.s ) , akzonobel ( the netherlands ) , quinn plastics ( uk ) and cytec industries ( u.s abs is a light-weight material that exhibits high impact resistance and mechanical toughness it is one of the materials used for 3d printing with fused deposition modeling ( fdm ) techniques polybenzimidazole ( pbi , short for poly-2,2 ’ - ( m-phenylen ) -5,5 ’ -bisbenzimidazole ) fiber is a synthetic fiber with a very high melting point it was first discovered by american polymer chemist carl shipp marvel in the pursuit of new materials with superior stability , retention of stiffness , toughness at elevated temperature polyether ether ketone ( peek ) is a colourless organic thermoplastic polymer in the polyaryletherketone ( paek ) family , used in engineering applications it was originally introduced by victrex plc , then ici ( imperial chemical industries ) in the early 1980s they are generally used in high performance electrical and electronic parts , microwave appliances , and under-the-hood automotive parts polyethylene ( polyethene , polythene , pe ) is a family of similar materials categorized according to their density and molecular structure it may be of low density or high density depending upon the process used in its manufacturing it is flexible at room temperature ( and low temperature ) and can be heat sealed since it is an inexpensive plastic it is made in large amounts to cater to the demand it is used to manufacture moving machine parts , bearings , gears , artificial joints and some bulletproof vests principal applications of injection and compression molded pps include cookware , bearings , and pump parts for service in various corrosive environments as pvc bends easily and has a tendency to be bent during transit , a method to mitigate this deformation is to heat the plastic until it becomes mobile , then reform the material into the desired shape polyvinylidene fluoride , pvdf , belongs to the fluoropolymer class of thermoplastics and is known for its high chemical inertness and resistance the polymer has one of the lowest coefficients of friction of any solid and is therefore commonly used for bearings and support of moving mechanical parts

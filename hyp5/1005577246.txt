acrylic paint consists of pmma particles suspended in water.button for many decades , pmma has been the predominant methacrylic ester produced worldwide ( taiwan ) , sumimoto chemical company ltd ( japan ) , evonik industries ( germany ) , basf ( germany ) , dow chemical company ( u.s ( japan ) , arkema sa ( france ) , evonik industries ( germany ) , basf ( germany ) and dow chemical company ( u.s abs is a light-weight material that exhibits high impact resistance and mechanical toughness nylon fibres are useful in making fabrics , rope , carpets and musical strings , whereas , in bulk form , nylon is used for mechanical parts including machine screws , gears and power tool casings it is one of the materials used for 3d printing with fused deposition modeling ( fdm ) techniques polybenzimidazole ( pbi , short for poly-2,2 ’ - ( m-phenylen ) -5,5 ’ -bisbenzimidazole ) fiber is a synthetic fiber with a very high melting point it was first discovered by american polymer chemist carl shipp marvel in the pursuit of new materials with superior stability , retention of stiffness , toughness at elevated temperature due to its high stability , polybenzimidazole is used to fabricate high-performance protective apparel such as firefighter 's gear , astronaut space suits , high temperature protective gloves , welders ’ apparel and aircraft wall fabrics susceptible to uv light , exposure results in yellowing ( degradation is especially visible in headlamps that lost or did n't have proper protective coating ) polyether sulfone ( pes ) or polysulfone is a class of specially engineered thermoplastics with high thermal , oxidative , and hydrolytic stability , and good resistance to aqueous mineral acids , alkalis , salt solutions , oils and greases polyoxymethylene ( pom ) , also known as acetal,2 polyacetal and polyformaldehyde , is an engineering thermoplastic used in precision parts requiring high stiffness , low friction , and excellent dimensional stability as with many other synthetic polymers , it is produced by different chemical firms with slightly different formulas and sold variously by such names as delrin , celcon , ramtal , duracon , kepital and hostaform polyphenylene oxide ( ppo ) , which is obtained from the free-radical , step-growth oxidative coupling polymerization of 2,6-xylenol , has many attractive properties such as high heat distortion and impact strength , chemical stability to mineral and organic acids , and low water absorption flexible pvc is also used in inflatable products , such as water beds and pool toys cpvc is commonly used in water , chemical , hot and cold , delivery systems for residential , commercial , and industrial applications the pvdf material is used in construction , transportation , chemical processes , electricity , batteries , waste water and treatment ptfe is hydrophobic : aqueous liquids do not wet the material , as fluorocarbons demonstrate mitigated london dispersion forces due to the high electronegativity of fluorine the polymer has one of the lowest coefficients of friction of any solid and is therefore commonly used for bearings and support of moving mechanical parts

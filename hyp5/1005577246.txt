today ’ s acrylics industry can be divided into two distinct multibillion-dollar markets : on one hand the polyacrylic acids ( paa ) and its ester derivatives ( pac ) market , on the other hand , the poly ( methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) market acrylic paint consists of pmma particles suspended in water.button for many decades , pmma has been the predominant methacrylic ester produced worldwide major players in the pmma market are mitsubishi rayon ( japan ) , arkema sa ( france ) , lg mma ( south korea ) , chi mei corp ( taiwan ) , sumimoto chemical company ltd ( japan ) , evonik industries ( germany ) , basf ( germany ) , dow chemical company ( u.s ( japan ) , arkema sa ( france ) , evonik industries ( germany ) , basf ( germany ) and dow chemical company ( u.s abs is a light-weight material that exhibits high impact resistance and mechanical toughness it was first discovered by american polymer chemist carl shipp marvel in the pursuit of new materials with superior stability , retention of stiffness , toughness at elevated temperature due to its high stability , polybenzimidazole is used to fabricate high-performance protective apparel such as firefighter 's gear , astronaut space suits , high temperature protective gloves , welders ’ apparel and aircraft wall fabrics they are easily worked , molded , and thermoformed for many applications , such as electronic components , construction materials , data storage devices , automotive and aircraft parts , check sockets in prosthetics , and security glazing polyether sulfone ( pes ) or polysulfone is a class of specially engineered thermoplastics with high thermal , oxidative , and hydrolytic stability , and good resistance to aqueous mineral acids , alkalis , salt solutions , oils and greases polyoxymethylene ( pom ) , also known as acetal,2 polyacetal and polyformaldehyde , is an engineering thermoplastic used in precision parts requiring high stiffness , low friction , and excellent dimensional stability polyetherimide ( pei ) , produced by a novel nitro displacement reaction involving bisphenol a , 4 , 4 ’ -methylenedianiline and 3-nitrophthalic anhydride , has high heat distortion temperature , tensile strength and modulus they are generally used in high performance electrical and electronic parts , microwave appliances , and under-the-hood automotive parts it may be of low density or high density depending upon the process used in its manufacturing it is used to manufacture moving machine parts , bearings , gears , artificial joints and some bulletproof vests polyphenylene oxide ( ppo ) , which is obtained from the free-radical , step-growth oxidative coupling polymerization of 2,6-xylenol , has many attractive properties such as high heat distortion and impact strength , chemical stability to mineral and organic acids , and low water absorption flexible pvc is also used in inflatable products , such as water beds and pool toys polyvinylidene fluoride , pvdf , belongs to the fluoropolymer class of thermoplastics and is known for its high chemical inertness and resistance the polymer has one of the lowest coefficients of friction of any solid and is therefore commonly used for bearings and support of moving mechanical parts

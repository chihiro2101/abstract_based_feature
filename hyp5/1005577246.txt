today ’ s acrylics industry can be divided into two distinct multibillion-dollar markets : on one hand the polyacrylic acids ( paa ) and its ester derivatives ( pac ) market , on the other hand , the poly ( methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) market it serves as a sturdy substitute for glass for items such as aquariums , buttons , motorcycle helmet visors , aircraft windows , viewing ports of submersibles , and lenses of exterior lights of automobiles major players in the pmma market are mitsubishi rayon ( japan ) , arkema sa ( france ) , lg mma ( south korea ) , chi mei corp ( taiwan ) , sumimoto chemical company ltd ( japan ) , evonik industries ( germany ) , basf ( germany ) , dow chemical company ( u.s it is used in many consumer products , such as toys , appliances , and telephones nylon fibres are useful in making fabrics , rope , carpets and musical strings , whereas , in bulk form , nylon is used for mechanical parts including machine screws , gears and power tool casings polylactic acid ( polylactide ) is a compostable thermoplastic aliphatic polyester derived from renewable resources , such as corn starch ( in the united states ) , beet pulp ( in europe ) , tapioca roots , chips or starch ( mostly in asia ) , or sugarcane it was first discovered by american polymer chemist carl shipp marvel in the pursuit of new materials with superior stability , retention of stiffness , toughness at elevated temperature due to its high stability , polybenzimidazole is used to fabricate high-performance protective apparel such as firefighter 's gear , astronaut space suits , high temperature protective gloves , welders ’ apparel and aircraft wall fabrics polycarbonate ( pc ) thermoplastics are known under trademarks such as lexan , makrolon , makroclear , and arcoplus they are easily worked , molded , and thermoformed for many applications , such as electronic components , construction materials , data storage devices , automotive and aircraft parts , check sockets in prosthetics , and security glazing polyether sulfone ( pes ) or polysulfone is a class of specially engineered thermoplastics with high thermal , oxidative , and hydrolytic stability , and good resistance to aqueous mineral acids , alkalis , salt solutions , oils and greases polyoxymethylene ( pom ) , also known as acetal,2 polyacetal and polyformaldehyde , is an engineering thermoplastic used in precision parts requiring high stiffness , low friction , and excellent dimensional stability as with many other synthetic polymers , it is produced by different chemical firms with slightly different formulas and sold variously by such names as delrin , celcon , ramtal , duracon , kepital and hostaform polyetherimide ( pei ) , produced by a novel nitro displacement reaction involving bisphenol a , 4 , 4 ’ -methylenedianiline and 3-nitrophthalic anhydride , has high heat distortion temperature , tensile strength and modulus expanded polystyrene foam ( eps ) is used in making insulation and packaging materials , such as the '' peanuts '' and molded foam used to cushion fragile products the original form is often referred to as unplasticized polyvinyl chloride ( upvc ) , which is the more commonly used type for installations such as water , waste , and sewer conveyance plumbing cpvc is commonly used in water , chemical , hot and cold , delivery systems for residential , commercial , and industrial applications the polymer has one of the lowest coefficients of friction of any solid and is therefore commonly used for bearings and support of moving mechanical parts

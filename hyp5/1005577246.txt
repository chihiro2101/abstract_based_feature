it serves as a sturdy substitute for glass for items such as aquariums , buttons , motorcycle helmet visors , aircraft windows , viewing ports of submersibles , and lenses of exterior lights of automobiles in medicine , it is used in bone cement and to replace eye lenses acrylic paint consists of pmma particles suspended in water.button for many decades , pmma has been the predominant methacrylic ester produced worldwide major players in the pmma market are mitsubishi rayon ( japan ) , arkema sa ( france ) , lg mma ( south korea ) , chi mei corp ( taiwan ) , sumimoto chemical company ltd ( japan ) , evonik industries ( germany ) , basf ( germany ) , dow chemical company ( u.s polybenzimidazole ( pbi , short for poly-2,2 ’ - ( m-phenylen ) -5,5 ’ -bisbenzimidazole ) fiber is a synthetic fiber with a very high melting point it was first discovered by american polymer chemist carl shipp marvel in the pursuit of new materials with superior stability , retention of stiffness , toughness at elevated temperature due to its high stability , polybenzimidazole is used to fabricate high-performance protective apparel such as firefighter 's gear , astronaut space suits , high temperature protective gloves , welders ’ apparel and aircraft wall fabrics they are easily worked , molded , and thermoformed for many applications , such as electronic components , construction materials , data storage devices , automotive and aircraft parts , check sockets in prosthetics , and security glazing polyoxymethylene ( pom ) , also known as acetal,2 polyacetal and polyformaldehyde , is an engineering thermoplastic used in precision parts requiring high stiffness , low friction , and excellent dimensional stability polyether ether ketone ( peek ) is a colourless organic thermoplastic polymer in the polyaryletherketone ( paek ) family , used in engineering applications it was originally introduced by victrex plc , then ici ( imperial chemical industries ) in the early 1980s polyetherimide ( pei ) , produced by a novel nitro displacement reaction involving bisphenol a , 4 , 4 ’ -methylenedianiline and 3-nitrophthalic anhydride , has high heat distortion temperature , tensile strength and modulus they are generally used in high performance electrical and electronic parts , microwave appliances , and under-the-hood automotive parts it is used to manufacture moving machine parts , bearings , gears , artificial joints and some bulletproof vests expanded polystyrene foam ( eps ) is used in making insulation and packaging materials , such as the '' peanuts '' and molded foam used to cushion fragile products cpvc is commonly used in water , chemical , hot and cold , delivery systems for residential , commercial , and industrial applications pvdf is widely used in the chemical industry as piping for aggressive chemicals and high purity liquids the polymer has one of the lowest coefficients of friction of any solid and is therefore commonly used for bearings and support of moving mechanical parts

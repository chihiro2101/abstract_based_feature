the concept of bolshevism arose at the second congress of the russian social democratic labour party ( 1903 ) as a result of the split of the party into two factions : supporters of lenin and the rest in the course of work on the charter of the russian social democratic labor party , vladimir lenin and yuliy martov proposed two different wordings of the clause on party membership lenin – a party member is a citizen who recognizes the program and charter , pays membership fees and works in one of the party organizations during the elections to the central organs of the party , the majority was won by supporters of the leninist formulation , after which lenin began to call his faction '' bolsheviks '' , while martov called his supporters '' mensheviks '' although in the subsequent history of the russian social democratic labor party , lenin 's supporters often found themselves in the minority , they were assigned the politically advantageous name '' bolsheviks '' all but the extreme left petersburg marxists disagreed with lenin 's party policy at the 4th congress of the russian social democratic labour party in 1906 , the organizational unity of the party was temporarily restored at the fifth congress , the central committee was elected , which , due to disagreements between the bolsheviks and the mensheviks , turned out to be unworkable , and the bolshevik centre , headed by vladimir lenin , which was created during the congress by bolshevik delegates at one of its factional meetings , arbitrarily took over the leadership of the bolshevik organizations of the party at the prague conference , held on january 18–30 , 1912 , which constituted itself as the all–party conference of the russian social democratic labor party and the supreme organ of the party , almost exclusively lenin 's supporters were represented in this regard , a bolshevik central committee was elected at the prague conference in 1916 , lenin wrote his work imperialism , the highest stage of capitalism , which was a major contribution to the development of classical marxism in the new conditions full composition of writings – 5th edition – moscow : publishing house of political literature , 1967 pages 133 by the beginning of the february revolution , the leading figures of the bolshevik faction were mainly in exile or in emigration , and therefore the bolsheviks did not take an organized part in it from the very beginning , while still abroad , lenin insisted on the immediate break of the petrograd soviet with the provisional government in order to actively prepare for the transition from the bourgeois–democratic to the next , '' proletarian '' stage of the revolution , the seizure of power and the end of the war returning to russia , he came up with a new program of action for the bolshevik party – the april theses – in which he put on the agenda the demand for the transfer of all power to the soviets in the interests of the proletariat and the poorest peasantry faced with resistance even among the representatives of '' theoretical '' , '' scientific '' bolshevism , lenin managed to overcome it , relying on the support of the lower classes – local party organizations , adherents of immediate practical action the bolshevik faction became known as the russian social democratic labor party ( bolsheviks ) the russian social democratic labour party was renamed the russian social democratic labor party ( bolsheviks ) at the 7th ( april ) conference in 1917 in 1990 , at the last , 28th congress of the communist party of the soviet union , during the legalization of political platforms within the communist party of the soviet union , the bolshevik platform was formed , giving rise to several modern political parties and social movements in the 1920s and 1930s , the left opposition to stalin adopted the self–designation '' bolshevik–leninism '' , thereby emphasizing its continuity with the revolutionary tradition as opposed to thermidorian stalinism thus , the famous social democrat alexander parvus wrote in 1918 : if marxism is a reflection of the social history of western europe , refracted through the prism of german philosophy , then bolshevism is marxism , emasculated by amateurs and refracted through the prism of russian ignorance

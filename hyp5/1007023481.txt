the concept of bolshevism arose at the second congress of the russian social democratic labour party ( 1903 ) as a result of the split of the party into two factions : supporters of lenin and the rest despite the ordinal number adopted in soviet historiography , the london congress was actually a constituent one , since the minsk congress had no practical significance one of the main reasons for the split was the question of a party of a new type in the course of work on the charter of the russian social democratic labor party , vladimir lenin and yuliy martov proposed two different wordings of the clause on party membership lenin – a party member is a citizen who recognizes the program and charter , pays membership fees and works in one of the party organizations during the elections to the central organs of the party , the majority was won by supporters of the leninist formulation , after which lenin began to call his faction '' bolsheviks '' , while martov called his supporters '' mensheviks '' although in the subsequent history of the russian social democratic labor party , lenin 's supporters often found themselves in the minority , they were assigned the politically advantageous name '' bolsheviks '' at the 4th congress of the russian social democratic labour party in 1906 , the organizational unity of the party was temporarily restored at the prague conference , held on january 18–30 , 1912 , which constituted itself as the all–party conference of the russian social democratic labor party and the supreme organ of the party , almost exclusively lenin 's supporters were represented by this time , the central committee of the party had virtually ceased to exist ( its last plenum was held in january 1910 ) , and the party found itself without an official leading center full composition of writings – 5th edition – moscow : publishing house of political literature , 1967 '' socialism and war ( attitude of the russian social–democratic labor party to war ) the bolshevik leaders who returned from exile , who , along with the mensheviks and socialist revolutionaries , became members of the petrograd soviet , at first tended to cooperate with the provisional government from the very beginning , while still abroad , lenin insisted on the immediate break of the petrograd soviet with the provisional government in order to actively prepare for the transition from the bourgeois–democratic to the next , '' proletarian '' stage of the revolution , the seizure of power and the end of the war returning to russia , he came up with a new program of action for the bolshevik party – the april theses – in which he put on the agenda the demand for the transfer of all power to the soviets in the interests of the proletariat and the poorest peasantry in april 1917 , the split of the russian social democratic labor party was finalized during a heated discussion at the 7th all–russian ( april ) conference of the russian social democratic labor party ( bolsheviks ) ( april 24–29 ) , the april theses received the support of the majority of delegates from the localities and formed the basis of the policy of the entire party the bolshevik faction became known as the russian social democratic labor party ( bolsheviks ) the russian social democratic labour party was renamed the russian social democratic labor party ( bolsheviks ) at the 7th ( april ) conference in 1917 in march 1918 , the party adopted the name of the communist party of the soviet union , the famous theorist of marxism karl kautsky explained the change in the name of lenin 's party as follows : the bolsheviks destroyed the democracy that the people had conquered in the march revolution at the 19th congress in october 1952 , the all–union communist party ( bolsheviks ) was renamed the communist party of the soviet union this is how the famous social democrat alexander parvus wrote in 1918 : the essence of bolshevism is simple – to ignite the revolution everywhere , not choosing the time , regardless of the political situation and other historical realities

the concept of bolshevism arose at the second congress of the russian social democratic labour party ( 1903 ) as a result of the split of the party into two factions : supporters of lenin and the rest in the course of work on the charter of the russian social democratic labor party , vladimir lenin and yuliy martov proposed two different wordings of the clause on party membership lenin – a party member is a citizen who recognizes the program and charter , pays membership fees and works in one of the party organizations during the elections to the central organs of the party , the majority was won by supporters of the leninist formulation , after which lenin began to call his faction '' bolsheviks '' , while martov called his supporters '' mensheviks '' although in the subsequent history of the russian social democratic labor party , lenin 's supporters often found themselves in the minority , they were assigned the politically advantageous name '' bolsheviks '' at the 4th congress of the russian social democratic labour party in 1906 , the organizational unity of the party was temporarily restored at the fifth congress , the central committee was elected , which , due to disagreements between the bolsheviks and the mensheviks , turned out to be unworkable , and the bolshevik centre , headed by vladimir lenin , which was created during the congress by bolshevik delegates at one of its factional meetings , arbitrarily took over the leadership of the bolshevik organizations of the party at the prague conference , held on january 18–30 , 1912 , which constituted itself as the all–party conference of the russian social democratic labor party and the supreme organ of the party , almost exclusively lenin 's supporters were represented by this time , the central committee of the party had virtually ceased to exist ( its last plenum was held in january 1910 ) , and the party found itself without an official leading center immediately after the outbreak of the world war , lenin and his supporters advanced the slogan of the defeat of tsarism in the war and the transformation of the imperialist war into a civil war full composition of writings – 5th edition – moscow : publishing house of political literature , 1967 '' socialism and war ( attitude of the russian social–democratic labor party to war ) full composition of writings – 5th edition – moscow : publishing house of political literature , 1967 from the very beginning , while still abroad , lenin insisted on the immediate break of the petrograd soviet with the provisional government in order to actively prepare for the transition from the bourgeois–democratic to the next , '' proletarian '' stage of the revolution , the seizure of power and the end of the war the bolshevik faction became known as the russian social democratic labor party ( bolsheviks ) the russian social democratic labour party was renamed the russian social democratic labor party ( bolsheviks ) at the 7th ( april ) conference in 1917 in march 1918 , the party adopted the name of the communist party of the soviet union , the famous theorist of marxism karl kautsky explained the change in the name of lenin 's party as follows : the bolsheviks destroyed the democracy that the people had conquered in the march revolution in 1990 , at the last , 28th congress of the communist party of the soviet union , during the legalization of political platforms within the communist party of the soviet union , the bolshevik platform was formed , giving rise to several modern political parties and social movements this is how the famous social democrat alexander parvus wrote in 1918 : the essence of bolshevism is simple – to ignite the revolution everywhere , not choosing the time , regardless of the political situation and other historical realities bolsheviks and soviets : dynamics of relations during the period of '' triumphal procession '' and '' strengthening of soviet power '' ( on the materials of the urals ) // problems of the history of society , state and law markov ; academy of sciences of the soviet union , scientific council '' history of revolutions and social movements '' – moscow : science , 1991

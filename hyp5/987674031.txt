the latest event alluded to in his epitoma rei militaris is the death of the emperor gratian ( 383 ) ; the earliest attestation of the work is a subscriptio by flavius eutropius , writing in constantinople in 450 , which appears in one of two families of manuscripts , suggesting that a division of the manuscript tradition had already occurred despite eutropius ' location in constantinople , the scholarly consensus is that vegetius wrote in the western roman empire vegetius dedicates his work to the reigning emperor , who is identified as theodosius , ad theodosium imperatorem , in the manuscript family that was not edited in 450 ; the identity is disputed : some scholars identify him with theodosius i , n.p milner sets forth the argument for theodosius in vegetius : epitome of military science , second edition ( liverpool : university press , 1996 ) , pp seeck 's conclusions changed the mind of karl lang , who twice edited the teubner de re militaria , and adopted seeck 's ascription watson , the roman soldier ( ithaca : cornell university press , 1969 ) , p goffart agrees that the later date is likely , suggesting that the work may have been intended to support a military revival in the time of aetius 's supremacy the date and purposes of vegetius ' de re militari rosenbaum uses allusions from vegetius 's works and relationships to the work of merobaudes to suggest that vegetius was a senior court official , primiscrinius to the praetorian prefect , who had been an agens in rebus vegetius also describes in detail the organisation , training and equipment of the army of the early empire stewechius ' opinion that the survival of vegetius ' work led to the loss of his named sources were more typical of the late renaissance the army of the early empire was a formidable fighting force , but it probably was not in its entirety quite as good as vegetius describes despite the romanticism extolling the idealized virtues of the roman legion of an earlier time , vegetius ' de re militari remains a reliable and useful insight into the success of the early roman empire

the eureka 147 system comprised three main elements : musicam audio coding ( masking pattern universal sub-band integrated coding and multiplexing ) , transmission coding & multiplexing and cofdm modulation as a predecessor of the mp3 format and technology , the perceptual codec musicam is based on integer arithmetics 32 subbands transform , driven by a psychoacoustic model it was primarily designed for digital audio broadcasting and digital tv , and disclosed by ccett ( france ) and irt ( germany ) in atlanta during an ieee-icassp conference the implementation of the audio part of this broadcasting system was based on a two chips encoder ( one for the subband transform , one for the psychoacoustic model designed by the team of g the audio coding algorithm used by the eureka 147 digital audio broadcasting ( dab ) system has been subject to the standardization process within the iso/moving pictures expert group ( mpeg ) in 1989â€“94 musicam audio coding was used as a basis for some coding schemes of mpeg-1 and mpeg-2 audio since the finalisation of mpeg-1 audio and mpeg-2 audio ( in 1992 and 1994 ) , the original musicam algorithm is not used anymore the name musicam is often mistakenly used when mpeg-1 audio layer ii is meant the mpeg-1 audio standard was based on the existing musicam and aspec audio formats '' the mpeg-1 audio standard included the three audio '' layers '' ( encoding techniques ) now known as layer i ( mp1 ) , layer ii ( mp2 ) and layer iii ( mp3 ) further work on mpeg audio was finalized in 1994 as part of the second suite of mpeg standards , mpeg-2 , more formally known as international standard iso/iec 13818-3 ( a.k.a mpeg-2 part 3 or backward compatible mpeg-2 audio or mpeg-2 audio bc ) , originally published in 1995 mpeg-2 part 3 ( iso/iec 13818-3 ) defined additional bit rates and sample rates for mpeg-1 audio layer i , ii and iii the layer iii ( mp3 ) component uses a lossy compression algorithm that was designed to greatly reduce the amount of data required to represent an audio recording and sound like a decent reproduction of the original uncompressed audio for most listeners ccett ( france ) , irt ( germany ) and philips ( the netherlands ) won an emmy award in engineering 2000 for development of a digital audio two-channel compression system known as musicam or mpeg audio layer ii iso mpeg audio subgroup , mpeg audio faq version 9 , mpeg-1 and mpeg-2 bc , retrieved on 2009-07-11 mpeg-1 audio layer ii is the standard audio format used in the mhp standard for set-top boxes mpeg-1 mpeg-1 audio layer i mp3 mpeg-2 mpeg-4 part 14 elementary stream musepack originally mp2-based , with numerous improvements

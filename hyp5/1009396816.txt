it attempted a subversion of the gallery or museum as the location and determiner of art , and the art market as the owner and distributor of art there 's no way i can climb inside somebody 's head and remove it photographs , written texts or displayed objects , which some might argue are not in themselves the art bits & pieces put together to present a semblance of a whole , the walker art center , minneapolis , 2005 language was a central concern for the first wave of conceptual artists of the 1960s and early 1970s although the utilisation of text in art was in no way novel , only in the 1960s did the artists lawrence weiner , edward ruscha , joseph kosuth , robert barry , and art & language begin to produce art by exclusively linguistic means anne rorimer , new art in the sixties and seventies , thames & hudson , 2001 ;

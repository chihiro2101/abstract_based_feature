the french artist marcel duchamp paved the way for the conceptualists , providing them with examples of prototypically conceptual works — the readymades , for instance the most famous of duchamp 's readymades was fountain ( 1917 ) , a standard urinal-basin signed by the artist with the pseudonym '' r.mutt '' , and submitted for inclusion in the annual , un-juried exhibition of the society of independent artists in new york ( which rejected it ) 28 the artistic tradition does not see a commonplace object ( such as a urinal ) as art because it is not made by an artist or with any intention of being art , nor is it unique or hand-crafted duchamp 's relevance and theoretical importance for future '' conceptualists '' was later acknowledged by us artist joseph kosuth in his 1969 essay , art after philosophy , when he wrote : '' all art ( after duchamp ) is conceptual ( in nature ) because art only exists conceptually '' in 1956 the founder of lettrism , isidore isou , developed the notion of a work of art which , by its very nature , could never be created in reality , but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually this concept , also called art esthapériste ( or '' infinite-aesthetics '' ) , derived from the infinitesimals of gottfried wilhelm leibniz – quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually in 1961 , philosopher and artist henry flynt coined the term '' concept art '' in an article bearing the same name which appeared in the proto-fluxus publication an anthology of chance operations flynt 's concept art , he maintained , devolved from his notion of '' cognitive nihilism , '' in which paradoxes in logic are shown to evacuate concepts of substance drawing on the syntax of logic and mathematics , concept art was meant jointly to supersede mathematics and the formalistic music then current in serious art music circles the term assumed a different meaning when employed by joseph kosuth and by the english art and language group , who discarded the conventional art object in favour of a documented critical inquiry , that began in art-language the journal of conceptual art in 1969 , into the artist 's social , philosophical , and psychological status in 1970 conceptual art and conceptual aspects , the first dedicated conceptual-art exhibition , took place at the new york cultural center conceptual art emerged as a movement during the 1960s – in part as a reaction against formalism as then articulated by the influential new york art critic clement greenberg according to greenberg modern art followed a process of progressive reduction and refinement toward the goal of defining the essential , formal nature of each medium 11 some have argued that conceptual art continued this '' dematerialization '' of art by removing the need for objects altogether , lucy lippard & john chandler , '' the dematerialization of art '' , art international 12:2 , february 1968 later artists continued to share a preference for art to be self-critical , as well as a distaste for illusion however , by the end of the 1960s it was certainly clear that greenberg 's stipulations for art to continue within the confines of each medium and to exclude external subject matter no longer held traction 12 conceptual art also reacted against the commodification of art ; it attempted a subversion of the gallery or museum as the location and determiner of art , and the art market as the owner and distributor of art '' many conceptual artists ' work can therefore only be known about through documentation which is manifested by it , e.g it is sometimes ( as in the work of robert barry , yoko ono , and weiner himself ) reduced to a set of written instructions describing a work , but stopping short of actually making it—emphasising the idea as more important than the artifact this reveals an explicit preference for the '' art '' side of the ostensible dichotomy between art and craft , where art , unlike craft , takes place within and engages historical discourse : for example , ono 's '' written instructions '' make more sense alongside other conceptual art of the time bits & pieces put together to present a semblance of a whole , the walker art center , minneapolis , 2005 language was a central concern for the first wave of conceptual artists of the 1960s and early 1970s where previously language was presented as one kind of visual element alongside others , and subordinate to an overarching composition ( e.g peter osborne , conceptual art : themes and movements , phaidon , london , 2002 it is a claim made at the level of the ontology of the work of art ( rather than say at the descriptive level of style or movement ) shanken points to the example of roy ascott who '' powerfully demonstrates the significant intersections between conceptual art and art-and-technology , exploding the conventional autonomy of these art-historical categories conversely , although his essay on the application of cybernetics to art and art pedagogy , '' the construction of change '' ( 1964 ) , was quoted on the dedication page ( to sol lewitt ) of lucy r lippard 's seminal six years : the dematerialization of the art object from 1966 to 1972 , ascott 's anticipation of and contribution to the formation of conceptual art in britain has received scant recognition , perhaps ( and ironically ) because his work was too closely allied with art-and-technology conceptual art and artistic skill 1973 by adopting language as their exclusive medium , weiner , barry , wilson , kosuth and art & language were able to sweep aside the vestiges of authorial presence manifested by formal invention and the handling of materials it is thus not so much an absence of skill or hostility toward tradition that defines conceptual art as an evident disregard for conventional , modern notions of authorial presence and of individual artistic expression proto-conceptualism has roots in the rise of modernism with , for example , manet ( 1832–1883 ) and later marcel duchamp ( 1887–1968 ) the first wave of the '' conceptual art '' movement extended from approximately 1967 conceptual art – '' in 1967 , sol lewitt published paragraphs on conceptual art ( considered by many to be the movement 's manifesto ) early '' concept '' artists like henry flynt ( 1940– ) , robert morris ( 1931–2018 ) , and ray johnson ( 1927–1995 ) influenced the later , widely accepted movement of conceptual art 1953 : robert rauschenberg produces erased de kooning drawing , a drawing by willem de kooning which rauschenberg erased it raised many questions about the fundamental nature of art , challenging the viewer to consider whether erasing another artist 's work could be a creative act , as well as whether the work was only '' art '' because the famous rauschenberg had done it presses universitaires de rennes , 1988 1956 : isidore isou introduces the concept of infinitesimal art in introduction à une esthétique imaginaire ( introduction to imaginary aesthetics ) 1957 : yves klein , aerostatic sculpture ( paris ) , composed of 1001 blue balloons released into the sky from galerie iris clert to promote his proposition monochrome ;

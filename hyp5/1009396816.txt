the french artist marcel duchamp paved the way for the conceptualists , providing them with examples of prototypically conceptual works — the readymades , for instance the most famous of duchamp 's readymades was fountain ( 1917 ) , a standard urinal-basin signed by the artist with the pseudonym '' r.mutt '' , and submitted for inclusion in the annual , un-juried exhibition of the society of independent artists in new york ( which rejected it ) tony godfrey , conceptual art , london : 1998 28 the artistic tradition does not see a commonplace object ( such as a urinal ) as art because it is not made by an artist or with any intention of being art , nor is it unique or hand-crafted duchamp 's relevance and theoretical importance for future '' conceptualists '' was later acknowledged by us artist joseph kosuth in his 1969 essay , art after philosophy , when he wrote : '' all art ( after duchamp ) is conceptual ( in nature ) because art only exists conceptually '' in 1956 the founder of lettrism , isidore isou , developed the notion of a work of art which , by its very nature , could never be created in reality , but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually this concept , also called art esthapériste ( or '' infinite-aesthetics '' ) , derived from the infinitesimals of gottfried wilhelm leibniz – quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually flynt 's concept art , he maintained , devolved from his notion of '' cognitive nihilism , '' in which paradoxes in logic are shown to evacuate concepts of substance drawing on the syntax of logic and mathematics , concept art was meant jointly to supersede mathematics and the formalistic music then current in serious art music circles henry flynt , '' the crystallization of concept art in 1961 '' therefore , flynt maintained , to merit the label concept art , a work had to be a critique of logic or mathematics in which a linguistic concept was the material , a quality which is absent from subsequent '' conceptual art in 1970 conceptual art and conceptual aspects , the first dedicated conceptual-art exhibition , took place at the new york cultural center conceptual art emerged as a movement during the 1960s – in part as a reaction against formalism as then articulated by the influential new york art critic clement greenberg according to greenberg modern art followed a process of progressive reduction and refinement toward the goal of defining the essential , formal nature of each medium as it is of the nature of paintings to be flat objects with canvas surfaces onto which colored pigment is applied , such things as figuration , 3-d perspective illusion and references to external subject matter were all found to be extraneous to the essence of painting , and ought to be removed 11 some have argued that conceptual art continued this '' dematerialization '' of art by removing the need for objects altogether , lucy lippard & john chandler , '' the dematerialization of art '' , art international 12:2 , february 1968 218 while others , including many of the artists themselves , saw conceptual art as a radical break with greenberg 's kind of formalist modernism however , by the end of the 1960s it was certainly clear that greenberg 's stipulations for art to continue within the confines of each medium and to exclude external subject matter no longer held traction 12 conceptual art also reacted against the commodification of art ; it attempted a subversion of the gallery or museum as the location and determiner of art , and the art market as the owner and distributor of art it is sometimes ( as in the work of robert barry , yoko ono , and weiner himself ) reduced to a set of written instructions describing a work , but stopping short of actually making it—emphasising the idea as more important than the artifact this reveals an explicit preference for the '' art '' side of the ostensible dichotomy between art and craft , where art , unlike craft , takes place within and engages historical discourse : for example , ono 's '' written instructions '' make more sense alongside other conceptual art of the time language was a central concern for the first wave of conceptual artists of the 1960s and early 1970s although the utilisation of text in art was in no way novel , only in the 1960s did the artists lawrence weiner , edward ruscha , joseph kosuth , robert barry , and art & language begin to produce art by exclusively linguistic means 71 of lawrence weiner 's works anne rorimer writes , '' the thematic content of individual works derives solely from the import of the language employed , while presentational means and contextual placement play crucial , yet separate , roles peter osborne , conceptual art : themes and movements , phaidon , london , 2002 28 osborne also notes that the early conceptualists were the first generation of artists to complete degree-based university training in art 28 osborne later made the observation that contemporary art is post-conceptual in a public lecture delivered at the fondazione antonio ratti , villa sucota in como on july 9 , 2010 shanken points to the example of roy ascott who '' powerfully demonstrates the significant intersections between conceptual art and art-and-technology , exploding the conventional autonomy of these art-historical categories john baldessari , for instance , has presented realist pictures that he commissioned professional sign-writers to paint ; and many conceptual performance artists ( e.g it is thus not so much an absence of skill or hostility toward tradition that defines conceptual art as an evident disregard for conventional , modern notions of authorial presence and of individual artistic expression proto-conceptualism has roots in the rise of modernism with , for example , manet ( 1832–1883 ) and later marcel duchamp ( 1887–1968 ) the first wave of the '' conceptual art '' movement extended from approximately 1967 conceptual art – '' in 1967 , sol lewitt published paragraphs on conceptual art ( considered by many to be the movement 's manifesto ) early '' concept '' artists like henry flynt ( 1940– ) , robert morris ( 1931–2018 ) , and ray johnson ( 1927–1995 ) influenced the later , widely accepted movement of conceptual art contemporary artists have taken up many of the concerns of the conceptual art movement , while they may or may not term themselves '' conceptual artists '' 1953 : robert rauschenberg produces erased de kooning drawing , a drawing by willem de kooning which rauschenberg erased presses universitaires de rennes , 1988 1956 : isidore isou introduces the concept of infinitesimal art in introduction à une esthétique imaginaire ( introduction to imaginary aesthetics ) for his next major exhibition , the void in 1958 , klein declared that his paintings were now invisible - and to prove it he exhibited an empty room 1961 : piero manzoni exhibited artist 's shit , tins purportedly containing his own feces ( although since the work would be destroyed if opened , no one has been able to say for sure ) he also sold his own breath ( enclosed in balloons ) as corpo d'aria , and signed people 's bodies , thus declaring them to be living works of art either for all time or for specified periods in each artwork , greco called attention to the art in everyday life , thereby asserting that art was actually a process of looking and seeing 1962 : fluxus internationale festspiele neuester musik in wiesbaden with , george maciunas , wolf vostell , nam june paik and others 1963 : george brecht 's collection of event-scores , water yam , is published as the first fluxkit by george maciunas an anthology of chance operations documented the development of dick higgins vision of intermedia art in the context of the ideas of john cage and became an early fluxus masterpiece an example of heuristic art , or a series of instructions for how to obtain an aesthetic experience 1965 : with show v , immaterial sculpture the dutch artist marinus boezem introduced conceptual art in the netherlands 1966 : conceived in 1966 the air conditioning show of art & language is published as an article in 1967 in the november issue of arts magazine 1972 : art & language exhibits index 01 at the documenta 5 , an installation indexing text-works by art & language and text-works from art-language , conceptual art , new york : dutton , 1972 lucy r , 1969 conceptual art and conceptual aspects , exh.cat , new york : queens museum of art , 1999 open systems : rethinking art c , london : tate modern , 2005 art & language uncompleted : the philippe méaille collection , macba press , 2014 light years : conceptual art and the photograph 1964–1977 , exh.cat

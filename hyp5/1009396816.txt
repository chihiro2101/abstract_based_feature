and many conceptual performance artists ( e.g it is thus not so much an absence of skill or hostility toward tradition that defines conceptual art as an evident disregard for conventional , modern notions of authorial presence and of individual artistic expression the first wave of the '' conceptual art '' movement extended from approximately 1967 conceptual art – '' in 1967 , sol lewitt published paragraphs on conceptual art ( considered by many to be the movement 's manifesto ) early '' concept '' artists like henry flynt ( 1940– ) , robert morris ( 1931–2018 ) , and ray johnson ( 1927–1995 ) influenced the later , widely accepted movement of conceptual art contemporary artists have taken up many of the concerns of the conceptual art movement , while they may or may not term themselves '' conceptual artists '' ideas such as anti-commodification , social and/or political critique , and ideas/information as medium continue to be aspects of contemporary art , especially among artists working with installation art , performance art , net.art and electronic/digital art 1955 : rhea sue sanders creates her first text pieces of the series pièces de complices , combining visual art with poetry and philosophy , and introducing the concept of complicity : the viewer must accomplish the art in her/his imagination klein also exhibited one minute fire painting , which was a blue panel into which 16 firecrackers were set 1961 : piero manzoni exhibited artist 's shit , tins purportedly containing his own feces ( although since the work would be destroyed if opened , no one has been able to say for sure ) he also sold his own breath ( enclosed in balloons ) as corpo d'aria , and signed people 's bodies , thus declaring them to be living works of art either for all time or for specified periods 1962 : yves klein presents immaterial pictorial sensitivity in various ceremonies on the banks of the seine 1962 : alberto greco began his vivo dito or live art series , which took place in paris , rome , madrid , and piedralaves 1963 : george brecht 's collection of event-scores , water yam , is published as the first fluxkit by george maciunas 1963 : festum fluxorum fluxus in düsseldorf with george maciunas , wolf vostell , joseph beuys , dick higgins , nam june paik , ben patterson , emmett williams and others an anthology of chance operations documented the development of dick higgins vision of intermedia art in the context of the ideas of john cage and became an early fluxus masterpiece an example of heuristic art , or a series of instructions for how to obtain an aesthetic experience 1969 : the first issue of art-language the journal of conceptual art is published in may the criticism of the art world integrates social , political and economic reasons , conceptual art , new york : dutton , 1972 lucy r ;

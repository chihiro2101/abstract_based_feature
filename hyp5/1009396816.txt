the french artist marcel duchamp paved the way for the conceptualists , providing them with examples of prototypically conceptual works — the readymades , for instance the most famous of duchamp 's readymades was fountain ( 1917 ) , a standard urinal-basin signed by the artist with the pseudonym '' r.mutt '' , and submitted for inclusion in the annual , un-juried exhibition of the society of independent artists in new york ( which rejected it ) tony godfrey , conceptual art , london : 1998 28 the artistic tradition does not see a commonplace object ( such as a urinal ) as art because it is not made by an artist or with any intention of being art , nor is it unique or hand-crafted duchamp 's relevance and theoretical importance for future '' conceptualists '' was later acknowledged by us artist joseph kosuth in his 1969 essay , art after philosophy , when he wrote : '' all art ( after duchamp ) is conceptual ( in nature ) because art only exists conceptually '' in 1956 the founder of lettrism , isidore isou , developed the notion of a work of art which , by its very nature , could never be created in reality , but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually this concept , also called art esthapériste ( or '' infinite-aesthetics '' ) , derived from the infinitesimals of gottfried wilhelm leibniz – quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually the current incarnation of the isouian movement , excoördism , self-defines as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small drawing on the syntax of logic and mathematics , concept art was meant jointly to supersede mathematics and the formalistic music then current in serious art music circles henry flynt , '' the crystallization of concept art in 1961 '' therefore , flynt maintained , to merit the label concept art , a work had to be a critique of logic or mathematics in which a linguistic concept was the material , a quality which is absent from subsequent '' conceptual art the term assumed a different meaning when employed by joseph kosuth and by the english art and language group , who discarded the conventional art object in favour of a documented critical inquiry , that began in art-language the journal of conceptual art in 1969 , into the artist 's social , philosophical , and psychological status in 1970 conceptual art and conceptual aspects , the first dedicated conceptual-art exhibition , took place at the new york cultural center conceptual art emerged as a movement during the 1960s – in part as a reaction against formalism as then articulated by the influential new york art critic clement greenberg according to greenberg modern art followed a process of progressive reduction and refinement toward the goal of defining the essential , formal nature of each medium as it is of the nature of paintings to be flat objects with canvas surfaces onto which colored pigment is applied , such things as figuration , 3-d perspective illusion and references to external subject matter were all found to be extraneous to the essence of painting , and ought to be removed 11 some have argued that conceptual art continued this '' dematerialization '' of art by removing the need for objects altogether , lucy lippard & john chandler , '' the dematerialization of art '' , art international 12:2 , february 1968 12 conceptual art also reacted against the commodification of art ; it attempted a subversion of the gallery or museum as the location and determiner of art , and the art market as the owner and distributor of art this reveals an explicit preference for the '' art '' side of the ostensible dichotomy between art and craft , where art , unlike craft , takes place within and engages historical discourse : for example , ono 's '' written instructions '' make more sense alongside other conceptual art of the time although the utilisation of text in art was in no way novel , only in the 1960s did the artists lawrence weiner , edward ruscha , joseph kosuth , robert barry , and art & language begin to produce art by exclusively linguistic means 71 of lawrence weiner 's works anne rorimer writes , '' the thematic content of individual works derives solely from the import of the language employed , while presentational means and contextual placement play crucial , yet separate , roles 76 the british philosopher and theorist of conceptual art peter osborne suggests that among the many factors that influenced the gravitation toward language-based art , a central role for conceptualism came from the turn to linguistic theories of meaning in both anglo-american analytic philosophy , and structuralism and post-structuralism continental philosophy during the middle of the twentieth century shanken points to the example of roy ascott who '' powerfully demonstrates the significant intersections between conceptual art and art-and-technology , exploding the conventional autonomy of these art-historical categories '' ascott , the british artist most closely associated with cybernetic art in england , was not included in cybernetic serendipity because his use of cybernetics was primarily conceptual and did not explicitly utilize technology conversely , although his essay on the application of cybernetics to art and art pedagogy , '' the construction of change '' ( 1964 ) , was quoted on the dedication page ( to sol lewitt ) of lucy r conceptual art and artistic skill image : an oak tree ( conceptual art installation ) jpg thumb 300px an oak tree by michael craig-martin 1973 by adopting language as their exclusive medium , weiner , barry , wilson , kosuth and art & language were able to sweep aside the vestiges of authorial presence manifested by formal invention and the handling of materials an important difference between conceptual art and more '' traditional '' forms of art-making goes to the question of artistic skill john baldessari , for instance , has presented realist pictures that he commissioned professional sign-writers to paint ;

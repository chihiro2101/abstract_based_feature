the french artist marcel duchamp paved the way for the conceptualists , providing them with examples of prototypically conceptual works — the readymades , for instance the most famous of duchamp 's readymades was fountain ( 1917 ) , a standard urinal-basin signed by the artist with the pseudonym '' r.mutt '' , and submitted for inclusion in the annual , un-juried exhibition of the society of independent artists in new york ( which rejected it ) tony godfrey , conceptual art , london : 1998 28 the artistic tradition does not see a commonplace object ( such as a urinal ) as art because it is not made by an artist or with any intention of being art , nor is it unique or hand-crafted duchamp 's relevance and theoretical importance for future '' conceptualists '' was later acknowledged by us artist joseph kosuth in his 1969 essay , art after philosophy , when he wrote : '' all art ( after duchamp ) is conceptual ( in nature ) because art only exists conceptually '' in 1956 the founder of lettrism , isidore isou , developed the notion of a work of art which , by its very nature , could never be created in reality , but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually this concept , also called art esthapériste ( or '' infinite-aesthetics '' ) , derived from the infinitesimals of gottfried wilhelm leibniz – quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually flynt 's concept art , he maintained , devolved from his notion of '' cognitive nihilism , '' in which paradoxes in logic are shown to evacuate concepts of substance drawing on the syntax of logic and mathematics , concept art was meant jointly to supersede mathematics and the formalistic music then current in serious art music circles henry flynt , '' the crystallization of concept art in 1961 '' therefore , flynt maintained , to merit the label concept art , a work had to be a critique of logic or mathematics in which a linguistic concept was the material , a quality which is absent from subsequent '' conceptual art the term assumed a different meaning when employed by joseph kosuth and by the english art and language group , who discarded the conventional art object in favour of a documented critical inquiry , that began in art-language the journal of conceptual art in 1969 , into the artist 's social , philosophical , and psychological status in 1970 conceptual art and conceptual aspects , the first dedicated conceptual-art exhibition , took place at the new york cultural center the critique of formalism and of the commodification of art conceptual art emerged as a movement during the 1960s – in part as a reaction against formalism as then articulated by the influential new york art critic clement greenberg 11 some have argued that conceptual art continued this '' dematerialization '' of art by removing the need for objects altogether , lucy lippard & john chandler , '' the dematerialization of art '' , art international 12:2 , february 1968 218 while others , including many of the artists themselves , saw conceptual art as a radical break with greenberg 's kind of formalist modernism later artists continued to share a preference for art to be self-critical , as well as a distaste for illusion 12 conceptual art also reacted against the commodification of art ; it attempted a subversion of the gallery or museum as the location and determiner of art , and the art market as the owner and distributor of art '' many conceptual artists ' work can therefore only be known about through documentation which is manifested by it , e.g this reveals an explicit preference for the '' art '' side of the ostensible dichotomy between art and craft , where art , unlike craft , takes place within and engages historical discourse : for example , ono 's '' written instructions '' make more sense alongside other conceptual art of the time language was a central concern for the first wave of conceptual artists of the 1960s and early 1970s although the utilisation of text in art was in no way novel , only in the 1960s did the artists lawrence weiner , edward ruscha , joseph kosuth , robert barry , and art & language begin to produce art by exclusively linguistic means anne rorimer , new art in the sixties and seventies , thames & hudson , 2001 ; p 28 osborne also notes that the early conceptualists were the first generation of artists to complete degree-based university training in art 28 osborne later made the observation that contemporary art is post-conceptual in a public lecture delivered at the fondazione antonio ratti , villa sucota in como on july 9 , 2010 the american art historian edward a shanken points to the example of roy ascott who '' powerfully demonstrates the significant intersections between conceptual art and art-and-technology , exploding the conventional autonomy of these art-historical categories '' ascott , the british artist most closely associated with cybernetic art in england , was not included in cybernetic serendipity because his use of cybernetics was primarily conceptual and did not explicitly utilize technology lippard 's seminal six years : the dematerialization of the art object from 1966 to 1972 , ascott 's anticipation of and contribution to the formation of conceptual art in britain has received scant recognition , perhaps ( and ironically ) because his work was too closely allied with art-and-technology conceptual art and artistic skill 1973 by adopting language as their exclusive medium , weiner , barry , wilson , kosuth and art & language were able to sweep aside the vestiges of authorial presence manifested by formal invention and the handling of materials proto-conceptualism has roots in the rise of modernism with , for example , manet ( 1832–1883 ) and later marcel duchamp ( 1887–1968 ) the first wave of the '' conceptual art '' movement extended from approximately 1967 conceptual art – '' in 1967 , sol lewitt published paragraphs on conceptual art ( considered by many to be the movement 's manifesto ) early '' concept '' artists like henry flynt ( 1940– ) , robert morris ( 1931–2018 ) , and ray johnson ( 1927–1995 ) influenced the later , widely accepted movement of conceptual art contemporary artists have taken up many of the concerns of the conceptual art movement , while they may or may not term themselves '' conceptual artists '' ideas such as anti-commodification , social and/or political critique , and ideas/information as medium continue to be aspects of contemporary art , especially among artists working with installation art , performance art , net.art and electronic/digital art it raised many questions about the fundamental nature of art , challenging the viewer to consider whether erasing another artist 's work could be a creative act , as well as whether the work was only '' art '' because the famous rauschenberg had done it 1955 : rhea sue sanders creates her first text pieces of the series pièces de complices , combining visual art with poetry and philosophy , and introducing the concept of complicity : the viewer must accomplish the art in her/his imagination 1957 : yves klein , aerostatic sculpture ( paris ) , composed of 1001 blue balloons released into the sky from galerie iris clert to promote his proposition monochrome ;

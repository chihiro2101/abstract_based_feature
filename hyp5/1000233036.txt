cegeps were henceforth created in order to harmonise the education system in quebec one of the innovations of cegeps was the integration of pre-university and vocational programs within the same institution , which was merged from existing schools , and which would be implemented throughout the province quebec students complete one grade fewer in total than other north american students before beginning post-secondary studies , completing high school at grade 11 instead of grade 12 cegep programs are typically two years in length with the exception of certain technical programs that are three years in length ; the latter programs are generally for those wishing to enter a vocational education following successful completion of cegep , most in-province undergraduate programs are three years in length for quebec students ; hence , the total number of years of study for quebec students from primary school through a bachelor 's degree is the same as for other students in north america for example , a quebec student who has completed a cegep diploma would begin a 3-year quebec-based university program in year 1 whereas an out-of-province student who has completed grade 12 would instead begin the same quebec-based university program in year 0 second , students may complete one year of cegep courses prior to transferring to an out-of-province university so as to begin in the first year of an out-of-province post-secondary degree students are then prepared to complete certain undergraduate programs at a quebec university in 3 years , as opposed to 4 years outside quebec quebec colleges also offer three-year technical programs for students who wish to pursue a skilled trade this certificate is delivered by a college 's continuing education department , while a diploma is issued by the ministry of education , recreation , and sport of quebec ( later renamed the ministry of education and higher education , in french )

image : crow instability contrail.jpg thumb the crow instability of a jet aeroplane 's contrail visually demonstrates the vortex created in the atmosphere ( gas fluid medium ) by the passage of the aircraft a key concept in the dynamics of vortices is the vorticity , a vector that describes the local rotary motion at a point in the fluid , as would be perceived by an observer that moves along with it the direction of the vorticity vector is defined to be the direction of the axis of rotation of this imaginary ball ( according to the right-hand rule ) while its length is twice the ball 's angular velocity when a vortex line ends at a boundary surface , the reduced pressure may also draw matter from that surface into the core for example , a dust devil is a column of dust picked up by the core of an air vortex attached to the ground a vortex that ends at the free surface of a body of water ( like the whirlpool that often forms over a bathtub drain ) may draw a column of air down the core a vortex flow might also be combined with a radial or axial flow pattern on the other hand , two parallel vortices with opposite circulations ( such as the two wingtip vortices of an airplane ) tend to remain separate in an ideal fluid this energy can never be dissipated and the vortex would persist forever it is only through dissipation of a vortex due to viscosity that a vortex line can end in the fluid , rather than at the boundary of the fluid in the hydrodynamic interpretation of the behaviour of electromagnetic fields , the acceleration of electric fluid in a particular direction creates a positive vortex of magnetic fluid aerodynamic drag can be explained in large part by the formation of vortices in the surrounding fluid that carry away energy from the moving body in the dynamics of fluid , a vortex is fluid that revolves around the axis line vortices also hold energy in its rotation of the fluid

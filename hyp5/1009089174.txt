a key concept in the dynamics of vortices is the vorticity , a vector that describes the local rotary motion at a point in the fluid , as would be perceived by an observer that moves along with it when a vortex line ends at a boundary surface , the reduced pressure may also draw matter from that surface into the core for example , a dust devil is a column of dust picked up by the core of an air vortex attached to the ground vortices need not be steady-state features ; they can move and change shape a vortex flow might also be combined with a radial or axial flow pattern as long as the effects of viscosity and diffusion are negligible , the fluid in a moving vortex is carried along with it this effect is demonstrated by smoke rings and exploited in vortex ring toys and guns these small vortices merge to form a single wingtip vortex , less than one wing chord downstream of that edge vortices contain substantial energy in the circular motion of the fluid it is only through dissipation of a vortex due to viscosity that a vortex line can end in the fluid , rather than at the boundary of the fluid in the dynamics of fluid , a vortex is fluid that revolves around the axis line vortices form from stirred fluids : they might be observed in smoke rings , whirlpools , in the wake of a boat or the winds around a tornado or dust devil when they are created , vortices can move , stretch , twist and interact in complicated ways vortices also hold energy in its rotation of the fluid

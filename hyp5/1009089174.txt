a key concept in the dynamics of vortices is the vorticity , a vector that describes the local rotary motion at a point in the fluid , as would be perceived by an observer that moves along with it the direction of the vorticity vector is defined to be the direction of the axis of rotation of this imaginary ball ( according to the right-hand rule ) while its length is twice the ball 's angular velocity the core of a vortex in air is sometimes visible because water vapor condenses as the low pressure of the core causes adiabatic cooling ; the funnel of a tornado is an example when a vortex line ends at a boundary surface , the reduced pressure may also draw matter from that surface into the core for example , a dust devil is a column of dust picked up by the core of an air vortex attached to the ground a vortex that ends at the free surface of a body of water ( like the whirlpool that often forms over a bathtub drain ) may draw a column of air down the core a vortex flow might also be combined with a radial or axial flow pattern in particular , the fluid in the core ( and matter trapped by it ) tends to remain in the core as the vortex moves about these small vortices merge to form a single wingtip vortex , less than one wing chord downstream of that edge in an ideal fluid this energy can never be dissipated and the vortex would persist forever it is only through dissipation of a vortex due to viscosity that a vortex line can end in the fluid , rather than at the boundary of the fluid in the dynamics of fluid , a vortex is fluid that revolves around the axis line vortices form from stirred fluids : they might be observed in smoke rings , whirlpools , in the wake of a boat or the winds around a tornado or dust devil when two or more vortices are close together they can merge to make a vortex

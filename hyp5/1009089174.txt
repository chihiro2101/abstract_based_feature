image : crow instability contrail.jpg thumb the crow instability of a jet aeroplane 's contrail visually demonstrates the vortex created in the atmosphere ( gas fluid medium ) by the passage of the aircraft a key concept in the dynamics of vortices is the vorticity , a vector that describes the local rotary motion at a point in the fluid , as would be perceived by an observer that moves along with it when a vortex line ends at a boundary surface , the reduced pressure may also draw matter from that surface into the core for example , a dust devil is a column of dust picked up by the core of an air vortex attached to the ground a vortex that ends at the free surface of a body of water ( like the whirlpool that often forms over a bathtub drain ) may draw a column of air down the core this effect is demonstrated by smoke rings and exploited in vortex ring toys and guns two or more vortices that are approximately parallel and circulating in the same direction will attract and eventually merge to form a single vortex , whose circulation will equal the sum of the circulations of the constituent vortices these small vortices merge to form a single wingtip vortex , less than one wing chord downstream of that edge on the other hand , two parallel vortices with opposite circulations ( such as the two wingtip vortices of an airplane ) tend to remain separate it is only through dissipation of a vortex due to viscosity that a vortex line can end in the fluid , rather than at the boundary of the fluid in the hydrodynamic interpretation of the behaviour of electromagnetic fields , the acceleration of electric fluid in a particular direction creates a positive vortex of magnetic fluid in the dynamics of fluid , a vortex is fluid that revolves around the axis line vortices form from stirred fluids : they might be observed in smoke rings , whirlpools , in the wake of a boat or the winds around a tornado or dust devil vortices also hold energy in its rotation of the fluid

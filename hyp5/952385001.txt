after stalking and killing roger , a ruthless but passionate mobster , lestat is approached by roger 's ghost eventually , lestat meets the devil , who calls himself memnoch he takes lestat on a whirlwind tour of heaven and hell , and retells the entirety of history from his own point of view in an effort to convince lestat to join him as god 's adversary in his journey , memnoch claims he is not evil , but merely working for god by ushering lost souls into heaven the novel follows up on claims made by david in the tale of the body thief that god and the devil are on better terms than most christians believe lestat de lioncourt â€“ the main character of the story and the past four books , lestat was created by a powerful vampire named magnus , who promptly cremated himself after creating his heir in previous books , lestat made the man named david talbot a vampire by force , an action that went against vampire law when lestat brings her veronica 's veil , dora starts her own religion after his death , he haunts lestat , describing his own life and commanding lestat to watch over dora from then on memnoch 's domain thus serves as a place of punishment that will eventually earn access to heaven the universe as revealed to lestat by the devil follows the following cosmology : god is a powerful and immortal being worshiped by angels , his first creation , since before the existence of matter and time these souls collect in confusion around the world in an airy realm that the angels describe as '' sheol '' or the gloom , attempting to come to terms with their existence when god invites memnoch to heaven to explain his disturbance of the natural order of creation , memnoch persuades god to allow him to find souls who are suitable for heaven god continuously argues that man is a creature of nature and ruled by its laws ; only through suffering and death can man evolve and eventually be worthy of heaven for god , this complaint is the last straw : he declares memnoch to be his adversary , and commands him to rule sheol and earth in a devilish form , preparing souls for heaven in his own fashion as human history progresses , god 's religion only exacerbates the suffering of man instead of alleviating it memnoch does n't like this work and is constantly asking god to appoint someone else to the job ( as david talbot witnesses in the tale of the body thief )

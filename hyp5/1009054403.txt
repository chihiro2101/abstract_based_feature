the origin of the modern meritocratic civil service can be traced back to imperial examination founded in imperial china the imperial exam based on merit was designed to select the best administrative officials for the state 's bureaucracy this system had a huge influence on both society and culture in imperial china and was directly responsible for the creation of a class of scholar-bureaucrats irrespective of their family pedigree originally appointments to the bureaucracy were based on the patronage of aristocrats ; during han dynasty , emperor wu of han established the xiaolian system of recommendation by superiors for appointments to office this was an early form of the imperial examinations , transitioning from inheritance and patronage to merit , in which local officials would select candidates to take part in an examination of the confucian classics after the fall of the han dynasty , the chinese bureaucracy regressed into a semi-merit system known as the nine-rank system this system was reversed during the short-lived sui dynasty ( 581–618 ) , which initiated a civil service bureaucracy recruited through imperial examination and recommendation the first civil service examination system was established by emperor wen of sui the structure of the examination system was extensively expanded during the reign of wu zetian in a debate in the unelected chamber of the uk parliament on march 13 , 1854 , john browne 'pointed out clearly with some disdain that the only precedent for appointing civil servants by literary exams was that of the chinese government ' : coolican ( 2018 ) , ch.5 : the northcote-trevelyan report , pp106–107 in the 18th century , in response to economic changes and the growth of the british empire , the bureaucracy of institutions such as the office of works and the navy board greatly expanded each had its own system , but in general , staff were appointed through patronage or outright purchase in 1853 the chancellor of the exchequer william gladstone , commissioned sir stafford northcote and charles trevelyan to look into the operation and organisation of the civil service the report 's conclusions were immediately implemented , and a permanent , unified and politically neutral civil service was introduced as her majesty 's civil service a civil service commission was also set up in 1855 to oversee open recruitment and end patronage , and most of the other northcote–trevelyan recommendations were implemented over some years career civil servants ( not temporary workers or politicians ) are hired only externally on the basis of entrance examinations entrance examinations are conducted by several institutions with a government mandate , such as cespe ( which belongs to the university of brasília ) and the cesgranrio foundation ( which is part of the federal university of rio de janeiro ) the labor laws and social insurance for civil servants are different from private workers ; even between government branches ( like different states or cities ) , the law and insurance differ there 's also higher post ranks like auditor , fiscal , chief of police , prosecutor , judge , attorney , etc in canada , the civil service at the federal level is known as the public service of canada , with each of the ten provincial governments as well as the three territorial governments also having their own separate civil services the federal civil service is defined as '' all appointive positions in the executive , judicial , and legislative branches of the government of the united states , except positions in the uniformed services this was changed in slow stages by the pendleton civil service reform act of 1883 and subsequent laws federal work force was appointed based on merit , that is , qualifications measured by tests the civil service , sevakamm civil ) of cambodia is the policy implementing arm of the royal government of cambodia hong kong and macau have separate civil service systems : hong kong civil service secretariat for administration and justice is responsible for the civil service in macau the civil service in france ( fonction publique ) is often incorrectly considered to include all government employees including employees of public corporations , such as sncf according to government statistics there were 5.5 million public sector employees in 2011 civic technology civil service commission civil service examination civil service organisation community service public service

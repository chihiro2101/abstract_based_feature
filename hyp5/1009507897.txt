a dna transcription unit encoding for a protein may contain both a coding sequence , which will be translated into the protein , and regulatory sequences , which direct and regulate the synthesis of that protein as opposed to dna replication , transcription results in an rna complement that includes the nucleotide uracil ( u ) in all instances where thymine ( t ) would have occurred in a dna complement only one of the two dna strands serve as a template for transcription the antisense strand of dna is read by rna polymerase from the 3 ' end to the 5 ' end during transcription ( 3 ' → 5 ' ) the complementary rna is created in the opposite direction , in the 5 ' → 3 ' direction , matching the sequence of the sense strand with the exception of switching uracil for thymine this also removes the need for an rna primer to initiate rna synthesis , as is the case in dna replication the non-template ( sense ) strand of dna is called the coding strand , because its sequence is the same as the newly created rna transcript ( except for the substitution of uracil for thymine ) transcription begins with the binding of rna polymerase , together with one or more transcription factor , to a specific dna sequence referred to as a '' promoter '' to form an rna polymerase-promoter '' closed complex '' in the '' closed complex '' the promoter dna is still fully double-stranded rna polymerase , assisted by one or more general transcription factors , then unwinds approximately 14 base pairs of dna to form an rna polymerase-promoter '' open complex '' in bacteria , there is one general rna transcription factor known as a sigma factor rna polymerase core enzyme binds to the bacterial general transcription ( sigma ) factor to form rna polymerase holoenzyme and then binds to a promoter in archaea and eukaryotes , rna polymerase contains subunits homologous to each of the five rna polymerase subunits in bacteria and also contains additional subunits in archaea , there are three general transcription factors : tbp , tfb , and tfe mechanistically , promoter escape occurs through dna scrunching , providing the energy needed to break interactions between rna polymerase holoenzyme and the promoter one strand of the dna , the template strand ( or noncoding strand ) , is used as a template for rna synthesis as transcription proceeds , rna polymerase traverses the template strand and uses base pairing complementarity with the dna template to create an rna copy ( which elongates during the traversal ) . role of rna polymerase in post-transcriptional changes in rna rna polymerase plays a very crucial role in all steps including post-transcriptional changes in rna file : transcription label en.jpg thumb electron micrograph of transcription of ribosomal rna hiv has an rna genome that is reverse transcribed into dna the enzyme ribonuclease h then digests the rna strand , and reverse transcriptase synthesises a complementary strand of dna to form a double helix dna structure ( '' cdna '' )

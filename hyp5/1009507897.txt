a dna transcription unit encoding for a protein may contain both a coding sequence , which will be translated into the protein , and regulatory sequences , which direct and regulate the synthesis of that protein as opposed to dna replication , transcription results in an rna complement that includes the nucleotide uracil ( u ) in all instances where thymine ( t ) would have occurred in a dna complement only one of the two dna strands serve as a template for transcription the antisense strand of dna is read by rna polymerase from the 3 ' end to the 5 ' end during transcription ( 3 ' → 5 ' ) the complementary rna is created in the opposite direction , in the 5 ' → 3 ' direction , matching the sequence of the sense strand with the exception of switching uracil for thymine this directionality is because rna polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3 ' end of the growing mrna chain this use of only the 3 ' → 5 ' dna strand eliminates the need for the okazaki fragments that are seen in dna replication this also removes the need for an rna primer to initiate rna synthesis , as is the case in dna replication the non-template ( sense ) strand of dna is called the coding strand , because its sequence is the same as the newly created rna transcript ( except for the substitution of uracil for thymine ) transcription begins with the binding of rna polymerase , together with one or more transcription factor , to a specific dna sequence referred to as a '' promoter '' to form an rna polymerase-promoter '' closed complex '' rna polymerase , assisted by one or more general transcription factors , then unwinds approximately 14 base pairs of dna to form an rna polymerase-promoter '' open complex '' in bacteria , there is one general rna transcription factor known as a sigma factor rna polymerase core enzyme binds to the bacterial general transcription ( sigma ) factor to form rna polymerase holoenzyme and then binds to a promoter in archaea and eukaryotes , rna polymerase contains subunits homologous to each of the five rna polymerase subunits in bacteria and also contains additional subunits in archaea and eukaryotes , the rna polymerase-promoter closed complex is usually referred to as the '' preinitiation complex one strand of the dna , the template strand ( or noncoding strand ) , is used as a template for rna synthesis as transcription proceeds , rna polymerase traverses the template strand and uses base pairing complementarity with the dna template to create an rna copy ( which elongates during the traversal ) although rna polymerase traverses the template strand from 3 ' → 5 ' , the coding ( non-template ) strand and newly formed rna can also be used as reference points , so transcription can be described as occurring 5 ' → 3 ' in rho-independent transcription termination , rna transcription stops when the newly synthesized rna molecule forms a g-c-rich hairpin loop followed by a run of us this pulls the poly-u transcript out of the active site of the rna polymerase , terminating transcription rna synthesis by rna polymerase was established in vitro by several laboratories by 1965 ; however , the rna synthesized by these enzymes had properties that suggested the existence of an additional factor needed to terminate transcription correctly the enzyme ribonuclease h then digests the rna strand , and reverse transcriptase synthesises a complementary strand of dna to form a double helix dna structure ( '' cdna '' )

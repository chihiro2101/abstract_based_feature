as opposed to dna replication , transcription results in an rna complement that includes the nucleotide uracil ( u ) in all instances where thymine ( t ) would have occurred in a dna complement the antisense strand of dna is read by rna polymerase from the 3 ' end to the 5 ' end during transcription ( 3 ' → 5 ' ) the complementary rna is created in the opposite direction , in the 5 ' → 3 ' direction , matching the sequence of the sense strand with the exception of switching uracil for thymine this directionality is because rna polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3 ' end of the growing mrna chain this also removes the need for an rna primer to initiate rna synthesis , as is the case in dna replication the non-template ( sense ) strand of dna is called the coding strand , because its sequence is the same as the newly created rna transcript ( except for the substitution of uracil for thymine ) transcription has some proofreading mechanisms , but they are fewer and less effective than the controls for copying dna as a result , transcription has a lower copying fidelity than dna replication transcription begins with the binding of rna polymerase , together with one or more transcription factor , to a specific dna sequence referred to as a '' promoter '' to form an rna polymerase-promoter '' closed complex '' rna polymerase , assisted by one or more general transcription factors , then unwinds approximately 14 base pairs of dna to form an rna polymerase-promoter '' open complex '' in bacteria , there is one general rna transcription factor known as a sigma factor in archaea and eukaryotes , rna polymerase contains subunits homologous to each of the five rna polymerase subunits in bacteria and also contains additional subunits in archaea and eukaryotes , the functions of the bacterial general transcription factor sigma are performed by multiple general transcription factors that work together abortive initiation continues to occur until an rna product of a threshold length of approximately 10 nucleotides is synthesized , at which point promoter escape occurs and a transcription elongation complex is formed mechanistically , promoter escape occurs through dna scrunching , providing the energy needed to break interactions between rna polymerase holoenzyme and the promoter in eukaryotes , at an rna polymerase ii-dependent promoter , upon promoter clearance , tfiih phosphorylates serine 5 on the carboxy terminal domain of rna polymerase ii , leading to the recruitment of capping enzyme ( ce ) as transcription proceeds , rna polymerase traverses the template strand and uses base pairing complementarity with the dna template to create an rna copy ( which elongates during the traversal ) although rna polymerase traverses the template strand from 3 ' → 5 ' , the coding ( non-template ) strand and newly formed rna can also be used as reference points , so transcription can be described as occurring 5 ' → 3 ' in rho-independent transcription termination , rna transcription stops when the newly synthesized rna molecule forms a g-c-rich hairpin loop followed by a run of us rna synthesis by rna polymerase was established in vitro by several laboratories by 1965 ; however , the rna synthesized by these enzymes had properties that suggested the existence of an additional factor needed to terminate transcription correctly in the case of hiv , reverse transcriptase is responsible for synthesizing a complementary dna strand ( cdna ) to the viral rna genome the enzyme ribonuclease h then digests the rna strand , and reverse transcriptase synthesises a complementary strand of dna to form a double helix dna structure ( '' cdna '' )

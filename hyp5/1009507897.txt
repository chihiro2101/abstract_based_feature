as opposed to dna replication , transcription results in an rna complement that includes the nucleotide uracil ( u ) in all instances where thymine ( t ) would have occurred in a dna complement only one of the two dna strands serve as a template for transcription the antisense strand of dna is read by rna polymerase from the 3 ' end to the 5 ' end during transcription ( 3 ' → 5 ' ) the non-template ( sense ) strand of dna is called the coding strand , because its sequence is the same as the newly created rna transcript ( except for the substitution of uracil for thymine ) transcription is divided into initiation , promoter escape , elongation , and termination transcription begins with the binding of rna polymerase , together with one or more transcription factor , to a specific dna sequence referred to as a '' promoter '' to form an rna polymerase-promoter '' closed complex '' rna polymerase , assisted by one or more general transcription factors , then unwinds approximately 14 base pairs of dna to form an rna polymerase-promoter '' open complex '' in bacteria , rna polymerase holoenzyme consists of five subunits : 2 α subunits , 1 β subunit , 1 β ' subunit , and 1 ω subunit rna polymerase core enzyme binds to the bacterial general transcription ( sigma ) factor to form rna polymerase holoenzyme and then binds to a promoter ( rna polymerase is called a holoenzyme when sigma subunit is attached to the core enzyme which is consist of 2 α subunits , 1 β subunit , 1 β ' subunit only ) in archaea and eukaryotes , rna polymerase contains subunits homologous to each of the five rna polymerase subunits in bacteria and also contains additional subunits in archaea and eukaryotes , the functions of the bacterial general transcription factor sigma are performed by multiple general transcription factors that work together the tfiid is the first component to bind to dna due to binding of tbp , while tfiih is the last component to be recruited '' transcription initiation is regulated by additional proteins , known as activators and repressors , and , in some cases , associated coactivators or coactivator , which modulate formation and function of the transcription initiation complex abortive initiation continues to occur until an rna product of a threshold length of approximately 10 nucleotides is synthesized , at which point promoter escape occurs and a transcription elongation complex is formed mechanistically , promoter escape occurs through dna scrunching , providing the energy needed to break interactions between rna polymerase holoenzyme and the promoter one strand of the dna , the template strand ( or noncoding strand ) , is used as a template for rna synthesis as transcription proceeds , rna polymerase traverses the template strand and uses base pairing complementarity with the dna template to create an rna copy ( which elongates during the traversal ) . role of rna polymerase in post-transcriptional changes in rna an example of such an antibacterial is rifampicin , which inhibits bacterial transcription of dna into mrna by inhibiting dna-dependent rna polymerase by binding its beta-subunit , while 8-hydroxyquinoline is an antifungal transcription inhibitor rna synthesis by rna polymerase was established in vitro by several laboratories by 1965 ; however , the rna synthesized by these enzymes had properties that suggested the existence of an additional factor needed to terminate transcription correctly telomerase carries an rna template from which it synthesizes a repeating sequence of dna , or '' junk '' dna

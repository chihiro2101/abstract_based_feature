a dna transcription unit encoding for a protein may contain both a coding sequence , which will be translated into the protein , and regulatory sequences , which direct and regulate the synthesis of that protein as opposed to dna replication , transcription results in an rna complement that includes the nucleotide uracil ( u ) in all instances where thymine ( t ) would have occurred in a dna complement the antisense strand of dna is read by rna polymerase from the 3 ' end to the 5 ' end during transcription ( 3 ' → 5 ' ) this directionality is because rna polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3 ' end of the growing mrna chain this also removes the need for an rna primer to initiate rna synthesis , as is the case in dna replication the non-template ( sense ) strand of dna is called the coding strand , because its sequence is the same as the newly created rna transcript ( except for the substitution of uracil for thymine ) transcription begins with the binding of rna polymerase , together with one or more transcription factor , to a specific dna sequence referred to as a '' promoter '' to form an rna polymerase-promoter '' closed complex '' rna polymerase , assisted by one or more general transcription factors , then unwinds approximately 14 base pairs of dna to form an rna polymerase-promoter '' open complex '' in bacteria , there is one general rna transcription factor known as a sigma factor ( rna polymerase is called a holoenzyme when sigma subunit is attached to the core enzyme which is consist of 2 α subunits , 1 β subunit , 1 β ' subunit only ) in archaea and eukaryotes , rna polymerase contains subunits homologous to each of the five rna polymerase subunits in bacteria and also contains additional subunits in eukaryotes , at an rna polymerase ii-dependent promoter , upon promoter clearance , tfiih phosphorylates serine 5 on the carboxy terminal domain of rna polymerase ii , leading to the recruitment of capping enzyme ( ce ) one strand of the dna , the template strand ( or noncoding strand ) , is used as a template for rna synthesis as transcription proceeds , rna polymerase traverses the template strand and uses base pairing complementarity with the dna template to create an rna copy ( which elongates during the traversal ) although rna polymerase traverses the template strand from 3 ' → 5 ' , the coding ( non-template ) strand and newly formed rna can also be used as reference points , so transcription can be described as occurring 5 ' → 3 ' mrna transcription can involve multiple rna polymerases on a single dna template and multiple rounds of transcription ( amplification of particular mrna ) , so many mrna molecules can be rapidly produced from a single copy of a gene in eukaryotes , this may correspond with short pauses during transcription that allow appropriate rna editing factors to bind . role of rna polymerase in post-transcriptional changes in rna rna polymerase plays a very crucial role in all steps including post-transcriptional changes in rna file : transcription label en.jpg thumb electron micrograph of transcription of ribosomal rna in the case of hiv , reverse transcriptase is responsible for synthesizing a complementary dna strand ( cdna ) to the viral rna genome telomerase carries an rna template from which it synthesizes a repeating sequence of dna , or '' junk '' dna

neurolinguistics is historically rooted in the development in the 19th century of aphasiology , the study of linguistic deficits ( aphasias ) occurring as the result of brain damage aphasiology attempts to correlate structure to function by analyzing the effect of brain injuries on language processing one of the first people to draw a connection between a particular brain area and language processing was paul broca , a french surgeon who conducted autopsies on numerous individuals who had speaking deficiencies , and found that most of them had brain damage ( or lesions ) on the left frontal lobe , in an area now known as broca 's area phrenology had made the claim in the early 19th century that different brain regions carried out different functions and that language was mostly controlled by the frontal regions of the brain , but broca 's research was possibly the first to offer empirical evidence for such a relationship , and has been described as '' epoch-making '' and '' pivotal '' to the fields of neurolinguistics and cognitive science later , carl wernicke , after whom wernicke 's area is named , proposed that different areas of the brain were specialized for different linguistic tasks , with broca 's area handling the motor production of speech , and wernicke 's area handling auditory speech comprehension the work of broca and wernicke established the field of aphasiology and the idea that language can be studied through examining physical characteristics of the brain early work in aphasiology also benefited from the early twentieth-century work of korbinian brodmann , who '' mapped '' the surface of the brain , dividing it up into numbered areas based on each area 's cytoarchitecture ( cell structure ) and function ; these areas , known as brodmann areas , are still widely used in neuroscience today although aphasiology is the historical core of neurolinguistics , in recent years the field has broadened considerably , thanks in part to the emergence of new brain imaging technologies ( such as pet and fmri ) and time-sensitive electrophysiological techniques ( eeg and meg ) , which can highlight patterns of brain activation as people engage in various language tasks ; brown , colin m electrophysiological techniques , in particular , emerged as a viable method for the study of language in 1980 with the discovery of the n400 , a brain response shown to be sensitive to semantic issues in language comprehension the n400 was the first language-relevant event-related potential to be identified , and since its discovery eeg and meg have become increasingly widely used for conducting language research neurolinguistics is closely related to the field of psycholinguistics , which seeks to elucidate the cognitive mechanisms of language by employing the traditional techniques of experimental psychology ; today , psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic theories often inform one another , and there is much collaboration between the two fields in general , theoretical linguists propose models to explain the structure of language and how language information is organized , psycholinguists propose models and algorithms to explain how language information is processed in the mind , and neurolinguists analyze brain activity to infer how biological structures ( populations and networks of neurons ) carry out those psycholinguistic processing algorithms neurolinguistics research is carried out in all the major areas of linguistics ; the main linguistic subfields , and how neurolinguistics addresses them , are given in the table below neurolinguistics research investigates several topics , including where language information is processed , how language processing unfolds over time , how brain structures are related to language acquisition and learning , and how neurophysiology can contribute to speech and language pathology much work in neurolinguistics has , like broca 's and wernicke 's early studies , investigated the locations of specific language '' modules '' within the brain and how the locations of brain activation differ when a subject is producing or perceiving a language other than his or her first language neurolinguistic techniques are also used to study disorders and breakdowns in language , such as aphasia and dyslexia , and how they relate to physical characteristics of the brain hemodynamic techniques take advantage of the fact that when an area of the brain works at a task , blood is sent to supply that area with oxygen ( in what is known as the blood oxygen level-dependent , or bold , response ) in addition to demonstrating which parts of the brain may subserve specific language tasks or computations , hemodynamic methods have also been used to demonstrate how the structure of the brain 's language architecture and the distribution of language-related activation may change over time , as a function of linguistic exposure in addition to these non-invasive methods , electrocorticography has also been used to study language processing neurolinguists employ a variety of experimental techniques in order to use brain imaging to draw conclusions about how language is represented and processed in the brain the logic behind tms and direct cortical stimulation is similar to the logic behind aphasiology : if a particular language function is impaired when a specific region of the brain is knocked out , then that region must be somehow implicated in that language function at least one study has suggested that the task the subject does has an effect on the brain responses and the results of the experiment some experiments give subjects a '' distractor '' task to ensure that subjects are not consciously paying attention to the experimental stimuli ; this may be done to test whether a certain computation in the brain is carried out automatically , regardless of whether the subject devotes attention to it

neurolinguistics is historically rooted in the development in the 19th century of aphasiology , the study of linguistic deficits ( aphasias ) occurring as the result of brain damage aphasiology attempts to correlate structure to function by analyzing the effect of brain injuries on language processing one of the first people to draw a connection between a particular brain area and language processing was paul broca , a french surgeon who conducted autopsies on numerous individuals who had speaking deficiencies , and found that most of them had brain damage ( or lesions ) on the left frontal lobe , in an area now known as broca 's area phrenology had made the claim in the early 19th century that different brain regions carried out different functions and that language was mostly controlled by the frontal regions of the brain , but broca 's research was possibly the first to offer empirical evidence for such a relationship , and has been described as '' epoch-making '' and '' pivotal '' to the fields of neurolinguistics and cognitive science later , carl wernicke , after whom wernicke 's area is named , proposed that different areas of the brain were specialized for different linguistic tasks , with broca 's area handling the motor production of speech , and wernicke 's area handling auditory speech comprehension the work of broca and wernicke established the field of aphasiology and the idea that language can be studied through examining physical characteristics of the brain early work in aphasiology also benefited from the early twentieth-century work of korbinian brodmann , who '' mapped '' the surface of the brain , dividing it up into numbered areas based on each area 's cytoarchitecture ( cell structure ) and function ; these areas , known as brodmann areas , are still widely used in neuroscience today the coining of the term '' neurolinguistics '' is attributed to edith crowell trager , henri hecaen and alexandr luria , in the late 1940s and 1950s ; luria 's book '' problems in neurolinguistics '' is likely the first book with neurolinguistics in the title although aphasiology is the historical core of neurolinguistics , in recent years the field has broadened considerably , thanks in part to the emergence of new brain imaging technologies ( such as pet and fmri ) and time-sensitive electrophysiological techniques ( eeg and meg ) , which can highlight patterns of brain activation as people engage in various language tasks ; brown , colin m electrophysiological techniques , in particular , emerged as a viable method for the study of language in 1980 with the discovery of the n400 , a brain response shown to be sensitive to semantic issues in language comprehension neurolinguistics is closely related to the field of psycholinguistics , which seeks to elucidate the cognitive mechanisms of language by employing the traditional techniques of experimental psychology ; today , psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic theories often inform one another , and there is much collaboration between the two fields neurolinguists can also make new predictions about the structure and organization of language based on insights about the physiology of the brain , by '' generalizing from the knowledge of neurological structures to language structure '' neurolinguistics research investigates several topics , including where language information is processed , how language processing unfolds over time , how brain structures are related to language acquisition and learning , and how neurophysiology can contribute to speech and language pathology much work in neurolinguistics has , like broca 's and wernicke 's early studies , investigated the locations of specific language '' modules '' within the brain research questions include what course language information follows through the brain as it is processed , whether or not particular areas specialize in processing particular sorts of information , how different brain regions interact with one another in language processing , brown , colin m another area of neurolinguistics literature involves the use of electrophysiology techniques to analyze the rapid processing of language in time the temporal ordering of specific patterns of brain activity may reflect discrete computational processes that the brain undergoes during language processing ; for example , one neurolinguistic theory of sentence parsing proposes that three brain responses ( the elan , n400 , and p600 ) are products of three different steps in syntactic and semantic processing research in first language acquisition has already established that infants from all linguistic environments go through similar and predictable stages ( such as babbling ) , and some neurolinguistics research attempts to find correlations between stages of language development and stages of brain development , caplan ( 1987 ) , p while other research investigates the physical changes ( known as neuroplasticity ) that the brain undergoes during second language acquisition , when adults learn a new language neuroplasticity is observed when both second language acquisition and language learning experience are induced , the result of this language exposure concludes that an increase of gray and white matter could be found in children , young adults and the elderly neuroplasticity as a function of second language learning : anatomical changes in the human brain cortex : a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system & behavior , 410.1016/j.cortex.2014.05.00124996640 brain imaging methods used in neurolinguistics may be classified into hemodynamic methods , electrophysiology methods , and methods that stimulate the cortex directly in addition to demonstrating which parts of the brain may subserve specific language tasks or computations , hemodynamic methods have also been used to demonstrate how the structure of the brain 's language architecture and the distribution of language-related activation may change over time , as a function of linguistic exposure one experiment showed that when subjects were instructed to judge the '' acceptability '' of sentences they did not show an n400 brain response ( a response commonly associated with semantic processing ) , but that they did show that response when instructed to ignore grammatical acceptability and only judge whether or not the sentences '' made sense ''

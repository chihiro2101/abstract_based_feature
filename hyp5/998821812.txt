aphasiology attempts to correlate structure to function by analyzing the effect of brain injuries on language processing one of the first people to draw a connection between a particular brain area and language processing was paul broca , a french surgeon who conducted autopsies on numerous individuals who had speaking deficiencies , and found that most of them had brain damage ( or lesions ) on the left frontal lobe , in an area now known as broca 's area phrenology had made the claim in the early 19th century that different brain regions carried out different functions and that language was mostly controlled by the frontal regions of the brain , but broca 's research was possibly the first to offer empirical evidence for such a relationship , and has been described as '' epoch-making '' and '' pivotal '' to the fields of neurolinguistics and cognitive science later , carl wernicke , after whom wernicke 's area is named , proposed that different areas of the brain were specialized for different linguistic tasks , with broca 's area handling the motor production of speech , and wernicke 's area handling auditory speech comprehension early work in aphasiology also benefited from the early twentieth-century work of korbinian brodmann , who '' mapped '' the surface of the brain , dividing it up into numbered areas based on each area 's cytoarchitecture ( cell structure ) and function ; these areas , known as brodmann areas , are still widely used in neuroscience today although aphasiology is the historical core of neurolinguistics , in recent years the field has broadened considerably , thanks in part to the emergence of new brain imaging technologies ( such as pet and fmri ) and time-sensitive electrophysiological techniques ( eeg and meg ) , which can highlight patterns of brain activation as people engage in various language tasks ; brown , colin m the n400 was the first language-relevant event-related potential to be identified , and since its discovery eeg and meg have become increasingly widely used for conducting language research in general , theoretical linguists propose models to explain the structure of language and how language information is organized , psycholinguists propose models and algorithms to explain how language information is processed in the mind , and neurolinguists analyze brain activity to infer how biological structures ( populations and networks of neurons ) carry out those psycholinguistic processing algorithms neurolinguistics research investigates several topics , including where language information is processed , how language processing unfolds over time , how brain structures are related to language acquisition and learning , and how neurophysiology can contribute to speech and language pathology much work in neurolinguistics has , like broca 's and wernicke 's early studies , investigated the locations of specific language '' modules '' within the brain research questions include what course language information follows through the brain as it is processed , whether or not particular areas specialize in processing particular sorts of information , how different brain regions interact with one another in language processing , brown , colin m another area of neurolinguistics literature involves the use of electrophysiology techniques to analyze the rapid processing of language in time research in first language acquisition has already established that infants from all linguistic environments go through similar and predictable stages ( such as babbling ) , and some neurolinguistics research attempts to find correlations between stages of language development and stages of brain development , caplan ( 1987 ) , p while other research investigates the physical changes ( known as neuroplasticity ) that the brain undergoes during second language acquisition , when adults learn a new language neuroplasticity is observed when both second language acquisition and language learning experience are induced , the result of this language exposure concludes that an increase of gray and white matter could be found in children , young adults and the elderly neuroplasticity as a function of second language learning : anatomical changes in the human brain cortex : a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system & behavior , 410.1016/j.cortex.2014.05.00124996640 neurolinguistic techniques are also used to study disorders and breakdowns in language , such as aphasia and dyslexia , and how they relate to physical characteristics of the brain since one of the focuses of this field is the testing of linguistic and psycholinguistic models , the technology used for experiments is highly relevant to the study of neurolinguistics these techniques provide high spatial resolution , allowing researchers to pinpoint the location of activity within the brain ; temporal resolution ( or information about the timing of brain activity ) , on the other hand , is poor , since the bold response happens much more slowly than language processing on the other hand , the location of brain activity can be difficult to identify in eeg ; consequently , this technique is used primarily to how language processes are carried out , rather than where these techniques include the subtraction paradigm , mismatch design , violation-based studies , various forms of priming , and direct stimulation of the brain many studies in neurolinguistics take advantage of anomalies or violations of syntax or semantic rules in experimental stimuli , and analyzing the brain responses elicited when a subject encounters these violations few neurolinguistic studies to date have used tms ; direct cortical stimulation and cortical recording ( recording brain activity using electrodes placed directly on the brain ) have been used with macaque to make predictions about the behavior of human brains the subjects showed a mismatch response ( mmn ) anyway , suggesting that the processing of the grammatical errors was happening automatically , regardless of attention & mdash ; or at least that subjects were unable to consciously separate their attention from the speech stimuli

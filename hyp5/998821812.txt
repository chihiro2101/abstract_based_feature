neurolinguistics is historically rooted in the development in the 19th century of aphasiology , the study of linguistic deficits ( aphasias ) occurring as the result of brain damage aphasiology attempts to correlate structure to function by analyzing the effect of brain injuries on language processing one of the first people to draw a connection between a particular brain area and language processing was paul broca , a french surgeon who conducted autopsies on numerous individuals who had speaking deficiencies , and found that most of them had brain damage ( or lesions ) on the left frontal lobe , in an area now known as broca 's area phrenology had made the claim in the early 19th century that different brain regions carried out different functions and that language was mostly controlled by the frontal regions of the brain , but broca 's research was possibly the first to offer empirical evidence for such a relationship , and has been described as '' epoch-making '' and '' pivotal '' to the fields of neurolinguistics and cognitive science later , carl wernicke , after whom wernicke 's area is named , proposed that different areas of the brain were specialized for different linguistic tasks , with broca 's area handling the motor production of speech , and wernicke 's area handling auditory speech comprehension the work of broca and wernicke established the field of aphasiology and the idea that language can be studied through examining physical characteristics of the brain early work in aphasiology also benefited from the early twentieth-century work of korbinian brodmann , who '' mapped '' the surface of the brain , dividing it up into numbered areas based on each area 's cytoarchitecture ( cell structure ) and function ; these areas , known as brodmann areas , are still widely used in neuroscience today although aphasiology is the historical core of neurolinguistics , in recent years the field has broadened considerably , thanks in part to the emergence of new brain imaging technologies ( such as pet and fmri ) and time-sensitive electrophysiological techniques ( eeg and meg ) , which can highlight patterns of brain activation as people engage in various language tasks ; brown , colin m neurolinguistics is closely related to the field of psycholinguistics , which seeks to elucidate the cognitive mechanisms of language by employing the traditional techniques of experimental psychology ; today , psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic theories often inform one another , and there is much collaboration between the two fields much work in neurolinguistics involves testing and evaluating theories put forth by psycholinguists and theoretical linguists in general , theoretical linguists propose models to explain the structure of language and how language information is organized , psycholinguists propose models and algorithms to explain how language information is processed in the mind , and neurolinguists analyze brain activity to infer how biological structures ( populations and networks of neurons ) carry out those psycholinguistic processing algorithms for example , experiments in sentence processing have used the elan , n400 , and p600 brain responses to examine how physiological brain responses reflect the different predictions of sentence processing models put forth by psycholinguists , such as janet fodor and lyn frazier 's '' serial '' model , see , for example , , which discusses how three brain responses reflect three stages of fodor and frazier 's model neurolinguistics research investigates several topics , including where language information is processed , how language processing unfolds over time , how brain structures are related to language acquisition and learning , and how neurophysiology can contribute to speech and language pathology much work in neurolinguistics has , like broca 's and wernicke 's early studies , investigated the locations of specific language '' modules '' within the brain another area of neurolinguistics literature involves the use of electrophysiology techniques to analyze the rapid processing of language in time the temporal ordering of specific patterns of brain activity may reflect discrete computational processes that the brain undergoes during language processing ; for example , one neurolinguistic theory of sentence parsing proposes that three brain responses ( the elan , n400 , and p600 ) are products of three different steps in syntactic and semantic processing neuroplasticity is observed when both second language acquisition and language learning experience are induced , the result of this language exposure concludes that an increase of gray and white matter could be found in children , young adults and the elderly in addition to demonstrating which parts of the brain may subserve specific language tasks or computations , hemodynamic methods have also been used to demonstrate how the structure of the brain 's language architecture and the distribution of language-related activation may change over time , as a function of linguistic exposure in addition to pet and fmri , which show which areas of the brain are activated by certain tasks , researchers also use diffusion tensor imaging ( dti ) , which shows the neural pathways that connect different brain areas , filler ag , tsuruda js , richards tl , howe fa : images , apparatus , algorithms and methods see , for example : subjects perform these tasks while recordings ( electrophysiological or hemodynamic ) are being taken , usually in order to ensure that they are paying attention to the stimuli one experiment showed that when subjects were instructed to judge the '' acceptability '' of sentences they did not show an n400 brain response ( a response commonly associated with semantic processing ) , but that they did show that response when instructed to ignore grammatical acceptability and only judge whether or not the sentences '' made sense '' some studies use a '' probe verification '' task rather than an overt acceptability judgment ; in this paradigm , each experimental sentence is followed by a '' probe word '' , and subjects must answer whether or not the probe word had appeared in the sentence some experiments give subjects a '' distractor '' task to ensure that subjects are not consciously paying attention to the experimental stimuli ; this may be done to test whether a certain computation in the brain is carried out automatically , regardless of whether the subject devotes attention to it another related form of experiment is the double-task experiment , in which a subject must perform an extra task ( such as sequential finger-tapping or articulating nonsense syllables ) while responding to linguistic stimuli ; this kind of experiment has been used to investigate the use of working memory in language processing

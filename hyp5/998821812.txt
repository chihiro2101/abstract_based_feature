neurolinguistics is historically rooted in the development in the 19th century of aphasiology , the study of linguistic deficits ( aphasias ) occurring as the result of brain damage aphasiology attempts to correlate structure to function by analyzing the effect of brain injuries on language processing one of the first people to draw a connection between a particular brain area and language processing was paul broca , a french surgeon who conducted autopsies on numerous individuals who had speaking deficiencies , and found that most of them had brain damage ( or lesions ) on the left frontal lobe , in an area now known as broca 's area later , carl wernicke , after whom wernicke 's area is named , proposed that different areas of the brain were specialized for different linguistic tasks , with broca 's area handling the motor production of speech , and wernicke 's area handling auditory speech comprehension the work of broca and wernicke established the field of aphasiology and the idea that language can be studied through examining physical characteristics of the brain the coining of the term '' neurolinguistics '' is attributed to edith crowell trager , henri hecaen and alexandr luria , in the late 1940s and 1950s ; luria 's book '' problems in neurolinguistics '' is likely the first book with neurolinguistics in the title electrophysiological techniques , in particular , emerged as a viable method for the study of language in 1980 with the discovery of the n400 , a brain response shown to be sensitive to semantic issues in language comprehension the n400 was the first language-relevant event-related potential to be identified , and since its discovery eeg and meg have become increasingly widely used for conducting language research much work in neurolinguistics involves testing and evaluating theories put forth by psycholinguists and theoretical linguists neurolinguists can also make new predictions about the structure and organization of language based on insights about the physiology of the brain , by '' generalizing from the knowledge of neurological structures to language structure '' neurolinguistics research is carried out in all the major areas of linguistics ; the main linguistic subfields , and how neurolinguistics addresses them , are given in the table below neurolinguistics research investigates several topics , including where language information is processed , how language processing unfolds over time , how brain structures are related to language acquisition and learning , and how neurophysiology can contribute to speech and language pathology much work in neurolinguistics has , like broca 's and wernicke 's early studies , investigated the locations of specific language '' modules '' within the brain neuroplasticity is observed when both second language acquisition and language learning experience are induced , the result of this language exposure concludes that an increase of gray and white matter could be found in children , young adults and the elderly since one of the focuses of this field is the testing of linguistic and psycholinguistic models , the technology used for experiments is highly relevant to the study of neurolinguistics modern brain imaging techniques have contributed greatly to a growing understanding of the anatomical organization of linguistic functions brain imaging methods used in neurolinguistics may be classified into hemodynamic methods , electrophysiology methods , and methods that stimulate the cortex directly hemodynamic techniques take advantage of the fact that when an area of the brain works at a task , blood is sent to supply that area with oxygen ( in what is known as the blood oxygen level-dependent , or bold , response ) in addition to these non-invasive methods , electrocorticography has also been used to study language processing neurolinguists employ a variety of experimental techniques in order to use brain imaging to draw conclusions about how language is represented and processed in the brain many studies in neurolinguistics take advantage of anomalies or violations of syntax or semantic rules in experimental stimuli , and analyzing the brain responses elicited when a subject encounters these violations violation designs have also been used for hemodynamic studies ( fmri and pet ) : embick and colleagues , for example , used grammatical and spelling violations to investigate the location of syntactic processing in the brain using fmri '' experimental evidence has shown that the instructions given to subjects in an acceptability judgment task can influence the subjects ' brain responses to stimuli some relevant journals include the journal of neurolinguistics and brain and language

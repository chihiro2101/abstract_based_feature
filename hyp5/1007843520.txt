the first standard public telephone kiosk introduced by the united kingdom post office was produced in concrete in 1921 and was designated k1 ( kiosk no.1 ) this design was not of the same family as the familiar red telephone boxes as of 2020 , there are seven k1 boxes in existence , all of which have been listed at grade ii by historic england , with two still located on british streets the first is situated in trinity market in kingston-upon-hull , and the other in bembridge high street , isle of wight the kiosk is in fact outside the former optician 's , now captain stan 's fish shop , 5 high street the red telephone box was the result of a competition in 1924 to design a kiosk that would be acceptable to the london metropolitan boroughs which had hitherto resisted the post office 's effort to erect k1 kiosks on their streets the royal fine art commission was instrumental in the choice of the british standard kiosk because of widespread dissatisfaction with the gpo 's design , the metropolitan boroughs joint standing committee organised a competition for a superior one in 1923 , but the results were disappointing new telephone kiosks '' , the times , 28 march 1925 , p the original wooden prototypes of the entries were later put into public service at under-cover sites around london the post office chose to make scott 's winning design in cast iron ( scott had suggested mild steel ) and to paint it red ( scott had suggested silver , with a '' greeny-blue '' interior ) and , with other minor changes of detail , it was brought into service as the kiosk no.2 or k2 k3 , introduced in 1929 , again by giles gilbert scott , was similar to k2 but was constructed from concrete and intended for nationwide use the standard colour scheme for both the k1 and the k3 was cream , with red glazing bars only a single batch of 50 k4 kiosks were built k5 was a metal-faced plywood construction introduced in 1934 and designed to be assembled and dismantled and used at exhibitions it is not known how many were produced , and there is little evidence they ever reached more than prototype stage the k6 was the first red telephone kiosk to be extensively used outside london , and many thousands were deployed in virtually every town and city , replacing most of the existing kiosks and establishing thousands of new sites the design was again by scott , and was essentially a smaller and more streamlined version of the k2 , intended to be produced at a considerably cheaper cost , and to occupy less pavement space the crown motif ( see below ) , which had previously been pierced through the ironwork to give ventilation , was now embossed in bas-relief in the k6 the number of rows was increased to 8 , and the central column of panes was made considerably wider than those to either side the post office was forced into allowing a less strident grey with red glazing bars scheme for areas of natural and architectural beauty ironically , some of these areas that have preserved their telephone boxes have now painted them red the k1 and the later k3 concrete kiosks were produced at various ( and largely unrecorded ) locations , around the country from 1926 onwards , the fascias of post office kiosks were emblazoned with a prominent crown , representing the british government ( of which the post office was an agency ) the design was initially the '' tudor crown '' , then in widespread use in government service the same crown was used in all parts of the united kingdom and british empire this new symbol therefore began to appear on the fascias of k6 kiosks however , in scotland , following pillar box war , the post office ( like other government agencies there ) began to use , from 1955 , a representation of the actual crown of scotland the crowns were originally painted the same red as the rest of the box however , since the early 1990s , when the heritage value of red kiosks began to be widely recognised , british telecom has picked out the crowns ( on both k2s and k6s ) in gold paint in 1959 architect neville conder was commissioned to design a new box the k8 retained a red colour scheme , but it was a different shade of red : a slightly brighter '' poppy red '' , which went on to be the standard colour across all kiosks the croydon boxes , which featured a black handset silhouette with bright yellow paintwork , were erected as an experimental prototype to replace the red telephone boxes in either the late 1970s or late 1980s , a new , smaller hooded booth was introduced known as booth 7a in february 1981 , it was announced that all the red telephone boxes would be repainted yellow , which was bt 's new corporate colour shortly afterwards , bt announced that only 90 of the 77,000 remaining traditional boxes had been painted different colours '' as an experiment '' and that no final decision had been reached after privatisation in 1982 , british telecom introduced the kx100 , a more utilitarian design , which began to replace most of the existing boxes as of january 2020 , it was estimated that 8,000 traditional red telephone boxes remain in public service following a competition by a girl guide unit in 2011 to find a use for their local disused telephone box in glendaruel , argyll , it has been fitted with a defibrillator in 2008 , ten k6 telephone boxes were imported from the united kingdom to the israeli city of petah tikva and installed on its main street , haim ozer manx telecom has left its kiosks in the red colour used by its predecessors british telecom and the gpo it was originally intended that the last upright box was to contain a working telephone the red telephone box has appeared in british pop culture file : red telephonebox bielefeld city.jpg telephone box standing in

the first standard public telephone kiosk introduced by the united kingdom post office was produced in concrete in 1921 and was designated k1 ( kiosk no.1 ) this design was not of the same family as the familiar red telephone boxes as of 2020 , there are seven k1 boxes in existence , all of which have been listed at grade ii by historic england , with two still located on british streets the kiosk is in fact outside the former optician 's , now captain stan 's fish shop , 5 high street the red telephone box was the result of a competition in 1924 to design a kiosk that would be acceptable to the london metropolitan boroughs which had hitherto resisted the post office 's effort to erect k1 kiosks on their streets the royal fine art commission was instrumental in the choice of the british standard kiosk because of widespread dissatisfaction with the gpo 's design , the metropolitan boroughs joint standing committee organised a competition for a superior one in 1923 , but the results were disappointing new telephone kiosks '' , the times , 28 march 1925 , p the original wooden prototypes of the entries were later put into public service at under-cover sites around london that of scott 's design is the only one known to survive and is still where it was originally placed , in the left entrance arch to the royal academy cheaper than the k2 , it was still significantly more costly than the k1 and so that remained the choice for low-revenue sites the standard colour scheme for both the k1 and the k3 was cream , with red glazing bars a rare surviving k3 kiosk can be seen beside the penguin beach exhibit at zsl london zoo , where it has been protected from the weather by the projecting eaves and recently restored to its original colour scheme in 1935 there had been 19,000 public telephones in the uk : by 1940 , thanks to the k6 , there were 35,000 the design was again by scott , and was essentially a smaller and more streamlined version of the k2 , intended to be produced at a considerably cheaper cost , and to occupy less pavement space this improved visibility , and gave a more horizontal appearance to the windows , again in keeping with '' moderne '' principles the k6 has since become a british icon , but it was not universally loved at the start the red colour caused particular local difficulties and there were many requests for less visible colours the post office was forced into allowing a less strident grey with red glazing bars scheme for areas of natural and architectural beauty ironically , some of these areas that have preserved their telephone boxes have now painted them red the k6 was the most prolific kiosk in the uk and its growth , from 1935 , can be seen from the bt archives : the other two manufacturers were mcdowall steven and bratt colbran , both of which produced only relatively small batches of the pre-war mk1 k6 the same crown was used in all parts of the united kingdom and british empire on the k6 , a separate ventilation slot was provided , and the crown was embossed in bas-relief this new symbol therefore began to appear on the fascias of k6 kiosks to accommodate the two different designs of crown on k6 kiosks , the fascia sections were henceforth cast with a slot in them , into which a plate bearing the appropriate crown was inserted before the roof section was fitted the crowns were originally painted the same red as the rest of the box however , since the early 1990s , when the heritage value of red kiosks began to be widely recognised , british telecom has picked out the crowns ( on both k2s and k6s ) in gold paint kiosks installed in kingston upon hull were not fitted with a crown , as those kiosks were installed by the hull corporation ( later hull city council , then kingston communications ) it was used primarily for new sites ; around 11000 were installed , replacing earlier models only when they needed relocating or had been damaged beyond repair there were two versions – the mk1 and the mk2 – with the most visible difference being in the detail of the roof and the surround of the 'telephone ' opals the croydon boxes , which featured a black handset silhouette with bright yellow paintwork , were erected as an experimental prototype to replace the red telephone boxes however , whilst the trials were successful , the quality of the materials and design made it too expensive for the post office to mass-produce and the design was not adopted these yellow booths were introduced into areas where previous red telephone boxes had been vandalised or even pulled out of the ground they became known as '' oakham '' boxes – a reference to the similarity in shape with an oak ham tin in 1980 , in preparation for privatization , post office telephones was rebranded as british telecom ( bt ) in february 1981 , it was announced that all the red telephone boxes would be repainted yellow , which was bt 's new corporate colour there was an immediate public outcry ; the daily mail launched a campaign '' against the yellow peril '' and questions were asked in parliament in the house of lords , the earl of gowrie , the minister of state for employment , called on bt '' to abandon this ridiculous scheme '' shortly afterwards , bt announced that only 90 of the 77,000 remaining traditional boxes had been painted different colours '' as an experiment '' and that no final decision had been reached thames town , an imitation english town on the outskirts of shanghai , includes red telephone boxes kingston upon hull ran a municipal telephone system from 1904 in 2016 , british chef gordon ramsay opened a british-themed fish restaurant in the las vegas strip , with the doors to the entrance resembling the red telephone box the telephone box complete illustrated history of the red telephone box

the first standard public telephone kiosk introduced by the united kingdom post office was produced in concrete in 1921 and was designated k1 ( kiosk no.1 ) this design was not of the same family as the familiar red telephone boxes as of 2020 , there are seven k1 boxes in existence , all of which have been listed at grade ii by historic england , with two still located on british streets the kiosk is in fact outside the former optician 's , now captain stan 's fish shop , 5 high street the red telephone box was the result of a competition in 1924 to design a kiosk that would be acceptable to the london metropolitan boroughs which had hitherto resisted the post office 's effort to erect k1 kiosks on their streets the royal fine art commission was instrumental in the choice of the british standard kiosk because of widespread dissatisfaction with the gpo 's design , the metropolitan boroughs joint standing committee organised a competition for a superior one in 1923 , but the results were disappointing new telephone kiosks '' , the times , 28 march 1925 , p from 1926 k2 was deployed in and around london and the k1 continued to be erected elsewhere a rare surviving k3 kiosk can be seen beside the penguin beach exhibit at zsl london zoo , where it has been protected from the weather by the projecting eaves and recently restored to its original colour scheme k4 ( designed by the post office engineering department in 1927 ) incorporated a post box and machines for buying postage stamps on the exterior some contemporary reports said the noise of the stamp-machines in operation disturbed phone-users , and the rolls of stamps in the machines became damp and stuck together in wet weather a fine example of a k4 may also be found outside the station building at bewdley on the severn valley railway it is not known how many were produced , and there is little evidence they ever reached more than prototype stage a fully detailed replica ( constructed using the original drawings ) can be seen at the avoncroft museum ( bromsgrove , worcestershire ) , as part of the national telephone kiosk collection in 1935 the k6 ( kiosk number six ) was designed to commemorate the silver jubilee of george v the k6 was the first red telephone kiosk to be extensively used outside london , and many thousands were deployed in virtually every town and city , replacing most of the existing kiosks and establishing thousands of new sites the crown motif ( see below ) , which had previously been pierced through the ironwork to give ventilation , was now embossed in bas-relief the paint colour used most widely today is known as '' currant red '' and is defined by a british standard , bs381c-red539 the k6 was the most prolific kiosk in the uk and its growth , from 1935 , can be seen from the bt archives : this made quality control and supervision of the manufacturing process difficult , when compared to the gpo 's experience with cast-iron post boxes , and was an important aspect of the gpo 's move towards cast-iron telephone kiosks the other two manufacturers were mcdowall steven and bratt colbran , both of which produced only relatively small batches of the pre-war mk1 k6 in 1953 the new queen , elizabeth ii , decided to replace the tudor crown in all contexts with a representation of the actual crown generally used for british coronations , the st edward 's crown the crowns were originally painted the same red as the rest of the box however , since the early 1990s , when the heritage value of red kiosks began to be widely recognised , british telecom has picked out the crowns ( on both k2s and k6s ) in gold paint kiosks installed in kingston upon hull were not fitted with a crown , as those kiosks were installed by the hull corporation ( later hull city council , then kingston communications ) in 1959 architect neville conder was commissioned to design a new box it was used primarily for new sites ; around 11000 were installed , replacing earlier models only when they needed relocating or had been damaged beyond repair the k8 retained a red colour scheme , but it was a different shade of red : a slightly brighter '' poppy red '' , which went on to be the standard colour across all kiosks there were two versions – the mk1 and the mk2 – with the most visible difference being in the detail of the roof and the surround of the 'telephone ' opals with regards to create a new box with easier access , lower maintenance and brighter lighting , the post office introduced a prototype run of '' croydon '' telephone boxes from 1972 , named as such because they were erected in croydon these yellow booths were introduced into areas where previous red telephone boxes had been vandalised or even pulled out of the ground there was an immediate public outcry ; the daily mail launched a campaign '' against the yellow peril '' and questions were asked in parliament shortly afterwards , bt announced that only 90 of the 77,000 remaining traditional boxes had been painted different colours '' as an experiment '' and that no final decision had been reached they are expensive and difficult to clean and maintain and can not be used by handicapped people '' many local authorities used legislation designed to protect buildings of architectural or historic importance to keep old telephone boxes in prominent locations and around 2,000 of them were given listed status several thousand others were left on low-revenue mostly rural sites but many thousands of recovered k2 and k6 boxes were sold off as of january 2020 , it was estimated that 8,000 traditional red telephone boxes remain in public service little-used red telephone boxes can be adopted by parish councils in england for other uses british k6 phone boxes are to be found , painted green , in the centre of kinsale , an old historic town in county cork within the republic of ireland boxes can also be found in the centre of the town of chinon , france , and in the german towns of bad münstereifel , bielefeld and eppingen manx telecom has left its kiosks in the red colour used by its predecessors british telecom and the gpo it takes the form of a row of twelve k6 telephone boxes , the first one upright , the others gradually falling over like dominoes the telephone box complete illustrated history of the red telephone box

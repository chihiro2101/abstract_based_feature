the first standard public telephone kiosk introduced by the united kingdom post office was produced in concrete in 1921 and was designated k1 ( kiosk no.1 ) this design was not of the same family as the familiar red telephone boxes as of 2020 , there are seven k1 boxes in existence , all of which have been listed at grade ii by historic england , with two still located on british streets the kiosk is in fact outside the former optician 's , now captain stan 's fish shop , 5 high street the red telephone box was the result of a competition in 1924 to design a kiosk that would be acceptable to the london metropolitan boroughs which had hitherto resisted the post office 's effort to erect k1 kiosks on their streets the royal fine art commission was instrumental in the choice of the british standard kiosk because of widespread dissatisfaction with the gpo 's design , the metropolitan boroughs joint standing committee organised a competition for a superior one in 1923 , but the results were disappointing the organisers invited entries from three respected architects and , along with the designs from the post office and from the birmingham civic society , the fine arts commission judged the competition and selected the design submitted by sir giles gilbert scott the original wooden prototypes of the entries were later put into public service at under-cover sites around london that of scott 's design is the only one known to survive and is still where it was originally placed , in the left entrance arch to the royal academy cheaper than the k2 , it was still significantly more costly than the k1 and so that remained the choice for low-revenue sites a rare surviving k3 kiosk can be seen beside the penguin beach exhibit at zsl london zoo , where it has been protected from the weather by the projecting eaves and recently restored to its original colour scheme k4 ( designed by the post office engineering department in 1927 ) incorporated a post box and machines for buying postage stamps on the exterior ten survive with four in public use at frodsham , warrington , whitley bay and near tunstall , east riding of yorkshire a fully detailed replica ( constructed using the original drawings ) can be seen at the avoncroft museum ( bromsgrove , worcestershire ) , as part of the national telephone kiosk collection in 1935 the k6 ( kiosk number six ) was designed to commemorate the silver jubilee of george v the door and two glazed sides of the k2 each had 18 equal-sized panes of glass arranged in 6 rows of 3 in the k6 the number of rows was increased to 8 , and the central column of panes was made considerably wider than those to either side this improved visibility , and gave a more horizontal appearance to the windows , again in keeping with '' moderne '' principles the red colour caused particular local difficulties and there were many requests for less visible colours the post office was forced into allowing a less strident grey with red glazing bars scheme for areas of natural and architectural beauty ironically , some of these areas that have preserved their telephone boxes have now painted them red the paint colour used most widely today is known as '' currant red '' and is defined by a british standard , bs381c-red539 this slightly brighter red was introduced with the k8 model in 1968 , but went on to be used across the estate on previous models too a purpose built kiosk trailer was designed from 1953 to reduce the running costs of cranes the k6 was the most prolific kiosk in the uk and its growth , from 1935 , can be seen from the bt archives : the k1 and the later k3 concrete kiosks were produced at various ( and largely unrecorded ) locations , around the country although many kiosks have been fitted with replacement backs over recent years , unmodified examples generally have the identity of their manufacturer marked on a plate on the outside at the bottom of their back panel lf , cc , mf , ms and bc â€“ which were used to various extents over the years a more consistent manufacturer mark can be found at about shoulder height on the inner face of the back panel the more recently erected non-bt k6 kiosks ( generally painted black ) are for the most part new castings , sourced from new manufacturers the design was initially the '' tudor crown '' , then in widespread use in government service on the k6 , a separate ventilation slot was provided , and the crown was embossed in bas-relief in 1953 the new queen , elizabeth ii , decided to replace the tudor crown in all contexts with a representation of the actual crown generally used for british coronations , the st edward 's crown however , in scotland , following pillar box war , the post office ( like other government agencies there ) began to use , from 1955 , a representation of the actual crown of scotland the k8 retained a red colour scheme , but it was a different shade of red : a slightly brighter '' poppy red '' , which went on to be the standard colour across all kiosks while improving visibility and illumination inside the box , these were vulnerable to damage with regards to create a new box with easier access , lower maintenance and brighter lighting , the post office introduced a prototype run of '' croydon '' telephone boxes from 1972 , named as such because they were erected in croydon the croydon boxes , which featured a black handset silhouette with bright yellow paintwork , were erected as an experimental prototype to replace the red telephone boxes in either the late 1970s or late 1980s , a new , smaller hooded booth was introduced known as booth 7a thames town , an imitation english town on the outskirts of shanghai , includes red telephone boxes gibtelecom

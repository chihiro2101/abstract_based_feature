the first standard public telephone kiosk introduced by the united kingdom post office was produced in concrete in 1921 and was designated k1 ( kiosk no.1 ) this design was not of the same family as the familiar red telephone boxes as of 2020 , there are seven k1 boxes in existence , all of which have been listed at grade ii by historic england , with two still located on british streets the kiosk is in fact outside the former optician 's , now captain stan 's fish shop , 5 high street the red telephone box was the result of a competition in 1924 to design a kiosk that would be acceptable to the london metropolitan boroughs which had hitherto resisted the post office 's effort to erect k1 kiosks on their streets the royal fine art commission was instrumental in the choice of the british standard kiosk because of widespread dissatisfaction with the gpo 's design , the metropolitan boroughs joint standing committee organised a competition for a superior one in 1923 , but the results were disappointing new telephone kiosks '' , the times , 28 march 1925 , p that of scott 's design is the only one known to survive and is still where it was originally placed , in the left entrance arch to the royal academy the standard colour scheme for both the k1 and the k3 was cream , with red glazing bars k4 ( designed by the post office engineering department in 1927 ) incorporated a post box and machines for buying postage stamps on the exterior ten survive with four in public use at frodsham , warrington , whitley bay and near tunstall , east riding of yorkshire a fine example of a k4 may also be found outside the station building at bewdley on the severn valley railway k5 was a metal-faced plywood construction introduced in 1934 and designed to be assembled and dismantled and used at exhibitions a fully detailed replica ( constructed using the original drawings ) can be seen at the avoncroft museum ( bromsgrove , worcestershire ) , as part of the national telephone kiosk collection in 1935 the k6 ( kiosk number six ) was designed to commemorate the silver jubilee of george v the design was again by scott , and was essentially a smaller and more streamlined version of the k2 , intended to be produced at a considerably cheaper cost , and to occupy less pavement space this improved visibility , and gave a more horizontal appearance to the windows , again in keeping with '' moderne '' principles the post office was forced into allowing a less strident grey with red glazing bars scheme for areas of natural and architectural beauty ironically , some of these areas that have preserved their telephone boxes have now painted them red the paint colour used most widely today is known as '' currant red '' and is defined by a british standard , bs381c-red539 this slightly brighter red was introduced with the k8 model in 1968 , but went on to be used across the estate on previous models too the k6 was the most prolific kiosk in the uk and its growth , from 1935 , can be seen from the bt archives : the other two manufacturers were mcdowall steven and bratt colbran , both of which produced only relatively small batches of the pre-war mk1 k6 the more recently erected non-bt k6 kiosks ( generally painted black ) are for the most part new castings , sourced from new manufacturers from 1926 onwards , the fascias of post office kiosks were emblazoned with a prominent crown , representing the british government ( of which the post office was an agency ) the design was initially the '' tudor crown '' , then in widespread use in government service the crowns were originally painted the same red as the rest of the box however , since the early 1990s , when the heritage value of red kiosks began to be widely recognised , british telecom has picked out the crowns ( on both k2s and k6s ) in gold paint it was used primarily for new sites ; around 11000 were installed , replacing earlier models only when they needed relocating or had been damaged beyond repair the k8 retained a red colour scheme , but it was a different shade of red : a slightly brighter '' poppy red '' , which went on to be the standard colour across all kiosks there were two versions – the mk1 and the mk2 – with the most visible difference being in the detail of the roof and the surround of the 'telephone ' opals the croydon boxes , which featured a black handset silhouette with bright yellow paintwork , were erected as an experimental prototype to replace the red telephone boxes however , whilst the trials were successful , the quality of the materials and design made it too expensive for the post office to mass-produce and the design was not adopted in either the late 1970s or late 1980s , a new , smaller hooded booth was introduced known as booth 7a these yellow booths were introduced into areas where previous red telephone boxes had been vandalised or even pulled out of the ground in 1980 , in preparation for privatization , post office telephones was rebranded as british telecom ( bt ) there was an immediate public outcry ; the daily mail launched a campaign '' against the yellow peril '' and questions were asked in parliament its most famous contributor was brian may , with his stereoscopic photography show ' a village lost and found ' a red telephone box can also be found on the courthouse square in oxford , mississippi in massachusetts , there is also a red telephone box in the student centre of the massachusetts institute of technology as they are in the us , and not under british restriction , they are fully functional , but with updated electronics to make them code compliant the telephone box complete illustrated history of the red telephone box payphonebox index of british red phone boxes

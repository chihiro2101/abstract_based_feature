the first standard public telephone kiosk introduced by the united kingdom post office was produced in concrete in 1921 and was designated k1 ( kiosk no.1 ) this design was not of the same family as the familiar red telephone boxes as of 2020 , there are seven k1 boxes in existence , all of which have been listed at grade ii by historic england , with two still located on british streets the kiosk is in fact outside the former optician 's , now captain stan 's fish shop , 5 high street the red telephone box was the result of a competition in 1924 to design a kiosk that would be acceptable to the london metropolitan boroughs which had hitherto resisted the post office 's effort to erect k1 kiosks on their streets the royal fine art commission was instrumental in the choice of the british standard kiosk the original wooden prototypes of the entries were later put into public service at under-cover sites around london that of scott 's design is the only one known to survive and is still where it was originally placed , in the left entrance arch to the royal academy k3 , introduced in 1929 , again by giles gilbert scott , was similar to k2 but was constructed from concrete and intended for nationwide use k4 ( designed by the post office engineering department in 1927 ) incorporated a post box and machines for buying postage stamps on the exterior a fully detailed replica ( constructed using the original drawings ) can be seen at the avoncroft museum ( bromsgrove , worcestershire ) , as part of the national telephone kiosk collection in 1935 the k6 ( kiosk number six ) was designed to commemorate the silver jubilee of george v stamp 1989 , pp in the k6 the number of rows was increased to 8 , and the central column of panes was made considerably wider than those to either side the k6 has since become a british icon , but it was not universally loved at the start the red colour caused particular local difficulties and there were many requests for less visible colours the post office was forced into allowing a less strident grey with red glazing bars scheme for areas of natural and architectural beauty the paint colour used most widely today is known as '' currant red '' and is defined by a british standard , bs381c-red539 hence , for complete historical accuracy , any kiosks in pre-1968 settings should really be painted in the previous , and slightly darker , shade bs381c-red538 a purpose built kiosk trailer was designed from 1953 to reduce the running costs of cranes the k6 was the most prolific kiosk in the uk and its growth , from 1935 , can be seen from the bt archives : the k1 and the later k3 concrete kiosks were produced at various ( and largely unrecorded ) locations , around the country this made quality control and supervision of the manufacturing process difficult , when compared to the gpo 's experience with cast-iron post boxes , and was an important aspect of the gpo 's move towards cast-iron telephone kiosks the other two manufacturers were mcdowall steven and bratt colbran , both of which produced only relatively small batches of the pre-war mk1 k6 the more recently erected non-bt k6 kiosks ( generally painted black ) are for the most part new castings , sourced from new manufacturers however , in scotland , following pillar box war , the post office ( like other government agencies there ) began to use , from 1955 , a representation of the actual crown of scotland the crowns were originally painted the same red as the rest of the box however , since the early 1990s , when the heritage value of red kiosks began to be widely recognised , british telecom has picked out the crowns ( on both k2s and k6s ) in gold paint kiosks installed in kingston upon hull were not fitted with a crown , as those kiosks were installed by the hull corporation ( later hull city council , then kingston communications ) it was used primarily for new sites ; around 11000 were installed , replacing earlier models only when they needed relocating or had been damaged beyond repair the k8 retained a red colour scheme , but it was a different shade of red : a slightly brighter '' poppy red '' , which went on to be the standard colour across all kiosks while improving visibility and illumination inside the box , these were vulnerable to damage the croydon boxes , which featured a black handset silhouette with bright yellow paintwork , were erected as an experimental prototype to replace the red telephone boxes these yellow booths were introduced into areas where previous red telephone boxes had been vandalised or even pulled out of the ground in february 1981 , it was announced that all the red telephone boxes would be repainted yellow , which was bt 's new corporate colour in the house of commons , mark lennox-boyd mp asked the prime minister , margaret thatcher , if she would treat the decision '' with the greatest possible dismay '' shortly afterwards , bt announced that only 90 of the 77,000 remaining traditional boxes had been painted different colours '' as an experiment '' and that no final decision had been reached the telephone box book exchange in cutnall green opened in june 2016 its most famous contributor was brian may , with his stereoscopic photography show ' a village lost and found ' a red telephone box can also be found on the courthouse square in oxford , mississippi thames town , an imitation english town on the outskirts of shanghai , includes red telephone boxes there were several such municipal services in the uk , but whereas most had been brought under the post office monopoly by 1913 , hull 's , being very efficient , was allowed to remain under the control of hull corporation ( the city council ) it takes the form of a row of twelve k6 telephone boxes , the first one upright , the others gradually falling over like dominoes file : red telephonebox bielefeld city.jpg telephone box standing in bielefeld , germany

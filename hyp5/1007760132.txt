other developments followed : the laser diode in the 1970s , optical fibers for transmitting information , and the optical amplifier though coined earlier , the term photonics came into common use in the 1980s as fiber-optic data transmission was adopted by telecommunications network operators its use was confirmed when the ieee lasers and electro-optics society established an archival journal named photonics technology letters at the end of the 1980s during the period leading up to the dot-com crash circa 2001 , photonics as a field focused largely on optical telecommunications however , photonics covers a huge range of science and technology applications , including laser manufacturing , biological and chemical sensing , medical diagnostics and therapy , display technology , and optical computing further growth of photonics is likely if current silicon photonics developments are successful classical optics long preceded the discovery that light is quantized , when albert einstein famously explained the photoelectric effect in 1905 optics tools include the refracting lens , the reflecting mirror , and various optical components and instruments developed throughout the 15th to 19th centuries key tenets of classical optics , such as huygens principle , developed in the 17th century , maxwell 's equations and the wave equations , developed in the 19th , do not depend on quantum properties of light photonics is related to quantum optics , optomechanics , electro-optics , optoelectronics and quantum electronics the term photonics more specifically connotes : the particle properties of light , the potential of creating signal processing device technologies using photons , the practical application of optics , and an analogy to electronics the term optoelectronics connotes devices or circuits that comprise both electrical and optical functions , i.e photonics also relates to the emerging science of quantum information and quantum optics economically important applications for semiconductor photonic devices include optical data recording , fiber optic telecommunications , laser printing ( based on xerography ) , displays , and optical pumping of high-power lasers in optical communications optical fibers allow for transmission distances of more than 100 & nbsp ; km without amplification depending on the bit rate and modulation format used for transmission optical amplifiers used in optical communications are erbium-doped fiber amplifiers , semiconductor optical amplifiers , raman amplifiers and optical parametric amplifiers another method is to take the light from a light source and modulate it in an external optical modulator nano-optics op-tec optronics/optoelectronics organic photonics bio-inspired photonics photonics mast ( on submarines ) european photonics industry consortium

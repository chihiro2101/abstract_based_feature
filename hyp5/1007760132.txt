other developments followed : the laser diode in the 1970s , optical fibers for transmitting information , and the optical amplifier though coined earlier , the term photonics came into common use in the 1980s as fiber-optic data transmission was adopted by telecommunications network operators its use was confirmed when the ieee lasers and electro-optics society established an archival journal named photonics technology letters at the end of the 1980s however , photonics covers a huge range of science and technology applications , including laser manufacturing , biological and chemical sensing , medical diagnostics and therapy , display technology , and optical computing further growth of photonics is likely if current silicon photonics developments are successful photonics is related to quantum optics , optomechanics , electro-optics , optoelectronics and quantum electronics quantum optics often connotes fundamental research , whereas photonics is used to connote applied research and development the term photonics more specifically connotes : the particle properties of light , the potential of creating signal processing device technologies using photons , the practical application of optics , and an analogy to electronics the term optoelectronics connotes devices or circuits that comprise both electrical and optical functions , i.e just as applications of electronics have expanded dramatically since the first transistor was invented in 1948 , the unique applications of photonics continue to emerge economically important applications for semiconductor photonic devices include optical data recording , fiber optic telecommunications , laser printing ( based on xerography ) , displays , and optical pumping of high-power lasers the science of photonics includes investigation of the emission , transmission , amplifier , detection , and modulation of light photonics commonly uses semiconductor-based light sources , such as light-emitting diodes ( leds ) , superluminescent diodes , and lasers optical amplifiers used in optical communications are erbium-doped fiber amplifiers , semiconductor optical amplifiers , raman amplifiers and optical parametric amplifiers another method is to take the light from a light source and modulate it in an external optical modulator this area of research focuses on the implementation of photonic systems like high speed photonic networks photonic integrated circuits ( pics ) are optically active integrated semiconductor photonic devices nano-optics op-tec optronics/optoelectronics organic photonics bio-inspired photonics photonics mast ( on submarines ) european photonics industry consortium

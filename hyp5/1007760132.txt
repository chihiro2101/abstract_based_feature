photonics as a field began with the invention of the laser in 1960 though coined earlier , the term photonics came into common use in the 1980s as fiber-optic data transmission was adopted by telecommunications network operators its use was confirmed when the ieee lasers and electro-optics society established an archival journal named photonics technology letters at the end of the 1980s however , photonics covers a huge range of science and technology applications , including laser manufacturing , biological and chemical sensing , medical diagnostics and therapy , display technology , and optical computing responsive photonic nanostructures : smart nanoscale optical materials , editor : yadong yin rsc cambridge 2013 classical optics long preceded the discovery that light is quantized , when albert einstein famously explained the photoelectric effect in 1905 optics tools include the refracting lens , the reflecting mirror , and various optical components and instruments developed throughout the 15th to 19th centuries key tenets of classical optics , such as huygens principle , developed in the 17th century , maxwell 's equations and the wave equations , developed in the 19th , do not depend on quantum properties of light quantum optics often connotes fundamental research , whereas photonics is used to connote applied research and development the term photonics more specifically connotes : the particle properties of light , the potential of creating signal processing device technologies using photons , the practical application of optics , and an analogy to electronics optomechanics , which involves the study of the interaction between light and mechanical vibrations of mesoscopic or macroscopic objects ; opto-atomics , in which devices integrate both photonic and atomic devices for applications such as precision timekeeping , navigation , and metrology ; plasmonics , which studies the interaction between light and plasmons in dielectric and metallic structures jpg thumb a sea mouse ( aphrodita aculeata ) , showing colorful spines , a remarkable example of photonic engineering by a living organism applications of photonics are ubiquitous economically important applications for semiconductor photonic devices include optical data recording , fiber optic telecommunications , laser printing ( based on xerography ) , displays , and optical pumping of high-power lasers other light sources include single photon sources , fluorescent lamps , cathode ray tubes ( crts ) , and plasma screens characteristic for research on semiconductor light sources is the frequent use of iii-v semiconductors instead of the classical semiconductors like silicon and germanium photonics also includes research on photonic systems this also includes research on optical regenerators , which improve optical signal quality nano-optics op-tec optronics/optoelectronics organic photonics bio-inspired photonics photonics mast ( on submarines ) european photonics industry consortium

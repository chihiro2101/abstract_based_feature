photonics as a field began with the invention of the laser in 1960 though coined earlier , the term photonics came into common use in the 1980s as fiber-optic data transmission was adopted by telecommunications network operators its use was confirmed when the ieee lasers and electro-optics society established an archival journal named photonics technology letters at the end of the 1980s further growth of photonics is likely if current silicon photonics developments are successful classical optics long preceded the discovery that light is quantized , when albert einstein famously explained the photoelectric effect in 1905 optics tools include the refracting lens , the reflecting mirror , and various optical components and instruments developed throughout the 15th to 19th centuries key tenets of classical optics , such as huygens principle , developed in the 17th century , maxwell 's equations and the wave equations , developed in the 19th , do not depend on quantum properties of light photonics is related to quantum optics , optomechanics , electro-optics , optoelectronics and quantum electronics quantum optics often connotes fundamental research , whereas photonics is used to connote applied research and development the term photonics more specifically connotes : the particle properties of light , the potential of creating signal processing device technologies using photons , the practical application of optics , and an analogy to electronics , as bulk crystal modulators such as the pockels cell , but also includes advanced imaging sensors programmable photonics , which studies the development of photonic circuits that can be reprogrammed to implement different functions in the same fashion as an fpga jpg thumb a sea mouse ( aphrodita aculeata ) , showing colorful spines , a remarkable example of photonic engineering by a living organism applications of photonics are ubiquitous just as applications of electronics have expanded dramatically since the first transistor was invented in 1948 , the unique applications of photonics continue to emerge the science of photonics includes investigation of the emission , transmission , amplifier , detection , and modulation of light modulation of a light source is used to encode information on a light source beyond this range and bandwidth , photonic integrated circuits are key to enable high-performance , low-cost optical transceivers nano-optics op-tec optronics/optoelectronics organic photonics bio-inspired photonics photonics mast ( on submarines ) european photonics industry consortium

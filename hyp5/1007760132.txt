photonics as a field began with the invention of the laser in 1960 other developments followed : the laser diode in the 1970s , optical fibers for transmitting information , and the optical amplifier though coined earlier , the term photonics came into common use in the 1980s as fiber-optic data transmission was adopted by telecommunications network operators during the period leading up to the dot-com crash circa 2001 , photonics as a field focused largely on optical telecommunications however , photonics covers a huge range of science and technology applications , including laser manufacturing , biological and chemical sensing , medical diagnostics and therapy , display technology , and optical computing classical optics long preceded the discovery that light is quantized , when albert einstein famously explained the photoelectric effect in 1905 key tenets of classical optics , such as huygens principle , developed in the 17th century , maxwell 's equations and the wave equations , developed in the 19th , do not depend on quantum properties of light photonics is related to quantum optics , optomechanics , electro-optics , optoelectronics and quantum electronics quantum optics often connotes fundamental research , whereas photonics is used to connote applied research and development the term photonics more specifically connotes : the particle properties of light , the potential of creating signal processing device technologies using photons , the practical application of optics , and an analogy to electronics the term optoelectronics connotes devices or circuits that comprise both electrical and optical functions , i.e photonics commonly uses semiconductor-based light sources , such as light-emitting diodes ( leds ) , superluminescent diodes , and lasers a very advanced research topic within photonics is the investigation and fabrication of special structures and '' materials '' with engineered optical properties optical amplifiers used in optical communications are erbium-doped fiber amplifiers , semiconductor optical amplifiers , raman amplifiers and optical parametric amplifiers a very advanced research topic on optical amplifiers is the research on quantum dot semiconductor optical amplifiers modulation of a light source is used to encode information on a light source photonic integrated circuits ( pics ) are optically active integrated semiconductor photonic devices nano-optics op-tec optronics/optoelectronics organic photonics bio-inspired photonics photonics mast ( on submarines ) european photonics industry consortium

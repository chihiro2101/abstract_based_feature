other developments followed : the laser diode in the 1970s , optical fibers for transmitting information , and the optical amplifier though coined earlier , the term photonics came into common use in the 1980s as fiber-optic data transmission was adopted by telecommunications network operators however , photonics covers a huge range of science and technology applications , including laser manufacturing , biological and chemical sensing , medical diagnostics and therapy , display technology , and optical computing further growth of photonics is likely if current silicon photonics developments are successful photonics is related to quantum optics , optomechanics , electro-optics , optoelectronics and quantum electronics quantum optics often connotes fundamental research , whereas photonics is used to connote applied research and development the term photonics more specifically connotes : the particle properties of light , the potential of creating signal processing device technologies using photons , the practical application of optics , and an analogy to electronics the term optoelectronics connotes devices or circuits that comprise both electrical and optical functions , i.e , as bulk crystal modulators such as the pockels cell , but also includes advanced imaging sensors jpg thumb a sea mouse ( aphrodita aculeata ) , showing colorful spines , a remarkable example of photonic engineering by a living organism applications of photonics are ubiquitous the potential applications of photonics are virtually unlimited and include chemical synthesis , medical diagnostics , on-chip data communication , sensors , laser defense , and fusion energy , to name several interesting additional examples the science of photonics includes investigation of the emission , transmission , amplifier , detection , and modulation of light photonics commonly uses semiconductor-based light sources , such as light-emitting diodes ( leds ) , superluminescent diodes , and lasers other light sources include single photon sources , fluorescent lamps , cathode ray tubes ( crts ) , and plasma screens a very advanced research topic within photonics is the investigation and fabrication of special structures and '' materials '' with engineered optical properties the leading commercial application of pics are optical transceivers for data center optical networks sensors : photons can also be used to detect and differentiate the optical properties of materials nano-optics op-tec optronics/optoelectronics organic photonics bio-inspired photonics photonics mast ( on submarines ) european photonics industry consortium

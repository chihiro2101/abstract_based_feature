get some of his money back on the equipment and so on anyway , with the heavy work schedules and the pressures and so on , i ended up collapsing on stage one night and the other members of the band decided i should go it was funny because i did n't want to go and there was a lot of animosity but at the same time it was a tremendous relief '' thus the '' classic '' uriah heep formed and , according to biographer k '' the result of this newly found chemistry was the demons and wizards album , which reached no while its title and roger dean 's sleeve both suggested that the band was romantically working medieval myth into their songs—and surely songs like '' rainbow demon '' and '' the wizard '' ( co-written by mark clarke , during his short stay ) did have thematic links with fantasy world—a more straightforward , hard-rocking approach was also apparent '' both critics and the band 's aficionados hold the album in high regard , which , according to allmusic , '' solidified uriah heep 's reputation as a master of gothic-inflected heavy metal 31 us ) came out , with '' sweet lorraine '' released as an american single and the title track ( a multi-part fantasy epic featuring hensley–byron vocal duel and box 's extensive guitar solo in the middle ) being the album 's highlight having completed another japanese tour , the band ( due to tax problems ) went abroad to record to chateau d'herouville in france soon after going out of hospital , thain , in sounds , openly accused manager gerry bron of having turned uriah heep into a mere '' financial thing '' and was fired two months after the group 's final gig of 1974 at new theatre in oxford , england on 14 december john wetton ( ex-family and king crimson ) joined the band in march 1975 and with him return to fantasy ( june 1975 ) was recorded ; representing a revitalised uriah heep , it soared up to no the following '' year-long world tour '' ( according to a headline in nme ) , was marred by a new accident paul , minnesota , john wetton had an accident of his own when he ( like his predecessor , thain ) received an electric shock on stage in november 1975 the best of uriah heep compilation was released , preceded by two solo albums : byron 's debut take no prisoners and hensley 's second , eager to please it was considered lightweight ; even box stated : '' less of the 'eavy and more of the 'umble '' ( making pointed reference to uriah heep 's self-description as '' 'umble '' in dickens ' david copperfield ) the manager later insisted the result was heep 's worst album , while hensley accused the manager of deliberately ignoring the band 's interests it was when the show started to come second that the problems began , '' hensley remembered soon bassist john wetton announced he was quitting '' firefly was released in february 1977 , displaying '' renewed effervescence and energy in unveiling what was clearly a new beginning for heep '' ( per '' the single '' free me '' ( whose '' acoustic style and accent on harmonies brought the group dangerously close to eagles territory , '' according to allmusic ) became an international hit in germany the album sold over a million copies and became uriah heep 's most successful , which coincided with the success of the re-released '' lady in black '' for some time during this period , there were three uriah heep singles sitting together in the german top 20 , these being '' wise man '' ( from firefly ) , '' lady in black '' and '' free me '' in the end of 1978 , fallen angel came out , having completed a hat-trick of studio albums to feature a consistent lineup ( only the second time in their career that they had done so ) '' too poppy '' for mick box 's liking ( but still , '' too eccentric to fit the bill of an aor record , '' according to allmusic ) , it was well received at the time ( sounds gave it 4 stars ) but failed to chart '' yet another technically sound but artistically bland recording from uriah heep '' ( according to allmusic ) failed to chart and marked the end of the band 's contract with legacy records – allmusic was well received and in retrospect is seen as the band 's return to form , the key to success being ( according to critic donald a www.classicrockmagazine.com uriah heep released their 23rd studio album into the wild on 15 april 2011 in europe ( 3 may in north america ) via frontiers records the album featured new bass player dave rimmer who had been a substitute for trevor bolder the previous year

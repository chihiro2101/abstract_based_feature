the band 's origins go back to 1967 when 19-year-old guitarist mick box formed a band in brentwood called hogwash , which began playing in local clubs and pubs when the band 's singer left , drummer roger penlington suggested his cousin david byron ( who knew the band ) as a replacement box and garrick instantly formed a songwriting partnership and , having higher musical aspirations than their colleagues , decided to give up their day jobs and go professional they set up a new band called spice ; it was then that david garrick changed his surname to byron drummer alex napier ( born 1947 in glasgow , strathclyde , scotland ) joined , having answered a music paper ad ; bassist paul newton of the gods completed the line-up '' managed initially by newton 's father , the band climbed their way up to the marquee level , then got signed by gerry bron ( the hit record productions ltd '' i thought they were a band i could develop and i took them on that basis , '' remembered bron later he became the band 's manager and signed them to vertigo records , the newly formed philips label then the name was changed to that of the well-known character from david copperfield , uriah heep ( for , according to biographer kirk blows , '' dickens ' name being everywhere around christmas '69 due to it being the hundredth anniversary of his death '' ) according to dave ling 's 2001 autobiography of the band , wizards and demons , the uriah heep story , though the '' uriah heep '' moniker was chosen in december 1969 , the band continued to play gigs as '' spice '' until ken hensley joined in february 1970 i was a big vanilla fudge fan , with their hammond organ and searing guitar on top , and we had david 's high vibrato vocals anyway so that 's how we decided to shape it , '' box recalled gerry bron brought in session player colin wood , followed by ken hensley , a former colleague of newton in the gods , who was then playing guitar in toe fat '' i saw a lot of potential in the group to do something very different , '' remembered hensley the album 's title references the signature phrase of the dickens character uriah heep ( '' very 'umble '' ) in a 1989 interview , mick box recalled , '' the funny thing was we wrote it at the hanwell community centre , and deep purple were rehearsing in the room next door to us you can imagine the kind of racket we were both making between us '' during the winter of 1970 , three quarters into the recording of the album , drummer alex napier was replaced by nigel olsson , recommended to byron by elton john '' those unfamiliar with uriah heep may want to try out demons and wizards or a compilation first , but anyone with a serious interest in uriah heep or the roots of heavy metal will find plenty to like on in the course of the album 's making the writing relationship between box , byron and hensley was beginning to develop it was like it was meant to be , there was that kind of chemistry , '' mick box recalled when nigel olsson returned to elton john 's group in the spring of 1970 , keith baker took his place the band 's second album , salisbury ( february 1971 ) , was more squarely in the progressive rock genre , with its 16-minute title track featuring a 24-piece orchestra in december 1970 keith baker left the band and was replaced by iain clark ( from another vertigo band cressida ) with him the band toured germany in late december 1970/january 1971 and made their first us tour in the spring of 1971 , supporting three dog night and steppenwolf '' it was the point in time when the band really found a solid musical direction , '' said bron later '' i think that 'july morning ' is one of the best examples of the way the band was developing at that point in time feeling marginalised and having recently been badly shaken up when he was involved in an accident in germany in one of the band 's cars , first bassist paul newton left , in november of '71 , and was briefly replaced by mark clarke when we became uriah heep and ken joined the band – and ken is the first to admit it – he had very definite ideas about what he wanted to do in a band anyway , with the heavy work schedules and the pressures and so on , i ended up collapsing on stage one night and the other members of the band decided i should go new zealander gary thain , a then member of keef hartley band , joined uriah heep as a permanent member in february 1972 halfway through another american tour , replacing mark clarke who was exhausted and nearing a mental breakdown '' gary just had a style about him , it was incredible because every bass player in the world that i 've ever known has always loved his style , with those melodic bass lines , '' box later said thus the '' classic '' uriah heep formed and , according to biographer k while its title and roger dean 's sleeve both suggested that the band was romantically working medieval myth into their songs—and surely songs like '' rainbow demon '' and '' the wizard '' ( co-written by mark clarke , during his short stay ) did have thematic links with fantasy world—a more straightforward , hard-rocking approach was also apparent to discard any possible insinuations concerning any kind of concept behind it , hensley 's note on the sleeve declared the album was '' '' ken hensley remembered : two singles were released from the album : '' the wizard '' and '' easy livin ' '' , the second ( a defiant rocker , according to blows , '' 39 on the billboard hot 100 '' david was the communication point , the focal point of the whole group 's stage presentation ken hensley meanwhile had been gradually recording his own , mellower material ; his solo debut proud words on a dusty shelf was released the same year our communication was falling apart , we were arguing over stuff like royalties and we were getting involved in matters beyond music , '' hensley said there was also a little bit of friction because ( artistic ) kenny did n't like all the attention that ( flamboyant ) david was getting a year later , on 8 december 1975 , gary thain was found dead in his norwood green home , having overdosed on heroin john wetton ( ex-family and king crimson ) joined the band in march 1975 and with him return to fantasy ( june 1975 ) was recorded ; representing a revitalised uriah heep , it soared up to no mick box fell off stage in louisville , kentucky on 2 august 1975 , breaking the radial bone in his right arm ( but he persevered through both the set and the tour , receiving three injections a night ) on 26 march 1976 at roy wilkins auditorium in st paul , minnesota , john wetton had an accident of his own when he ( like his predecessor , thain ) received an electric shock on stage in november 1975 the best of uriah heep compilation was released , preceded by two solo albums : byron 's debut take no prisoners and hensley 's second , eager to please box later said , '' image-wise he was n't quite what we were looking for , but his pipes were perfect and so we went for the music end of it 56 ) after its us release in september 1982 and the band successfully performed at the castle donington monsters of rock event a few weeks prior to this , on 21 august equator ( march 1985 ) sold poorly , due to the fact that '' cbs just did a terrible job getting it into the shops , '' as box saw it british bassist john jowitt ( ark , iq , arena ) came in temporarily , followed by dave rimmer uriah heep 's distinctive features have always included a massive keyboard sound , strong vocal harmonies and ( in the early years ) david byron 's quasi-operatic vocals studio albums ( of original material )

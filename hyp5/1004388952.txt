the band 's origins go back to 1967 when 19-year-old guitarist mick box formed a band in brentwood called hogwash , which began playing in local clubs and pubs when the band 's singer left , drummer roger penlington suggested his cousin david byron ( who knew the band ) as a replacement box and garrick instantly formed a songwriting partnership and , having higher musical aspirations than their colleagues , decided to give up their day jobs and go professional they set up a new band called spice ; it was then that david garrick changed his surname to byron drummer alex napier ( born 1947 in glasgow , strathclyde , scotland ) joined , having answered a music paper ad ; bassist paul newton of the gods completed the line-up from the very beginning , spice avoided playing covers and , according to box , always strove '' '' managed initially by newton 's father , the band climbed their way up to the marquee level , then got signed by gerry bron ( the hit record productions ltd '' i thought they were a band i could develop and i took them on that basis , '' remembered bron later then the name was changed to that of the well-known character from david copperfield , uriah heep ( for , according to biographer kirk blows , '' dickens ' name being everywhere around christmas '69 due to it being the hundredth anniversary of his death '' ) according to dave ling 's 2001 autobiography of the band , wizards and demons , the uriah heep story , though the '' uriah heep '' moniker was chosen in december 1969 , the band continued to play gigs as '' spice '' until ken hensley joined in february 1970 i was a big vanilla fudge fan , with their hammond organ and searing guitar on top , and we had david 's high vibrato vocals anyway so that 's how we decided to shape it , '' box recalled '' i saw a lot of potential in the group to do something very different , '' remembered hensley hensley had little to contribute to the debut : box and byron wrote most of the material , including '' gypsy '' , in many ways ( according to blows ) '' '' during the winter of 1970 , three quarters into the recording of the album , drummer alex napier was replaced by nigel olsson , recommended to byron by elton john the debut was not popular with rock critics ( especially in the usa where rolling stone reviewer melissa mills infamously promised to commit suicide '' if this band makes it '' ) but in retrospect the attitude towards it changed '' those unfamiliar with uriah heep may want to try out demons and wizards or a compilation first , but anyone with a serious interest in uriah heep or the roots of heavy metal will find plenty to like on very 'umble , '' advised critic donald a it was like it was meant to be , there was that kind of chemistry , '' mick box recalled when nigel olsson returned to elton john 's group in the spring of 1970 , keith baker took his place the band 's second album , salisbury ( february 1971 ) , was more squarely in the progressive rock genre , with its 16-minute title track featuring a 24-piece orchestra in december 1970 keith baker left the band and was replaced by iain clark ( from another vertigo band cressida ) with him the band toured germany in late december 1970/january 1971 and made their first us tour in the spring of 1971 , supporting three dog night and steppenwolf the third album was recorded in the summer months of 1971 , during the band 's three visits to lansdowne '' i think that 'july morning ' is one of the best examples of the way the band was developing at that point in time by the end of 1971 it became clear , according to hensley , that he , byron and box had become the tightly knit nucleus of the band feeling marginalised and having recently been badly shaken up when he was involved in an accident in germany in one of the band 's cars , first bassist paul newton left , in november of '71 , and was briefly replaced by mark clarke newton recalled in a 2000 interview on uriah heep 's website his departure : '' well , as you know , my father managed the band in the early days , with the gods and spice when we became uriah heep and ken joined the band – and ken is the first to admit it – he had very definite ideas about what he wanted to do in a band i suppose in some ways it was like the band was a vehicle which ken needed and used to put his own ideas together there was a lot of unhappiness on all sorts of levels and everybody was unhappy in a lot of ways anyway , with the heavy work schedules and the pressures and so on , i ended up collapsing on stage one night and the other members of the band decided i should go it was funny because i did n't want to go and there was a lot of animosity but at the same time it was a tremendous relief '' just a collection of our songs that we had a good time recording '' ken hensley remembered : two singles were released from the album : '' the wizard '' and '' easy livin ' '' , the second ( a defiant rocker , according to blows , '' 31 us ) came out , with '' sweet lorraine '' released as an american single and the title track ( a multi-part fantasy epic featuring hensley–byron vocal duel and box 's extensive guitar solo in the middle ) being the album 's highlight '' uriah heep used to have an image , now they have personality , '' wrote melody maker in 1973 a lavishly packaged ( an eight-page booklet plus ) double album uriah heep live followed , recorded at the birmingham town hall in january 1973 having completed another japanese tour , the band ( due to tax problems ) went abroad to record to chateau d'herouville in france '' recording abroad disrupted the band 's normal method of operation and that had a big negative effect on the group our communication was falling apart , we were arguing over stuff like royalties and we were getting involved in matters beyond music , '' hensley said john wetton ( ex-family and king crimson ) joined the band in march 1975 and with him return to fantasy ( june 1975 ) was recorded ; representing a revitalised uriah heep , it soared up to no the following '' year-long world tour '' ( according to a headline in nme ) , was marred by a new accident it was considered lightweight ; even box stated : '' less of the 'eavy and more of the 'umble '' ( making pointed reference to uriah heep 's self-description as '' 'umble '' in dickens ' david copperfield ) hensley later explained , '' when he joined , we thought that we could replace a great bass player ( thain ) with another great bass player , but we ignored the personality factor , which is crucial in germany the album sold over a million copies and became uriah heep 's most successful , which coincided with the success of the re-released '' lady in black '' for some time during this period , there were three uriah heep singles sitting together in the german top 20 , these being '' wise man '' ( from firefly ) , '' lady in black '' and '' free me '' several tracks of the next album had to be re-recorded with a new drummer , chris slade ( of the manfred mann 's earth band ) '' yet another technically sound but artistically bland recording from uriah heep '' ( according to allmusic ) failed to chart and marked the end of the band 's contract with legacy records all the while mick box acted as a manager for the band until , on 5 april 2005 , they retained simon porter as their manager uriah heep entered the studio in january 2014 to begin recording their 24th studio album outsider , which was released in june 2014 in a july 2020 interview with sea of tranquility , guitarist mick box and bassist dave rimmer confirmed that uriah heep are scheduled to begin recording their 26th studio album in early 2021 studio albums ( of original material )

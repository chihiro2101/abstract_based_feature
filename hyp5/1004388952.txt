the band 's origins go back to 1967 when 19-year-old guitarist mick box formed a band in brentwood called hogwash , which began playing in local clubs and pubs when the band 's singer left , drummer roger penlington suggested his cousin david byron ( who knew the band ) as a replacement box and garrick instantly formed a songwriting partnership and , having higher musical aspirations than their colleagues , decided to give up their day jobs and go professional they set up a new band called spice ; it was then that david garrick changed his surname to byron drummer alex napier ( born 1947 in glasgow , strathclyde , scotland ) joined , having answered a music paper ad ; bassist paul newton of the gods completed the line-up '' i thought they were a band i could develop and i took them on that basis , '' remembered bron later he became the band 's manager and signed them to vertigo records , the newly formed philips label the four-piece found themselves booked into the lansdowne studios in london , still under the name of spice then the name was changed to that of the well-known character from david copperfield , uriah heep ( for , according to biographer kirk blows , '' dickens ' name being everywhere around christmas '69 due to it being the hundredth anniversary of his death '' ) according to dave ling 's 2001 autobiography of the band , wizards and demons , the uriah heep story , though the '' uriah heep '' moniker was chosen in december 1969 , the band continued to play gigs as '' spice '' until ken hensley joined in february 1970 '' we 'd actually recorded half the first album when we decided that keyboards would be good for our sound gerry bron brought in session player colin wood , followed by ken hensley , a former colleague of newton in the gods , who was then playing guitar in toe fat '' i saw a lot of potential in the group to do something very different , '' remembered hensley in a 1989 interview , mick box recalled , '' the funny thing was we wrote it at the hanwell community centre , and deep purple were rehearsing in the room next door to us '' during the winter of 1970 , three quarters into the recording of the album , drummer alex napier was replaced by nigel olsson , recommended to byron by elton john the debut was not popular with rock critics ( especially in the usa where rolling stone reviewer melissa mills infamously promised to commit suicide '' if this band makes it '' ) but in retrospect the attitude towards it changed '' those unfamiliar with uriah heep may want to try out demons and wizards or a compilation first , but anyone with a serious interest in uriah heep or the roots of heavy metal will find plenty to like on the band 's second album , salisbury ( february 1971 ) , was more squarely in the progressive rock genre , with its 16-minute title track featuring a 24-piece orchestra in december 1970 keith baker left the band and was replaced by iain clark ( from another vertigo band cressida ) with him the band toured germany in late december 1970/january 1971 and made their first us tour in the spring of 1971 , supporting three dog night and steppenwolf '' it was the point in time when the band really found a solid musical direction , '' said bron later the third album , look at yourself , released in october 1971 , marked the solidification of disparate ideas that had been a prominent feature of salisbury and presented the unified sound and direction feeling marginalised and having recently been badly shaken up when he was involved in an accident in germany in one of the band 's cars , first bassist paul newton left , in november of '71 , and was briefly replaced by mark clarke newton recalled in a 2000 interview on uriah heep 's website his departure : '' well , as you know , my father managed the band in the early days , with the gods and spice i suppose in some ways it was like the band was a vehicle which ken needed and used to put his own ideas together it was funny because i did n't want to go and there was a lot of animosity but at the same time it was a tremendous relief '' '' gary just had a style about him , it was incredible because every bass player in the world that i 've ever known has always loved his style , with those melodic bass lines , '' box later said '' ken hensley remembered : two singles were released from the album : '' the wizard '' and '' easy livin ' '' , the second ( a defiant rocker , according to blows , '' he had so much charisma , so much ability , '' admitted hensley many years later having completed another japanese tour , the band ( due to tax problems ) went abroad to record to chateau d'herouville in france 33 us ) was created with '' stealin ' '' released as a single wonderworld ( june 1974 ) , recorded in munich 's musicland studios in january , disappointed fans and band members alike our communication was falling apart , we were arguing over stuff like royalties and we were getting involved in matters beyond music , '' hensley said soon after going out of hospital , thain , in sounds , openly accused manager gerry bron of having turned uriah heep into a mere '' financial thing '' and was fired two months after the group 's final gig of 1974 at new theatre in oxford , england on 14 december the following '' year-long world tour '' ( according to a headline in nme ) , was marred by a new accident mick box fell off stage in louisville , kentucky on 2 august 1975 , breaking the radial bone in his right arm ( but he persevered through both the set and the tour , receiving three injections a night ) in november 1975 the best of uriah heep compilation was released , preceded by two solo albums : byron 's debut take no prisoners and hensley 's second , eager to please with bron committed to non-musical projects ( including his air-taxi service ) the band decided to produce the album themselves the manager later insisted the result was heep 's worst album , while hensley accused the manager of deliberately ignoring the band 's interests in july 1976 , after the final show of a spanish tour , byron was sacked soon bassist john wetton announced he was quitting hensley later explained , '' when he joined , we thought that we could replace a great bass player ( thain ) with another great bass player , but we ignored the personality factor , which is crucial box later said , '' image-wise he was n't quite what we were looking for , but his pipes were perfect and so we went for the music end of it '' hensley agreed : '' he had a voice that i thought would give a new dimension '' the band then toured the usa supporting kiss paul stanley later recalled , '' they were incredibly professional , and so consistent that their worst nights were excellent and their best were tremendous blend of sharp , short rockers and pop-friendly ballads '' looked like '' an attempt to court the american aor market in germany the album sold over a million copies and became uriah heep 's most successful , which coincided with the success of the re-released '' lady in black '' not long before its release daisley left the band to return to ozzy osbourne and trevor bolder re-joined uriah heep totally exhausted and having serious voice problems , goalby left in november 1985 after an australian tour uriah heep played an electric show the first night and an all acoustic show the second in a july 2020 interview with sea of tranquility , guitarist mick box and bassist dave rimmer confirmed that uriah heep are scheduled to begin recording their 26th studio album in early 2021

the band 's origins go back to 1967 when 19-year-old guitarist mick box formed a band in brentwood called hogwash , which began playing in local clubs and pubs when the band 's singer left , drummer roger penlington suggested his cousin david byron ( who knew the band ) as a replacement box and garrick instantly formed a songwriting partnership and , having higher musical aspirations than their colleagues , decided to give up their day jobs and go professional they set up a new band called spice ; it was then that david garrick changed his surname to byron drummer alex napier ( born 1947 in glasgow , strathclyde , scotland ) joined , having answered a music paper ad ; bassist paul newton of the gods completed the line-up from the very beginning , spice avoided playing covers and , according to box , always strove '' '' managed initially by newton 's father , the band climbed their way up to the marquee level , then got signed by gerry bron ( the hit record productions ltd '' i thought they were a band i could develop and i took them on that basis , '' remembered bron later he became the band 's manager and signed them to vertigo records , the newly formed philips label then the name was changed to that of the well-known character from david copperfield , uriah heep ( for , according to biographer kirk blows , '' dickens ' name being everywhere around christmas '69 due to it being the hundredth anniversary of his death '' ) according to dave ling 's 2001 autobiography of the band , wizards and demons , the uriah heep story , though the '' uriah heep '' moniker was chosen in december 1969 , the band continued to play gigs as '' spice '' until ken hensley joined in february 1970 gerry bron brought in session player colin wood , followed by ken hensley , a former colleague of newton in the gods , who was then playing guitar in toe fat the album 's title references the signature phrase of the dickens character uriah heep ( '' very 'umble '' ) hensley had little to contribute to the debut : box and byron wrote most of the material , including '' gypsy '' , in many ways ( according to blows ) '' '' during the winter of 1970 , three quarters into the recording of the album , drummer alex napier was replaced by nigel olsson , recommended to byron by elton john '' those unfamiliar with uriah heep may want to try out demons and wizards or a compilation first , but anyone with a serious interest in uriah heep or the roots of heavy metal will find plenty to like on in the course of the album 's making the writing relationship between box , byron and hensley was beginning to develop it was like it was meant to be , there was that kind of chemistry , '' mick box recalled when nigel olsson returned to elton john 's group in the spring of 1970 , keith baker took his place the band 's second album , salisbury ( february 1971 ) , was more squarely in the progressive rock genre , with its 16-minute title track featuring a 24-piece orchestra with him the band toured germany in late december 1970/january 1971 and made their first us tour in the spring of 1971 , supporting three dog night and steppenwolf by this time , gerry bron 's deal with philips/vertigo was over , so he set up his own label , bronze records the third album , look at yourself , released in october 1971 , marked the solidification of disparate ideas that had been a prominent feature of salisbury and presented the unified sound and direction '' i think that 'july morning ' is one of the best examples of the way the band was developing at that point in time by the end of 1971 it became clear , according to hensley , that he , byron and box had become the tightly knit nucleus of the band when we became uriah heep and ken joined the band – and ken is the first to admit it – he had very definite ideas about what he wanted to do in a band i mean , let 's face it , the fact that what we did was successful was great for me too i actually wanted to leave the band for quite a while before i actually left but i did n't anyway , with the heavy work schedules and the pressures and so on , i ended up collapsing on stage one night and the other members of the band decided i should go new zealander gary thain , a then member of keef hartley band , joined uriah heep as a permanent member in february 1972 halfway through another american tour , replacing mark clarke who was exhausted and nearing a mental breakdown thus the '' classic '' uriah heep formed and , according to biographer k to discard any possible insinuations concerning any kind of concept behind it , hensley 's note on the sleeve declared the album was '' solidified uriah heep 's reputation as a master of gothic-inflected heavy metal six months later , in november 1972 , uriah heep 's fifth studio album the magician 's birthday ( no 31 us ) came out , with '' sweet lorraine '' released as an american single and the title track ( a multi-part fantasy epic featuring hensley–byron vocal duel and box 's extensive guitar solo in the middle ) being the album 's highlight but hensley too developed into a sophisticated instrumentalist and stage persona , whose writing and keyboard flair ignited the rest of the band a lavishly packaged ( an eight-page booklet plus ) double album uriah heep live followed , recorded at the birmingham town hall in january 1973 '' recording abroad disrupted the band 's normal method of operation and that had a big negative effect on the group box remembered weeks spent in the studio as '' dramatic '' for all the wrong reasons '' david was drunk for most of the time , kenny was having an emotional time of it and i was constantly trying to help them so it was difficult for me too a year later , on 8 december 1975 , gary thain was found dead in his norwood green home , having overdosed on heroin john wetton ( ex-family and king crimson ) joined the band in march 1975 and with him return to fantasy ( june 1975 ) was recorded ; representing a revitalised uriah heep , it soared up to no hensley later explained , '' when he joined , we thought that we could replace a great bass player ( thain ) with another great bass player , but we ignored the personality factor , which is crucial paul stanley later recalled , '' they were incredibly professional , and so consistent that their worst nights were excellent and their best were tremendous '' innocent victim , released in november 1977 , '' had a slight edge on firefly '' according to box , but still in retrospect this '' in germany the album sold over a million copies and became uriah heep 's most successful , which coincided with the success of the re-released '' lady in black in the end of 1978 , fallen angel came out , having completed a hat-trick of studio albums to feature a consistent lineup ( only the second time in their career that they had done so ) '' everything he wrote , he had to use… and if you insist in using everything you end up with substandard albums , '' disgruntled box opined both albums , abominog and head first , updated the band 's sound and generated a brief , newfound interest in uriah heep among younger heavy metal fans '' yet another technically sound but artistically bland recording from uriah heep '' ( according to allmusic ) failed to chart and marked the end of the band 's contract with legacy records on 16 november 2017 , it was reported that uriah heep would begin recording their 25th studio album , titled living the dream , with producer jay ruston '' two former uriah heep members passed away in 2020 : lee kerslake after a long cancer battle on september 19 , and ken hensley after a short illness on november 4

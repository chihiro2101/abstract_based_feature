gerald edelman was born in 1929 in ozone park , queens , new york , to jewish parents , physician edward edelman , and anna ( n√©e freedman ) edelman , who worked in the insurance industry ) he studied violin for years , but eventually realized that he did not have the inner drive needed to pursue a career as a concert violinist , and decided to go into medical research instead after his nobel prize award , edelman began research into the regulation of primary cellular processes , particularly the control of cell growth and the development of multi-celled organisms , focussing on cell-to-cell interactions in early embryonic development and in the formation and function of the nervous system these studies led to the discovery of cell adhesion molecules ( cams ) , which guide the fundamental processes that help an animal achieve its shape and form , and by which nervous systems are built research by edelman and his colleagues and rodney robert porter in the early 1960s produced fundamental breakthroughs in the understanding of the antibody 's chemical structure , opening a door for further study for this work , edelman and porter shared the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1972 in its nobel prize press release in 1972 , the karolinska institutet lauded edelman and porter 's work as a major breakthrough : using experimental data from his own research and the work of others , edelman developed molecular models of antibody proteins at the time when the first complete antibody sequence was determined ( 1969 ) it was the largest complete protein sequence that had ever been determined topobiology is edelman 's theory which asserts that morphogenesis is driven by differential adhesive interactions among heterogeneous cell populations and it explains how a single cell can give rise to a complex multi-cellular organism in his later career , edelman was noted for his theory of consciousness , documented in a trilogy of technical books and in several subsequent books written for a general audience , including bright air , brilliant fire ( 1992 ) , a universe of consciousness ( 2001 , with giulio tononi ) , wider than the sky ( 2004 ) and second nature : brain science and human knowledge ( 2007 ) he explicitly located his theory within charles darwin 's theory of natural selection , citing the key tenets of darwin 's population theory , which postulates that individual variation within species provides the basis for the natural selection that eventually leads to the evolution of new species edelman argued that the mind and consciousness are purely biological phenomena , arising from complex cellular processes within the brain , and that the development of consciousness and intelligence can be explained by darwinian theory developmental selection -- the formation of the gross anatomy of the brain is controlled by genetic factors , but in any individual the connectivity between neurons at the synaptic level and their organisation into functional neuronal groups is determined by somatic selection during growth and development experiential selection -- overlapping the initial growth and development of the brain , and extending throughout an individual 's life , a continuous process of synaptic selection occurs within the diverse repertoires of neuronal groups reentry depends for its operations on the intricate networks of massively parallel reciprocal connections within and between neuronal groups , which arise through the processes of developmental and experiential selection outlined above gerald edelman telling his life story at web of stories the scripps research institute - faculty : gerald edelman '' evolution in your brain : gerald edelman says only the fittest neurons survive '' interview in discover magazine , july 2007 '' the brain doctor : dr

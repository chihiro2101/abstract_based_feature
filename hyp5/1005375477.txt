gerald edelman was born in 1929 in ozone park , queens , new york , to jewish parents , physician edward edelman , and anna ( née freedman ) edelman , who worked in the insurance industry after his nobel prize award , edelman began research into the regulation of primary cellular processes , particularly the control of cell growth and the development of multi-celled organisms , focussing on cell-to-cell interactions in early embryonic development and in the formation and function of the nervous system one of the most significant discoveries made in this research is that the precursor gene for the neural cell adhesion molecule gave rise in evolution to the entire molecular system of adaptive immunity he decided that , since the book said so little about antibodies , he would investigate them further upon returning to the united states , which led him to study physical chemistry for his 1960 ph.d research by edelman and his colleagues and rodney robert porter in the early 1960s produced fundamental breakthroughs in the understanding of the antibody 's chemical structure , opening a door for further study for this work , edelman and porter shared the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1972 edelman 's early research on the structure of antibody proteins revealed that disulfide bonds link together the protein subunits using experimental data from his own research and the work of others , edelman developed molecular models of antibody proteins edelman and his colleagues used cyanogen bromide and proteases to fragment the antibody protein subunits into smaller pieces that could be analyzed for determination of their protein sequencing the availability of amino acid sequences of antibody proteins allowed recognition of the fact that the body can produce many different antibody proteins with similar antibody constant regions and divergent antibody variable regions as proposed by edelman in 1988 , topobiology is the process that sculpts and maintains differentiated tissues and is acquired by the energetically favored segregation of cells through heterologous cellular interactions '' the first of edelman 's technical books , the mindful brain ( 1978 ) , develops his theory of neural darwinism , which is built around the idea of plasticity in the neural network in response to the environment edelman argued that the mind and consciousness are purely biological phenomena , arising from complex cellular processes within the brain , and that the development of consciousness and intelligence can be explained by darwinian theory edelman 's theory of neuronal group selection , also known as 'neural darwinism ' , has three basic tenets—developmental selection , experiential selection and reentry a universe of consciousness : how matter becomes imagination , edelman and giulio tononi , coauthors , ( basic books , 2000 , reprint edition 2001 ) gerald edelman telling his life story at web of stories the scripps research institute - faculty : gerald edelman '' evolution in your brain : gerald edelman says only the fittest neurons survive '' interview in discover magazine , july 2007 '' the brain doctor : dr edelman gerald nobel luminaries – jewish nobel prize winners , on the beit hatfutsot-the museum of the jewish people website .

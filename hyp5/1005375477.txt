gerald edelman was born in 1929 in ozone park , queens , new york , to jewish parents , physician edward edelman , and anna ( née freedman ) edelman , who worked in the insurance industry after a year at the johnson foundation for medical physics , edelman became a resident at the massachusetts general hospital ; he then practiced medicine in france while serving with us army medical corps after his nobel prize award , edelman began research into the regulation of primary cellular processes , particularly the control of cell growth and the development of multi-celled organisms , focussing on cell-to-cell interactions in early embryonic development and in the formation and function of the nervous system these studies led to the discovery of cell adhesion molecules ( cams ) , which guide the fundamental processes that help an animal achieve its shape and form , and by which nervous systems are built while in paris serving in the army , edelman read a book that sparked his interest in antibody research by edelman and his colleagues and rodney robert porter in the early 1960s produced fundamental breakthroughs in the understanding of the antibody 's chemical structure , opening a door for further study for this work , edelman and porter shared the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1972 edelman 's early research on the structure of antibody proteins revealed that disulfide bonds link together the protein subunits two light and two heavy chains are linked together by disulfide bonds to form a functional antibody using experimental data from his own research and the work of others , edelman developed molecular models of antibody proteins edelman and his colleagues used cyanogen bromide and proteases to fragment the antibody protein subunits into smaller pieces that could be analyzed for determination of their protein sequencing topobiology is edelman 's theory which asserts that morphogenesis is driven by differential adhesive interactions among heterogeneous cell populations and it explains how a single cell can give rise to a complex multi-cellular organism in his books , edelman proposed a biological theory of consciousness , based on his studies of the immune system edelman argued that the mind and consciousness are purely biological phenomena , arising from complex cellular processes within the brain , and that the development of consciousness and intelligence can be explained by darwinian theory edelman 's theory of neuronal group selection , also known as 'neural darwinism ' , has three basic tenets—developmental selection , experiential selection and reentry developmental selection -- the formation of the gross anatomy of the brain is controlled by genetic factors , but in any individual the connectivity between neurons at the synaptic level and their organisation into functional neuronal groups is determined by somatic selection during growth and development gerald edelman telling his life story at web of stories the scripps research institute - faculty : gerald edelman '' evolution in your brain : gerald edelman says only the fittest neurons survive '' interview in discover magazine , july 2007 '' the brain doctor : dr

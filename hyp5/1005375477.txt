gerald edelman was born in 1929 in ozone park , queens , new york , to jewish parents , physician edward edelman , and anna ( née freedman ) edelman , who worked in the insurance industry he attended public schools in new york , graduating from john adams high school , and going on to college in pennsylvania where he graduated magna cum laude with a b.s after his nobel prize award , edelman began research into the regulation of primary cellular processes , particularly the control of cell growth and the development of multi-celled organisms , focussing on cell-to-cell interactions in early embryonic development and in the formation and function of the nervous system these studies led to the discovery of cell adhesion molecules ( cams ) , which guide the fundamental processes that help an animal achieve its shape and form , and by which nervous systems are built one of the most significant discoveries made in this research is that the precursor gene for the neural cell adhesion molecule gave rise in evolution to the entire molecular system of adaptive immunity for this work , edelman and porter shared the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1972 in its nobel prize press release in 1972 , the karolinska institutet lauded edelman and porter 's work as a major breakthrough : edelman 's early research on the structure of antibody proteins revealed that disulfide bonds link together the protein subunits using experimental data from his own research and the work of others , edelman developed molecular models of antibody proteins at the time when the first complete antibody sequence was determined ( 1969 ) it was the largest complete protein sequence that had ever been determined the availability of amino acid sequences of antibody proteins allowed recognition of the fact that the body can produce many different antibody proteins with similar antibody constant regions and divergent antibody variable regions in his books , edelman proposed a biological theory of consciousness , based on his studies of the immune system edelman argued that the mind and consciousness are purely biological phenomena , arising from complex cellular processes within the brain , and that the development of consciousness and intelligence can be explained by darwinian theory edelman 's theory of neuronal group selection , also known as 'neural darwinism ' , has three basic tenets—developmental selection , experiential selection and reentry this process may strengthen or weaken the connections between groups of neurons and it is constrained by value signals that arise from the activity of the ascending systems of the brain , which are continually modified by successful output experiential selection generates dynamic systems that can 'map ' complex spatio-temporal events from the sensory organs , body systems and other neuronal groups in the brain onto other selected neuronal groups gerald edelman telling his life story at web of stories the scripps research institute - faculty : gerald edelman '' evolution in your brain : gerald edelman says only the fittest neurons survive '' interview in discover magazine , july 2007 '' the brain doctor : dr

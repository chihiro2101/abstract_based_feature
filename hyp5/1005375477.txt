gerald edelman was born in 1929 in ozone park , queens , new york , to jewish parents , physician edward edelman , and anna ( née freedman ) edelman , who worked in the insurance industry he attended public schools in new york , graduating from john adams high school , and going on to college in pennsylvania where he graduated magna cum laude with a b.s after a year at the johnson foundation for medical physics , edelman became a resident at the massachusetts general hospital ; he then practiced medicine in france while serving with us army medical corps in 1957 , edelman joined the rockefeller university as a graduate fellow , working in the laboratory of henry kunkel and receiving a ph.d after his nobel prize award , edelman began research into the regulation of primary cellular processes , particularly the control of cell growth and the development of multi-celled organisms , focussing on cell-to-cell interactions in early embryonic development and in the formation and function of the nervous system these studies led to the discovery of cell adhesion molecules ( cams ) , which guide the fundamental processes that help an animal achieve its shape and form , and by which nervous systems are built one of the most significant discoveries made in this research is that the precursor gene for the neural cell adhesion molecule gave rise in evolution to the entire molecular system of adaptive immunity edelman 's early research on the structure of antibody proteins revealed that disulfide bonds link together the protein subunits the protein subunits of antibodies are of two types , the larger heavy chains and the smaller light chains a key feature of these models included the idea that the antigen binding domains of antibodies ( fab ) include amino acids from both the light and heavy protein subunits in his later career , edelman was noted for his theory of consciousness , documented in a trilogy of technical books and in several subsequent books written for a general audience , including bright air , brilliant fire ( 1992 ) , a universe of consciousness ( 2001 , with giulio tononi ) , wider than the sky ( 2004 ) and second nature : brain science and human knowledge ( 2007 ) edelman argued that the mind and consciousness are purely biological phenomena , arising from complex cellular processes within the brain , and that the development of consciousness and intelligence can be explained by darwinian theory this process may strengthen or weaken the connections between groups of neurons and it is constrained by value signals that arise from the activity of the ascending systems of the brain , which are continually modified by successful output gerald edelman , bright air , brilliant fire ( penguin , 1992 ) , p.224 reentry —the concept of reentrant signalling between neuronal groups edelman founded and directed the neurosciences institute , a nonprofit research center in san diego that between 1993 and 2012 studied the biological bases of higher brain function in humans gerald edelman telling his life story at web of stories the scripps research institute - faculty : gerald edelman '' evolution in your brain : gerald edelman says only the fittest neurons survive '' interview in discover magazine , july 2007 '' the brain doctor : dr gerald edelman is a genius on a spiritual path '' - profile in san diego jewish journal , october 2007 '' from brain dynamics to consciousness '' , video , ibm lecture on cognitive computing , june 2006 , inactive as of jeffrey epstein vi foundation june 15 , 2013

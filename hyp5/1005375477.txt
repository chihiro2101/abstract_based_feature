gerald edelman was born in 1929 in ozone park , queens , new york , to jewish parents , physician edward edelman , and anna ( née freedman ) edelman , who worked in the insurance industry edelman 's remarks in 2008 radio interview with physicist michio kaku ( host of exploration ) after a year at the johnson foundation for medical physics , edelman became a resident at the massachusetts general hospital ; he then practiced medicine in france while serving with us army medical corps after his nobel prize award , edelman began research into the regulation of primary cellular processes , particularly the control of cell growth and the development of multi-celled organisms , focussing on cell-to-cell interactions in early embryonic development and in the formation and function of the nervous system one of the most significant discoveries made in this research is that the precursor gene for the neural cell adhesion molecule gave rise in evolution to the entire molecular system of adaptive immunity while in paris serving in the army , edelman read a book that sparked his interest in antibody he decided that , since the book said so little about antibodies , he would investigate them further upon returning to the united states , which led him to study physical chemistry for his 1960 ph.d research by edelman and his colleagues and rodney robert porter in the early 1960s produced fundamental breakthroughs in the understanding of the antibody 's chemical structure , opening a door for further study for this work , edelman and porter shared the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1972 in its nobel prize press release in 1972 , the karolinska institutet lauded edelman and porter 's work as a major breakthrough : edelman 's early research on the structure of antibody proteins revealed that disulfide bonds link together the protein subunits using experimental data from his own research and the work of others , edelman developed molecular models of antibody proteins in his books , edelman proposed a biological theory of consciousness , based on his studies of the immune system edelman 's theory seeks to explain consciousness in terms of the morphology of the brain this process may strengthen or weaken the connections between groups of neurons and it is constrained by value signals that arise from the activity of the ascending systems of the brain , which are continually modified by successful output edelman founded and directed the neurosciences institute , a nonprofit research center in san diego that between 1993 and 2012 studied the biological bases of higher brain function in humans edelman gerald nobel luminaries – jewish nobel prize winners , on the beit hatfutsot-the museum of the jewish people website .

the law from old english lagu ( something laid down or fixed ) ; legal comes from latin legalis , from lex '' law , '' '' statute '' is a system of rules usually enforced through a set of institutions the purpose of law is to provide an objective set of rules for governing conduct and maintaining order in a society these codified laws may coexist with or contradict other forms of social control , such as religious proscriptions , professional rules and ethics , or the cultural mores and customs of a society criminal law is concerned with actions which are dangerous or harmful to society as a whole , in which prosecution is pursued not by an individual but rather by the state the purpose of criminal law is to provide the specific definition of what constitutes a crime and to prescribe punishments for committing such a crime the subject of criminal justice is , of course , primarily concerned with the enforcement of criminal law the criminal-justice system consists of three main parts : law enforcement agencies , usually the police courts and accompanying prosecutor and defence lawyers agencies for detaining and supervising offenders , such as prisons and probation agencies in the criminal justice system , these distinct agencies operate together as the principal means of maintaining the rule of law within society the first contact a defendant has with the criminal justice system is usually with the police ( or law enforcement ) who investigates the suspected wrongdoing and makes an arrest , but if the suspect is dangerous to the whole nation , a national level law enforcement agency is called in when warranted , law enforcement agencies or police officers are empowered to use force and other forms of legal coercion and means to effect public and social order the term is most commonly associated with police departments of a state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility police are primarily concerned with keeping the peace and enforcing criminal law based on their particular mission and jurisdiction formed in 1908 , the federal bureau of investigation began as an entity which could investigate and enforce specific federal laws as an investigative and '' law enforcement agency '' in the united states ; this , however , has constituted only a small portion of overall policing activity during modern times , such endeavors contribute toward fulfilling a shared mission among law enforcement organizations with respect to the traditional policing mission of deterring crime and maintaining societal order the judge , or magistrate , is a person , elected or appointed , who is knowledgeable in the law , and whose function is to objectively administer the legal proceedings and offer a final decision to dispose of a case in this system , two parties will both offer their version of events and argue their case before the court ( sometimes before a judge or panel of judges , sometimes before a jury ) it is the prosecutor 's duty to explain to the court what crime was committed and to detail what evidence has been found which incriminates the accused a defense attorney counsels the accused on the legal process , likely outcomes for the accused and suggests strategies , an accused person is entitled to a government-paid defense attorney if he or she is in jeopardy of losing his or her life and/or liberty if the accused confesses his or her guilt , a shorter process may be employed and a judgment may be rendered more quickly some nations , such as america , allow plea bargaining in which the accused pleads guilty , nolo contendere or not guilty , and may accept a diversion program or reduced punishment , where the prosecution 's case is weak or in exchange for the cooperation of the accused against other people any prejudice on the part of the lawyers , the judge , or jury members threatens to destroy the court 's credibility this is a particular problem when the lawyer performs in a substandard manner '' we find that the percentage of favorable rulings drops gradually from ≈65 % to nearly zero within each decision session and returns abruptly to ≈65 % after a break religious institutions also have a presence in many prisons , with the goal of teaching ethics and instilling a sense of morality in the prisoners probation and house arrest are also sanctions which seek to limit a person 's mobility and his or her opportunities to commit crimes without actually placing them in a prison setting the functional study of criminal justice is distinct from criminology , which involves the study of crime as a social phenomenon , causes of crime , criminal behavior , and other aspects of crime until the 1960s , the primary focus of criminal justice in the united states was on policing and police science the modern criminal justice system has evolved since ancient times , with new forms of punishment , added rights for offenders and victims , and policing reforms despite such reforms , police agencies were led by highly autocratic leaders , and there remained a lack of respect between police and the community outline of criminal justice & ndash ;

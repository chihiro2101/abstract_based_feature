the law from old english lagu ( something laid down or fixed ) ; legal comes from latin legalis , from lex '' law , '' '' statute '' is a system of rules usually enforced through a set of institutions within the realm of codified law , there are generally two forms of law that the courts are concerned with criminal law is concerned with actions which are dangerous or harmful to society as a whole , in which prosecution is pursued not by an individual but rather by the state the purpose of criminal law is to provide the specific definition of what constitutes a crime and to prescribe punishments for committing such a crime no criminal law can be valid unless it includes both of these factors the subject of criminal justice is , of course , primarily concerned with the enforcement of criminal law the criminal-justice system consists of three main parts : law enforcement agencies , usually the police courts and accompanying prosecutor and defence lawyers agencies for detaining and supervising offenders , such as prisons and probation agencies in the criminal justice system , these distinct agencies operate together as the principal means of maintaining the rule of law within society the term is most commonly associated with police departments of a state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility with regard to criminal justice , there are a number of critical people in any court setting these include the judge , prosecutor , and the defense attorney the judge , or magistrate , is a person , elected or appointed , who is knowledgeable in the law , and whose function is to objectively administer the legal proceedings and offer a final decision to dispose of a case and in a growing number of nations , guilt or innocence ( although in the u.s a jury can never find a defendant '' innocent '' but rather '' not guilty '' ) is decided through the adversarial system the case should be decided in favor of the party who offers the most sound and compelling arguments based on the law as applied to the facts of the case it is the prosecutor 's duty to explain to the court what crime was committed and to detail what evidence has been found which incriminates the accused a defense attorney counsels the accused on the legal process , likely outcomes for the accused and suggests strategies defense counsel may challenge evidence presented by the prosecution or present exculpatory evidence and argue on behalf of their client , an accused person is entitled to a government-paid defense attorney if he or she is in jeopardy of losing his or her life and/or liberty in many jurisdictions , there is no right to an appointed attorney , if the accused is not in jeopardy of losing his or her liberty this function may be performed by a judge , a panel of judges , or a jury panel composed of unbiased citizens in america , this process depends on the state , level of court , and even agreements between the prosecuting and defending parties if the accused confesses his or her guilt , a shorter process may be employed and a judgment may be rendered more quickly the jury process is another area of frequent criticism , as there are few mechanisms to guard against poor judgment or incompetence on the part of the layman jurors '' we find that the percentage of favorable rulings drops gradually from ≈65 % to nearly zero within each decision session and returns abruptly to ≈65 % after a break '' manipulations of the court system by defense and prosecution attorneys , law enforcement as well as the defendants have occurred and there have been cases where justice was denied offenders are then turned over to the correctional authorities , from the court system after the accused has been found guilty like all other aspects of criminal justice , the administration of punishment has taken many different forms throughout history largely thanks to the law enforcement education program , criminal justice students numbered over 100,000 by 1975 after the american revolution the british-based criminal justice system was then adopted by other developing nations ( such as the united states ) in the united states , police departments were first established in boston in 1838 , and new york city in 1844 walker , samuel popular justice : a history of american criminal justice

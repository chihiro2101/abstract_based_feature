nectocaris had a flattened , kite-shaped body with a fleshy fin running along the length of each side the small head had two stalked eyes , a single pair of tentacles , and a flexible funnel opening out to the underside of the body although nectocaris is known from canada , china and australia , in rocks spanning some 20 & nbsp ; million years , there does not seem to be much diversity ; size excepted , all specimens are anatomically very similar & nbsp ; pteryx , there seem to be two discrete morphs , one large ( ~10 & nbsp ; cm in length ) , one small ( ~3 & nbsp ; cm long ) the eyes of nectocaris would have had a similar visual acuity to modern nautilus ( if they lacked a lens ) or squid ( if they did not ) the most pleasing interpretation – which is not without problems – is to interpret some of the features of nectocaris as shared with the earliest cephalopods because the genus was originally known from a single , incomplete specimen and with no counterpart , conway morris was unable to deduce its affinity these allowed them to reinterpret nectocaris as a primitive cephalopod , with only 2 & nbsp ; tentacles instead of the 8 or 10 & nbsp ; limbs of modern cephalopods whether nectocaris represents a derived or basal cephalopod , and whether it belongs in the crown group , it is more parsimonious to interpret its distinctive features as homologues of their equivalent in cephalopods – even if the absence of a shell in nectocaris is an independent feature fossils of petalilium show a dorsoventrally flattened body , usually 5 to 6 & nbsp ; centimetres , but ranging from 1.5 to 10 & nbsp ; cm

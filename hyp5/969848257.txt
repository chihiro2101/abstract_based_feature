nectocaris had a flattened , kite-shaped body with a fleshy fin running along the length of each side the small head had two stalked eyes , a single pair of tentacles , and a flexible funnel opening out to the underside of the body although nectocaris is known from canada , china and australia , in rocks spanning some 20 & nbsp ; million years , there does not seem to be much diversity ; size excepted , all specimens are anatomically very similar historically , three genera have been erected for nectocaridid taxa from different localities , but these 'species ' – petalilium latus and vetustovermis planus – likely belong to the same genus or even the same species as n & nbsp ; pteryx , there seem to be two discrete morphs , one large ( ~10 & nbsp ; cm in length ) , one small ( ~3 & nbsp ; cm long ) these allowed them to reinterpret nectocaris as a primitive cephalopod , with only 2 & nbsp ; tentacles instead of the 8 or 10 & nbsp ; limbs of modern cephalopods whether nectocaris represents a derived or basal cephalopod , and whether it belongs in the crown group , it is more parsimonious to interpret its distinctive features as homologues of their equivalent in cephalopods – even if the absence of a shell in nectocaris is an independent feature vetustovermis ( from latin : '' very old worm '' ) is a soft-bodied middle cambrian animal , known from a single reported fossil specimen from the south australian emu bay shale petalilium ( sometimes misspelled petalium ) is an enigmatic genus of cambrian organism known from the haikou area , from the maoshoiatan mudstone member of the chengjiang biota 's ( 2005 ) study suggested that petalilium may be related to nectocaris

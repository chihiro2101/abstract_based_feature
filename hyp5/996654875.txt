for humans , one type of vertebrate , and other animals that stand on two feet ( bipeds ) , terms that are used are different from those that stand on four ( quadrupeds ) unique terms are used to describe animals without a backbone ( invertebrates ) , because of their wide variety of shapes and symmetry this means descriptions as if the organism is in its standard anatomical position , even when the organism in question has appendages in another position in humans , this refers to the body in a standing position with arms at the side and palms facing forward , with thumbs out and to the sides many anatomical terms can be combined , either to indicate a position in two axes simultaneously or to indicate the direction of a movement relative to the body for example , '' anterolateral '' indicates a position that is both anterior and lateral to the body axis ( such as the bulk of the pectoralis major muscle ) anatomical terms describe structures with relation to four main anatomical planes : the median plane , which divides the body into left and right ) the axes of the body are lines drawn about which an organism is roughly symmetrical to do this , distinct ends of an organism are chosen , and the axis is named according to those directions example axes are : the anteroposterior axis the cephalocaudal axis the dorsoventral axis examples of axes in specific animals are shown below several terms are commonly seen and used as prefixes : sub- is used to indicate something that is beneath , or something that is subordinate to or lesser than for example , subcutaneous means beneath the skin , and '' subglobular '' may mean smaller than a hypo- is used to indicate something that is beneath infra- is used to indicate something that is within or below super- or supra- is used to indicate something that is above something else other terms are used as suffixes , added to the end of words : -ad and ab- are used to indicate that something is towards ( -ad ) or away from ( -ab ) something else for example , '' distad '' means '' in the distal direction '' , and '' distad of the femur '' means '' beyond the femur in the distal direction '' for example , in the anatomical position , the most superior part of the human body is the head and the most inferior is the feet as a second example , in humans , the neck is superior to the chest but inferior to the head anterior describes what is in front , and posterior describes what is to the back of something these terms describe how close something is to the midline , or the medial plane the terms '' left '' and '' right '' are sometimes used , or their latin alternatives ; however , as left and right sides are mirror images , using these words is somewhat confusing , as structures are duplicated on both sides terms derived from lateral include : contralateral : on the side opposite to another structure thus the upper arm in humans is proximal and the hand is distal '' proximal and distal '' are frequently used when describing appendages , such as fins , tentacles , and limbs for example , the great vessels run centrally through the body ; many smaller vessels branch from these peripheral , originally from ancient greek ) describes something further away from the centre of something for example , the arm is peripheral to the body these two terms , used in anatomy and embryology , describe something at the back ( dorsal ) or front/belly ( ventral ) of an organism the dorsal surface of an organism refers to the back , or upper side , of an organism cranial or cephalic describes how close something is to the head of an organism caudal describes how close something is to the trailing end of an organism for example , in horses , the eyes are caudal to the nose and rostral to the back of the head similarly , the term '' caudal '' is used more in embryology and only occasionally used in human anatomy the location of anatomical structures can also be described in relation to different anatomical landmarks they are used in anatomy , surface anatomy , surgery , and radiology for example , structures may be described relative to the anterior superior iliac spine , the medial malleolus or the medial epicondyle volar can also be used to refer to the underside of the palm or sole , which are themselves also sometimes used to describe location as palmar and plantar in invertebrates , the large variety of body shapes presents a difficult problem when attempting to apply standard directional terms the part of the organism attached to the substrate is usually referred to as the basal end , whereas the end furthest from the attachment is referred to as the apical end prolateral refers to the surface of a leg that is closest to the anterior end of an arachnid 's body

much of this information has been standardised in internationally agreed vocabularies for humans ( terminologia anatomica ) and animals ( nomina anatomica veterinaria ) for humans , one type of vertebrate , and other animals that stand on two feet ( bipeds ) , terms that are used are different from those that stand on four ( quadrupeds ) one reason is that humans have a different neuraxis and another is that unlike animals that rest on four limbs , humans are considered when describing anatomy as being in the standard anatomical position , which is standing up with arms outstretched thus , what is on '' top '' of a human is the head , whereas the '' top '' of a dog may be its back , and the '' top '' of a flounder could refer to either its left or its right side unique terms are used to describe animals without a backbone ( invertebrates ) , because of their wide variety of shapes and symmetry because animals can change orientation with respect to their environment , and because appendages like limbs and tentacles can change position with respect to the main body , terms to describe position need to refer to an animal when it is in its standard anatomical position this means descriptions as if the organism is in its standard anatomical position , even when the organism in question has appendages in another position this helps avoid confusion in terminology when referring to the same organism in different postures in humans , this refers to the body in a standing position with arms at the side and palms facing forward , with thumbs out and to the sides many anatomical terms can be combined , either to indicate a position in two axes simultaneously or to indicate the direction of a movement relative to the body for example , '' anterolateral '' indicates a position that is both anterior and lateral to the body axis ( such as the bulk of the pectoralis major muscle ) combined terms were once generally , hyphenated , but the modern tendency is to omit the hyphen anatomical terms describe structures with relation to four main anatomical planes : the median plane , which divides the body into left and right example axes are : the anteroposterior axis the cephalocaudal axis the dorsoventral axis examples of axes in specific animals are shown below several terms are commonly seen and used as prefixes : sub- is used to indicate something that is beneath , or something that is subordinate to or lesser than for example , subcutaneous means beneath the skin , and '' subglobular '' may mean smaller than a hypo- is used to indicate something that is beneath for example , the hypoglossal nerve supplies the muscles beneath the tongue other terms are used as suffixes , added to the end of words : -ad and ab- are used to indicate that something is towards ( -ad ) or away from ( -ab ) something else superior describes what is above something and inferior describes what is below it for example , in the anatomical position , the most superior part of the human body is the head and the most inferior is the feet as a second example , in humans , the neck is superior to the chest but inferior to the head these terms describe how close something is to the midline , or the medial plane the terms proximal and distal are used to describe parts of a feature that are close to or distant from the main mass of the body , respectively thus the upper arm in humans is proximal and the hand is distal that might be an organ , a region in the body , or an anatomical structure '' deep '' is one of the few anatomical terms of location derived from old english rather than latin â€“ the anglicised latin term would have been '' profound '' for example , in a fish , the pectoral fins are dorsal to the anal fin , but ventral to the dorsal fin general zoology laboratory manual mcgraw-hill , and in humans , '' cranial '' and '' cephalic '' are used to refer to the skull , with '' cranial '' being used more commonly the term '' rostral '' is rarely used in human anatomy , apart from embryology , and refers more to the front of the face than the superior aspect of the organism this is because the brain is situated at the superior part of the head whereas the nose is situated in the anterior part the location of anatomical structures can also be described in relation to different anatomical landmarks they are used in anatomy , surface anatomy , surgery , and radiology structures may be described as being at the level of a specific spinal vertebra , depending on the section of the vertebral column the structure is at anatomical lines are used to describe anatomical location for example , the terms '' distal '' and '' proximal '' are also redefined to mean the distance away or close to the dental arch , and '' medial '' and '' lateral '' are used to refer to the closeness to the midline of the dental arch for example , the top of a dog 's paw is its dorsal surface ; the underside , either the palmar ( on the forelimb ) or the plantar ( on the hindlimb ) surface volar can also be used to refer to the underside of the palm or sole , which are themselves also sometimes used to describe location as palmar and plantar anteversion and retroversion are complementary terms describing an anatomical structure that is rotated forwards ( towards the front of the body ) or backwards ( towards the back of the body ) , relative to some other position several other terms are also used to describe location 662px-anatomical-directions.png anatomical terms of location in a dog anatomical-directions-kangaroo.svg anatomical terms of location in a kangaroo anatomical directions and axes.jpg anatomical terms of location in a fish usually such organisms are planktonic ( free-swimming ) protists , and are nearly always viewed on microscope slides , where they appear essentially two-dimensional

much of this information has been standardised in internationally agreed vocabularies for humans ( terminologia anatomica ) and animals ( nomina anatomica veterinaria ) for humans , one type of vertebrate , and other animals that stand on two feet ( bipeds ) , terms that are used are different from those that stand on four ( quadrupeds ) one reason is that humans have a different neuraxis and another is that unlike animals that rest on four limbs , humans are considered when describing anatomy as being in the standard anatomical position , which is standing up with arms outstretched thus , what is on '' top '' of a human is the head , whereas the '' top '' of a dog may be its back , and the '' top '' of a flounder could refer to either its left or its right side unique terms are used to describe animals without a backbone ( invertebrates ) , because of their wide variety of shapes and symmetry this means descriptions as if the organism is in its standard anatomical position , even when the organism in question has appendages in another position in humans , this refers to the body in a standing position with arms at the side and palms facing forward , with thumbs out and to the sides many anatomical terms can be combined , either to indicate a position in two axes simultaneously or to indicate the direction of a movement relative to the body for example , '' anterolateral '' indicates a position that is both anterior and lateral to the body axis ( such as the bulk of the pectoralis major muscle ) anatomical terms describe structures with relation to four main anatomical planes : the median plane , which divides the body into left and right this passes through the head , spinal cord , navel , and , in many animals , the tail image : labelled ciliates.jpg thumb organisms where the ends of the long axis are distinct an organism that is symmetrical on both sides has three main axes that intersect at right angles an organism that is round or not symmetrical may have different axes for example , subcutaneous means beneath the skin , and '' subglobular '' may mean smaller than a hypo- is used to indicate something that is beneath for example , the hypoglossal nerve supplies the muscles beneath the tongue infra- is used to indicate something that is within or below other terms are used as suffixes , added to the end of words : -ad and ab- are used to indicate that something is towards ( -ad ) or away from ( -ab ) something else for example , in the anatomical position , the most superior part of the human body is the head and the most inferior is the feet as a second example , in humans , the neck is superior to the chest but inferior to the head anterior describes what is in front , and posterior describes what is to the back of something lateral describes something to the sides of an animal , as in '' left lateral '' and '' right lateral '' medial describes structures close to the midline , or closer to the midline than another structure the terms '' left '' and '' right '' are sometimes used , or their latin alternatives ; however , as left and right sides are mirror images , using these words is somewhat confusing , as structures are duplicated on both sides terms derived from lateral include : contralateral : on the side opposite to another structure for example , bilateral orchiectomy means removal of testes on both sides of the body for example , a stroke can result in unilateral paresis , meaning weakness on one side of the body varus and valgus are terms used to describe a state in which a part further away is abnormally placed towards ( varus ) or away from ( valgus ) the midline the terms proximal and distal are used to describe parts of a feature that are close to or distant from the main mass of the body , respectively these two terms , used in anatomy and embryology , describe something at the back ( dorsal ) or front/belly ( ventral ) of an organism these terms are generally preferred in veterinary medicine and not used as often in human medicine the term '' rostral '' is rarely used in human anatomy , apart from embryology , and refers more to the front of the face than the superior aspect of the organism the location of anatomical structures can also be described in relation to different anatomical landmarks they are used in anatomy , surface anatomy , surgery , and radiology because the sacrum and coccyx are fused , they are not often used to provide the location structures closer to the radius are radial , structures closer to the ulna are ulnar , and structures relating to both bones are referred to as radioulnar 662px-anatomical-directions.png anatomical terms of location in a dog anatomical-directions-kangaroo.svg anatomical terms of location in a kangaroo anatomical directions and axes.jpg anatomical terms of location in a fish image : asymmetrical and spherical.jpg thumb right 250px asymmetrical and spherical body plan in organisms that maintain a constant shape and have one dimension longer than the other , at least two directional terms can be used special terms are used for spiders

much of this information has been standardised in internationally agreed vocabularies for humans ( terminologia anatomica ) and animals ( nomina anatomica veterinaria ) for humans , one type of vertebrate , and other animals that stand on two feet ( bipeds ) , terms that are used are different from those that stand on four ( quadrupeds ) one reason is that humans have a different neuraxis and another is that unlike animals that rest on four limbs , humans are considered when describing anatomy as being in the standard anatomical position , which is standing up with arms outstretched unique terms are used to describe animals without a backbone ( invertebrates ) , because of their wide variety of shapes and symmetry this means descriptions as if the organism is in its standard anatomical position , even when the organism in question has appendages in another position in humans , this refers to the body in a standing position with arms at the side and palms facing forward , with thumbs out and to the sides many anatomical terms can be combined , either to indicate a position in two axes simultaneously or to indicate the direction of a movement relative to the body for example , '' anterolateral '' indicates a position that is both anterior and lateral to the body axis ( such as the bulk of the pectoralis major muscle ) in radiology , an x-ray image may be said to be '' anteroposterior '' , indicating that the beam of x-rays passes from their source to patient 's anterior body wall through the body to exit through posterior body wall anatomical terms describe structures with relation to four main anatomical planes : the median plane , which divides the body into left and right the frontal plane , also called the coronal plane , which divides the body into front and back an organism that is symmetrical on both sides has three main axes that intersect at right angles example axes are : the anteroposterior axis the cephalocaudal axis the dorsoventral axis examples of axes in specific animals are shown below several terms are commonly seen and used as prefixes : sub- is used to indicate something that is beneath , or something that is subordinate to or lesser than other terms are used as suffixes , added to the end of words : -ad and ab- are used to indicate that something is towards ( -ad ) or away from ( -ab ) something else further examples may include cephalad ( towards the cephalic end ) , craniad , and distad for example , in the anatomical position , the most superior part of the human body is the head and the most inferior is the feet for example , in a dog the nose is anterior to the eyes and the tail is considered the most posterior part ; in many fish the gill openings are posterior to the eyes but anterior to the tail lateral describes something to the sides of an animal , as in '' left lateral '' and '' right lateral '' terms derived from lateral include : contralateral : on the side opposite to another structure for example , the right arm and leg are controlled by the left , contralateral brain for example , the left arm is ipsilateral to the left leg for example , bilateral orchiectomy means removal of testes on both sides of the body varus and valgus are terms used to describe a state in which a part further away is abnormally placed towards ( varus ) or away from ( valgus ) the midline thus the elbow is distal to a wound on the upper arm , but proximal to a wound on the lower arm central and peripheral refer to the distance towards and away from the centre of something deep describes something further away from the surface of the organism for example , the external oblique muscle of the abdomen is deep to the skin these two terms , used in anatomy and embryology , describe something at the back ( dorsal ) or front/belly ( ventral ) of an organism the dorsal surface of an organism refers to the back , or upper side , of an organism specific terms exist to describe how close or far something is to the head or tail of an animal cranial or cephalic describes how close something is to the head of an organism these terms are generally preferred in veterinary medicine and not used as often in human medicine thus , the '' rostrocaudal axis '' refers to a c shape ( see image ) the location of anatomical structures can also be described in relation to different anatomical landmarks references may also take origin from superficial anatomy , made to landmarks that are on the skin or visible underneath retroversion describes an anatomical structure tilted back away from something for example , as humans are approximately symmetry in biology organisms , anatomical descriptions usually use the same terms as those for other vertebrates the long or longitudinal axis is defined by points at the opposite ends of the organism for this reason , the end of the organism with the mouth is referred to as the oral end , and the opposite surface is the aboral end prolateral refers to the surface of a leg that is closest to the anterior end of an arachnid 's body

much of this information has been standardised in internationally agreed vocabularies for humans ( terminologia anatomica ) and animals ( nomina anatomica veterinaria ) for humans , one type of vertebrate , and other animals that stand on two feet ( bipeds ) , terms that are used are different from those that stand on four ( quadrupeds ) one reason is that humans have a different neuraxis and another is that unlike animals that rest on four limbs , humans are considered when describing anatomy as being in the standard anatomical position , which is standing up with arms outstretched thus , what is on '' top '' of a human is the head , whereas the '' top '' of a dog may be its back , and the '' top '' of a flounder could refer to either its left or its right side unique terms are used to describe animals without a backbone ( invertebrates ) , because of their wide variety of shapes and symmetry because animals can change orientation with respect to their environment , and because appendages like limbs and tentacles can change position with respect to the main body , terms to describe position need to refer to an animal when it is in its standard anatomical position this means descriptions as if the organism is in its standard anatomical position , even when the organism in question has appendages in another position in humans , this refers to the body in a standing position with arms at the side and palms facing forward , with thumbs out and to the sides many anatomical terms can be combined , either to indicate a position in two axes simultaneously or to indicate the direction of a movement relative to the body combined terms were once generally , hyphenated , but the modern tendency is to omit the hyphen anatomical terms describe structures with relation to four main anatomical planes : the median plane , which divides the body into left and right ) the axes of the body are lines drawn about which an organism is roughly symmetrical to do this , distinct ends of an organism are chosen , and the axis is named according to those directions an organism that is symmetrical on both sides has three main axes that intersect at right angles an organism that is round or not symmetrical may have different axes several terms are commonly seen and used as prefixes : sub- is used to indicate something that is beneath , or something that is subordinate to or lesser than for example , subcutaneous means beneath the skin , and '' subglobular '' may mean smaller than a hypo- is used to indicate something that is beneath super- or supra- is used to indicate something that is above something else for example , '' distad '' means '' in the distal direction '' , and '' distad of the femur '' means '' beyond the femur in the distal direction '' further examples may include cephalad ( towards the cephalic end ) , craniad , and distad for example , in a dog the nose is anterior to the eyes and the tail is considered the most posterior part ; in many fish the gill openings are posterior to the eyes but anterior to the tail these terms describe how close something is to the midline , or the medial plane the terms '' left '' and '' right '' are sometimes used , or their latin alternatives ; terms derived from lateral include : contralateral : on the side opposite to another structure for example , bilateral orchiectomy means removal of testes on both sides of the body for example , a stroke can result in unilateral paresis , meaning weakness on one side of the body varus and valgus are terms used to describe a state in which a part further away is abnormally placed towards ( varus ) or away from ( valgus ) the midline the terms proximal and distal are used to describe parts of a feature that are close to or distant from the main mass of the body , respectively although the direction indicated by '' proximal '' and '' distal '' is always respectively towards or away from the point of attachment , a given structure can be either proximal or distal in relation to another point of reference that might be an organ , a region in the body , or an anatomical structure these terms are generally preferred in veterinary medicine and not used as often in human medicine similarly , the term '' caudal '' is used more in embryology and only occasionally used in human anatomy other terms and special cases the location of anatomical structures can also be described in relation to different anatomical landmarks these terms are used to avoid confusion when describing the median surface of the hand and what is the '' anterior '' or '' posterior '' surface '' anterior '' can be used to describe the hand of the hand , and '' posterior '' can be used to describe the back of the hand and arm a misaligned pelvis may be anteverted , that is to say tilted forward to some relevant degree these terms are not used to form the fixed axes for example , as humans are approximately symmetry in biology organisms , anatomical descriptions usually use the same terms as those for other vertebrates 662px-anatomical-directions.png anatomical terms of location in a dog anatomical-directions-kangaroo.svg anatomical terms of location in a kangaroo anatomical directions and axes.jpg anatomical terms of location in a fish usually such organisms are planktonic ( free-swimming ) protists , and are nearly always viewed on microscope slides , where they appear essentially two-dimensional for this reason , the end of the organism with the mouth is referred to as the oral end , and the opposite surface is the aboral end

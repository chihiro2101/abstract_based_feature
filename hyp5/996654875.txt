much of this information has been standardised in internationally agreed vocabularies for humans ( terminologia anatomica ) and animals ( nomina anatomica veterinaria ) for humans , one type of vertebrate , and other animals that stand on two feet ( bipeds ) , terms that are used are different from those that stand on four ( quadrupeds ) one reason is that humans have a different neuraxis and another is that unlike animals that rest on four limbs , humans are considered when describing anatomy as being in the standard anatomical position , which is standing up with arms outstretched thus , what is on '' top '' of a human is the head , whereas the '' top '' of a dog may be its back , and the '' top '' of a flounder could refer to either its left or its right side unique terms are used to describe animals without a backbone ( invertebrates ) , because of their wide variety of shapes and symmetry because animals can change orientation with respect to their environment , and because appendages like limbs and tentacles can change position with respect to the main body , terms to describe position need to refer to an animal when it is in its standard anatomical position this means descriptions as if the organism is in its standard anatomical position , even when the organism in question has appendages in another position this helps avoid confusion in terminology when referring to the same organism in different postures in humans , this refers to the body in a standing position with arms at the side and palms facing forward , with thumbs out and to the sides many anatomical terms can be combined , either to indicate a position in two axes simultaneously or to indicate the direction of a movement relative to the body for example , '' anterolateral '' indicates a position that is both anterior and lateral to the body axis ( such as the bulk of the pectoralis major muscle ) anatomical terms describe structures with relation to four main anatomical planes : the median plane , which divides the body into left and right the horizontal plane , also known as the transverse plane , which is perpendicular to the other two planes in a human , this plane is parallel to the ground ; in a quadruped , this divides the animal into anterior and posterior sections ) the axes of the body are lines drawn about which an organism is roughly symmetrical infra- is used to indicate something that is within or below inter- is used to indicate something that is between for example , in the anatomical position , the most superior part of the human body is the head and the most inferior is the feet anterior describes what is in front , and posterior describes what is to the back of something for example , in a dog the nose is anterior to the eyes and the tail is considered the most posterior part ; in many fish the gill openings are posterior to the eyes but anterior to the tail medial describes structures close to the midline , or closer to the midline than another structure terms derived from lateral include : contralateral : on the side opposite to another structure for example , a stroke can result in unilateral paresis , meaning weakness on one side of the body varus and valgus are terms used to describe a state in which a part further away is abnormally placed towards ( varus ) or away from ( valgus ) the midline the terms proximal and distal are used to describe parts of a feature that are close to or distant from the main mass of the body , respectively '' proximal and distal '' are frequently used when describing appendages , such as fins , tentacles , and limbs peripheral , originally from ancient greek ) describes something further away from the centre of something for example , the arm is peripheral to the body '' deep '' is one of the few anatomical terms of location derived from old english rather than latin â€“ the anglicised latin term would have been '' profound '' superficial describes something near the outer surface of the organism these two terms , used in anatomy and embryology , describe something at the back ( dorsal ) or front/belly ( ventral ) of an organism specific terms exist to describe how close or far something is to the head or tail of an animal to describe how close to the head of an animal something is , three distinct terms are used : rostral describes something situated toward the oral or nasal region , or in the case of the brain , toward the tip of the frontal lobe for example , in horses , the eyes are caudal to the nose and rostral to the back of the head these terms are generally preferred in veterinary medicine and not used as often in human medicine structures may be described as being at the level of a specific spinal vertebra , depending on the section of the vertebral column the structure is at several other terms are also used to describe location aboral ( opposite to oral ) is used to denote a location along the gastrointestinal canal that is relatively closer to the anus 662px-anatomical-directions.png anatomical terms of location in a dog anatomical-directions-kangaroo.svg anatomical terms of location in a kangaroo anatomical directions and axes.jpg anatomical terms of location in a fish in such organisms , only terms such as superficial and deep , or sometimes proximal and distal , are usefully descriptive in organisms that maintain a constant shape and have one dimension longer than the other , at least two directional terms can be used

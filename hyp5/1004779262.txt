according to the hebrew bible , god commands abraham to offer his son isaac as a sacrifice after isaac is bound to an altar , a angel of the lord stops abraham before the sacrifice finishes , saying '' now i know you fear god in the binding of isaac , religious murders & kabbalah , lippman bodoff argues that abraham never intended to actually sacrifice his son , and that he had faith that god had no intention that he do so god 's commandment to abraham was very specific , and abraham understood it very precisely : isaac was to be '' raised up as an offering '' , and god would use the opportunity to teach humankind , once and for all , that human sacrifice , child sacrifice , is not acceptable citing the prophet jeremiah 's exhortation against child sacrifice ( chapter 19 ) , they state unequivocally that such behavior '' never crossed god ’ s mind '' , referring specifically to the sacrificial slaughter of isaac the thought of actually killing isaac never crossed their minds the jewish publication society suggests abraham 's apparent complicity with the sacrifice was actually his way of testing god by silently complying with god 's instructions to kill isaac , abraham was putting pressure on god to act in a moral way to preserve life more evidence that abraham thought that he would not actually sacrifice isaac comes from genesis 22:5 , where abraham said to his servants , '' you stay here with the ass first , abraham 's willingness to sacrifice isaac demonstrates the limit of humanity 's capability to both love and fear god as her study demonstrates , over the last century the '' binding of isaac '' has morphed into the '' sacrifice of isaac '' , connoting both the glory and agony of heroic death on the battlefield some talmudic sages teach that isaac was an adult aged thirty seven , likely based on the next biblical story , which is of sarah 's death at 127 years , being 90 when isaac was born levenson , lecture oct 13 , 2016 : '' genesis 22 : the binding of isaac and the crucifixion of jesus , starting at about 1:05:10 isaac 's reaction to the binding is unstated in the biblical narrative some commentators have argued that he was traumatized and angry , often citing the fact that he and abraham are never seen to speak to each other again ; however , jon d '' ( hebrews 11:17–19 , nkjv ) abraham 's faith in god is such that he felt god would be able to resurrect the slain isaac , in order that his prophecy ( genesis 21:12 ) might be fulfilled see yancy smith , '' hippolytus ' commentary on the song of songs in social and critical context '' ( unpublished phd dissertation ; brite divinity school , 2008 ) , 312 origen , homilies on genesis 11–13 this interpretation can be supported by symbolism and context such as abraham sacrificing his son on the third day of the journey ( genesis 22:4 ) , or abraham taking the wood and putting it on his son isaac 's shoulder ( genesis 22:6 ) however , it was a ram ( not a lamb ) that was ultimately sacrificed in isaac 's place , and the ram was caught in a thicket ( i.e the quran states that when abraham asked for a righteous son , god granted him a son possessing forbearance when the son was able to walk and work with him , abraham saw a vision about sacrificing his son , ishmael quran 37:100 the next two verses state god also granted abraham the righteous son isaac and promised more rewards one side of the argument believed it was isaac rather than ishmael ( notably ibn qutaybah and al-tabari ) interpreting the verse '' god 's perfecting his mercy on abraham and isaac '' as referring to his making abraham his closest one , and to his rescuing isaac it may be that the biblical story contains traces of a tradition in which abraham does sacrifice isaac , for in genesis & nbsp ; 22:19 abraham appears to return from the mountain without isaac friedman argued that in the original e story , abraham may have carried out the sacrifice of isaac , but that later repugnance at the idea of a human sacrifice led the redactor of je to add the lines in which a ram is substituted for isaac & nbsp ; 20 some scholars also point at the genealogical snippet ( verses & nbsp ; 20 & ndash ; 24 ) as containing a hint to the question whether abraham sacrificed isaac or not

according to the hebrew bible , god commands abraham to offer his son isaac as a sacrifice after isaac is bound to an altar , a angel of the lord stops abraham before the sacrifice finishes , saying '' now i know you fear god '' abraham looks up and sees a ram and sacrifices it instead of isaac in the binding of isaac , religious murders & kabbalah , lippman bodoff argues that abraham never intended to actually sacrifice his son , and that he had faith that god had no intention that he do so god 's commandment to abraham was very specific , and abraham understood it very precisely : isaac was to be '' raised up as an offering '' , and god would use the opportunity to teach humankind , once and for all , that human sacrifice , child sacrifice , is not acceptable citing the prophet jeremiah 's exhortation against child sacrifice ( chapter 19 ) , they state unequivocally that such behavior '' never crossed god ’ s mind '' , referring specifically to the sacrificial slaughter of isaac the jewish publication society suggests abraham 's apparent complicity with the sacrifice was actually his way of testing god abraham had previously argued with god to save lives in sodom and gomorrah more evidence that abraham thought that he would not actually sacrifice isaac comes from genesis 22:5 , where abraham said to his servants , '' you stay here with the ass , page 39 , the jewish publication society , 1999 in the guide for the perplexed , maimonides argues that the story of the binding of isaac contains two '' great notions '' first , abraham 's willingness to sacrifice isaac demonstrates the limit of humanity 's capability to both love and fear god feldman argues that the story of isaac 's binding , in both its biblical and post-biblical versions ( the new testament included ) has had a great impact on the ethos of altruism heroism and self-sacrifice in modern hebrew national culture as her study demonstrates , over the last century the '' binding of isaac '' has morphed into the '' sacrifice of isaac '' , connoting both the glory and agony of heroic death on the battlefield levenson , lecture oct 13 , 2016 : '' genesis 22 : the binding of isaac and the crucifixion of jesus , starting at about 1:05:10 isaac 's reaction to the binding is unstated in the biblical narrative some commentators have argued that he was traumatized and angry , often citing the fact that he and abraham are never seen to speak to each other again ; however , jon d origen , homilies on genesis 11–13 this interpretation can be supported by symbolism and context such as abraham sacrificing his son on the third day of the journey ( genesis 22:4 ) , or abraham taking the wood and putting it on his son isaac 's shoulder ( genesis 22:6 ) another thing to note is how god reemphasizes isaac being abraham 's one and only son whom he loves ( genesis 22:2,12,16 ) as further support that the binding of isaac foretells the gospel of jesus christ , when the two went up there , isaac asked abraham '' where is the lamb for the burnt offering '' to which abraham responded '' god himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering , my son in islamic sources , when abraham tells his son about the vision , his son agreed to be sacrificed for the fulfillment of god 's command , and no binding to the altar occurred when they both had submitted their will to god and were ready for the sacrifice , god told abraham he had fulfilled the vision , and provided him with a ram to sacrifice instead quran 37:100 the next two verses state god also granted abraham the righteous son isaac and promised more rewards one side of the argument believed it was isaac rather than ishmael ( notably ibn qutaybah and al-tabari ) interpreting the verse '' god 's perfecting his mercy on abraham and isaac '' as referring to his making abraham his closest one , and to his rescuing isaac the other side , by far a vast majority , held that the promise to sarah was of a son , isaac , and a grandson , jacob ( quran 11:71-74 ) excluded the possibility of a premature death of isaac coats argues that abraham 's obedience to god 's command in fact necessitates praise and blessing , which he only receives in the second angelic speech & nbsp ; 20 some scholars also point at the genealogical snippet ( verses & nbsp ; 20 & ndash ; 24 ) as containing a hint to the question whether abraham sacrificed isaac or not

according to the hebrew bible , god commands abraham to offer his son isaac as a sacrifice after isaac is bound to an altar , a angel of the lord stops abraham before the sacrifice finishes , saying '' now i know you fear god '' abraham looks up and sees a ram and sacrifices it instead of isaac in the binding of isaac , religious murders & kabbalah , lippman bodoff argues that abraham never intended to actually sacrifice his son , and that he had faith that god had no intention that he do so god 's commandment to abraham was very specific , and abraham understood it very precisely : isaac was to be '' raised up as an offering '' , and god would use the opportunity to teach humankind , once and for all , that human sacrifice , child sacrifice , is not acceptable the jewish publication society suggests abraham 's apparent complicity with the sacrifice was actually his way of testing god more evidence that abraham thought that he would not actually sacrifice isaac comes from genesis 22:5 , where abraham said to his servants , '' you stay here with the ass first , abraham 's willingness to sacrifice isaac demonstrates the limit of humanity 's capability to both love and fear god feldman argues that the story of isaac 's binding , in both its biblical and post-biblical versions ( the new testament included ) has had a great impact on the ethos of altruism heroism and self-sacrifice in modern hebrew national culture as her study demonstrates , over the last century the '' binding of isaac '' has morphed into the '' sacrifice of isaac '' , connoting both the glory and agony of heroic death on the battlefield some talmudic sages teach that isaac was an adult aged thirty seven , likely based on the next biblical story , which is of sarah 's death at 127 years , being 90 when isaac was born levenson , lecture oct 13 , 2016 : '' genesis 22 : the binding of isaac and the crucifixion of jesus , starting at about 1:05:10 isaac 's reaction to the binding is unstated in the biblical narrative '' ( hebrews 11:17â€“19 , nkjv ) abraham 's faith in god is such that he felt god would be able to resurrect the slain isaac , in order that his prophecy ( genesis 21:12 ) might be fulfilled early christian preaching sometimes accepted jewish interpretations of the binding of isaac without elaborating for example , hippolytus of rome says in his commentary on the song of songs , '' the blessed isaac became desirous of the anointing and he wished to sacrifice himself for the sake of the world '' ( on the song 2:15 ) as further support that the binding of isaac foretells the gospel of jesus christ , when the two went up there , isaac asked abraham '' where is the lamb for the burnt offering '' to which abraham responded '' god himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering , my son the version in the quran differs from that in genesis in two aspects : the identity of the sacrificed son and the son 's reaction towards the requested sacrifice in islamic sources , when abraham tells his son about the vision , his son agreed to be sacrificed for the fulfillment of god 's command , and no binding to the altar occurred when the son was able to walk and work with him , abraham saw a vision about sacrificing his son , ishmael when he told his son about it , his son agreed to fulfill the command of god in the vision when they both had submitted their will to god and were ready for the sacrifice , god told abraham he had fulfilled the vision , and provided him with a ram to sacrifice instead god promised to reward abraham quran 37:100 the next two verses state god also granted abraham the righteous son isaac and promised more rewards on that reading , in the original e version of the binding abraham disobeys god 's command , sacrificing the ram '' instead of his son '' ( v it may be that the biblical story contains traces of a tradition in which abraham does sacrifice isaac , for in genesis & nbsp ; 22:19 abraham appears to return from the mountain without isaac

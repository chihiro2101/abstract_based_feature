according to the hebrew bible , god commands abraham to offer his son isaac as a sacrifice after isaac is bound to an altar , a angel of the lord stops abraham before the sacrifice finishes , saying '' now i know you fear god '' abraham looks up and sees a ram and sacrifices it instead of isaac in the binding of isaac , religious murders & kabbalah , lippman bodoff argues that abraham never intended to actually sacrifice his son , and that he had faith that god had no intention that he do so rabbi ari kahn ( on the orthodox union website ) elaborates this view as follows : isaac 's death was never a possibility — not as far as abraham was concerned , and not as far as god was concerned god 's commandment to abraham was very specific , and abraham understood it very precisely : isaac was to be '' raised up as an offering '' , and god would use the opportunity to teach humankind , once and for all , that human sacrifice , child sacrifice , is not acceptable citing the prophet jeremiah 's exhortation against child sacrifice ( chapter 19 ) , they state unequivocally that such behavior '' never crossed god ’ s mind '' , referring specifically to the sacrificial slaughter of isaac the jewish publication society suggests abraham 's apparent complicity with the sacrifice was actually his way of testing god abraham had previously argued with god to save lives in sodom and gomorrah by silently complying with god 's instructions to kill isaac , abraham was putting pressure on god to act in a moral way to preserve life more evidence that abraham thought that he would not actually sacrifice isaac comes from genesis 22:5 , where abraham said to his servants , '' you stay here with the ass as her study demonstrates , over the last century the '' binding of isaac '' has morphed into the '' sacrifice of isaac '' , connoting both the glory and agony of heroic death on the battlefield '' ( hebrews 11:17–19 , nkjv ) abraham 's faith in god is such that he felt god would be able to resurrect the slain isaac , in order that his prophecy ( genesis 21:12 ) might be fulfilled early christian preaching sometimes accepted jewish interpretations of the binding of isaac without elaborating another thing to note is how god reemphasizes isaac being abraham 's one and only son whom he loves ( genesis 22:2,12,16 ) the version in the quran differs from that in genesis in two aspects : the identity of the sacrificed son and the son 's reaction towards the requested sacrifice in islamic sources , when abraham tells his son about the vision , his son agreed to be sacrificed for the fulfillment of god 's command , and no binding to the altar occurred the quran states that when abraham asked for a righteous son , god granted him a son possessing forbearance when he told his son about it , his son agreed to fulfill the command of god in the vision when they both had submitted their will to god and were ready for the sacrifice , god told abraham he had fulfilled the vision , and provided him with a ram to sacrifice instead quran 37:100 the next two verses state god also granted abraham the righteous son isaac and promised more rewards the other side , by far a vast majority , held that the promise to sarah was of a son , isaac , and a grandson , jacob ( quran 11:71-74 ) excluded the possibility of a premature death of isaac jewish communities regularly review this literature , for instance the recent mock trial held by more than 600 & nbsp ; members of the university synagogue of orange county , california on that reading , in the original e version of the binding abraham disobeys god 's command , sacrificing the ram '' instead of his son '' ( v it may be that the biblical story contains traces of a tradition in which abraham does sacrifice isaac , for in genesis & nbsp ; 22:19 abraham appears to return from the mountain without isaac

according to the hebrew bible , god commands abraham to offer his son isaac as a sacrifice after isaac is bound to an altar , a angel of the lord stops abraham before the sacrifice finishes , saying '' now i know you fear god '' abraham looks up and sees a ram and sacrifices it instead of isaac in the binding of isaac , religious murders & kabbalah , lippman bodoff argues that abraham never intended to actually sacrifice his son , and that he had faith that god had no intention that he do so rabbi ari kahn ( on the orthodox union website ) elaborates this view as follows : isaac 's death was never a possibility — not as far as abraham was concerned , and not as far as god was concerned god 's commandment to abraham was very specific , and abraham understood it very precisely : isaac was to be '' raised up as an offering '' , and god would use the opportunity to teach humankind , once and for all , that human sacrifice , child sacrifice , is not acceptable citing the prophet jeremiah 's exhortation against child sacrifice ( chapter 19 ) , they state unequivocally that such behavior '' never crossed god ’ s mind '' , referring specifically to the sacrificial slaughter of isaac though readers of this parashah throughout the generations have been disturbed , even horrified , by the akedah , there was no miscommunication between god and abraham the jewish publication society suggests abraham 's apparent complicity with the sacrifice was actually his way of testing god more evidence that abraham thought that he would not actually sacrifice isaac comes from genesis 22:5 , where abraham said to his servants , '' you stay here with the ass , page 39 , the jewish publication society , 1999 in the guide for the perplexed , maimonides argues that the story of the binding of isaac contains two '' great notions '' second , because abraham acted on a prophetic vision of what god had asked him to do , the story exemplifies how prophetic revelation has the same truth value as philosophical argument and thus carries equal certainty , notwithstanding the fact that it comes in a dream or vision feldman argues that the story of isaac 's binding , in both its biblical and post-biblical versions ( the new testament included ) has had a great impact on the ethos of altruism heroism and self-sacrifice in modern hebrew national culture as her study demonstrates , over the last century the '' binding of isaac '' has morphed into the '' sacrifice of isaac '' , connoting both the glory and agony of heroic death on the battlefield another thing to note is how god reemphasizes isaac being abraham 's one and only son whom he loves ( genesis 22:2,12,16 ) in the new testament , john the baptist saw jesus coming toward him and said '' look , the lamb of god , who takes away the sins of the world ! '' ( john 1:29 ) in islamic sources , when abraham tells his son about the vision , his son agreed to be sacrificed for the fulfillment of god 's command , and no binding to the altar occurred the quran states that when abraham asked for a righteous son , god granted him a son possessing forbearance when the son was able to walk and work with him , abraham saw a vision about sacrificing his son , ishmael when they both had submitted their will to god and were ready for the sacrifice , god told abraham he had fulfilled the vision , and provided him with a ram to sacrifice instead quran 37:100 the next two verses state god also granted abraham the righteous son isaac and promised more rewards one side of the argument believed it was isaac rather than ishmael ( notably ibn qutaybah and al-tabari ) interpreting the verse '' god 's perfecting his mercy on abraham and isaac '' as referring to his making abraham his closest one , and to his rescuing isaac on that reading , in the original e version of the binding abraham disobeys god 's command , sacrificing the ram '' instead of his son '' ( v it may be that the biblical story contains traces of a tradition in which abraham does sacrifice isaac , for in genesis & nbsp ; 22:19 abraham appears to return from the mountain without isaac however , whereas verses & nbsp ; 20 & ndash ; 23 have some significant links with other parts of the hebrew bible as well as with the historical and cultural entourage of the ancient near east , such connections are absent in v

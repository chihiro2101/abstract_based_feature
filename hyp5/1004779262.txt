according to the hebrew bible , god commands abraham to offer his son isaac as a sacrifice after isaac is bound to an altar , a angel of the lord stops abraham before the sacrifice finishes , saying '' now i know you fear god '' abraham looks up and sees a ram and sacrifices it instead of isaac in the binding of isaac , religious murders & kabbalah , lippman bodoff argues that abraham never intended to actually sacrifice his son , and that he had faith that god had no intention that he do so rabbi ari kahn ( on the orthodox union website ) elaborates this view as follows : isaac 's death was never a possibility — not as far as abraham was concerned , and not as far as god was concerned god 's commandment to abraham was very specific , and abraham understood it very precisely : isaac was to be '' raised up as an offering '' , and god would use the opportunity to teach humankind , once and for all , that human sacrifice , child sacrifice , is not acceptable citing the prophet jeremiah 's exhortation against child sacrifice ( chapter 19 ) , they state unequivocally that such behavior '' never crossed god ’ s mind '' , referring specifically to the sacrificial slaughter of isaac though readers of this parashah throughout the generations have been disturbed , even horrified , by the akedah , there was no miscommunication between god and abraham the jewish publication society suggests abraham 's apparent complicity with the sacrifice was actually his way of testing god by silently complying with god 's instructions to kill isaac , abraham was putting pressure on god to act in a moral way to preserve life more evidence that abraham thought that he would not actually sacrifice isaac comes from genesis 22:5 , where abraham said to his servants , '' you stay here with the ass first , abraham 's willingness to sacrifice isaac demonstrates the limit of humanity 's capability to both love and fear god feldman argues that the story of isaac 's binding , in both its biblical and post-biblical versions ( the new testament included ) has had a great impact on the ethos of altruism heroism and self-sacrifice in modern hebrew national culture '' ( hebrews 11:17–19 , nkjv ) abraham 's faith in god is such that he felt god would be able to resurrect the slain isaac , in order that his prophecy ( genesis 21:12 ) might be fulfilled for example , hippolytus of rome says in his commentary on the song of songs , '' the blessed isaac became desirous of the anointing and he wished to sacrifice himself for the sake of the world '' ( on the song 2:15 ) see yancy smith , '' hippolytus ' commentary on the song of songs in social and critical context '' ( unpublished phd dissertation ; brite divinity school , 2008 ) , 312 origen , homilies on genesis 11–13 this interpretation can be supported by symbolism and context such as abraham sacrificing his son on the third day of the journey ( genesis 22:4 ) , or abraham taking the wood and putting it on his son isaac 's shoulder ( genesis 22:6 ) another thing to note is how god reemphasizes isaac being abraham 's one and only son whom he loves ( genesis 22:2,12,16 ) as further support that the binding of isaac foretells the gospel of jesus christ , when the two went up there , isaac asked abraham '' where is the lamb for the burnt offering '' to which abraham responded '' god himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering , my son in islamic sources , when abraham tells his son about the vision , his son agreed to be sacrificed for the fulfillment of god 's command , and no binding to the altar occurred the quran states that when abraham asked for a righteous son , god granted him a son possessing forbearance when the son was able to walk and work with him , abraham saw a vision about sacrificing his son , ishmael on that reading , in the original e version of the binding abraham disobeys god 's command , sacrificing the ram '' instead of his son '' ( v it may be that the biblical story contains traces of a tradition in which abraham does sacrifice isaac , for in genesis & nbsp ; 22:19 abraham appears to return from the mountain without isaac friedman argued that in the original e story , abraham may have carried out the sacrifice of isaac , but that later repugnance at the idea of a human sacrifice led the redactor of je to add the lines in which a ram is substituted for isaac

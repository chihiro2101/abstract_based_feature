a covert channel is so called because it is hidden from the access control mechanisms of secure operating systems since it does not use the legitimate data transfer mechanisms of the computer system ( typically , read and write ) , and therefore can not be detected or controlled by the security mechanisms that underlie secure operating systems covert channels are exceedingly hard to install in real systems , and can often be detected by monitoring system performance they can also be removed manually with a high degree of assurance from secure systems by well established covert channel analysis strategies covert channels are distinct from , and often confused with , legitimate channel exploitations that attack low-assurance pseudo-secure systems using schemes such as steganography or even less sophisticated schemes to disguise prohibited objects inside of legitimate information objects the legitimate channel misuse by steganography is specifically not a form of covert channel covert channel analysis is the only proven way to control covert channels analysis of legitimate channels for hidden objects is often misrepresented as the only successful countermeasure for legitimate channel misuse lampson 's definition of a covert channel was paraphrased in the tcsec ncsc-tg-030 , covert channel analysis of trusted systems ( light pink book ) , 1993 from the united states department of defense ( dod ) rainbow series publications the tcsec defines two kinds of covert channels : storage channels - communicate by modifying a '' storage location '' , such as a hard drive requires analysis of covert storage channels to be classified as a b2 system and analysis of covert timing channels is a requirement for class b3 handel and sandford presented research where they study covert channels within the general design of network communication protocols their work identifies covert channel merit such as : detectability : covert channel must be measurable by the intended recipient only their covert channel analysis does not consider issues such as interoperability of these data hiding techniques with other network nodes , covert channel capacity estimation , effect of data hiding on the network in terms of complexity and compatibility his work focuses on local area networks ( lans ) in which three obvious covert channels ( two storage channel and one timing channel ) are identified covert channels in the tcp/ip protocol suite , 1996 paper by craig rowland on covert channels in the tcp/ip protocol with proof of concept code after rowland , several authors in academia published more work on covert channels in the tcp/ip protocol suite , including a plethora of countermeasures ranging from statistical approaches to machine learning

covert channels are exceedingly hard to install in real systems , and can often be detected by monitoring system performance covert channel analysis is the only proven way to control covert channels by contrast , secure operating systems can easily prevent misuse of legitimate channels , so distinguishing both is important analysis of legitimate channels for hidden objects is often misrepresented as the only successful countermeasure for legitimate channel misuse computer security technology planning study ( james p anderson , 1972 ) without being informed of this , some are misled to believe an analysis will '' manage the risk '' of these legitimate channels specifically to refer to ways of transferring information from a higher classification compartment to a lower classification the tcsec defines two kinds of covert channels : storage channels - communicate by modifying a '' storage location '' , such as a hard drive requires analysis of covert storage channels to be classified as a b2 system and analysis of covert timing channels is a requirement for class b3 the use of delays between packets transmitted over computer networks was first explored by girling for covert communication covert channels are not easy to find because these media are so numerous and frequently used the possibility of covert channels can not be completely eliminated , although it can be significantly reduced by careful design and analysis the detection of a covert channel can be made more difficult by using characteristics of the communications medium for the legitimate channel that are never controlled or examined by legitimate users since it is unlikely that legitimate users will check for patterns of file opening and closing operations , this type of covert channel can remain undetected for long periods their work identifies covert channel merit such as : detectability : covert channel must be measurable by the intended recipient only the scenario transmits covert information through a '' when-is-sent ‚Äù strategy therefore termed as timing covert channel

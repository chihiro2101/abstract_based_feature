they can also be removed manually with a high degree of assurance from secure systems by well established covert channel analysis strategies the legitimate channel misuse by steganography is specifically not a form of covert channel covert channels can tunnel through secure operating systems and require special measures to control covert channel analysis is the only proven way to control covert channels analysis of legitimate channels for hidden objects is often misrepresented as the only successful countermeasure for legitimate channel misuse requires analysis of covert storage channels to be classified as a b2 system and analysis of covert timing channels is a requirement for class b3 the use of delays between packets transmitted over computer networks was first explored by girling for covert communication ordinary things , such as existence of a file or time used for a computation , have been the medium through which a covert channel communicates the detection of a covert channel can be made more difficult by using characteristics of the communications medium for the legitimate channel that are never controlled or examined by legitimate users handel and sandford presented research where they study covert channels within the general design of network communication protocols their covert channel analysis does not consider issues such as interoperability of these data hiding techniques with other network nodes , covert channel capacity estimation , effect of data hiding on the network in terms of complexity and compatibility moreover , the generality of the techniques can not be fully justified in practice since the osi model does not exist per se in functional systems data hiding in lan environment by covert channels the author termed this possibility as covert storage channel as it depends in what is sent ( i.e data hiding in tcp/ip protocol suite by covert channels covert channels in the tcp/ip protocol suite , 1996 paper by craig rowland on covert channels in the tcp/ip protocol with proof of concept code

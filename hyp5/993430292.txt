covert channels are exceedingly hard to install in real systems , and can often be detected by monitoring system performance the legitimate channel misuse by steganography is specifically not a form of covert channel covert channels can tunnel through secure operating systems and require special measures to control covert channel analysis is the only proven way to control covert channels analysis of legitimate channels for hidden objects is often misrepresented as the only successful countermeasure for legitimate channel misuse the tcsec defines two kinds of covert channels : storage channels - communicate by modifying a '' storage location '' , such as a hard drive requires analysis of covert storage channels to be classified as a b2 system and analysis of covert timing channels is a requirement for class b3 ordinary things , such as existence of a file or time used for a computation , have been the medium through which a covert channel communicates the possibility of covert channels can not be completely eliminated , although it can be significantly reduced by careful design and analysis the detection of a covert channel can be made more difficult by using characteristics of the communications medium for the legitimate channel that are never controlled or examined by legitimate users for example , a file can be opened and closed by a program in a specific , timed pattern that can be detected by another program , and the pattern can be interpreted as a string of bits , forming a covert channel their work identifies covert channel merit such as : detectability : covert channel must be measurable by the intended recipient only the scenario transmits covert information through a '' when-is-sent ‚Äù strategy therefore termed as timing covert channel data hiding in tcp/ip protocol suite by covert channels covert channels in the tcp/ip protocol suite , 1996 paper by craig rowland on covert channels in the tcp/ip protocol with proof of concept code the research on network covert channels overlaps with the domain of network steganography , which emerged later

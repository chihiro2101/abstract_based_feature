covert channels are exceedingly hard to install in real systems , and can often be detected by monitoring system performance they can also be removed manually with a high degree of assurance from secure systems by well established covert channel analysis strategies the legitimate channel misuse by steganography is specifically not a form of covert channel covert channels can tunnel through secure operating systems and require special measures to control covert channel analysis is the only proven way to control covert channels by contrast , secure operating systems can easily prevent misuse of legitimate channels , so distinguishing both is important analysis of legitimate channels for hidden objects is often misrepresented as the only successful countermeasure for legitimate channel misuse requires analysis of covert storage channels to be classified as a b2 system and analysis of covert timing channels is a requirement for class b3 the use of delays between packets transmitted over computer networks was first explored by girling for covert communication ordinary things , such as existence of a file or time used for a computation , have been the medium through which a covert channel communicates the detection of a covert channel can be made more difficult by using characteristics of the communications medium for the legitimate channel that are never controlled or examined by legitimate users bandwidth : number of data hiding bits per channel use his work focuses on local area networks ( lans ) in which three obvious covert channels ( two storage channel and one timing channel ) are identified the scenario transmits covert information through a '' when-is-sent ‚Äù strategy therefore termed as timing covert channel data hiding in tcp/ip protocol suite by covert channels the research on network covert channels overlaps with the domain of network steganography , which emerged later

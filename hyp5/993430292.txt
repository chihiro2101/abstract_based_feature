covert channels are exceedingly hard to install in real systems , and can often be detected by monitoring system performance they can also be removed manually with a high degree of assurance from secure systems by well established covert channel analysis strategies the legitimate channel misuse by steganography is specifically not a form of covert channel covert channels can tunnel through secure operating systems and require special measures to control covert channel analysis is the only proven way to control covert channels analysis of legitimate channels for hidden objects is often misrepresented as the only successful countermeasure for legitimate channel misuse the tcsec ( tcsec ) was a set of criteria , now deprecated , that had been established by the national computer security center , an agency managed by the united states ' national security agency a covert channel is created by a sender process that modulates some condition ( such as free space , availability of some service , wait time to execute ) that can be detected by a receiving process the tcsec defines two kinds of covert channels : storage channels - communicate by modifying a '' storage location '' , such as a hard drive requires analysis of covert storage channels to be classified as a b2 system and analysis of covert timing channels is a requirement for class b3 the detection of a covert channel can be made more difficult by using characteristics of the communications medium for the legitimate channel that are never controlled or examined by legitimate users data hiding in lan environment by covert channels his work focuses on local area networks ( lans ) in which three obvious covert channels ( two storage channel and one timing channel ) are identified the scenario transmits covert information through a '' when-is-sent ‚Äù strategy therefore termed as timing covert channel data hiding in tcp/ip protocol suite by covert channels the research on network covert channels overlaps with the domain of network steganography , which emerged later

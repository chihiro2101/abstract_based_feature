the classic symptoms of diabetes are frequent urination ( polyuria ) , increased thirst ( polydipsia ) , increased hunger ( polyphagia ) , and weight loss a small number of people with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes can develop a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state ( a condition of very high blood sugar associated with a decreased level of consciousness and hypotension ) in the developed world , and increasingly elsewhere , type & nbsp ; 2 & nbsp ; diabetes is the largest cause of nontraumatic blindness and kidney failure it has also been associated with an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia through disease processes such as alzheimer 's disease and vascular dementia there is also an association between type 2 diabetes and mild hearing loss the development of type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors a lack of sleep has also been linked to type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes dietary factors also influence the risk of developing type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes most cases of diabetes involve many genes , with each being a small contributor to an increased probability of becoming a type & nbsp ; 2 diabetic more than 36 & nbsp ; genes and 80 & nbsp ; single-nucleotide polymorphism ( snps ) had been found that contribute to the risk of type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes these include maturity onset diabetes of the young ( mody ) , donohue syndrome , and rabson–mendenhall syndrome , among others maturity onset diabetes of the young constitute 1–5 % of all cases of diabetes in young people those who have previously had gestational diabetes are at a higher risk of developing type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes is due to insufficient insulin production from beta cells in the setting of insulin resistance however , not all people with insulin resistance develop diabetes since an impairment of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells is also required in the early stages of insulin resistance , the mass of beta cells expands , increasing the output of insulin to compensate for the insulin insensitivity but when type 2 diabetes has become manifest , a type 2 diabetic will have lost about half of their beta cells positive tests should be repeated unless the person presents with typical symptoms and blood sugars > 11.1 & nbsp ; mmol/l ( > 200 & nbsp ; mg/dl ) a fasting or random blood sugar is preferred over the glucose tolerance test , as they are more convenient for people it is estimated that 20 % of people with diabetes in the united states do not realize that they have the disease if the diagnosis is in doubt antibody testing may be useful to confirm type & nbsp ; 1 diabetes and c-peptide levels may be useful to confirm type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes , with c-peptide levels normal or high in type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes , but low in type & nbsp ; 1 diabetes the american diabetes association recommends screening those who have a bmi over 25 ( in people of asian descent screening is recommended for a bmi over 23 ) onset of type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes can be delayed or prevented through proper nutrition and regular exercise in those with impaired glucose tolerance , diet and exercise either alone or in combination with metformin or acarbose may decrease the risk of developing diabetes a 2017 review found that , long term , lifestyle changes decreased the risk by 28 % , while medication does not reduce risk after withdrawal hypoglycemia is associated with adverse outcomes in older people with type 2 diabetes there is weak evidence suggesting that treating gum disease by scaling and root planing may result in a small short-term improvement in blood sugar levels for people with diabetes there is also not enough evidence to determine if medications to treat gum disease are effective at lowering blood sugar levels there is not enough evidence to suggest that cinnamon improves blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes vitamin d supplementation to people with type 2 diabetes may improve markers of insulin resistance and hba1c globally as of 2015 it was estimated that there were 392 & nbsp ; million people with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes making up about 90 % of diabetes cases type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes is now diagnosed as frequently as type & nbsp ; 1 diabetes in teenagers in the united states type & nbsp ; 1 and type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes were identified as separate conditions for the first time by the indian physicians sushruta and charaka in 400–500 & nbsp ; ad with type & nbsp ; 1 associated with youth and type & nbsp ; 2 with being overweight

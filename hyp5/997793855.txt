the classic symptoms of diabetes are frequent urination ( polyuria ) , increased thirst ( polydipsia ) , increased hunger ( polyphagia ) , and weight loss a small number of people with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes can develop a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state ( a condition of very high blood sugar associated with a decreased level of consciousness and hypotension ) type 2 diabetes is typically a chronic disease associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy in the developed world , and increasingly elsewhere , type & nbsp ; 2 & nbsp ; diabetes is the largest cause of nontraumatic blindness and kidney failure it has also been associated with an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia through disease processes such as alzheimer 's disease and vascular dementia there is also an association between type 2 diabetes and mild hearing loss the development of type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors the intestinal bacteria prevotella copri and bacteroides vulgatus have been connected with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes laboratory studies have linked short-term sleep deprivations to changes in glucose metabolism , nervous system activity , or hormonal factors that may lead to diabetes dietary factors also influence the risk of developing type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes most cases of diabetes involve many genes , with each being a small contributor to an increased probability of becoming a type & nbsp ; 2 diabetic more than 36 & nbsp ; genes and 80 & nbsp ; single-nucleotide polymorphism ( snps ) had been found that contribute to the risk of type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes the tcf7l2 allele , for example , increases the risk of developing diabetes by 1.5 & nbsp ; times and is the greatest risk of the common genetic variants there are a number of rare cases of diabetes that arise due to an abnormality in a single gene ( known as monogenic forms of diabetes or diabetes mellitus other types ) those who have previously had gestational diabetes are at a higher risk of developing type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes individuals with cancer may be at a higher risk of mortality if they also have diabetes testosterone deficiency is also associated with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes is due to insufficient insulin production from beta cells in the setting of insulin resistance insulin resistance , which is the inability of cells to respond adequately to normal levels of insulin , occurs primarily within the muscles , liver , and fat tissue however , not all people with insulin resistance develop diabetes since an impairment of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells is also required positive tests should be repeated unless the person presents with typical symptoms and blood sugars > 11.1 & nbsp ; mmol/l ( > 200 & nbsp ; mg/dl ) threshold for diagnosis of diabetes is based on the relationship between results of glucose tolerance tests , fasting glucose or hba 1c and complications such as retinopathy hba 1c has the advantages that fasting is not required and results are more stable but has the disadvantage that the test is more costly than measurement of blood glucose it is estimated that 20 % of people with diabetes in the united states do not realize that they have the disease type 2 diabetes is characterized by high blood glucose in the context of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency if the diagnosis is in doubt antibody testing may be useful to confirm type & nbsp ; 1 diabetes and c-peptide levels may be useful to confirm type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes , with c-peptide levels normal or high in type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes , but low in type & nbsp ; 1 diabetes no major organization recommends universal screening for diabetes as there is no evidence that such a program improve outcomes hypoglycemia is associated with adverse outcomes in older people with type 2 diabetes it is recommended that all people with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes get regular eye examinations aspirin is recommended in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease , however routine use of aspirin has not been found to improve outcomes in uncomplicated diabetes globally as of 2015 it was estimated that there were 392 & nbsp ; million people with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes making up about 90 % of diabetes cases type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes is now diagnosed as frequently as type & nbsp ; 1 diabetes in teenagers in the united states type & nbsp ; 1 and type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes were identified as separate conditions for the first time by the indian physicians sushruta and charaka in 400â€“500 & nbsp ; ad with type & nbsp ; 1 associated with youth and type & nbsp ; 2 with being overweight

the classic symptoms of diabetes are frequent urination ( polyuria ) , increased thirst ( polydipsia ) , increased hunger ( polyphagia ) , and weight loss a small number of people with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes can develop a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state ( a condition of very high blood sugar associated with a decreased level of consciousness and hypotension ) type 2 diabetes is typically a chronic disease associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy in the developed world , and increasingly elsewhere , type & nbsp ; 2 & nbsp ; diabetes is the largest cause of nontraumatic blindness and kidney failure it has also been associated with an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia through disease processes such as alzheimer 's disease and vascular dementia there is also an association between type 2 diabetes and mild hearing loss the development of type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors while some of these factors are under personal control , such as diet and obesity , other factors are not , such as increasing age , female gender , and genetics smoking appears to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes a lack of sleep has also been linked to type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes dietary factors also influence the risk of developing type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes the type of fats in the diet are important , with saturated fats and trans fatty acids increasing the risk , and polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat decreasing the risk most cases of diabetes involve many genes , with each being a small contributor to an increased probability of becoming a type & nbsp ; 2 diabetic more than 36 & nbsp ; genes and 80 & nbsp ; single-nucleotide polymorphism ( snps ) had been found that contribute to the risk of type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes the tcf7l2 allele , for example , increases the risk of developing diabetes by 1.5 & nbsp ; times and is the greatest risk of the common genetic variants these include maturity onset diabetes of the young ( mody ) , donohue syndrome , and rabson–mendenhall syndrome , among others those who have previously had gestational diabetes are at a higher risk of developing type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes testosterone deficiency is also associated with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes is due to insufficient insulin production from beta cells in the setting of insulin resistance however , in the setting of insulin resistance , the liver inappropriately releases glucose into the blood in the early stages of insulin resistance , the mass of beta cells expands , increasing the output of insulin to compensate for the insulin insensitivity threshold for diagnosis of diabetes is based on the relationship between results of glucose tolerance tests , fasting glucose or hba 1c and complications such as retinopathy type 2 diabetes is characterized by high blood glucose in the context of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency this is in contrast to type 1 diabetes in which there is an absolute insulin deficiency due to destruction of islet cells in the pancreas and gestational diabetes that is a new onset of high blood sugars associated with pregnancy type & nbsp ; 1 and type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes can typically be distinguished based on the presenting circumstances screening is recommended by the united states preventive services task force ( uspstf ) in adults without symptoms whose blood pressure is greater than 135/80 & nbsp ; mmhg evidence for the benefit of dietary changes alone , however , is limited , with some evidence for a diet high in green leafy vegetables and some for limiting the intake of sugary drinks in those with impaired glucose tolerance , diet and exercise either alone or in combination with metformin or acarbose may decrease the risk of developing diabetes while low vitamin d levels are associated with an increased risk of diabetes , correcting the levels by supplementing vitamin d3 does not improve that risk management of type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes focuses on lifestyle interventions , lowering other cardiovascular risk factors , and maintaining blood glucose levels in the normal range self-monitoring of blood glucose for people with newly diagnosed type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes may be used in combination with education , although the benefit of self-monitoring in those not using multi-dose insulin is questionable globally as of 2015 it was estimated that there were 392 & nbsp ; million people with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes making up about 90 % of diabetes cases type & nbsp ; 1 and type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes were identified as separate conditions for the first time by the indian physicians sushruta and charaka in 400–500 & nbsp ; ad with type & nbsp ; 1 associated with youth and type & nbsp ; 2 with being overweight

the classic symptoms of diabetes are frequent urination ( polyuria ) , increased thirst ( polydipsia ) , increased hunger ( polyphagia ) , and weight loss a small number of people with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes can develop a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state ( a condition of very high blood sugar associated with a decreased level of consciousness and hypotension ) type 2 diabetes is typically a chronic disease associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy in the developed world , and increasingly elsewhere , type & nbsp ; 2 & nbsp ; diabetes is the largest cause of nontraumatic blindness and kidney failure it has also been associated with an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia through disease processes such as alzheimer 's disease and vascular dementia there is also an association between type 2 diabetes and mild hearing loss the development of type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors the intestinal bacteria prevotella copri and bacteroides vulgatus have been connected with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes lifestyle factors are important to the development of type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes , including obesity and being overweight ( defined by a body mass index of greater than 25 ) , lack of physical activity , poor diet , stress , and urbanization among those who are not obese , a high waist–hip ratio is often present a lack of sleep has also been linked to type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes laboratory studies have linked short-term sleep deprivations to changes in glucose metabolism , nervous system activity , or hormonal factors that may lead to diabetes most cases of diabetes involve many genes , with each being a small contributor to an increased probability of becoming a type & nbsp ; 2 diabetic more than 36 & nbsp ; genes and 80 & nbsp ; single-nucleotide polymorphism ( snps ) had been found that contribute to the risk of type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes the tcf7l2 allele , for example , increases the risk of developing diabetes by 1.5 & nbsp ; times and is the greatest risk of the common genetic variants there are a number of rare cases of diabetes that arise due to an abnormality in a single gene ( known as monogenic forms of diabetes or diabetes mellitus other types ) maturity onset diabetes of the young constitute 1–5 % of all cases of diabetes in young people those who have previously had gestational diabetes are at a higher risk of developing type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes testosterone deficiency is also associated with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes is due to insufficient insulin production from beta cells in the setting of insulin resistance however , in the setting of insulin resistance , the liver inappropriately releases glucose into the blood the proportion of insulin resistance versus beta cell dysfunction differs among individuals , with some having primarily insulin resistance and only a minor defect in insulin secretion and others with slight insulin resistance and primarily a lack of insulin secretion this is in contrast to type 1 diabetes in which there is an absolute insulin deficiency due to destruction of islet cells in the pancreas and gestational diabetes that is a new onset of high blood sugars associated with pregnancy type & nbsp ; 1 and type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes can typically be distinguished based on the presenting circumstances there is an association between higher intake of sugar-sweetened fruit juice and diabetes , but no evidence of an association with 100 % fruit juice in those with impaired glucose tolerance , diet and exercise either alone or in combination with metformin or acarbose may decrease the risk of developing diabetes decreasing the systolic blood pressure to less than 140 & nbsp ; mmhg is associated with a lower risk of death and better outcomes hypoglycemia is associated with adverse outcomes in older people with type 2 diabetes there is weak evidence suggesting that treating gum disease by scaling and root planing may result in a small short-term improvement in blood sugar levels for people with diabetes there is not enough evidence to suggest that cinnamon improves blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes it is recommended that this option be considered in those who are unable to get both their weight and blood sugar under control traditionally considered a disease of adults , type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes is increasingly diagnosed in children in parallel with rising obesity rates type & nbsp ; 1 and type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes were identified as separate conditions for the first time by the indian physicians sushruta and charaka in 400–500 & nbsp ; ad with type & nbsp ; 1 associated with youth and type & nbsp ; 2 with being overweight

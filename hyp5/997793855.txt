the classic symptoms of diabetes are frequent urination ( polyuria ) , increased thirst ( polydipsia ) , increased hunger ( polyphagia ) , and weight loss a small number of people with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes can develop a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state ( a condition of very high blood sugar associated with a decreased level of consciousness and hypotension ) type 2 diabetes is typically a chronic disease associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy in the developed world , and increasingly elsewhere , type & nbsp ; 2 & nbsp ; diabetes is the largest cause of nontraumatic blindness and kidney failure there is also an association between type 2 diabetes and mild hearing loss the development of type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors smoking appears to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes laboratory studies have linked short-term sleep deprivations to changes in glucose metabolism , nervous system activity , or hormonal factors that may lead to diabetes dietary factors also influence the risk of developing type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes persistent organic pollutants may also play a role the tcf7l2 allele , for example , increases the risk of developing diabetes by 1.5 & nbsp ; times and is the greatest risk of the common genetic variants there are a number of rare cases of diabetes that arise due to an abnormality in a single gene ( known as monogenic forms of diabetes or diabetes mellitus other types ) maturity onset diabetes of the young constitute 1â€“5 % of all cases of diabetes in young people testosterone deficiency is also associated with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes eating disorders may also interact with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes , with bulimia nervosa increasing the risk and anorexia nervosa decreasing it type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes is due to insufficient insulin production from beta cells in the setting of insulin resistance however , in the setting of insulin resistance , the liver inappropriately releases glucose into the blood the proportion of insulin resistance versus beta cell dysfunction differs among individuals , with some having primarily insulin resistance and only a minor defect in insulin secretion and others with slight insulin resistance and primarily a lack of insulin secretion however , not all people with insulin resistance develop diabetes since an impairment of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells is also required in the early stages of insulin resistance , the mass of beta cells expands , increasing the output of insulin to compensate for the insulin insensitivity but when type 2 diabetes has become manifest , a type 2 diabetic will have lost about half of their beta cells positive tests should be repeated unless the person presents with typical symptoms and blood sugars > 11.1 & nbsp ; mmol/l ( > 200 & nbsp ; mg/dl ) type 2 diabetes is characterized by high blood glucose in the context of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency this is in contrast to type 1 diabetes in which there is an absolute insulin deficiency due to destruction of islet cells in the pancreas and gestational diabetes that is a new onset of high blood sugars associated with pregnancy type & nbsp ; 1 and type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes can typically be distinguished based on the presenting circumstances if the diagnosis is in doubt antibody testing may be useful to confirm type & nbsp ; 1 diabetes and c-peptide levels may be useful to confirm type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes , with c-peptide levels normal or high in type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes , but low in type & nbsp ; 1 diabetes it is recommended that all people with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes get regular eye examinations there is not enough evidence to suggest that cinnamon improves blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes culturally appropriate education may help people with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes control their blood sugar levels , for up to 24 months 2015 american diabetes association recommendations are that people with diabetes and albuminuria should receive an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system to reduce the risks of progression to end-stage renal disease , cardiovascular events , and death aspirin is recommended in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease , however routine use of aspirin has not been found to improve outcomes in uncomplicated diabetes globally as of 2015 it was estimated that there were 392 & nbsp ; million people with type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes making up about 90 % of diabetes cases type & nbsp ; 2 diabetes is now diagnosed as frequently as type & nbsp ; 1 diabetes in teenagers in the united states

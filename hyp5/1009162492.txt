the dynamic range of an audio system is a measure of the difference between the smallest and largest amplitude values that can be represented in a medium digital and analog differ in both the methods of transfer and storage , as well as the behavior exhibited by the systems due to these methods the dynamic range of digital audio systems can exceed that of analog audio systems consumer analog cassette tapes have a dynamic range of 60 to 70 & nbsp ; db analog fm broadcasts rarely have a dynamic range exceeding 50 & nbsp ; db the dynamic range of a direct-cut vinyl record may surpass 70 & nbsp ; db analog studio master tapes can have a dynamic range of up to 77 & nbsp ; db an lp made out of perfect vinyl lp would have a theoretical dynamic range of 70 & nbsp ; db measurements indicate maximum actual performance in the 60 to 70 & nbsp ; db range the benefits of using digital recorders with greater than 16-bit accuracy can be applied to the 16 bits of audio cd stuart stresses that with the correct dither , the resolution of a digital system is theoretically infinite , and that it is possible , for example , to resolve sounds at −110 & nbsp ; db ( below digital full-scale ) in a well-designed 16 bit channel there are some differences in the behaviour of analog and digital systems when high level signals are present , where there is the possibility that such signals could push the system into overload with high level signals , analog magnetic tape approaches saturation , and high frequency response drops in proportion to low frequency response the opposite is usually true of analog systems , where distortion tends to increase at high signal levels the difference between analog and digital systems is the form of high-level signal error it is usually a design goal of digital systems to limit high-level signals to prevent overload unlike analog duplication , digital copies are exact replicas that can be duplicated indefinitely and without generation loss , in principle consumer cd-r compact discs have a limited and variable lifespan due to both inherent and manufacturing quality issues magnetic tapes , both analog and digital , wear from friction between the tape and the heads , guides , and other parts of the tape transport as the tape slides over them ( sound could , however , be stored on an m-disc dvd-r using the dvd-audio format digital media capable of bit-perfect storage and retrieval have been commonplace for some time , since they were generally developed for software storage which has no tolerance for error this distortion can be rendered as uncorrelated quantization noise through the use of dither each additional bit adds approximately 6 & nbsp ; db in possible snr , e.g 24 x 6 144 & nbsp ; db for 24 bit quantization , 126 & nbsp ; db for 21-bit , and 120 & nbsp ; db for 20-bit this additional motion is added to the desired signal as noise , usually of very low frequencies , creating a rumbling sound during quiet passages very inexpensive turntables sometimes used ball bearings , which are very likely to generate audible amounts of rumble a good turntable should have rumble at least 60 & nbsp ; db below the specified output level from the pick-up because they have no moving parts in the signal path , digital systems are not subject to rumble for lp records , the quality of the turntable will have a large effect on the level of wow and flutter therefore , a sampling frequency of 40 & nbsp ; khz is mathematically sufficient to capture all the information contained in a signal having frequency components less than or equal to 20 & nbsp ; khz compact cassettes may have a response extending up to 15 & nbsp ; khz at full ( 0 & nbsp ; db ) recording level at lower levels ( −10 & nbsp ; db ) , cassettes are typically limited to 20 & nbsp ; khz due to self-erasure of the tape media the low frequency response of vinyl records is restricted by rumble noise ( described above ) , as well as the physical and electrical characteristics of the entire pickup arm and transducer assembly cd4 records contained frequencies up to 50 & nbsp ; khz frequencies of up to 122 & nbsp ; khz have been experimentally cut on lp records using an oversampling design and delta-sigma modulation , the less aggressive analog anti-aliasing filter can be supplemented by a digital filter the digital filter can be made to have a near-ideal transfer function , with low in-band ripple , and no aging or thermal drift analog systems are not subject to a nyquist limit or aliasing and thus do not require anti-aliasing filters or any of the design considerations associated with them sampling the waveform at higher frequencies and allowing for a greater number of bits per sample allows noise and distortion to be reduced further showed that music signals with frequency components above 20 & nbsp ; khz were only distinguished from those without by a few of the 176 test subjects however , nishiguchi et al can still neither confirm nor deny the possibility that some subjects could discriminate between musical sounds with and without very high frequency components a signal is recorded digitally by an analog-to-digital converter , which measures the amplitude of an analog signal at regular intervals specified by the sampling rate , and then stores these sampled numbers in computer hardware this form of distortion , sometimes called granular or quantization distortion , has been pointed to as a fault of some digital systems and recordings particularly some early digital recordings , where the digital release was said to be inferior to the analog version however , '' if the quantisation is performed using the right dither , then the only consequence of the digitisation is effectively the addition of a white , uncorrelated , benign , random noise floor '' the range of possible values that can be represented numerically by a sample is determined by the number of binary digits used there was a mixed critical response to early digital recordings released on cd the super audio cd ( sacd ) format was created by sony and philips , who were also the developers of the earlier standard audio cd format 1- bit ) values at a sample rate of 2.884 & nbsp ; mhz , which is 64 times the 44.1 & nbsp ; khz sample rate used by cd continuous amplitude , discrete time systems have also been used in many early analog-to-digital converters , in the form of sample-and-hold circuits

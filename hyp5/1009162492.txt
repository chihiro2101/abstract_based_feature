the dynamic range of an audio system is a measure of the difference between the smallest and largest amplitude values that can be represented in a medium digital and analog differ in both the methods of transfer and storage , as well as the behavior exhibited by the systems due to these methods the dynamic range of digital audio systems can exceed that of analog audio systems consumer analog cassette tapes have a dynamic range of 60 to 70 & nbsp ; db the dynamic range of a direct-cut vinyl record may surpass 70 & nbsp ; db analog studio master tapes can have a dynamic range of up to 77 & nbsp ; db an lp made out of perfect diamond has an atomic feature size of about 0.5 nanometer , which , with a groove size of 8 micron , yields a theoretical dynamic range of 110 & nbsp ; db stuart stresses that with the correct dither , the resolution of a digital system is theoretically infinite , and that it is possible , for example , to resolve sounds at âˆ’110 & nbsp ; db ( below digital full-scale ) in a well-designed 16 bit channel there are some differences in the behaviour of analog and digital systems when high level signals are present , where there is the possibility that such signals could push the system into overload with high level signals , analog magnetic tape approaches saturation , and high frequency response drops in proportion to low frequency response in principle , pcm digital systems have the lowest level of nonlinear distortion at full signal amplitude the opposite is usually true of analog systems , where distortion tends to increase at high signal levels a study by manson ( 1980 ) considered the requirements of a digital audio system for high quality broadcasting for this reason , it was suggested that a fast-acting signal limiter or 'soft clipper ' be used to prevent the system from becoming overloaded the difference between analog and digital systems is the form of high-level signal error modern converter designs based on sigma-delta modulation may become unstable in overload conditions error correction allows digital formats to tolerate significant media deterioration though digital media is not immune to data loss mathematically , this can be expressed by means of the signal to noise ratio ( snr or s/n ratio ) with digital systems , the quality of reproduction depends on the analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion steps , and does not depend on the quality of the recording medium , provided it is adequate to retain the digital values without error digital media capable of bit-perfect storage and retrieval have been commonplace for some time , since they were generally developed for software storage which has no tolerance for error the process of analog-to-digital conversion will , according to theory , always introduce quantization distortion this distortion can be rendered as uncorrelated quantization noise through the use of dither each additional bit adds approximately 6 & nbsp ; db in possible snr , e.g 24 x 6 144 & nbsp ; db for 24 bit quantization , 126 & nbsp ; db for 21-bit , and 120 & nbsp ; db for 20-bit this additional motion is added to the desired signal as noise , usually of very low frequencies , creating a rumbling sound during quiet passages very inexpensive turntables sometimes used ball bearings , which are very likely to generate audible amounts of rumble increased turntable mass also tends to lead to reduced rumble a good turntable should have rumble at least 60 & nbsp ; db below the specified output level from the pick-up because they have no moving parts in the signal path , digital systems are not subject to rumble wow ( recording ) are a change in frequency of an analog device and are the result of mechanical imperfections , with wow being a slower rate form of flutter owing to their use of precision crystal oscillators for their timebase , digital systems are not subject to wow and flutter this is accomplished using anti-aliasing filters which require a transition band to sufficiently reduce aliasing professional digital recorders may record higher frequencies , while some consumer and telecommunications systems record a more restricted frequency range high quality reel-to-reel machines can extend from 10 & nbsp ; hz to above 20 & nbsp ; khz compact cassettes may have a response extending up to 15 & nbsp ; khz at full ( 0 & nbsp ; db ) recording level the low frequency response of vinyl records is restricted by rumble noise ( described above ) , as well as the physical and electrical characteristics of the entire pickup arm and transducer assembly aliasing is prevented in digital systems by an anti-aliasing filter however , designing an analog filter which precisely removes all frequency content exactly above or below a certain cutoff frequency , is impractical this solution is called oversampling , and allows a less aggressive and lower-cost anti-aliasing filter to be used early digital systems may have suffered from a number of signal degradations related to the use of analog anti-aliasing filters , e.g using an oversampling design and delta-sigma modulation , the less aggressive analog anti-aliasing filter can be supplemented by a digital filter dat can sample audio at up to 48 & nbsp ; khz , while dvd-audio can be 96 or 192 & nbsp ; khz and up to 24 bits resolution this process is called quantization , and these small errors in the measurements are manifested aurally as low level noise or distortion this form of distortion , sometimes called granular or quantization distortion , has been pointed to as a fault of some digital systems and recordings particularly some early digital recordings , where the digital release was said to be inferior to the analog version the accuracy of a digital system is dependent on the sampled amplitude values , but it is also dependent on the temporal regularity of these values a comparison of analog and digital filtering shows technical advantages to both methods analog modeling carries some benefits over their analog counterparts , such as the ability to remove noise from the algorithms and modifications to make the parameters more flexible those who favour the digital format point to the results of blind tests , which demonstrate the high performance possible with digital recorders the boundary is further blurred by digital systems which statistically aim at analog-like behavior , most often by utilizing stochastic dithering and noise shaping techniques

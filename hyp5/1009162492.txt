the dynamic range of an audio system is a measure of the difference between the smallest and largest amplitude values that can be represented in a medium digital and analog differ in both the methods of transfer and storage , as well as the behavior exhibited by the systems due to these methods the dynamic range of digital audio systems can exceed that of analog audio systems consumer analog cassette tapes have a dynamic range of 60 to 70 & nbsp ; db analog fm broadcasts rarely have a dynamic range exceeding 50 & nbsp ; db analog studio master tapes can have a dynamic range of up to 77 & nbsp ; db an lp made out of perfect vinyl lp would have a theoretical dynamic range of 70 & nbsp ; db stuart stresses that with the correct dither , the resolution of a digital system is theoretically infinite , and that it is possible , for example , to resolve sounds at −110 & nbsp ; db ( below digital full-scale ) in a well-designed 16 bit channel there are some differences in the behaviour of analog and digital systems when high level signals are present , where there is the possibility that such signals could push the system into overload with high level signals , analog magnetic tape approaches saturation , and high frequency response drops in proportion to low frequency response in principle , pcm digital systems have the lowest level of nonlinear distortion at full signal amplitude the opposite is usually true of analog systems , where distortion tends to increase at high signal levels a study by manson ( 1980 ) considered the requirements of a digital audio system for high quality broadcasting with many recordings , high level distortions at signal peaks may be audibly masked by the original signal , thus large amounts of distortion may be acceptable at peak signal levels the difference between analog and digital systems is the form of high-level signal error it is usually a design goal of digital systems to limit high-level signals to prevent overload unlike analog duplication , digital copies are exact replicas that can be duplicated indefinitely and without generation loss , in principle when a cd is played , there is no physical contact involved as the data is read optically using a laser beam for electronic audio signals , sources of noise include mechanical , electrical and thermal noise in the recording and playback cycle the amount of noise that a piece of audio equipment adds to the original signal can be quantified mathematically , this can be expressed by means of the signal to noise ratio ( snr or s/n ratio ) sometimes the maximum possible dynamic range of the system is quoted instead with digital systems , the quality of reproduction depends on the analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion steps , and does not depend on the quality of the recording medium , provided it is adequate to retain the digital values without error this distortion can be rendered as uncorrelated quantization noise through the use of dither the 16-bit digital system of red book audio cd has 2 16 65,536 possible signal amplitudes , theoretically allowing for an snr of 98 & nbsp ; db very inexpensive turntables sometimes used ball bearings , which are very likely to generate audible amounts of rumble more expensive turntables tend to use massive sleeve bearings , which are much less likely to generate offensive amounts of rumble a good turntable should have rumble at least 60 & nbsp ; db below the specified output level from the pick-up practical hi-fi sound , 'analogue and digital ' , pages 61–64 ; 'the pick-up , arm and turntable ' , pages 79–82 because they have no moving parts in the signal path , digital systems are not subject to rumble wow ( recording ) are a change in frequency of an analog device and are the result of mechanical imperfections , with wow being a slower rate form of flutter wow and flutter are most noticeable on signals which contain pure tones owing to their use of precision crystal oscillators for their timebase , digital systems are not subject to wow and flutter for digital systems , the upper limit of the frequency response is determined by the sampling frequency the sampling theorem also requires that frequency content above the nyquist frequency be removed from the signal before sampling it the bandwidth provided by the 44,100 hz sampling frequency used by the red book ( cd standard ) is sufficiently wide to cover the entire human hearing range , which roughly extends from 20 & nbsp ; hz to 20 & nbsp ; khz the frequency response for a conventional lp player might be 20 & nbsp ; hz to 20 & nbsp ; khz , ±3 & nbsp ; db the high frequency response of vinyl depends on the cartridge early digital systems may have suffered from a number of signal degradations related to the use of analog anti-aliasing filters , e.g using an oversampling design and delta-sigma modulation , the less aggressive analog anti-aliasing filter can be supplemented by a digital filter instead , the limits of analog storage formats are determined by the physical properties of their construction sampling the waveform at higher frequencies and allowing for a greater number of bits per sample allows noise and distortion to be reduced further dat can sample audio at up to 48 & nbsp ; khz , while dvd-audio can be 96 or 192 & nbsp ; khz and up to 24 bits resolution showed that music signals with frequency components above 20 & nbsp ; khz were only distinguished from those without by a few of the 176 test subjects one aspect that may degrade the performance of a digital system is jitter the accuracy of a digital system is dependent on the sampled amplitude values , but it is also dependent on the temporal regularity of these values the super audio cd ( sacd ) format was created by sony and philips , who were also the developers of the earlier standard audio cd format this digital data stream can therefore be converted to analog by passing it through an analog low-pass filter while not as common as '' pure analog '' or '' pure digital '' methods , these situations do occur in practice

digital and analog differ in both the methods of transfer and storage , as well as the behavior exhibited by the systems due to these methods the dynamic range of digital audio systems can exceed that of analog audio systems consumer analog cassette tapes have a dynamic range of 60 to 70 & nbsp ; db analog fm broadcasts rarely have a dynamic range exceeding 50 & nbsp ; db the dynamic range of a direct-cut vinyl record may surpass 70 & nbsp ; db analog studio master tapes can have a dynamic range of up to 77 & nbsp ; db an lp made out of perfect vinyl lp would have a theoretical dynamic range of 70 & nbsp ; db measurements indicate maximum actual performance in the 60 to 70 & nbsp ; db range stuart stresses that with the correct dither , the resolution of a digital system is theoretically infinite , and that it is possible , for example , to resolve sounds at −110 & nbsp ; db ( below digital full-scale ) in a well-designed 16 bit channel there are some differences in the behaviour of analog and digital systems when high level signals are present , where there is the possibility that such signals could push the system into overload in principle , pcm digital systems have the lowest level of nonlinear distortion at full signal amplitude the opposite is usually true of analog systems , where distortion tends to increase at high signal levels a study by manson ( 1980 ) considered the requirements of a digital audio system for high quality broadcasting for this reason , it was suggested that a fast-acting signal limiter or 'soft clipper ' be used to prevent the system from becoming overloaded with many recordings , high level distortions at signal peaks may be audibly masked by the original signal , thus large amounts of distortion may be acceptable at peak signal levels the difference between analog and digital systems is the form of high-level signal error unlike analog duplication , digital copies are exact replicas that can be duplicated indefinitely and without generation loss , in principle error correction allows digital formats to tolerate significant media deterioration though digital media is not immune to data loss magnetic tapes , both analog and digital , wear from friction between the tape and the heads , guides , and other parts of the tape transport as the tape slides over them cds suffer from disc rot and slowly degrade with time , even if they are stored properly and not played ( sound could , however , be stored on an m-disc dvd-r using the dvd-audio format for electronic audio signals , sources of noise include mechanical , electrical and thermal noise in the recording and playback cycle mathematically , this can be expressed by means of the signal to noise ratio ( snr or s/n ratio ) digital media capable of bit-perfect storage and retrieval have been commonplace for some time , since they were generally developed for software storage which has no tolerance for error this distortion can be rendered as uncorrelated quantization noise through the use of dither the magnitude of this noise or distortion is determined by the number of quantization levels 24 x 6 144 & nbsp ; db for 24 bit quantization , 126 & nbsp ; db for 21-bit , and 120 & nbsp ; db for 20-bit the 16-bit digital system of red book audio cd has 2 16 65,536 possible signal amplitudes , theoretically allowing for an snr of 98 & nbsp ; db practical hi-fi sound , 'analogue and digital ' , pages 61–64 ; 'the pick-up , arm and turntable ' , pages 79–82 because they have no moving parts in the signal path , digital systems are not subject to rumble for digital systems , the upper limit of the frequency response is determined by the sampling frequency this states that a sampled signal can be reproduced exactly as long as it is sampled at a frequency greater than twice the bandwidth of the signal , the nyquist frequency some analog tape manufacturers specify frequency responses up to 20 & nbsp ; khz , but these measurements may have been made at lower signal levels compact cassettes may have a response extending up to 15 & nbsp ; khz at full ( 0 & nbsp ; db ) recording level the low frequency response of vinyl records is restricted by rumble noise ( described above ) , as well as the physical and electrical characteristics of the entire pickup arm and transducer assembly cd4 records contained frequencies up to 50 & nbsp ; khz aliasing is prevented in digital systems by an anti-aliasing filter however , designing an analog filter which precisely removes all frequency content exactly above or below a certain cutoff frequency , is impractical early digital systems may have suffered from a number of signal degradations related to the use of analog anti-aliasing filters , e.g , time dispersion , nonlinear distortion , ripple , temperature dependence of filters etc using an oversampling design and delta-sigma modulation , the less aggressive analog anti-aliasing filter can be supplemented by a digital filter analog systems are not subject to a nyquist limit or aliasing and thus do not require anti-aliasing filters or any of the design considerations associated with them cd quality audio is sampled at 44,100 hz ( nyquist frequency 22.05 & nbsp ; khz ) and at 16 bits with any of these sampling rates , signal information is captured above what is generally considered to be the human hearing range '' the range of possible values that can be represented numerically by a sample is determined by the number of binary digits used there are audio engineers that endorse them and feel that they compare equally in sound to the analog processes that they imitate early digital audio machines had disappointing results , with digital converters introducing errors that the ear could detect while not as common as '' pure analog '' or '' pure digital '' methods , these situations do occur in practice there are many benefits to using digital recording over analog recording because “ numbers are more easily manipulated than are grooves on a record or magnetized particles on a tape ”

the dynamic range of an audio system is a measure of the difference between the smallest and largest amplitude values that can be represented in a medium digital and analog differ in both the methods of transfer and storage , as well as the behavior exhibited by the systems due to these methods the dynamic range of digital audio systems can exceed that of analog audio systems consumer analog cassette tapes have a dynamic range of 60 to 70 & nbsp ; db analog fm broadcasts rarely have a dynamic range exceeding 50 & nbsp ; db the benefits of using digital recorders with greater than 16-bit accuracy can be applied to the 16 bits of audio cd there are some differences in the behaviour of analog and digital systems when high level signals are present , where there is the possibility that such signals could push the system into overload the opposite is usually true of analog systems , where distortion tends to increase at high signal levels a study by manson ( 1980 ) considered the requirements of a digital audio system for high quality broadcasting unlike analog duplication , digital copies are exact replicas that can be duplicated indefinitely and without generation loss , in principle error correction allows digital formats to tolerate significant media deterioration though digital media is not immune to data loss tapes can also suffer creasing , stretching , and frilling of the edges of the plastic tape base , particularly from low-quality or out-of-alignment tape decks when a cd is played , there is no physical contact involved as the data is read optically using a laser beam cds suffer from disc rot and slowly degrade with time , even if they are stored properly and not played for electronic audio signals , sources of noise include mechanical , electrical and thermal noise in the recording and playback cycle the amount of noise that a piece of audio equipment adds to the original signal can be quantified mathematically , this can be expressed by means of the signal to noise ratio ( snr or s/n ratio ) sometimes the maximum possible dynamic range of the system is quoted instead with digital systems , the quality of reproduction depends on the analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion steps , and does not depend on the quality of the recording medium , provided it is adequate to retain the digital values without error digital media capable of bit-perfect storage and retrieval have been commonplace for some time , since they were generally developed for software storage which has no tolerance for error the magnitude of this noise or distortion is determined by the number of quantization levels in binary systems this is determined by and typically stated in terms of the number of bits each additional bit adds approximately 6 & nbsp ; db in possible snr , e.g the 16-bit digital system of red book audio cd has 2 16 65,536 possible signal amplitudes , theoretically allowing for an snr of 98 & nbsp ; db this additional motion is added to the desired signal as noise , usually of very low frequencies , creating a rumbling sound during quiet passages for lp records , the quality of the turntable will have a large effect on the level of wow and flutter the choice of sample sampling frequency in a digital system is based on the nyquist–shannon sampling theorem the sampling theorem also requires that frequency content above the nyquist frequency be removed from the signal before sampling it the bandwidth provided by the 44,100 hz sampling frequency used by the red book ( cd standard ) is sufficiently wide to cover the entire human hearing range , which roughly extends from 20 & nbsp ; hz to 20 & nbsp ; khz professional digital recorders may record higher frequencies , while some consumer and telecommunications systems record a more restricted frequency range some analog tape manufacturers specify frequency responses up to 20 & nbsp ; khz , but these measurements may have been made at lower signal levels at lower levels ( −10 & nbsp ; db ) , cassettes are typically limited to 20 & nbsp ; khz due to self-erasure of the tape media the frequency response for a conventional lp player might be 20 & nbsp ; hz to 20 & nbsp ; khz , ±3 & nbsp ; db aliasing is prevented in digital systems by an anti-aliasing filter however , designing an analog filter which precisely removes all frequency content exactly above or below a certain cutoff frequency , is impractical early digital systems may have suffered from a number of signal degradations related to the use of analog anti-aliasing filters , e.g using an oversampling design and delta-sigma modulation , the less aggressive analog anti-aliasing filter can be supplemented by a digital filter analog systems are not subject to a nyquist limit or aliasing and thus do not require anti-aliasing filters or any of the design considerations associated with them dat can sample audio at up to 48 & nbsp ; khz , while dvd-audio can be 96 or 192 & nbsp ; khz and up to 24 bits resolution ( 2004 ) concluded that '' no significant difference was found between sounds with and without very high frequency components among the sound stimuli and the subjects these results suggest that the main benefit to using higher sample rates is that it pushes consequential phase distortion from the band-limiting filters out of the audible range and that , under ideal conditions , higher sample rates may not be necessary dunn ( 1998 ) examined the performance of digital converters to see if these differences in performance could be explained by the band-limiting filters used in converters and looking for the artifacts they introduce a signal is recorded digitally by an analog-to-digital converter , which measures the amplitude of an analog signal at regular intervals specified by the sampling rate , and then stores these sampled numbers in computer hardware this process is called quantization , and these small errors in the measurements are manifested aurally as low level noise or distortion this sort of test is often used to evaluate the performance of lossy audio compression at any point in time , the amplitude of the original analog signal is represented by the relative preponderance of 1 's over 0 's in the data stream those who favour the digital format point to the results of blind tests , which demonstrate the high performance possible with digital recorders the boundary is further blurred by digital systems which statistically aim at analog-like behavior , most often by utilizing stochastic dithering and noise shaping techniques audiophile audio quality measurement audio system measurements history of sound recording

the dynamic range of an audio system is a measure of the difference between the smallest and largest amplitude values that can be represented in a medium digital and analog differ in both the methods of transfer and storage , as well as the behavior exhibited by the systems due to these methods the dynamic range of digital audio systems can exceed that of analog audio systems consumer analog cassette tapes have a dynamic range of 60 to 70 & nbsp ; db analog fm broadcasts rarely have a dynamic range exceeding 50 & nbsp ; db the dynamic range of a direct-cut vinyl record may surpass 70 & nbsp ; db analog studio master tapes can have a dynamic range of up to 77 & nbsp ; db an lp made out of perfect diamond has an atomic feature size of about 0.5 nanometer , which , with a groove size of 8 micron , yields a theoretical dynamic range of 110 & nbsp ; db an lp made out of perfect vinyl lp would have a theoretical dynamic range of 70 & nbsp ; db the benefits of using digital recorders with greater than 16-bit accuracy can be applied to the 16 bits of audio cd stuart stresses that with the correct dither , the resolution of a digital system is theoretically infinite , and that it is possible , for example , to resolve sounds at −110 & nbsp ; db ( below digital full-scale ) in a well-designed 16 bit channel there are some differences in the behaviour of analog and digital systems when high level signals are present , where there is the possibility that such signals could push the system into overload with high level signals , analog magnetic tape approaches saturation , and high frequency response drops in proportion to low frequency response in principle , pcm digital systems have the lowest level of nonlinear distortion at full signal amplitude for this reason , it was suggested that a fast-acting signal limiter or 'soft clipper ' be used to prevent the system from becoming overloaded the difference between analog and digital systems is the form of high-level signal error error correction allows digital formats to tolerate significant media deterioration though digital media is not immune to data loss magnetic tapes , both analog and digital , wear from friction between the tape and the heads , guides , and other parts of the tape transport as the tape slides over them cds suffer from disc rot and slowly degrade with time , even if they are stored properly and not played for electronic audio signals , sources of noise include mechanical , electrical and thermal noise in the recording and playback cycle the amount of noise that a piece of audio equipment adds to the original signal can be quantified mathematically , this can be expressed by means of the signal to noise ratio ( snr or s/n ratio ) sometimes the maximum possible dynamic range of the system is quoted instead digital media capable of bit-perfect storage and retrieval have been commonplace for some time , since they were generally developed for software storage which has no tolerance for error this distortion can be rendered as uncorrelated quantization noise through the use of dither the 16-bit digital system of red book audio cd has 2 16 65,536 possible signal amplitudes , theoretically allowing for an snr of 98 & nbsp ; db a good turntable should have rumble at least 60 & nbsp ; db below the specified output level from the pick-up practical hi-fi sound , 'analogue and digital ' , pages 61–64 ; 'the pick-up , arm and turntable ' , pages 79–82 because they have no moving parts in the signal path , digital systems are not subject to rumble wow ( recording ) are a change in frequency of an analog device and are the result of mechanical imperfections , with wow being a slower rate form of flutter wow and flutter can also be present in the recording , as a result of the imperfect operation of the recorder owing to their use of precision crystal oscillators for their timebase , digital systems are not subject to wow and flutter some analog tape manufacturers specify frequency responses up to 20 & nbsp ; khz , but these measurements may have been made at lower signal levels at lower levels ( −10 & nbsp ; db ) , cassettes are typically limited to 20 & nbsp ; khz due to self-erasure of the tape media digital systems require that all high frequency signal content above the nyquist frequency must be removed prior to sampling , which , if not done , will result in these ultrasound frequencies '' folding over '' into frequencies which are in the audible range , producing a kind of distortion called aliasing aliasing is prevented in digital systems by an anti-aliasing filter however , designing an analog filter which precisely removes all frequency content exactly above or below a certain cutoff frequency , is impractical early digital systems may have suffered from a number of signal degradations related to the use of analog anti-aliasing filters , e.g sampling the waveform at higher frequencies and allowing for a greater number of bits per sample allows noise and distortion to be reduced further dat can sample audio at up to 48 & nbsp ; khz , while dvd-audio can be 96 or 192 & nbsp ; khz and up to 24 bits resolution showed that music signals with frequency components above 20 & nbsp ; khz were only distinguished from those without by a few of the 176 test subjects he posits that variation is due largely to performance of the band-limiting filters in converters a signal is recorded digitally by an analog-to-digital converter , which measures the amplitude of an analog signal at regular intervals specified by the sampling rate , and then stores these sampled numbers in computer hardware numbers on computers represent a finite set of discrete values , which means that if an analog signal is digitally sampled using native methods ( without dither ) , the amplitude of the audio signal will simply be rounded to the nearest representation this form of distortion , sometimes called granular or quantization distortion , has been pointed to as a fault of some digital systems and recordings particularly some early digital recordings , where the digital release was said to be inferior to the analog version random jitter alters the noise floor of the digital system in the popular hi-fi press , it had been suggested that linear pcm '' creates a stress reaction in people '' , and that dsd '' is the only digital recording system that does not those who favour the digital format point to the results of blind tests , which demonstrate the high performance possible with digital recorders audiophile audio quality measurement audio system measurements history of sound recording

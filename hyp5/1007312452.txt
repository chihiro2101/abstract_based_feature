the subsequent ideological break between him and eliade has been compared by writer gabriela adameşteanu with that between jean-paul sartre and albert camus according to sebastian , eliade had been friendly to him until the start of his political commitments , after which he severed all ties sebastian , passim before their friendship came apart , however , sebastian claimed that he took notes on their conversations ( which he later published ) during which eliade was supposed to have expressed antisemitic views according to sebastian , eliade said in 1939 : the poles ' resistance in warsaw is a jewish resistance the friendship between eliade and sebastian drastically declined during the war : the latter writer , fearing for his security during the pro-nazi ion antonescu regime ( see romania during world war ii ) , hoped that eliade , by then a diplomat , could intervene in his favor ; however , upon his brief return to romania , eliade did not see or approach sebastian paul cernat notes that eliade 's statement includes an admission that he '' counted on sebastian 's support , in order to get back into romanian life and culture '' , and proposes that eliade may have expected his friend to vouch for him in front of hostile authorities eliade provided two distinct explanations for not having met with sebastian : one was related to his claim of being followed around by the gestapo , and the other , expressed in his diaries , was that the shame of representing a regime that humiliated jews had made him avoid facing his former friend another take on the matter was advanced in 1972 by the israeli magazine toladot , which claimed that , as an official representative , eliade was aware of antonescu 's agreement to implement the final solution in romania and of how this could affect sebastian ( see holocaust in romania ) one year later , a text , accompanied by his picture , was featured as answer to an inquiry by the iron guard 's buna vestire about the reasons he had for supporting the movement in october 1940 , as the national legionary state came into existence , the british foreign office blacklisted mircea eliade , alongside five other romanians , due to his iron guard connections and suspicions that he was prepared to spy in favor of nazi germany according to various sources , while in portugal , the diplomat was also preparing to disseminate propaganda in favor of the iron guard the depolitisation of eliade after the start of his diplomatic career was also mistrusted by his former close friend eugène ionesco , who indicated that , upon the close of world war ii , eliade 's personal beliefs as communicated to his friends amounted to '' all is over now that communism has won '' ionesco , 1945 , in ornea , p.184 this forms part of ionesco 's severe and succinct review of the careers of legionary-inspired intellectuals , many of them his friends and former friends , in a letter he sent to tudor vianu ionesco , 1946 , in ornea , p.211 eliade 's former friend , the communist belu zilber , who was attending the paris conference in 1946 , refused to see eliade , arguing that , as an iron guard affiliate , the latter had '' denounced left-wingers '' , and contrasting him with cioran ( '' they are both legionaries , but cioran is honest '' ) ornea , p.210 in august 1954 , when horia sima , who led the iron guard during its exile , was rejected by a faction inside the movement , mircea eliade 's name was included on a list of persons who supported the latter—although this may have happened without his consent he saw himself and other exiled romanian intellectuals as members of a circle who worked to '' maintain the culture of a free romania and , above all , to publish texts that had become unpublishable in romania itself '' eliade , ordeal by labyrinth , in ellwood , p.115 beginning in 1969 , eliade 's past became the subject of public debate in israel at the time , historian gershom scholem asked eliade to explain his attitudes , which the latter did using vague terms during the final years of eliade 's life , his disciple culianu exposed and publicly criticized his 1930s pro-iron guard activities ; relations between the two soured as a result but , in any case , i am led to believe that he was closer to the iron guard than i would have liked to believe volovici , for example , is critical of eliade not only because of his support for the iron guard , but also for spreading antisemitism and anti-masonry in 1930s romania leon volovici , nationalist ideology and antisemitism : the case of romanian intellectuals in the 1930s , pergamon press , oxford , 1991 , p.104–105 , 110–111 , 120–126 , 134 in 1991 , exiled novelist norman manea published an essay firmly condemning eliade 's attachment to the iron guard rennie , have claimed that there is , to date , no evidence of eliade 's membership , active services rendered , or of any real involvement with any fascist or totalitarian movements or membership organizations , nor that there is any evidence of his continued support for nationalist ideals after their inherently violent nature was revealed they further assert that there is no imprint of overt political beliefs in eliade 's scholarship , and also claim that eliade 's critics are following political agendas handoca opined that eliade changed his stance after discovering that the legionaries had turned violent , and argued that there was no evidence of eliade 's actual affiliation with the iron guard as a political movement mircea eliade 's nephew and commentator sorin alexandrescu himself proposed that eliade 's politics were essentially conservative and patriotic , in part motivated by a fear of the soviet union which he shared with many other young intellectuals according to ellwood , the part of eliade that felt attracted to the '' freedom of new beginnings suggested by primal myths '' is the same part that felt attracted to the guard , with its almost mythological notion of a new beginning through a '' national resurrection '' thus , a '' more accessible '' object for nostalgia was a '' secondary silver age within the last few hundred years '' —the kingdom of romania 's 19th century cultural renaissance ellwood , p.xiv to the young eliade , the iron guard seemed like a path for returning to the silver age of romania 's glory , being a movement '' dedicated to the cultural and national renewal of the romanian people by appeal to their spiritual roots '' ellwood , p.91 because of eliade 's withdrawal from politics , and also because the later eliade 's religiosity was very personal and idiosyncratic , ellwood believes the later eliade probably would have rejected the '' corporate sacred '' of the iron guard '' eliade , in ornea , p.210 ornea commented that this was the only instance where the romanian academic spoke of his political involvement with a dose of self-criticism , and contrasted the statement with eliade 's usual refusal to discuss his stances '' pertinently '' in parallel , according to oişteanu ( who relied his assessment on eliade 's own personal notes ) , eliade 's interest in the american hippie community was reciprocated by members of the latter , some of whom reportedly viewed eliade as '' a guru '' the film mircea eliade et la redécouverte du sacré ( 1987 ) , and part of the television series architecture et géographie sacrées by paul barbă neagră , discuss eliade 's works in march 2007 , on eliade 's 100th birthday , the romanian radio broadcasting company hosted the mircea eliade week , during which radio drama adaptations of several works were broadcast trask ) , princeton university press , princeton , 2009 isabela vasiliu-scraba , harismele duhului sfânt si fotografia „ de 14 ani ” ( mircea eliade ) , în rev

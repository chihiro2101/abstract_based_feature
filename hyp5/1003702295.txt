several hexokinase isoforms or isozymes that provide different functions can occur in a single species phosphorylation of a hexose such as glucose often limits it to a number of intracellular metabolic processes , such as glycolysis or glycogen synthesis they are designated hexokinases i , ii , iii , and iv or hexokinases a , b , c , and d hexokinases i , ii , and iii are referred to as '' low-k m '' isozymes because of a high affinity for glucose ( below 1 mm ) hexokinase ii is also located at the mitochondria outer membrane so it can have direct access to atp mammalian hexokinase iv , also referred to as glucokinase , differs from other hexokinases in kinetics and functions glucokinase can only phosphorylate glucose if the concentration of this substrate is high enough ; its km for glucose is 100 times higher than that of hexokinases i , ii , and iii the first step in glycolysis is the phosphorylation of glucose by hexokinase the addition of a charged phosphate group at the 6-position of hexoses also ensures 'trapping ' of glucose and 2-deoxyhexose glucose analogs ( e.g it appears as if hexokinase possesses a single potential transmembrane domain located around amino acid 400 the mutation causes a reduction of the hk activity , which causes hexokinase deficiency .

they are categorized as actin fold proteins , sharing a common atp binding site core that is surrounded by more variable sequences which determine substrate affinities and other properties several hexokinase isoforms or isozymes that provide different functions can occur in a single species phosphorylation of a hexose such as glucose often limits it to a number of intracellular metabolic processes , such as glycolysis or glycogen synthesis this is because phosphorylated hexoses are charged , and thus more difficult to transport out of a cell multicellular organisms including plants and animals often have more than one hexokinase isoform there are four important mammalian hexokinase isozymes that vary in subcellular locations and kinetics with respect to different substrates and conditions , and physiological function they are designated hexokinases i , ii , iii , and iv or hexokinases a , b , c , and d hexokinases i , ii , and iii are referred to as '' low-k m '' isozymes because of a high affinity for glucose ( below 1 mm ) glucokinase can only phosphorylate glucose if the concentration of this substrate is high enough ; its km for glucose is 100 times higher than that of hexokinases i , ii , and iii by catalyzing the phosphorylation of glucose to yield glucose 6-phosphate , hexokinases maintain the downhill concentration gradient that favors the facilitated transport of glucose into cells it appears as if hexokinase possesses a single potential transmembrane domain located around amino acid 400

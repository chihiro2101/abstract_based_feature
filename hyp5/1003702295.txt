genes that encode hexokinase have been discovered in every domain of life , and exist among a variety of species that range from bacteria , yeast , and plants to humans and other vertebrates they are categorized as actin fold proteins , sharing a common atp binding site core that is surrounded by more variable sequences which determine substrate affinities and other properties multicellular organisms including plants and animals often have more than one hexokinase isoform there are four important mammalian hexokinase isozymes that vary in subcellular locations and kinetics with respect to different substrates and conditions , and physiological function they are designated hexokinases i , ii , iii , and iv or hexokinases a , b , c , and d hexokinases i , ii , and iii hexokinases i , ii , and iii are referred to as '' low-k m '' isozymes because of a high affinity for glucose ( below 1 mm ) glucokinase can only phosphorylate glucose if the concentration of this substrate is high enough ; its km for glucose is 100 times higher than that of hexokinases i , ii , and iii hexokinase iv is monomeric , about 50kd , displays positive cooperativity with glucose , and is not allosterically inhibited by its product , glucose-6-phosphate by catalyzing the phosphorylation of glucose to yield glucose 6-phosphate , hexokinases maintain the downhill concentration gradient that favors the facilitated transport of glucose into cells this association confers hexokinase direct access to atp generated by mitochondria , which is one of the two substrates of hexokinase

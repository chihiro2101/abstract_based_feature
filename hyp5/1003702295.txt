several hexokinase isoforms or isozymes that provide different functions can occur in a single species this suggests an evolutionary origin by duplication and fusion of a 50kd ancestral hexokinase similar to those of bacteria there are four important mammalian hexokinase isozymes that vary in subcellular locations and kinetics with respect to different substrates and conditions , and physiological function they are designated hexokinases i , ii , iii , and iv or hexokinases a , b , c , and d each consists of two similar 50kd halves , but only in hexokinase ii do both halves have functional active sites hexokinase ii is also located at the mitochondria outer membrane so it can have direct access to atp hexokinase iii/c is substrate-inhibited by glucose at physiologic concentrations glucose is unique in that it can be used to produce atp by all cells in both the presence and absence of molecular oxygen ( o 2 ) this association confers hexokinase direct access to atp generated by mitochondria , which is one of the two substrates of hexokinase a hydropathy analysis of hexokinase in yeast has been created by these standards it appears as if hexokinase possesses a single potential transmembrane domain located around amino acid 400

several hexokinase isoforms or isozymes that provide different functions can occur in a single species phosphorylation of a hexose such as glucose often limits it to a number of intracellular metabolic processes , such as glycolysis or glycogen synthesis they are designated hexokinases i , ii , iii , and iv or hexokinases a , b , c , and d hexokinases i , ii , and iii hexokinases i , ii , and iii are referred to as '' low-k m '' isozymes because of a high affinity for glucose ( below 1 mm ) hexokinase iii/c is substrate-inhibited by glucose at physiologic concentrations glucose is unique in that it can be used to produce atp by all cells in both the presence and absence of molecular oxygen ( o 2 ) by catalyzing the phosphorylation of glucose to yield glucose 6-phosphate , hexokinases maintain the downhill concentration gradient that favors the facilitated transport of glucose into cells the addition of a charged phosphate group at the 6-position of hexoses also ensures 'trapping ' of glucose and 2-deoxyhexose glucose analogs ( e.g this association confers hexokinase direct access to atp generated by mitochondria , which is one of the two substrates of hexokinase it appears as if hexokinase possesses a single potential transmembrane domain located around amino acid 400

the navigation runs from springfield basin in chelmsford to the sea lock at heybridge basin near maldon there is also a set of flood gates at beeleigh , which prevents water from the river blackwater flooding the cut to heybridge basin the navigation meanders in a broadly west to east direction between chelmsford and maldon , through countryside which is largely arable , and although it passes near to a number of villages , all of them are set back some distance from the waterway prior to the actual construction of the navigation , there had been almost 120 years of proposals for such a scheme , and opposition from the port of maldon , which anticipated that its revenues would fall if vessels could travel to chelmsford in july 1733 , john hore , who was involved in the kennet , stroudwater , and the avon navigation at bristol , proposed two schemes , one to make the river navigable , and another to create a new cut between chelmsford and maldon an act of parliament to authorise the plan was passed on 6 june 1766 , with the stipulation that the work must be completed within 12 years , and that no work could start until 25 per cent of the capital had been raised finally in 1792 , with navigations in other parts of the country bringing increased prosperity to the towns they served , the people of chelmsford decide to avoid the opposition of maldon by bypassing it , and terminating the navigation at heybridge , on the river blackwater below maldon despite spirited opposition by maldon , the bill became an act of parliament on 17 june 1793 , creating the company of the proprietors of the chelmer and blackwater navigation , with powers to raise £40,000 by the issuing of shares , and a further £20,000 if required the port of maldon now tried to mitigate their loss , and with advice from benjamin latrobe , produced a plan to improve the blackwater through maldon to its junction with the chelmer at beeleigh , which was submitted to parliament in 1793 realising that this would make the final cut to heybridge redundant , the navigation company opposed the bill , and it was defeated work continued on the navigation , with the first section from heybridge basin to little baddow opening in april 1796 and the navigation opening throughout on 3 june 1797 12 locks lowered the level of the navigation by from springfield basin in chelmsford to the sea lock at heybridge basin here , the navigation left the course of the river chelmer , and joined that of the river blackwater , before entering the final of cut to heybridge basin the waters of the river blackwater were diverted into the chelmer , flowing over a weir between beeleigh lock and the stop gates the first inland gasworks in britain was built in chelmsford in 1819 , using coal brought up the navigation although trade declined , the impact of the railways was less significant than on many canals following the second world war , the sea lock into heybridge basin was extended to , so that coasters carrying timber from the continent could enter the basin to transfer their cargo to barges the navigation is unusual in that it was not nationalised in 1948 when most of the other waterways in the uk were , and remained under the control of the original company of proprietors of the chelmer & blackwater navigation ltd waterways , issue 223 , ( spring 2009 ) , inland waterways association while essex waterways manage the navigation from day to day , it is still owned by the company of proprietors its maintenance is unusual , in that the northumbrian water group has a statutory obligation to maintain the mitre gates and the sea gate at the eastern end of the lock having checked its dimensions , northumberland water commissioned mwh global and kenneth grub to design a new gate which would fit into the existing pocket , so that no modification of the lock structure would be required the lock was drained in october 2017 for the sea gate to be fitted , and the intermediate mitre gates were also replaced the chelmer & blackwater navigation ltd history of the chelmer and blackwater navigation the chelmer canal trust

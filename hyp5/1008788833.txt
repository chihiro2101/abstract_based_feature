the navigation runs from springfield basin in chelmsford to the sea lock at heybridge basin near maldon there is also a set of flood gates at beeleigh , which prevents water from the river blackwater flooding the cut to heybridge basin the navigation meanders in a broadly west to east direction between chelmsford and maldon , through countryside which is largely arable , and although it passes near to a number of villages , all of them are set back some distance from the waterway prior to the actual construction of the navigation , there had been almost 120 years of proposals for such a scheme , and opposition from the port of maldon , which anticipated that its revenues would fall if vessels could travel to chelmsford the first such scheme was proposed in 1677 by andrew yarranton , who published his idea in a work entitled england 's improvements by sea and land in july 1733 , john hore , who was involved in the kennet , stroudwater , and the avon navigation at bristol , proposed two schemes , one to make the river navigable , and another to create a new cut between chelmsford and maldon peter muilman called a meeting in chelmsford on 2 october 1772 , to propose improvements to the river , but a subsequent meeting decided that a new cut would be a better solution finally in 1792 , with navigations in other parts of the country bringing increased prosperity to the towns they served , the people of chelmsford decide to avoid the opposition of maldon by bypassing it , and terminating the navigation at heybridge , on the river blackwater below maldon the new route would increase the length of the navigation by about , but this plan formed the basis of a parliamentary bill despite spirited opposition by maldon , the bill became an act of parliament on 17 june 1793 , creating the company of the proprietors of the chelmer and blackwater navigation , with powers to raise £40,000 by the issuing of shares , and a further £20,000 if required work started soon afterwards , and although john rennie was officially chief engineer , the project was managed by richard coates , who had also assisted rennie on the ipswich and stowmarket navigation 12 locks lowered the level of the navigation by from springfield basin in chelmsford to the sea lock at heybridge basin here , the navigation left the course of the river chelmer , and joined that of the river blackwater , before entering the final of cut to heybridge basin the waters of the river blackwater were diverted into the chelmer , flowing over a weir between beeleigh lock and the stop gates a community developed around heybridge basin , with richard tovee , a sawyer by trade , and thomas malden , a coal merchant , both buying plots of land to further their trade the first inland gasworks in britain was built in chelmsford in 1819 , using coal brought up the navigation prior to the cessation of commercial traffic in 1972 , pleasure craft were prohibited from using the locks , and for a short period , the only boats to use the navigation were the company work boats and canoes although british waterways were approached , they declined to take over the navigation waterways , issue 223 , ( spring 2009 ) , inland waterways association while essex waterways manage the navigation from day to day , it is still owned by the company of proprietors the cut would avoid a weir and low bridge to rejoin the river system where the river can and chelmer merge , and a new waterside area would be constructed in the town centre the link was downgraded to an '' aspiration '' following a 2008 planning enquiry , although it remained on the town centre development plans , and the replacement essex record office building was sited so that it would overlook the link chelmsford city council commissioned a feasibility study , which proposed that the automatic gates could be replaced , and a navigation lock built alongside the new structure , on the north side of the river the chelmer & blackwater navigation ltd history of the chelmer and blackwater navigation the chelmer canal trust

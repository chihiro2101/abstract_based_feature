the navigation runs from springfield basin in chelmsford to the sea lock at heybridge basin near maldon there is also a set of flood gates at beeleigh , which prevents water from the river blackwater flooding the cut to heybridge basin the navigation meanders in a broadly west to east direction between chelmsford and maldon , through countryside which is largely arable , and although it passes near to a number of villages , all of them are set back some distance from the waterway prior to the actual construction of the navigation , there had been almost 120 years of proposals for such a scheme , and opposition from the port of maldon , which anticipated that its revenues would fall if vessels could travel to chelmsford the first such scheme was proposed in 1677 by andrew yarranton , who published his idea in a work entitled england 's improvements by sea and land in july 1733 , john hore , who was involved in the kennet , stroudwater , and the avon navigation at bristol , proposed two schemes , one to make the river navigable , and another to create a new cut between chelmsford and maldon despite the projected extra costs for a canal , hore favoured the canal scheme , as he believed there would be less objection from the millers along the river route finally in 1792 , with navigations in other parts of the country bringing increased prosperity to the towns they served , the people of chelmsford decide to avoid the opposition of maldon by bypassing it , and terminating the navigation at heybridge , on the river blackwater below maldon the new route would increase the length of the navigation by about , but this plan formed the basis of a parliamentary bill despite spirited opposition by maldon , the bill became an act of parliament on 17 june 1793 , creating the company of the proprietors of the chelmer and blackwater navigation , with powers to raise £40,000 by the issuing of shares , and a further £20,000 if required work started soon afterwards , and although john rennie was officially chief engineer , the project was managed by richard coates , who had also assisted rennie on the ipswich and stowmarket navigation the port of maldon now tried to mitigate their loss , and with advice from benjamin latrobe , produced a plan to improve the blackwater through maldon to its junction with the chelmer at beeleigh , which was submitted to parliament in 1793 realising that this would make the final cut to heybridge redundant , the navigation company opposed the bill , and it was defeated work continued on the navigation , with the first section from heybridge basin to little baddow opening in april 1796 and the navigation opening throughout on 3 june 1797 12 locks lowered the level of the navigation by from springfield basin in chelmsford to the sea lock at heybridge basin here , the navigation left the course of the river chelmer , and joined that of the river blackwater , before entering the final of cut to heybridge basin the waters of the river blackwater were diverted into the chelmer , flowing over a weir between beeleigh lock and the stop gates a community developed around heybridge basin , with richard tovee , a sawyer by trade , and thomas malden , a coal merchant , both buying plots of land to further their trade further improvements were made , including the rebuilding of heybridge sea lock by james green , and trade developed steadily leisure boats used the navigation for the first time in 1973 , when the inland waterways association ( iwa ) organised a rally at kings head meadow , chelmsford its maintenance is unusual , in that the northumbrian water group has a statutory obligation to maintain the mitre gates and the sea gate at the eastern end of the lock when the hanningfield water order 1950 was passed by parliament , it included a clause that made the water companies responsible for the lock gates , because water from the navigation would be pumped to the reservoir , and they needed to esnure that it would not become contaminated with salt the chelmer & blackwater navigation ltd history of the chelmer and blackwater navigation the chelmer canal trust

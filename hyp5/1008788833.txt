the navigation runs from springfield basin in chelmsford to the sea lock at heybridge basin near maldon there is also a set of flood gates at beeleigh , which prevents water from the river blackwater flooding the cut to heybridge basin prior to the actual construction of the navigation , there had been almost 120 years of proposals for such a scheme , and opposition from the port of maldon , which anticipated that its revenues would fall if vessels could travel to chelmsford in july 1733 , john hore , who was involved in the kennet , stroudwater , and the avon navigation at bristol , proposed two schemes , one to make the river navigable , and another to create a new cut between chelmsford and maldon the next schemes were proposed in 1762 , when the canal engineers john smeaton and thomas yeoman both carried out surveys for a possible route muilman announced that this scheme would probably not require any locks , and advocated that he should build it once robert whitworth had surveyed it , but nothing came of this under the direction of john rennie charles wedge surveyed the route in 1792 and matthew hall surveyed it in 1793 the new route would increase the length of the navigation by about , but this plan formed the basis of a parliamentary bill despite spirited opposition by maldon , the bill became an act of parliament on 17 june 1793 , creating the company of the proprietors of the chelmer and blackwater navigation , with powers to raise £40,000 by the issuing of shares , and a further £20,000 if required work started soon afterwards , and although john rennie was officially chief engineer , the project was managed by richard coates , who had also assisted rennie on the ipswich and stowmarket navigation the grave of richard coates stands in springfield churchyard , while rennie 's original survey book for the canal has been preserved realising that this would make the final cut to heybridge redundant , the navigation company opposed the bill , and it was defeated work continued on the navigation , with the first section from heybridge basin to little baddow opening in april 1796 and the navigation opening throughout on 3 june 1797 12 locks lowered the level of the navigation by from springfield basin in chelmsford to the sea lock at heybridge basin here , the navigation left the course of the river chelmer , and joined that of the river blackwater , before entering the final of cut to heybridge basin the waters of the river blackwater were diverted into the chelmer , flowing over a weir between beeleigh lock and the stop gates the navigation was constructed with only of water , which was the lowest statutory draught for any of the english commercial waterways the navigation is unusual in that it was not nationalised in 1948 when most of the other waterways in the uk were , and remained under the control of the original company of proprietors of the chelmer & blackwater navigation ltd it is estimated that the project would take two years to complete at a cost of around £6 million , much of which would be provided by community infrastructure levy money , from the housing developments taking place in the vicinity having checked its dimensions , northumberland water commissioned mwh global and kenneth grub to design a new gate which would fit into the existing pocket , so that no modification of the lock structure would be required while the lock was isolated , it was decided that the upper timber gates would also be replaced , and new gates were manufactured from sustainably sourced oak and ekki the lock was drained in october 2017 for the sea gate to be fitted , and the intermediate mitre gates were also replaced the chelmer & blackwater navigation ltd history of the chelmer and blackwater navigation the chelmer canal trust

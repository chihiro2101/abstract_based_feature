the navigation runs from springfield basin in chelmsford to the sea lock at heybridge basin near maldon there is also a set of flood gates at beeleigh , which prevents water from the river blackwater flooding the cut to heybridge basin the navigation meanders in a broadly west to east direction between chelmsford and maldon , through countryside which is largely arable , and although it passes near to a number of villages , all of them are set back some distance from the waterway prior to the actual construction of the navigation , there had been almost 120 years of proposals for such a scheme , and opposition from the port of maldon , which anticipated that its revenues would fall if vessels could travel to chelmsford in july 1733 , john hore , who was involved in the kennet , stroudwater , and the avon navigation at bristol , proposed two schemes , one to make the river navigable , and another to create a new cut between chelmsford and maldon peter muilman called a meeting in chelmsford on 2 october 1772 , to propose improvements to the river , but a subsequent meeting decided that a new cut would be a better solution under the direction of john rennie charles wedge surveyed the route in 1792 and matthew hall surveyed it in 1793 despite spirited opposition by maldon , the bill became an act of parliament on 17 june 1793 , creating the company of the proprietors of the chelmer and blackwater navigation , with powers to raise £40,000 by the issuing of shares , and a further £20,000 if required realising that this would make the final cut to heybridge redundant , the navigation company opposed the bill , and it was defeated work continued on the navigation , with the first section from heybridge basin to little baddow opening in april 1796 and the navigation opening throughout on 3 june 1797 12 locks lowered the level of the navigation by from springfield basin in chelmsford to the sea lock at heybridge basin an additional stop lock protected the new cut from flooding at beeleigh here , the navigation left the course of the river chelmer , and joined that of the river blackwater , before entering the final of cut to heybridge basin the navigation was constructed with only of water , which was the lowest statutory draught for any of the english commercial waterways a community developed around heybridge basin , with richard tovee , a sawyer by trade , and thomas malden , a coal merchant , both buying plots of land to further their trade leisure boats used the navigation for the first time in 1973 , when the inland waterways association ( iwa ) organised a rally at kings head meadow , chelmsford after negotiations with the administrator , the inland waterways association ( iwa ) signed a maintenance and operating agreement in november 2005 to take over responsibility for the running of the navigation through a wholly owned subsidiary called essex waterways ltd the towpath from maldon to chelmsford has been designated as a public footpath , and is maintained in good order access to the navigation from the river blackwater is only possible at certain states of the tide , and advance booking to use the sea lock is required the cut would avoid a weir and low bridge to rejoin the river system where the river can and chelmer merge , and a new waterside area would be constructed in the town centre chelmsford city council commissioned a feasibility study , which proposed that the automatic gates could be replaced , and a navigation lock built alongside the new structure , on the north side of the river while the lock was isolated , it was decided that the upper timber gates would also be replaced , and new gates were manufactured from sustainably sourced oak and ekki the chelmer & blackwater navigation ltd history of the chelmer and blackwater navigation the chelmer canal trust

the navigation runs from springfield basin in chelmsford to the sea lock at heybridge basin near maldon there is also a set of flood gates at beeleigh , which prevents water from the river blackwater flooding the cut to heybridge basin the navigation meanders in a broadly west to east direction between chelmsford and maldon , through countryside which is largely arable , and although it passes near to a number of villages , all of them are set back some distance from the waterway prior to the actual construction of the navigation , there had been almost 120 years of proposals for such a scheme , and opposition from the port of maldon , which anticipated that its revenues would fall if vessels could travel to chelmsford the first such scheme was proposed in 1677 by andrew yarranton , who published his idea in a work entitled england 's improvements by sea and land in july 1733 , john hore , who was involved in the kennet , stroudwater , and the avon navigation at bristol , proposed two schemes , one to make the river navigable , and another to create a new cut between chelmsford and maldon peter muilman called a meeting in chelmsford on 2 october 1772 , to propose improvements to the river , but a subsequent meeting decided that a new cut would be a better solution the new route would increase the length of the navigation by about , but this plan formed the basis of a parliamentary bill despite spirited opposition by maldon , the bill became an act of parliament on 17 june 1793 , creating the company of the proprietors of the chelmer and blackwater navigation , with powers to raise £40,000 by the issuing of shares , and a further £20,000 if required work started soon afterwards , and although john rennie was officially chief engineer , the project was managed by richard coates , who had also assisted rennie on the ipswich and stowmarket navigation the grave of richard coates stands in springfield churchyard , while rennie 's original survey book for the canal has been preserved 12 locks lowered the level of the navigation by from springfield basin in chelmsford to the sea lock at heybridge basin here , the navigation left the course of the river chelmer , and joined that of the river blackwater , before entering the final of cut to heybridge basin the waters of the river blackwater were diverted into the chelmer , flowing over a weir between beeleigh lock and the stop gates the navigation experienced some teething problems , with floods in 1797 creating shoals which prevented the passage of barges further improvements were made , including the rebuilding of heybridge sea lock by james green , and trade developed steadily local wharfs served the communities of little baddow , boreham , ulting and heybridge although commercial traffic ceased , the navigation continued to derive income from water abstraction and from the sale of wood from the willows which grow along the banks the navigation is unusual in that it was not nationalised in 1948 when most of the other waterways in the uk were , and remained under the control of the original company of proprietors of the chelmer & blackwater navigation ltd leisure boats used the navigation for the first time in 1973 , when the inland waterways association ( iwa ) organised a rally at kings head meadow , chelmsford access to the navigation from the river blackwater is only possible at certain states of the tide , and advance booking to use the sea lock is required the navigation is connected to the tidal river blackwater by heybridge sea lock the chelmer & blackwater navigation ltd history of the chelmer and blackwater navigation the chelmer canal trust

this important case represented an immediate challenge to the civil rights act of 1964 , the landmark piece of civil rights legislation which represented the first comprehensive act by congress on civil rights and race relations since the civil rights act of 1875 for much of the 100 years preceding 1964 , african americans in the united states had been dominated by racial segregation , a system of racial separation which , while in name providing for '' separate but equal '' treatment of both white and african americans , in deed provided inferior accommodation , services , and treatment for african americans rolleston specifically argued against title ii of the civil rights act of 1964 , which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race , religion , or national origin in places of public accommodation hotels and motels are included as types of public accommodation in the act , and so are restaurants that serve food substantially to those who participate in interstate travel therefore , a hotel or motel does not necessarily engage in interstate commerce because the profit comes from persons rather than goods rolleston also asserted that racial discrimination by an individual is not prohibited by the fourteenth amendment or the constitution , claiming that discrimination is a private wrong that individuals are allowed to commit in addition , rolleston maintained that it violated his fifth amendment rights to choose customers and operate his business as he wished and resulted in unjust deprivation of his property without due process of law and just compensation he concluded his opening argument by stating that the supreme court did not need to exist if the commerce clause allowed for congress to enact any regulations it pleases in response , archibald cox , the solicitor general of the united states , countered that the restrictions requiring adequate accommodation for african americans were unquestionably related to interstate travel and that congress , under the constitution 's commerce clause , certainly had the power to address such a matter in law cox also highlighted how discrimination by hotels and motels hinders interstate travel by limiting the availability of accommodations for travelers having observed that 75 % of the heart of atlanta motel 's clientele came from out-of-state and that it was strategically located near interstates 75 and 85 as well as two major georgia highways , the court found that the business clearly affected interstate commerce the courts compared out-of-state campers staying at a summer camp to out-of-state residents occupying a hotel , deeming the camp a participant in interstate commerce

the book absolute or relative motion ? ( 1896 ) by benedict friedländer and his brother immanuel contained ideas similar to mach 's principle einstein , letter to ernst mach , zurich , 25 june 1913 , in in this sense , at least some of mach 's principles are related to philosophical holism the writing in which einstein found inspiration from mach was '' the science of mechanics '' , where the philosopher criticized newton 's idea of absolute space , in particular the argument that newton gave sustaining the existence of an advantaged reference system : what is commonly called '' newton 's bucket argument '' in his philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica , newton tried to demonstrate that one can always decide if one is rotating with respect to the absolute space , measuring the apparent forces that arise only when an absolute rotation is performed if a bucket is filled with water , and made to rotate , initially the water remains still , but then , gradually , the walls of the vessel communicate their motion to the water , making it curve and climb up the borders of the bucket , because of the centrifugal forces produced by the rotation this thought experiment demonstrates that the centrifugal forces arise only when the water is in rotation with respect to the absolute space ( represented here by the earth 's reference frame , or better , the distant stars ) instead , when the bucket was rotating with respect to the water no centrifugal forces were produced , this indicating that the latter was still with respect to the absolute space mach , in his book , says that the bucket experiment only demonstrates that when the water is in rotation with respect to the bucket no centrifugal forces are produced , and that we can not know how the water would behave if in the experiment the bucket 's walls were increased in depth and width until they became leagues big , one can not simply say that the water is rotating , but must specify if it 's rotating with respect to the vessel or to the earth ) because intuitive notions of distance and time no longer apply , what exactly is meant by '' mach 's principle '' in general relativity is even less clear than in newtonian physics and at least 21 formulations of mach 's principle are possible , some being considered more strongly machian than others einstein , before completing his development of the general theory of relativity , found an effect which he interpreted as being evidence of mach 's principle einstein was so satisfied with this manifestation of mach 's principle that he wrote a letter to mach expressing this : the lense–thirring effect certainly satisfies the very basic and broad notion that '' matter there influences inertia here '' a stronger form of mach 's principle applies in wheeler–mach–einstein spacetimes , which require spacetime to be spatially compact and globally hyperbolic

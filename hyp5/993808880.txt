the book absolute or relative motion ? ( 1896 ) by benedict friedländer and his brother immanuel contained ideas similar to mach 's principle mach 's principle is sometimes interpreted as the statement that such a particle 's state of motion has no meaning in that case einstein , letter to ernst mach , zurich , 25 june 1913 , in in this sense , at least some of mach 's principles are related to philosophical holism mach 's suggestion can be taken as the injunction that gravitation theories should be relational theory einstein brought the principle into mainstream physics while working on general relativity indeed , it was einstein who first coined the phrase mach 's principle most physicists believe mach 's principle was never developed into a quantitative physical theory that would explain a mechanism by which the stars can have such an effect although einstein was intrigued and inspired by mach 's principle , einstein 's formulation of the principle is not a fundamental assumption of general relativity mach 's principle in general relativity einstein , before completing his development of the general theory of relativity , found an effect which he interpreted as being evidence of mach 's principle as for the statement that '' inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies '' , this too could be interpreted as true in the context of the effect a stronger form of mach 's principle applies in wheeler–mach–einstein spacetimes , which require spacetime to be spatially compact and globally hyperbolic

the book absolute or relative motion ? ( 1896 ) by benedict friedl√§nder and his brother immanuel contained ideas similar to mach 's principle mach 's principle is sometimes interpreted as the statement that such a particle 's state of motion has no meaning in that case in mach 's words , the principle is embodied as follows : this is a reprint of the english translation by thomas h mcormack ( first published in 1906 ) with a new introduction by karl menger albert einstein seemed to view mach 's principle as something along the lines of : a einstein , letter to ernst mach , zurich , 25 june 1913 , in in this sense , at least some of mach 's principles are related to philosophical holism einstein brought the principle into mainstream physics while working on general relativity indeed , it was einstein who first coined the phrase mach 's principle it is then not clear , in the passages from mach just mentioned , if the philosopher intended to formulate a new kind of physical action between heavy bodies although einstein was intrigued and inspired by mach 's principle , einstein 's formulation of the principle is not a fundamental assumption of general relativity mach 's principle in general relativity einstein , before completing his development of the general theory of relativity , found an effect which he interpreted as being evidence of mach 's principle modern relativists see the imprints of mach 's principle in the initial-value problem

radius is an aaa protocol that manages network access radius uses two packet types to manage the full aaa process : access-request , which manages authentication and authorization ; and accounting-request , which manages accounting the user or machine sends a request to a network access server ( nas ) to gain access to a particular network resource using access credentials in turn , the nas sends a radius access request message to the radius server , requesting authorization to grant access via the radius protocol rfc 2865 remote authentication dial in user service ( radius ) this request includes access credentials , typically in the form of username and password or security certificate provided by the user the radius server checks that the information is correct using authentication schemes such as pap , chap or eap the user 's proof of identification is verified , along with , optionally , other information related to the request , such as the user 's network address or phone number , account status , and specific network service access privileges the radius server then returns one of three responses to the nas : 1 ) access reject , 2 ) access challenge , or 3 ) access accept access challenge is also used in more complex authentication dialogs where a secure tunnel is established between the user machine and the radius server in a way that the access credentials are hidden from the nas when network access is granted to the user by the nas , an accounting start ( a radius accounting request packet containing an acct-status-type attribute with the value '' start '' ) is sent by the nas to the radius server to signal the start of the user 's network access when a radius server receives an aaa request for a user name containing a realm , the server will reference a table of configured realms proxy chaining is possible in radius and authentication/authorization and accounting packets are usually routed between a nas device and a home server through a series of proxies radius types an analysis of the radius authentication protocol decoding a sniffer-trace of radius transaction using wireshark to debug radius

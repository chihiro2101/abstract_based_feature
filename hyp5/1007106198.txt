radius is an aaa protocol that manages network access aaa stands for authentication , authorization and accounting radius uses two packet types to manage the full aaa process : access-request , which manages authentication and authorization ; and accounting-request , which manages accounting the user or machine sends a request to a network access server ( nas ) to gain access to a particular network resource using access credentials in turn , the nas sends a radius access request message to the radius server , requesting authorization to grant access via the radius protocol additionally , the request may contain other information which the nas knows about the user , such as its network address or phone number , and information regarding the user 's physical point of attachment to the nas historically , radius servers checked the user 's information against a locally stored flat file database the radius server then returns one of three responses to the nas : 1 ) access reject , 2 ) access challenge , or 3 ) access accept access challenge is also used in more complex authentication dialogs where a secure tunnel is established between the user machine and the radius server in a way that the access credentials are hidden from the nas once the user is authenticated , the radius server will often check that the user is authorized to use the network service requested when network access is granted to the user by the nas , an accounting start ( a radius accounting request packet containing an acct-status-type attribute with the value '' start '' ) is sent by the nas to the radius server to signal the start of the user 's network access proxy chaining is possible in radius and authentication/authorization and accounting packets are usually routed between a nas device and a home server through a series of proxies radius types an analysis of the radius authentication protocol decoding a sniffer-trace of radius transaction using wireshark to debug radius

radius is an aaa protocol that manages network access the user or machine sends a request to a network access server ( nas ) to gain access to a particular network resource using access credentials in turn , the nas sends a radius access request message to the radius server , requesting authorization to grant access via the radius protocol rfc 2865 remote authentication dial in user service ( radius ) this request includes access credentials , typically in the form of username and password or security certificate provided by the user additionally , the request may contain other information which the nas knows about the user , such as its network address or phone number , and information regarding the user 's physical point of attachment to the nas the user 's proof of identification is verified , along with , optionally , other information related to the request , such as the user 's network address or phone number , account status , and specific network service access privileges modern radius servers can do this , or can refer to external sources—commonly sql , kerberos , ldap , or active directory servers—to verify the user 's credentials the radius server then returns one of three responses to the nas : 1 ) access reject , 2 ) access challenge , or 3 ) access accept ; access challenge : requests additional information from the user such as a secondary password , pin , token , or card access challenge is also used in more complex authentication dialogs where a secure tunnel is established between the user machine and the radius server in a way that the access credentials are hidden from the nas when network access is granted to the user by the nas , an accounting start ( a radius accounting request packet containing an acct-status-type attribute with the value '' start '' ) is sent by the nas to the radius server to signal the start of the user 's network access rfc 2866 radius accounting periodically , interim update records ( a radius accounting request packet containing an acct-status-type attribute with the value '' interim-update '' ) may be sent by the nas to the radius server , to update it on the status of an active session when a radius server receives an aaa request for a user name containing a realm , the server will reference a table of configured realms

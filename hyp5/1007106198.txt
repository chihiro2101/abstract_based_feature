radius is an aaa protocol that manages network access radius uses two packet types to manage the full aaa process : access-request , which manages authentication and authorization ; and accounting-request , which manages accounting authentication and authorization are defined in rfc 2865 while accounting is described by rfc 2866 the user or machine sends a request to a network access server ( nas ) to gain access to a particular network resource using access credentials in turn , the nas sends a radius access request message to the radius server , requesting authorization to grant access via the radius protocol the user 's proof of identification is verified , along with , optionally , other information related to the request , such as the user 's network address or phone number , account status , and specific network service access privileges modern radius servers can do this , or can refer to external sources—commonly sql , kerberos , ldap , or active directory servers—to verify the user 's credentials access challenge is also used in more complex authentication dialogs where a secure tunnel is established between the user machine and the radius server in a way that the access credentials are hidden from the nas ; access accept : the user is granted access once the user is authenticated , the radius server will often check that the user is authorized to use the network service requested again , this information may be stored locally on the radius server , or may be looked up in an external source such as ldap or active directory realms can also be compounded using both prefix and postfix notation , to allow for complicated roaming scenarios ; for example , somedomain.com\username anotherdomain.com could be a valid username with two realms radius types an analysis of the radius authentication protocol decoding a sniffer-trace of radius transaction using wireshark to debug radius

radius is an aaa protocol that manages network access the user or machine sends a request to a network access server ( nas ) to gain access to a particular network resource using access credentials in turn , the nas sends a radius access request message to the radius server , requesting authorization to grant access via the radius protocol rfc 2865 remote authentication dial in user service ( radius ) this request includes access credentials , typically in the form of username and password or security certificate provided by the user the user 's proof of identification is verified , along with , optionally , other information related to the request , such as the user 's network address or phone number , account status , and specific network service access privileges modern radius servers can do this , or can refer to external sources—commonly sql , kerberos , ldap , or active directory servers—to verify the user 's credentials access challenge is also used in more complex authentication dialogs where a secure tunnel is established between the user machine and the radius server in a way that the access credentials are hidden from the nas once the user is authenticated , the radius server will often check that the user is authorized to use the network service requested again , this information may be stored locally on the radius server , or may be looked up in an external source such as ldap or active directory when network access is granted to the user by the nas , an accounting start ( a radius accounting request packet containing an acct-status-type attribute with the value '' start '' ) is sent by the nas to the radius server to signal the start of the user 's network access rfc 2866 radius accounting periodically , interim update records ( a radius accounting request packet containing an acct-status-type attribute with the value '' interim-update '' ) may be sent by the nas to the radius server , to update it on the status of an active session proxy chaining is possible in radius and authentication/authorization and accounting packets are usually routed between a nas device and a home server through a series of proxies radius types an analysis of the radius authentication protocol decoding a sniffer-trace of radius transaction using wireshark to debug radius

the idea of these meetings was first suggested in a letter to the archbishop of canterbury by bishop john henry hopkins of the episcopal diocese of vermont in 1851 the possibility of such an international gathering of bishops had first emerged during the jubilee of the church missionary society in 1851 when a number of us bishops were present in london they therefore requested him to call a '' national synod of the bishops of the anglican church at home and abroad '' , to meet under his leadership after consulting both houses of the convocation of canterbury , archbishop longley assented and convened all the bishops of the anglican communion ( then 144 in number ) to meet at lambeth in 1867 the resolutions of the lambeth conferences have never been regarded as synodical decrees , but '' their weight has increased with each conference '' seventy-six bishops accepted the primate 's invitation to the first conference , which met at lambeth on 24 september 1867 and sat for four days , the sessions being in private the archbishop opened the conference with an address : deliberation followed ; committees were appointed to report on special questions ; resolutions were adopted , and an encyclical letter was addressed to the faithful of the anglican communion in 1978 the bishops ' spouses were accommodated at the nearby st edmund 's school ( an anglican private school ) ; this separation of spouses was not felt helpful the archbishop of york and several other english bishops refused to attend because they thought such a conference would cause '' increased confusion '' about controversial issues day two was spent on a discussion of synodical authority concluding that the faith and unity of the anglican communion would be best maintained by there being a synod above those of the '' several branches '' '' longley refused to accept a condemnatory resolution proposed by hopkins , presiding bishop of the americans , but they later voted to note 'the hurt done to the whole communion by the state of the church in natal ' of the 13 resolutions adopted by the conference , 2 have direct reference to the natal situation on the final day , the bishops attended holy communion at lambeth parish church at which longley presided ; fulford of montreal , one of the instigators of the original request , preached the bishops then moved lambeth for the first session on 2 july , after holy communion at which tait presided and thomson of york preached , the bishops gathered in the library a bishop who rose to thank to express gratitude for his change of mind was rebuked with the words , '' sir you may thank me all you wish , but you must thank me in silence '' conference of bishops of the anglican communion , encyclical letter , etc archive of lambeth conferences resolutions a pan-anglican synod

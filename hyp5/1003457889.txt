the idea of these meetings was first suggested in a letter to the archbishop of canterbury by bishop john henry hopkins of the episcopal diocese of vermont in 1851 the possibility of such an international gathering of bishops had first emerged during the jubilee of the church missionary society in 1851 when a number of us bishops were present in london they therefore requested him to call a '' national synod of the bishops of the anglican church at home and abroad '' , to meet under his leadership after consulting both houses of the convocation of canterbury , archbishop longley assented and convened all the bishops of the anglican communion ( then 144 in number ) to meet at lambeth in 1867 the resolutions of the lambeth conferences have never been regarded as synodical decrees , but '' their weight has increased with each conference the archbishop opened the conference with an address : deliberation followed ; committees were appointed to report on special questions ; resolutions were adopted , and an encyclical letter was addressed to the faithful of the anglican communion the archbishop of york and several other english bishops refused to attend because they thought such a conference would cause '' increased confusion '' about controversial issues the conference began with a celebration of the holy communion at which henry john whitehouse , the second bishop of illinois , preached ; wilberforce of oxford later described the sermon as '' wordy but not devoid of a certain impressiveness '' the session was spent discussing a '' preamble to the subsequent resolutions '' that would be issued after the conference '' longley refused to accept a condemnatory resolution proposed by hopkins , presiding bishop of the americans , but they later voted to note 'the hurt done to the whole communion by the state of the church in natal ' there had been no plan for further debate but the bishops unexpectedly returned to the subject of colenso , delaying the end of the conference on the final day , the bishops attended holy communion at lambeth parish church at which longley presided ; fulford of montreal , one of the instigators of the original request , preached the bishops then moved lambeth for the first session on 2 july , after holy communion at which tait presided and thomson of york preached , the bishops gathered in the library the arrangements did not go well and the dean of canterbury complained of 'the appalling mismanagement by the railway authorities' the proposal did not arise from the formal debates of the conference but amongst a group of bishops talking over tea on the lawn of lambeth palace conference of bishops of the anglican communion , encyclical letter , etc records of the lambeth conference at lambeth palace library

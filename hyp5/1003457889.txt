the idea of these meetings was first suggested in a letter to the archbishop of canterbury by bishop john henry hopkins of the episcopal diocese of vermont in 1851 the possibility of such an international gathering of bishops had first emerged during the jubilee of the church missionary society in 1851 when a number of us bishops were present in london they therefore requested him to call a '' national synod of the bishops of the anglican church at home and abroad '' , to meet under his leadership after consulting both houses of the convocation of canterbury , archbishop longley assented and convened all the bishops of the anglican communion ( then 144 in number ) to meet at lambeth in 1867 the resolutions of the lambeth conferences have never been regarded as synodical decrees , but '' their weight has increased with each conference '' seventy-six bishops accepted the primate 's invitation to the first conference , which met at lambeth on 24 september 1867 and sat for four days , the sessions being in private the archbishop opened the conference with an address : deliberation followed ; committees were appointed to report on special questions ; resolutions were adopted , and an encyclical letter was addressed to the faithful of the anglican communion in 1978 the bishops ' spouses were accommodated at the nearby st edmund 's school ( an anglican private school ) ; this separation of spouses was not felt helpful presided over by : charles thomas longley 76 bishops were present the archbishop of york and several other english bishops refused to attend because they thought such a conference would cause '' increased confusion '' about controversial issues there had been no plan for further debate but the bishops unexpectedly returned to the subject of colenso , delaying the end of the conference on the final day , the bishops attended holy communion at lambeth parish church at which longley presided ; fulford of montreal , one of the instigators of the original request , preached no one session of the conference had all the bishops attending although all signed the address and longley was authorised to add the names of absent bishops who later subscribed to it the bishops then moved lambeth for the first session on 2 july , after holy communion at which tait presided and thomson of york preached , the bishops gathered in the library presided over by : edward white benson 145 bishops present the agenda of this conference was noticeable for its attention to matters beyond the internal organisation of the anglican communion and its attempts to engage with some of the major social issues that the member churches were encountering presided over by : frederick temple ( having been convened by archbishop benson ) 194 bishops present this conference was held a year early because of the thirteenth centennial celebrations of st conference of bishops of the anglican communion , encyclical letter , etc

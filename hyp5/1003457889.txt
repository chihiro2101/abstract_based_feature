the possibility of such an international gathering of bishops had first emerged during the jubilee of the church missionary society in 1851 when a number of us bishops were present in london however , the initial impetus came from episcopal churches in canada after consulting both houses of the convocation of canterbury , archbishop longley assented and convened all the bishops of the anglican communion ( then 144 in number ) to meet at lambeth in 1867 the resolutions of the lambeth conferences have never been regarded as synodical decrees , but '' their weight has increased with each conference '' seventy-six bishops accepted the primate 's invitation to the first conference , which met at lambeth on 24 september 1867 and sat for four days , the sessions being in private the archbishop opened the conference with an address : deliberation followed ; committees were appointed to report on special questions ; resolutions were adopted , and an encyclical letter was addressed to the faithful of the anglican communion each of the subsequent conferences has been first received in canterbury cathedral and addressed by the archbishop from the chair of st augustine from 1978 onwards the conference has been held on the canterbury campus of the university of kent allowing the bishops to live and worship together on the same site for the first time the archbishop of york and several other english bishops refused to attend because they thought such a conference would cause '' increased confusion '' about controversial issues the conference began with a celebration of the holy communion at which henry john whitehouse , the second bishop of illinois , preached ; wilberforce of oxford later described the sermon as '' wordy but not devoid of a certain impressiveness '' the session was spent discussing a '' preamble to the subsequent resolutions '' that would be issued after the conference day two was spent on a discussion of synodical authority concluding that the faith and unity of the anglican communion would be best maintained by there being a synod above those of the '' several branches '' on the final day , the bishops attended holy communion at lambeth parish church at which longley presided ; fulford of montreal , one of the instigators of the original request , preached no one session of the conference had all the bishops attending although all signed the address and longley was authorised to add the names of absent bishops who later subscribed to it the bishops then moved lambeth for the first session on 2 july , after holy communion at which tait presided and thomson of york preached , the bishops gathered in the library conference of bishops of the anglican communion , encyclical letter , etc records of the lambeth conference at lambeth palace library

in most models , the voter casts two votes : one for a constituency representative and one for a party in most jurisdictions , candidates may stand for both a constituency and on a party list ( referred to in new zealand as dual candidacy ) , but in wales are restricted to contend either for a constituency or for a party list , but not both if a candidate is on the party list , but wins a constituency seat , they do not receive two seats ; they are instead crossed off the party list and the party seat goes to the next candidate down in bavaria , the second vote is not simply for the party but for one of the candidates on the party 's regional list : bavaria uses seven regions for this purpose subtracted from each party 's allocation is the number of constituency seats that party won , so that the additional seats are compensatory ( top-up ) if a party wins more fptp seats than the proportional quota received by the party-list vote , these surplus seats become overhang seats to work towards restoring a full proportionality in most german states , but not federally until the federal election of 2013 , leveling seats are added to compensate for the overhang seats and achieve complete proportionality however , scotland uses the term additional member system which , like other mmp systems , is sometimes less than perfectly proportional in the german state of bavaria , the constituency vote and party vote are combined to determine the distribution of seats when a party wins more constituency seats than it would be entitled to from its proportion of ( party list ) votes , overhang seats can occur in germany 's bundestag and the new zealand house of representatives , all these constituency members keep their seats if the party vote for the māori party had been more in proportion with the constituency seats won , there would have been a normal 120-member house if a party wins more local seats than its proportion of the total vote justifies , the size of the landtag increases so that the total outcome is fully proportional to the votes , with other parties receiving additional list seats to achieve proportionality in scotland and wales , due to the nature of the calculations used to distribute the regional list seats , overhang seats are not possible a party that won 7 constituency seats would start with a divisor of 8 ( 7 seats + 1 per the method 's divisor formula ) instead of 1 the compensatory effect characteristic of mmp is in the fact that a party that won constituency seats would have lower averages on the table than it would if the election used mmm as in numerous party-list , in order to be eligible for list seats in many mmp models , a party must earn at least a certain percentage of the total party vote , or no candidates will be elected from the party list a party can also be eligible for list seats if it wins at least three constituency seats in germany , or at least one in new zealand mmp is currently in use in : bolivia adopted mmp in 1994 germany bundestag , the federal parliament ( see electoral system of germany ) most state parliaments bavaria uniquely uses an open list system for its party-list seats lesotho adopted mmp in 2002 the system 's use was reviewed by referendum in november 2011 , with the majority ( 56.17 % ) voting to keep it in 2020 general election , the labour party won 65 out of 120 seats , becoming the second party under mmp worldwide to be able to govern alone thailand – a variant of mmp was adopted for the 2019 general election , replacing the parallel system used in previous elections the country-wide proportional seats are allocated based on the constituency vote rather than a separate party list vote south africa – while not used nationally or provincially , all municipalities designated as either metropolitan or local elect their municipal councillors using mmp unlike the other two assemblies that use the system , parties have to pass a threshold of 5 % of the regional votes in order to be eligible for the list seats hungary used a variant of mmp , but with two rounds for the constituency seats and an additional regional party list portion in 2010 and earlier for the 2016 elections , closed party-list proportional representation was used instead during october–december 2018 , british columbia held a referendum on proportional representation , promised as part of the election platform of the bc ndp who took office following the may 2017 provincial election currently costa rica is debating the switch from the current closed party list proportional representation system to a mixed member proportional representation based on the german model some voters may therefore seek to achieve double representation by voting tactically for another party in the regional vote , as a vote for their preferred party in the regional vote would be wasted ahead of the 2020 south korean legislative election , the electoral system was changed from parallel voting to a hybrid mixed-member proportional system , with 30 seats allocated in a compensatory manner

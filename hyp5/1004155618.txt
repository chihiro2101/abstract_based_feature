in most models , the voter casts two votes : one for a constituency representative and one for a party in the 2017 new zealand election , 27.33 % of voters split their vote ( voted for a local candidate of a different party than their party vote ) compared to 31.64 % in 2014 in each constituency , the representative is chosen using a single winner method , typically first-past-the-post ( that is , the candidate with the most votes , by plurality , wins ) in most jurisdictions , candidates may stand for both a constituency and on a party list ( referred to in new zealand as dual candidacy ) , but in wales are restricted to contend either for a constituency or for a party list , but not both if a candidate is on the party list , but wins a constituency seat , they do not receive two seats ; they are instead crossed off the party list and the party seat goes to the next candidate down subtracted from each party 's allocation is the number of constituency seats that party won , so that the additional seats are compensatory ( top-up ) if a party wins more fptp seats than the proportional quota received by the party-list vote , these surplus seats become overhang seats to work towards restoring a full proportionality in most german states , but not federally until the federal election of 2013 , leveling seats are added to compensate for the overhang seats and achieve complete proportionality in one election in scotland , the highest averages method resulted in a majority government for the scottish national party with only 44 % of the party vote however , scotland uses the term additional member system which , like other mmp systems , is sometimes less than perfectly proportional in the german state of bavaria , the constituency vote and party vote are combined to determine the distribution of seats when a party wins more constituency seats than it would be entitled to from its proportion of ( party list ) votes , overhang seats can occur overhang seats add to the normal number of seats for the duration of the electoral period for example , in the 2008 new zealand general election the māori party won 2.4 % of the party vote , which would entitle them to 0 seats in the house , but won 5 constituency seats , leaving an overhang of 2 seats , which resulted in a 122-member house if the party vote for the māori party had been more in proportion with the constituency seats won , there would have been a normal 120-member house in most german states , and in the federal bundestag since 2013 , the other parties receive extra seats ( '' balance seats '' ) to create full proportionality if a party wins more local seats than its proportion of the total vote justifies , the size of the landtag increases so that the total outcome is fully proportional to the votes , with other parties receiving additional list seats to achieve proportionality in scotland and wales , due to the nature of the calculations used to distribute the regional list seats , overhang seats are not possible the list allocation for those parliaments works like a mixed member majoritarian system , but in using the d'hondt method 's divisors to find the averages for the allocation , the first divisor for each party takes into account the number of constituency seats won by the party ; i.e a party that won 7 constituency seats would start with a divisor of 8 ( 7 seats + 1 per the method 's divisor formula ) instead of 1 the compensatory effect characteristic of mmp is in the fact that a party that won constituency seats would have lower averages on the table than it would if the election used mmm as in numerous party-list , in order to be eligible for list seats in many mmp models , a party must earn at least a certain percentage of the total party vote , or no candidates will be elected from the party list having a member with a 'safe ' constituency seat is therefore a tremendous asset to a minor party in new zealand , the votes for constituency candidates are used to determine the distribution of the list seats thailand – a variant of mmp was adopted for the 2019 general election , replacing the parallel system used in previous elections the country-wide proportional seats are allocated based on the constituency vote rather than a separate party list vote south africa – while not used nationally or provincially , all municipalities designated as either metropolitan or local elect their municipal councillors using mmp south korea – since 2019 , the national assembly uses a modified version of mixed-member proportional , with 253 single-member constituencies , 17 supplementary seats ( a la parallel voting ) , and 30 compensatory seats the amendment increases the number of seats in the council from 152 to 190 ( +38 ) , 80 % of the seats will be filled with first-past-the-post voting and the rest 20 % by proportional voting hungary used a variant of mmp , but with two rounds for the constituency seats and an additional regional party list portion in 2010 and earlier in other cases , a party may be so certain of winning a large number of constituency seats that it expects no extra seats in the proportional top-up ( list seats ) on september 26 , 2010 , chavez ' party , the united socialist party of venezuela , took 57.4 % of parliamentary seats with only 48.2 % of the vote under the new system ( ignoring the role of small allied parties ) ahead of the 2020 south korean legislative election , the electoral system was changed from parallel voting to a hybrid mixed-member proportional system , with 30 seats allocated in a compensatory manner

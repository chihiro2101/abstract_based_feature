in most models , the voter casts two votes : one for a constituency representative and one for a party in the original variant used in germany , citizens gave only one vote , so that voting for a representative automatically meant also voting for the representative 's party voters can thus vote for the local person they prefer for local mp without regard for party affiliation , since the partisan make-up of the legislature is determined only by the party vote in the 2017 new zealand election , 27.33 % of voters split their vote ( voted for a local candidate of a different party than their party vote ) compared to 31.64 % in 2014 in each constituency , the representative is chosen using a single winner method , typically first-past-the-post ( that is , the candidate with the most votes , by plurality , wins ) in most jurisdictions , candidates may stand for both a constituency and on a party list ( referred to in new zealand as dual candidacy ) , but in wales are restricted to contend either for a constituency or for a party list , but not both if a candidate is on the party list , but wins a constituency seat , they do not receive two seats ; they are instead crossed off the party list and the party seat goes to the next candidate down in bavaria , the second vote is not simply for the party but for one of the candidates on the party 's regional list : bavaria uses seven regions for this purpose in contrast , the open list method of mmp was chosen in november 2016 by voters in the 2016 prince edward island electoral reform referendum subtracted from each party 's allocation is the number of constituency seats that party won , so that the additional seats are compensatory ( top-up ) if a party wins more fptp seats than the proportional quota received by the party-list vote , these surplus seats become overhang seats to work towards restoring a full proportionality in the german state of bavaria , the constituency vote and party vote are combined to determine the distribution of seats when a party wins more constituency seats than it would be entitled to from its proportion of ( party list ) votes , overhang seats can occur for example , in the 2008 new zealand general election the māori party won 2.4 % of the party vote , which would entitle them to 0 seats in the house , but won 5 constituency seats , leaving an overhang of 2 seats , which resulted in a 122-member house if the party vote for the māori party had been more in proportion with the constituency seats won , there would have been a normal 120-member house the list allocation for those parliaments works like a mixed member majoritarian system , but in using the d'hondt method 's divisors to find the averages for the allocation , the first divisor for each party takes into account the number of constituency seats won by the party ; i.e a party that won 7 constituency seats would start with a divisor of 8 ( 7 seats + 1 per the method 's divisor formula ) instead of 1 the resulting table would then give 7 seats for scotland and 4 seats for wales to the parties possessing the highest averages on the table , although both devolved parliaments do not use a table , instead using a sequential method because of no provision for overhang seats , there have been cases where a party ended up with fewer total seats than its proportional entitlement as in numerous party-list , in order to be eligible for list seats in many mmp models , a party must earn at least a certain percentage of the total party vote , or no candidates will be elected from the party list a party can also be eligible for list seats if it wins at least three constituency seats in germany , or at least one in new zealand having a member with a 'safe ' constituency seat is therefore a tremendous asset to a minor party in new zealand bavaria uniquely uses an open list system for its party-list seats lesotho adopted mmp in 2002 in 2020 general election , the labour party won 65 out of 120 seats , becoming the second party under mmp worldwide to be able to govern alone thailand – a variant of mmp was adopted for the 2019 general election , replacing the parallel system used in previous elections the country-wide proportional seats are allocated based on the constituency vote rather than a separate party list vote south korea – since 2019 , the national assembly uses a modified version of mixed-member proportional , with 253 single-member constituencies , 17 supplementary seats ( a la parallel voting ) , and 30 compensatory seats united kingdom – though the uk parliament does not use mmp , two constituent countries and one devolved region use mmp ( referred to as the additional member system ) in their devolved legislatures unlike the other two assemblies that use the system , parties have to pass a threshold of 5 % of the regional votes in order to be eligible for the list seats a proposal to adopt mmp with closed province-wide lists for elections to the legislative assembly of prince edward island was defeated in a referendum in 2005 some voters may therefore seek to achieve double representation by voting tactically for another party in the regional vote , as a vote for their preferred party in the regional vote would be wasted by way of example , in 2005 albanian parliamentary election , the two main parties did not expect to win any list seats , so they encouraged voters to use their list votes for allied minor parties ahead of the 2020 south korean legislative election , the electoral system was changed from parallel voting to a hybrid mixed-member proportional system , with 30 seats allocated in a compensatory manner

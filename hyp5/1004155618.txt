in most models , the voter casts two votes : one for a constituency representative and one for a party in the original variant used in germany , citizens gave only one vote , so that voting for a representative automatically meant also voting for the representative 's party in the 2017 new zealand election , 27.33 % of voters split their vote ( voted for a local candidate of a different party than their party vote ) compared to 31.64 % in 2014 in most jurisdictions , candidates may stand for both a constituency and on a party list ( referred to in new zealand as dual candidacy ) , but in wales are restricted to contend either for a constituency or for a party list , but not both if a candidate is on the party list , but wins a constituency seat , they do not receive two seats ; they are instead crossed off the party list and the party seat goes to the next candidate down in baden-württemberg , there are no lists ; they use the '' best near-winner '' method in a four-region model , where the regional members are the local candidates of the under-represented party in that region who received the most votes in their local constituency without being elected in it above the constituency level ) several different calculation methods have been used , but the basic characteristic of the mmp is that the total number of seats in the assembly , including the single-member seats and not only the party-list ones , are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes the party received in the party portion of the ballot subtracted from each party 's allocation is the number of constituency seats that party won , so that the additional seats are compensatory ( top-up ) in most german states , but not federally until the federal election of 2013 , leveling seats are added to compensate for the overhang seats and achieve complete proportionality in one election in scotland , the highest averages method resulted in a majority government for the scottish national party with only 44 % of the party vote when a party wins more constituency seats than it would be entitled to from its proportion of ( party list ) votes , overhang seats can occur overhang seats add to the normal number of seats for the duration of the electoral period in germany 's bundestag and the new zealand house of representatives , all these constituency members keep their seats for example , in the 2008 new zealand general election the māori party won 2.4 % of the party vote , which would entitle them to 0 seats in the house , but won 5 constituency seats , leaving an overhang of 2 seats , which resulted in a 122-member house if the party vote for the māori party had been more in proportion with the constituency seats won , there would have been a normal 120-member house if a party wins more local seats than its proportion of the total vote justifies , the size of the landtag increases so that the total outcome is fully proportional to the votes , with other parties receiving additional list seats to achieve proportionality the list allocation for those parliaments works like a mixed member majoritarian system , but in using the d'hondt method 's divisors to find the averages for the allocation , the first divisor for each party takes into account the number of constituency seats won by the party ; i.e a party that won 7 constituency seats would start with a divisor of 8 ( 7 seats + 1 per the method 's divisor formula ) instead of 1 the compensatory effect characteristic of mmp is in the fact that a party that won constituency seats would have lower averages on the table than it would if the election used mmm as in numerous party-list , in order to be eligible for list seats in many mmp models , a party must earn at least a certain percentage of the total party vote , or no candidates will be elected from the party list a party can also be eligible for list seats if it wins at least three constituency seats in germany , or at least one in new zealand having a member with a 'safe ' constituency seat is therefore a tremendous asset to a minor party in new zealand mmp is currently in use in : bolivia adopted mmp in 1994 , the votes for constituency candidates are used to determine the distribution of the list seats new zealand adopted the system for its unicameral house of representatives in 1994 following a long electoral reform process , beginning with the royal commission on the electoral system in 1985 and ending with the 1993 referendum on the voting system in 2020 general election , the labour party won 65 out of 120 seats , becoming the second party under mmp worldwide to be able to govern alone the country-wide proportional seats are allocated based on the constituency vote rather than a separate party list vote south korea – since 2019 , the national assembly uses a modified version of mixed-member proportional , with 253 single-member constituencies , 17 supplementary seats ( a la parallel voting ) , and 30 compensatory seats unlike the other two assemblies that use the system , parties have to pass a threshold of 5 % of the regional votes in order to be eligible for the list seats the amendment increases the number of seats in the council from 152 to 190 ( +38 ) , 80 % of the seats will be filled with first-past-the-post voting and the rest 20 % by proportional voting in other cases , a party may be so certain of winning a large number of constituency seats that it expects no extra seats in the proportional top-up ( list seats ) this tactic was used to such an extent that it totally distorted the working of the model , to the point that the parties that won list seats were almost always different from the parties that won constituency seats ahead of the 2020 south korean legislative election , the electoral system was changed from parallel voting to a hybrid mixed-member proportional system , with 30 seats allocated in a compensatory manner

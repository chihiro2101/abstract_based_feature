in most models , the voter casts two votes : one for a constituency representative and one for a party in the original variant used in germany , citizens gave only one vote , so that voting for a representative automatically meant also voting for the representative 's party voters can thus vote for the local person they prefer for local mp without regard for party affiliation , since the partisan make-up of the legislature is determined only by the party vote in the 2017 new zealand election , 27.33 % of voters split their vote ( voted for a local candidate of a different party than their party vote ) compared to 31.64 % in 2014 in most jurisdictions , candidates may stand for both a constituency and on a party list ( referred to in new zealand as dual candidacy ) , but in wales are restricted to contend either for a constituency or for a party list , but not both if a candidate is on the party list , but wins a constituency seat , they do not receive two seats ; they are instead crossed off the party list and the party seat goes to the next candidate down in bavaria , the second vote is not simply for the party but for one of the candidates on the party 's regional list : bavaria uses seven regions for this purpose above the constituency level ) several different calculation methods have been used , but the basic characteristic of the mmp is that the total number of seats in the assembly , including the single-member seats and not only the party-list ones , are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes the party received in the party portion of the ballot subtracted from each party 's allocation is the number of constituency seats that party won , so that the additional seats are compensatory ( top-up ) if a party wins more fptp seats than the proportional quota received by the party-list vote , these surplus seats become overhang seats to work towards restoring a full proportionality in most german states , but not federally until the federal election of 2013 , leveling seats are added to compensate for the overhang seats and achieve complete proportionality in one election in scotland , the highest averages method resulted in a majority government for the scottish national party with only 44 % of the party vote however , scotland uses the term additional member system which , like other mmp systems , is sometimes less than perfectly proportional in the german state of bavaria , the constituency vote and party vote are combined to determine the distribution of seats when a party wins more constituency seats than it would be entitled to from its proportion of ( party list ) votes , overhang seats can occur in germany 's bundestag and the new zealand house of representatives , all these constituency members keep their seats for example , in the 2008 new zealand general election the māori party won 2.4 % of the party vote , which would entitle them to 0 seats in the house , but won 5 constituency seats , leaving an overhang of 2 seats , which resulted in a 122-member house if the party vote for the māori party had been more in proportion with the constituency seats won , there would have been a normal 120-member house if a party wins more local seats than its proportion of the total vote justifies , the size of the landtag increases so that the total outcome is fully proportional to the votes , with other parties receiving additional list seats to achieve proportionality the resulting table would then give 7 seats for scotland and 4 seats for wales to the parties possessing the highest averages on the table , although both devolved parliaments do not use a table , instead using a sequential method because of no provision for overhang seats , there have been cases where a party ended up with fewer total seats than its proportional entitlement as in numerous party-list , in order to be eligible for list seats in many mmp models , a party must earn at least a certain percentage of the total party vote , or no candidates will be elected from the party list in new zealand the threshold is 5 % , in bolivia 3 % , in germany 5 % for elections for federal parliament and most state parliaments a party can also be eligible for list seats if it wins at least three constituency seats in germany , or at least one in new zealand thailand – a variant of mmp was adopted for the 2019 general election , replacing the parallel system used in previous elections the country-wide proportional seats are allocated based on the constituency vote rather than a separate party list vote south korea – since 2019 , the national assembly uses a modified version of mixed-member proportional , with 253 single-member constituencies , 17 supplementary seats ( a la parallel voting ) , and 30 compensatory seats united kingdom – though the uk parliament does not use mmp , two constituent countries and one devolved region use mmp ( referred to as the additional member system ) in their devolved legislatures on august 6 , 2020 the state council of tigray decided to amend its constitution and change the electoral system to mmp , this will affect the upcoming regional elections hungary used a variant of mmp , but with two rounds for the constituency seats and an additional regional party list portion in 2010 and earlier some voters may therefore seek to achieve double representation by voting tactically for another party in the regional vote , as a vote for their preferred party in the regional vote would be wasted on september 26 , 2010 , chavez ' party , the united socialist party of venezuela , took 57.4 % of parliamentary seats with only 48.2 % of the vote under the new system ( ignoring the role of small allied parties ) ahead of the 2020 south korean legislative election , the electoral system was changed from parallel voting to a hybrid mixed-member proportional system , with 30 seats allocated in a compensatory manner

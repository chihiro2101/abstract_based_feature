in most models , the voter casts two votes : one for a constituency representative and one for a party in the original variant used in germany , citizens gave only one vote , so that voting for a representative automatically meant also voting for the representative 's party in the 2017 new zealand election , 27.33 % of voters split their vote ( voted for a local candidate of a different party than their party vote ) compared to 31.64 % in 2014 in most jurisdictions , candidates may stand for both a constituency and on a party list ( referred to in new zealand as dual candidacy ) , but in wales are restricted to contend either for a constituency or for a party list , but not both if a candidate is on the party list , but wins a constituency seat , they do not receive two seats ; they are instead crossed off the party list and the party seat goes to the next candidate down in bavaria , the second vote is not simply for the party but for one of the candidates on the party 's regional list : bavaria uses seven regions for this purpose in baden-württemberg , there are no lists ; they use the '' best near-winner '' method in a four-region model , where the regional members are the local candidates of the under-represented party in that region who received the most votes in their local constituency without being elected in it above the constituency level ) several different calculation methods have been used , but the basic characteristic of the mmp is that the total number of seats in the assembly , including the single-member seats and not only the party-list ones , are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes the party received in the party portion of the ballot subtracted from each party 's allocation is the number of constituency seats that party won , so that the additional seats are compensatory ( top-up ) if a party wins more fptp seats than the proportional quota received by the party-list vote , these surplus seats become overhang seats to work towards restoring a full proportionality in most german states , but not federally until the federal election of 2013 , leveling seats are added to compensate for the overhang seats and achieve complete proportionality in one election in scotland , the highest averages method resulted in a majority government for the scottish national party with only 44 % of the party vote in the german state of bavaria , the constituency vote and party vote are combined to determine the distribution of seats when a party wins more constituency seats than it would be entitled to from its proportion of ( party list ) votes , overhang seats can occur overhang seats add to the normal number of seats for the duration of the electoral period for example , in the 2008 new zealand general election the māori party won 2.4 % of the party vote , which would entitle them to 0 seats in the house , but won 5 constituency seats , leaving an overhang of 2 seats , which resulted in a 122-member house if a party wins more local seats than its proportion of the total vote justifies , the size of the landtag increases so that the total outcome is fully proportional to the votes , with other parties receiving additional list seats to achieve proportionality in scotland and wales , due to the nature of the calculations used to distribute the regional list seats , overhang seats are not possible the list allocation for those parliaments works like a mixed member majoritarian system , but in using the d'hondt method 's divisors to find the averages for the allocation , the first divisor for each party takes into account the number of constituency seats won by the party ; i.e the compensatory effect characteristic of mmp is in the fact that a party that won constituency seats would have lower averages on the table than it would if the election used mmm because of no provision for overhang seats , there have been cases where a party ended up with fewer total seats than its proportional entitlement as in numerous party-list , in order to be eligible for list seats in many mmp models , a party must earn at least a certain percentage of the total party vote , or no candidates will be elected from the party list a party can also be eligible for list seats if it wins at least three constituency seats in germany , or at least one in new zealand , the votes for constituency candidates are used to determine the distribution of the list seats in 2020 general election , the labour party won 65 out of 120 seats , becoming the second party under mmp worldwide to be able to govern alone the country-wide proportional seats are allocated based on the constituency vote rather than a separate party list vote south africa – while not used nationally or provincially , all municipalities designated as either metropolitan or local elect their municipal councillors using mmp albania used mmp from 2001 to 2005 ( after having used parallel voting in the 1996 and 1997 elections ) hungary used a variant of mmp , but with two rounds for the constituency seats and an additional regional party list portion in 2010 and earlier for the 2014 election and later the system was changed to a parallel voting system this tactic was used to such an extent that it totally distorted the working of the model , to the point that the parties that won list seats were almost always different from the parties that won constituency seats ahead of the 2020 south korean legislative election , the electoral system was changed from parallel voting to a hybrid mixed-member proportional system , with 30 seats allocated in a compensatory manner electoral strategies in mixed systems of representation

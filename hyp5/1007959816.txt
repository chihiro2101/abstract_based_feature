internal hemorrhoids originate above the pectinate line they are covered by columnar epithelium , which lacks pain receptors they are covered proximally by anoderm and distally by skin , both of which are sensitive to pain and temperature many anorectal problems , including fissures , fistulae , abscesses , colorectal cancer , rectal varices , and itching have similar symptoms and may be incorrectly referred to as hemorrhoids rectal bleeding may also occur owing to colorectal cancer , colitis including inflammatory bowel disease , diverticular disease , and angiodysplasia other conditions that produce an anal mass include skin tags , anal warts , rectal prolapse , polyps , and enlarged anal papillae anorectal varices due to increased portal hypertension ( blood pressure in the portal venous system ) may present similar to hemorrhoids but are a different condition spending less time attempting to defecate , avoiding reading while on the toilet , and losing weight for overweight persons and avoiding heavy lifting are also recommended increased fiber intake has been shown to improve outcomes and may be achieved by dietary alterations or the consumption of fibre supplements steroid-containing agents should not be used for more than 14 days , as they may cause thinning of the skin rubber band ligation is typically recommended as the first-line treatment in those with grade i to iii disease it is a procedure in which elastic bands are applied onto an internal hemorrhoid at least 1 & nbsp ; cm above the pectinate line to cut off its blood supply infrared cauterization may be an option for grade i or ii disease mucosal ectropion is another condition which may occur after hemorrhoidectomy ( often together with anal stenosis ) however , the long-term benefit is greater in those with grade iii hemorrhoids as compared to rubber band ligation however , the chance of symptomatic hemorrhoids returning is greater than for conventional hemorroidectomy , so it is typically recommended only for grade ii or iii disease

michael warner popularized the term in 1991 , in one of the first major works of queer theory from the outset , theories of heteronormativity included a critical look at gender ; warner wrote that '' every person who comes to a queer self-understanding knows in one way or another that her stigmatization is intricated with gender means being able , more or less articulately , to challenge the common understanding of what gender difference means cohen , michael warner , and lauren berlant , argue that they are oppressive , stigmatizing , marginalizing of perceived deviant forms of sexuality and gender , and make self-expression more challenging when that expression does not conform to the norm 5 may 2008 heteronormativity describes how social institutions and policies reinforce the presumption that people are heterosexual and that gender and sex are natural binaries heteronormative culture privileges heterosexuality as normal and natural and fosters a climate where lgbt individuals are discriminated against in marriage , tax codes , and employment following berlant and warner , laurie and stark also argue that the domestic '' intimate sphere '' becomes '' the unquestioned non‐place that anchors heteronormative public discourses , especially those concerning marriage and adoption rights '' . against gay , lesbian , bisexual , and transgender individuals according to cultural anthropologist gayle rubin , heteronormativity in mainstream society creates a '' sex hierarchy '' that graduates sexual practices from morally '' good sex '' to '' bad sex '' the hierarchy places reproductive , monogamous sex between committed heterosexuals as '' good '' and places any sexual acts and individuals who fall short of this standard lower until they fall into '' bad sex '' specifically , this places long-term committed gay couples and promiscuous gays in between the two poles patrick mccreery , lecturer at new york university , views this hierarchy as partially explanatory for the stigmatization of gay people for socially '' deviant '' sexual practices that are often practiced by straight people as well , such as consumption of pornography or sex in public places mccreery states that this heteronormative hierarchy carries over to the workplace , where gay , lesbian and bisexual individuals face discrimination such as anti-homosexual hiring policies or workplace discrimination that often leaves '' lowest hierarchy '' individuals such as transsexual people vulnerable to the most overt discrimination and unable to find work '' workers such as the fired employee and others , such as effeminate male waiters ( allegedly described as the true targets ) , were legally fired by work policies '' transgressing '' against '' normal '' heteronormative culture according to sociology professors samuel perry and kara snawder from university of oklahoma , multiple research studies in the past have shown that there can be and often is a link between the religious beliefs of americans and homophobic behavior june 7 , 2001 nontraditional families ( which diverge from '' a middle-class family with a bread-winning father and a stay-at-home mother , married to each other and raising their biological children '' ) constitute the majority of families in the united states today modern families may also have single-parent headed families caused by divorce , separation or death , families who have two parents who are not married but have children , or families with same-sex parents : affidavit – united states district court for the district of massachusetts ( 2009 ) however , columnist maggie gallagher argues that heteronormative social structures are beneficial to society because they are optimal for the raising of children margaret somerville – in conversation recent criticisms of this argument have been made by timothy laurie , who argues that both intersex conditions and infertility rates have always complicated links between biology , marriage and child-rearing societal factors influence adults to search for a partner of the opposite sex to engage in heterosexual marriage with the goal of having children through the traditional nuclear family structure many american parents adhere to this heteronormative narrative , and teach their children accordingly wilkerson explains that it dictates aspects of everyday life such as nutritional health , socio-economic status , personal beliefs , and traditional gender roles intersex people have biological characteristics that are ambiguously either male or female if such a condition is detected , intersex people in most present-day societies are almost always assigned a normative sex shortly after birth stroud district council '' gender equality scheme and action plan 2007 '' , defines the state of being transgender as '' non-identification with , or non-presentation as , the sex ( and assumed gender ) one was assigned at birth sometimes sex reassignment surgery is a requirement for an official gender change , and often '' male '' and '' female '' are the only choices available , even for intersex and transgender people

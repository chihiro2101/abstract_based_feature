the canal was first proposed by hugh montgomerie , 12th earl of eglinton in 1791 he wanted to connect the booming industrial towns of glasgow , paisley and johnstone to his new deep sea port at ardrossan and his ayrshire coal fields the earl had spent £100,000 on creating ardrossan 's harbour and intended to make it the principal port for glasgow the other alternative route , up the clyde river estuary to glasgow , was not navigable by large ships as the river was too shallow engineers john rennie , thomas telford and john ainslie were employed to design the canal , survey a route , and estimate the costs the third and last section would use 13 locks to bring the canal down to sea level at ardrossan harbour the company of the proprietors of the glasgow , paisley and ardrossan canal was incorporated by an act of parliament which received royal assent from george iii on 20 june 1806 the full length to glasgow 's port eglinton was complete sometime in 1811 hugh montgomerie , 12th earl of eglinton , had already spent £100,000 on a separate project to build a sea harbour at ardrossan , at the proposed terminus of the canal a wharf was built on the north bank of the river cart near crookston castle ; and canal basins provided at paisley and johnstone in 1830 , long , and shallow wrought iron canal boats began to run regularly , conveying about sixty passengers a distance of , at an average rate of , stoppages included the boats reached speeds of , and although 14 journeys were made each day , no damage was caused to the canal banks by their wash they covered the between glasgow and paisley in 50 minutes many people , with the day off work , took the opportunity to travel the short distance of by canal between paisley and johnstone the construction costs were so high that the canal never made an issue of dividend on its shares this bill allowed for the financing and construction of a railway from the johnstone canal basin to ardrossan parliament dictated that due to the failure to complete the canal past johnstone , that work on the railway should be started at the ardrossan harbour end a second railway line was opened , in 1840 , by the glasgow , paisley , kilmarnock and ayr railway company ( gpk & a ) , in direct competition with the canal in 1990 , passenger services resumed on the section from glasgow central station to a new paisley canal station short sections of the original canal can still be seen at the millarston and ferguslie mills area of paisley

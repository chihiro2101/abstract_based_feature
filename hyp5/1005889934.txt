the canal was first proposed by hugh montgomerie , 12th earl of eglinton in 1791 he wanted to connect the booming industrial towns of glasgow , paisley and johnstone to his new deep sea port at ardrossan and his ayrshire coal fields the earl had spent £100,000 on creating ardrossan 's harbour and intended to make it the principal port for glasgow engineers john rennie , thomas telford and john ainslie were employed to design the canal , survey a route , and estimate the costs the first section would be a contour canal of about in length following the land , a contour canal is entirely level and requires no locks or lifts making navigation quick and easy contour canals require only a small water supply since no water is lost to locks , but this method of construction would make the canal longer than it need have been the second section would see a series of 8 locks lift the level up to a summit near johnstone the third and last section would use 13 locks to bring the canal down to sea level at ardrossan harbour the company of the proprietors of the glasgow , paisley and ardrossan canal was incorporated by an act of parliament which received royal assent from george iii on 20 june 1806 the passenger service initially only ran between paisley and johnstone the costs of completing the first contour canal had consumed all the available funds – the initial estimates having been grossly understated hugh montgomerie , 12th earl of eglinton , had already spent £100,000 on a separate project to build a sea harbour at ardrossan , at the proposed terminus of the canal a wharf was built on the north bank of the river cart near crookston castle ; and canal basins provided at paisley and johnstone the paisley canal passage boats were long and wide shortly after the canal 's opening , the paisley canal disaster took the lives of 84 people , 52 males and 32 females even though the wharf was only deep , the coldness of the water and the sheer sides of the embankments compounded the problem that few people of the time could swim a second railway line was opened , in 1840 , by the glasgow , paisley , kilmarnock and ayr railway company ( gpk & a ) , in direct competition with the canal in the 1830s they planned to turn their canal into a railway and complete the link from kilwinning to johnstone ; but allowed the scheme to fold the paisley canal railway line closed to passengers in 1983

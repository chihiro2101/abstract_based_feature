the canal was first proposed by hugh montgomerie , 12th earl of eglinton in 1791 he wanted to connect the booming industrial towns of glasgow , paisley and johnstone to his new deep sea port at ardrossan and his ayrshire coal fields the earl had spent £100,000 on creating ardrossan 's harbour and intended to make it the principal port for glasgow interest was also shown by lord montgomerie and william houston who would also benefit from the canal passing through their lands and connecting their own coal and iron mines to nearby industrial consumers the other alternative route , up the clyde river estuary to glasgow , was not navigable by large ships as the river was too shallow engineers john rennie , thomas telford and john ainslie were employed to design the canal , survey a route , and estimate the costs the first section would be a contour canal of about in length the third and last section would use 13 locks to bring the canal down to sea level at ardrossan harbour the company of the proprietors of the glasgow , paisley and ardrossan canal was incorporated by an act of parliament which received royal assent from george iii on 20 june 1806 the passenger service initially only ran between paisley and johnstone the full length to glasgow 's port eglinton was complete sometime in 1811 hugh montgomerie , 12th earl of eglinton , had already spent £100,000 on a separate project to build a sea harbour at ardrossan , at the proposed terminus of the canal attempts were made to raise extra funds but other major investors , such as william houston , were reluctant to invest as the canal already linked his own coal and iron mines , around johnstone , to glasgow and paisley the canal ran from port eglinton ; and an inn was built there in 1816 a wharf was built on the north bank of the river cart near crookston castle ; and canal basins provided at paisley and johnstone they covered the between glasgow and paisley in 50 minutes shortly after the canal 's opening , the paisley canal disaster took the lives of 84 people , 52 males and 32 females this bill allowed for the financing and construction of a railway from the johnstone canal basin to ardrossan much of the route was used to construct the paisley canal railway line the paisley canal railway line closed to passengers in 1983

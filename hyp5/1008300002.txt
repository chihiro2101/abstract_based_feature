genesis 2 narrates that yahweh places the first man and woman in a garden with trees of whose fruits they may eat , but forbids them to eat from '' the tree of the knowledge of good and evil '' when , in genesis 3 , a serpent persuades the woman to eat from its forbidden fruit and she also lets the man taste it , god expels them from the garden in greek literature , homer also uses the device when telemachus states that '' i wish to know everything , the good and the evil '' ; although the words used – for '' good '' and for '' evil '' – are better termed '' superior '' and '' inferior '' homer , however , if '' tree of the knowledge of good and evil '' is to be understood to mean a tree whose fruit imparts knowledge of everything , this phrase does not necessarily denote a moral concept given the context of disobedience to god , other interpretations of the implications of this phrase also demand consideration robert alter emphasizes the point that when god forbids the man to eat from that particular tree , he says that if he does so , he is '' doomed to die however , there are a myriad of modern scholarly interpretations regarding the term , '' the knowledge of good and evil '' , in genesis 2–3 , such as wisdom , omniscience , sexual knowledge , moral discrimination , maturity , and other qualities in jewish tradition , the tree of knowledge and the eating of its fruit represents the beginning of the mixture of good and evil together however , in legends of the jews , it was adam who had devoutly forbidden eve to touch the tree even though god had only mentioned the eating of the fruit in catholicism , augustine of hippo taught that the '' tree '' should be understood both symbolically and as a real tree – similarly to jerusalem being both a real city and a figure of heavenly jerusalem the quran never refers to the tree as the '' tree of the knowledge of good and evil '' but rather typically refers to it as '' the tree '' or ( in the words of iblis ) as the '' tree of immortality

genesis 2 narrates that yahweh places the first man and woman in a garden with trees of whose fruits they may eat , but forbids them to eat from '' the tree of the knowledge of good and evil '' when , in genesis 3 , a serpent persuades the woman to eat from its forbidden fruit and she also lets the man taste it , god expels them from the garden this may be an example of the type of figure of speech known as merism , a literary device that pairs opposite terms together in order to create a general meaning , so that the phrase '' good and evil '' would simply imply '' everything '' in greek literature , homer also uses the device when telemachus states that '' i wish to know everything , the good and the evil '' ; although the words used – for '' good '' and for '' evil '' – are better termed '' superior '' and '' inferior '' homer , however , if '' tree of the knowledge of good and evil '' is to be understood to mean a tree whose fruit imparts knowledge of everything , this phrase does not necessarily denote a moral concept robert alter emphasizes the point that when god forbids the man to eat from that particular tree , he says that if he does so , he is '' doomed to die however , there are a myriad of modern scholarly interpretations regarding the term , '' the knowledge of good and evil '' , in genesis 2–3 , such as wisdom , omniscience , sexual knowledge , moral discrimination , maturity , and other qualities in jewish tradition , the tree of knowledge and the eating of its fruit represents the beginning of the mixture of good and evil together image : orvieto061.jpg thumb right 200px a marble bas relief by lorenzo maitani on the orvieto cathedral , italy depicts eve and the tree in christian tradition , consuming the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil was the sin committed by adam and eve that led to the fall of man in genesis 3 the quran never refers to the tree as the '' tree of the knowledge of good and evil '' but rather typically refers to it as '' the tree '' or ( in the words of iblis ) as the '' tree of immortality '' quran 20:120 muslims believe that when god created adam and eve , he told them that they could enjoy everything in the garden except this tree and so satan appeared to them , telling them the only reason god forbade them to eat from the tree was that they would become angels or immortal

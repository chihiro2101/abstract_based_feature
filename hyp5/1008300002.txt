genesis 2 narrates that yahweh places the first man and woman in a garden with trees of whose fruits they may eat , but forbids them to eat from '' the tree of the knowledge of good and evil '' when , in genesis 3 , a serpent persuades the woman to eat from its forbidden fruit and she also lets the man taste it , god expels them from the garden meaning of good and evil this may be an example of the type of figure of speech known as merism , a literary device that pairs opposite terms together in order to create a general meaning , so that the phrase '' good and evil '' would simply imply '' everything '' homer , however , if '' tree of the knowledge of good and evil '' is to be understood to mean a tree whose fruit imparts knowledge of everything , this phrase does not necessarily denote a moral concept robert alter emphasizes the point that when god forbids the man to eat from that particular tree , he says that if he does so , he is '' doomed to die however , there are a myriad of modern scholarly interpretations regarding the term , '' the knowledge of good and evil '' , in genesis 2â€“3 , such as wisdom , omniscience , sexual knowledge , moral discrimination , maturity , and other qualities in jewish tradition , the tree of knowledge and the eating of its fruit represents the beginning of the mixture of good and evil together however , in legends of the jews , it was adam who had devoutly forbidden eve to touch the tree even though god had only mentioned the eating of the fruit the quran never refers to the tree as the '' tree of the knowledge of good and evil '' but rather typically refers to it as '' the tree '' or ( in the words of iblis ) as the '' tree of immortality a cylinder seal , known as the adam and eve cylinder seal , from post-akkadian periods in mesopotamia century bce ) has been linked to the adam and eve story

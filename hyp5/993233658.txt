alkene dihydroxylation by osmium tetroxide is an old and extremely useful method for the functionalization of olefins however , since osmium ( viii ) reagents like osmium tetroxide ( oso 4 ) are expensive and extremely toxic , it has become desirable to develop catalytic variants of this reaction barry sharpless was the first to develop a general , reliable enantioselective alkene dihydroxylation , referred to as the sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation ( sad ) the reaction mechanism of the sharpless dihydroxylation begins with the formation of the osmium tetroxide â€“ ligand complex ( 2 ) 600px the mechanism of the sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation has been extensively studied and a potential secondary catalytic cycle has been identified ( see below ) if the osmylate ester intermediate is oxidized before it dissociates , then an osmium ( viii ) -diol complex is formed which may then dihydroxylate another alkene in his original report sharpless suggested the reaction proceeded via a cycloaddition 2+2 cycloaddition of oso 4 onto the alkene to give an osmaoxetane intermediate ( see below ) for example , sharpless provided evidence for the reaction proceeding via a step-wise mechanism crystallographic evidence has shown that the active catalyst possesses a pentacoordinate osmium species held in a u-shaped binding pocket potassium ferricyanide ( k 3 fe ( cn ) 6 ) is the most commonly used stoichiometric oxidant for the reaction , and is the oxidant that comes in the commercially available ad-mix preparations

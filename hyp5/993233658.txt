alkene dihydroxylation by osmium tetroxide is an old and extremely useful method for the functionalization of olefins however , since osmium ( viii ) reagents like osmium tetroxide ( oso 4 ) are expensive and extremely toxic , it has become desirable to develop catalytic variants of this reaction barry sharpless was the first to develop a general , reliable enantioselective alkene dihydroxylation , referred to as the sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation ( sad ) low levels of oso 4 are combined with a stoichiometric ferricyanide oxidant in the presence of chiral nitrogenous ligands to create an asymmetric environment around the oxidant the reaction mechanism of the sharpless dihydroxylation begins with the formation of the osmium tetroxide â€“ ligand complex ( 2 ) 600px the mechanism of the sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation has been extensively studied and a potential secondary catalytic cycle has been identified ( see below ) if the osmylate ester intermediate is oxidized before it dissociates , then an osmium ( viii ) -diol complex is formed which may then dihydroxylate another alkene for example , sharpless provided evidence for the reaction proceeding via a step-wise mechanism stoichiometric oxidant : peroxides were among the first stoichiometric oxidants to be used in this catalytic cycle ; see the milas hydroxylation in the example shown below , the para-methoxybenzoyl substituent serves primarily as a source of steric bulk to allow the catalyst to differentiate the two faces of the alkene

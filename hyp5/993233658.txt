alkene dihydroxylation by osmium tetroxide is an old and extremely useful method for the functionalization of olefins however , since osmium ( viii ) reagents like osmium tetroxide ( oso 4 ) are expensive and extremely toxic , it has become desirable to develop catalytic variants of this reaction barry sharpless was the first to develop a general , reliable enantioselective alkene dihydroxylation , referred to as the sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation ( sad ) the reaction mechanism of the sharpless dihydroxylation begins with the formation of the osmium tetroxide â€“ ligand complex ( 2 ) 600px the mechanism of the sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation has been extensively studied and a potential secondary catalytic cycle has been identified ( see below ) in his original report sharpless suggested the reaction proceeded via a cycloaddition 2+2 cycloaddition of oso 4 onto the alkene to give an osmaoxetane intermediate ( see below ) corey published a slightly different variant of this reaction and suggested that the reaction most likely proceeded via a 3+2 cycloaddition of oso 4 with the alkene to directly generate the osmylate ester aciee 1993 , 32 , 1329 additionally both sharpless and corey showed that the active catalyst possesses a u-shaped chiral binding pocket stoichiometric oxidant : peroxides were among the first stoichiometric oxidants to be used in this catalytic cycle ; see the milas hydroxylation in general sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation favors oxidation of the more electron-rich alkene ( scheme 1 )

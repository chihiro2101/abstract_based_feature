alkene dihydroxylation by osmium tetroxide is an old and extremely useful method for the functionalization of olefins however , since osmium ( viii ) reagents like osmium tetroxide ( oso 4 ) are expensive and extremely toxic , it has become desirable to develop catalytic variants of this reaction some stoichiometric terminal oxidants that have been employed in these catalytic reactions include potassium chlorate , hydrogen peroxide ( milas hydroxylation ) , n-methylmorpholine n-oxide ( nmo , upjohn dihydroxylation ) , tert-butyl hydroperoxide ( tbhp ) , and potassium ferricyanide ( k 3 fe ( cn ) 6 ) barry sharpless was the first to develop a general , reliable enantioselective alkene dihydroxylation , referred to as the sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation ( sad ) low levels of oso 4 are combined with a stoichiometric ferricyanide oxidant in the presence of chiral nitrogenous ligands to create an asymmetric environment around the oxidant the reaction mechanism of the sharpless dihydroxylation begins with the formation of the osmium tetroxide â€“ ligand complex ( 2 ) 600px the mechanism of the sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation has been extensively studied and a potential secondary catalytic cycle has been identified ( see below ) corey published a slightly different variant of this reaction and suggested that the reaction most likely proceeded via a 3+2 cycloaddition of oso 4 with the alkene to directly generate the osmylate ester potassium ferricyanide ( k 3 fe ( cn ) 6 ) is the most commonly used stoichiometric oxidant for the reaction , and is the oxidant that comes in the commercially available ad-mix preparations additive : citric acid : osmium tetroxide is an electrophilic oxidant and as such reacts slowly with electron-deficient olefins

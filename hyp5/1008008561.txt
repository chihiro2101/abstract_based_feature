in prehistoric and historic time , inuit peoples wore flattened walrus ivory '' glasses '' , looking through narrow slits to block harmful reflected rays of the sun sunglasses made from flat panes of smoky quartz , which offered no corrective powers but did protect the eyes from glare , were used in china in the 12th century or possibly earlier james ayscough began experimenting with tinted lenses in spectacles in the mid-18th century , around 1752 these were not '' sunglasses '' as that term is now used ; ayscough believed that blue- or green-tinted glass could correct for specific vision impairments one of the earliest surviving depictions of a person wearing sunglasses is of the scientist antoine lavoisier in 1772 yellow/amber and brown-tinted spectacles were also a commonly prescribed item for people with syphilis in the 19th and early 20th centuries because sensitivity to light was one of the symptoms of the disease in 1913 , crookes lenses were introduced , made from glass containing cerium , which block ultraviolet light inexpensive mass-produced sunglasses made from celluloid were first produced by sam foster in 1929 '' it stated that 20 million sunglasses were sold in the united states in 1937 , but estimated that only about 25 % of american wearers needed them to protect their eyes polarizer sunglasses first became available in 1936 , when edwin h land began experimenting with making lenses with his patented polaroid filter at present , xiamen , china , is the world 's largest producer of sunglasses , with its port exporting 120 million pairs each year sunglasses can improve visual comfort and visual clarity by protecting the eye from glare the lenses of polarized sunglasses reduce glare reflected at some angles off shiny non-metallic surfaces , such as water they allow wearers to see into water when only surface glare would otherwise be seen , and eliminate glare from a road surface when driving into the sun sunglasses offer protection against excessive exposure to light , including its visible and invisible components medical experts advise the public on the importance of wearing sunglasses to protect the eyes from uv ; for adequate protection , experts recommend sunglasses that reflect or filter out 99 % or more of uva and uvb light , with wavelengths up to 400 nm this is slightly more protection than the widely used standard of the european union ( see below ) , which requires that 95 % of the radiation up to only 380 & nbsp ; nm must be reflected or filtered out informationen und empfehlungen zur altersbedingten makuladegeneration und zum grauen star this type of eyewear can filter out uv radiation harmful to the eyes more recently , high-energy visible light ( hev ) has been implicated as a cause of age-related macular degeneration ;

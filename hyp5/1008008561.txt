in prehistoric and historic time , inuit peoples wore flattened walrus ivory '' glasses '' , looking through narrow slits to block harmful reflected rays of the sun sunglasses made from flat panes of smoky quartz , which offered no corrective powers but did protect the eyes from glare , were used in china in the 12th century or possibly earlier ancient documents describe the use of such crystal sunglasses by judges in ancient chinese courts to conceal their facial expressions while questioning witnesses these were not '' sunglasses '' as that term is now used ; ayscough believed that blue- or green-tinted glass could correct for specific vision impairments one of the earliest surviving depictions of a person wearing sunglasses is of the scientist antoine lavoisier in 1772 yellow/amber and brown-tinted spectacles were also a commonly prescribed item for people with syphilis in the 19th and early 20th centuries because sensitivity to light was one of the symptoms of the disease in 1913 , crookes lenses were introduced , made from glass containing cerium , which block ultraviolet light in the early 1920s , the use of sunglasses started to become more widespread , especially among movie stars inexpensive mass-produced sunglasses made from celluloid were first produced by sam foster in 1929 foster found a ready market on the beaches of atlantic city , new jersey , where he began selling sunglasses under the name foster grant from a woolworth on the boardwalk '' it stated that 20 million sunglasses were sold in the united states in 1937 , but estimated that only about 25 % of american wearers needed them to protect their eyes polarizer sunglasses first became available in 1936 , when edwin h the lenses of polarized sunglasses reduce glare reflected at some angles off shiny non-metallic surfaces , such as water sunglasses offer protection against excessive exposure to light , including its visible and invisible components the most widespread protection is against ultraviolet radiation , which can cause short-term and long-term ocular problems such as arc eye , snow blindness , cataracts , pterygium , and various forms of eye cancer this is slightly more protection than the widely used standard of the european union ( see below ) , which requires that 95 % of the radiation up to only 380 & nbsp ; nm must be reflected or filtered out informationen und empfehlungen zur altersbedingten makuladegeneration und zum grauen star there has been some speculation that sunglasses actually promote skin cancer the only way to assess the protection of sunglasses is to have the lenses measured , either by the manufacturer or by a properly equipped optician inadequate dark lenses are even more harmful than inadequate light lenses ( or wearing no sunglasses at all ) because they provoke the pupil to open wider however , not every yellow or brown lens blocks sufficient blue light high prices can not guarantee sufficient protection as no correlation between high prices and increased uv protection has been demonstrated '' the australian competition and consumer commission has also reported that '' consumers can not rely on price as an indicator of quality '' one survey even found that a 6.95 pair of generic glasses offered slightly better protection than expensive salvatore ferragamo shades sunglasses can be worn to hide one 's eyes the relevance of sunglasses within the fashion industry has included prominent fashion editors ' reviews of annual trends in sunglasses as well as runway fashion shows featuring sunglasses as a primary or secondary component of a look fashion trends can also draw on the '' cool '' image of sunglasses and association with a particular lifestyle , especially the close connection between sunglasses and beach life public eye looks over new standard for sunglasses ( 2002-01-20 ) in addition to filtering , the standard also lists requirements for minimum robustness , labeling , materials ( non-toxic for skin contact and not combustible ) and lack of protrusions ( to avoid harm when wearing them ) according to this standard , the lens should have a uvb ( 280 to 315 & nbsp ; nm ) transmittance of no more than one per cent and a uva ( 315 to 380 & nbsp ; nm ) transmittance of no more than 0.3 times the visual light transmittance the ansi z87.1-2003 standard includes requirements for basic impact and high impact protection the ansi z87.1-2003 standard when driving a vehicle , particularly at high speed , dazzling glare caused by a low sun , or by lights reflecting off snow , puddles , other vehicles , or even the front of the vehicle , can be lethal two criteria must be met : vision must be clear , and the glasses must let sufficient light get to the eyes for the driving conditions general-purpose sunglasses may be too dark , or otherwise unsuitable for driving the automobile association and the federation of manufacturing opticians have produced guidance for selection of sunglasses for driving variable tint or photochromic lenses increase their optical density when exposed to uv light , reverting to their clear state when the uv brightness decreases some manufacturers produce special photochromic lenses that adapt to the varying light conditions when driving lenses with light transmission less than 75 % are unsuitable for night driving , and lenses with light transmission less than 8 % ( category 4 ) are unsuitable for driving at any time ; they should by uk law be labelled 'not suitable for driving and road use ' due to the light levels within the car , filter category 2 lenses which transmit between 18 % and 43 % of light are recommended for daytime driving graduated lenses , with the bottom part lighter than the top , can make it easier to see the controls within the car an anti-reflection coating is recommended , and a hard coating to protect the lenses from scratches the main purpose of these glasses are to protect the wearer from dust and smog particles entering into the eyes while driving at high speeds like corrective lens , sunglasses have to meet special requirements when worn for sports for water sports , so-called water sunglasses ( also : surf goggles or water eyewear ) are specially adapted for use in turbulent water , such as the surf or whitewater in addition to the features for sports glasses , water sunglasses can have increased buoyancy to stop them from sinking should they come off , and they can have a vent or other method to eliminate fogging these sunglasses are used in water sports such as surfing , windsurfing , kiteboarding , wakeboarding , kayaking , jet ski , bodyboarding , and water skiing mountain climbing or traveling across glaciers or snowfields requires above-average eye protection , because sunlight ( including ultraviolet radiation ) is more intense in higher altitudes , and snow and ice reflect additional light website ( retrieved on 21 september 2009 ) the frames of sunglasses and corrective glasses used in space must meet special requirements reliable fit is particularly important when wearing corrective glasses underneath tight helmets and in space suits : once inside the spacesuit , slipped glasses can not be touched to push them back into place , sometimes for up to ten hours the first sunglasses used in a moon landing were the original aviator produced by american optical in 1969 they were used aboard the eagle , the lunar module of apollo 11 , the first manned mission to land on the moon nasa research primarily by scientists james b miller at the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) resulted in special lenses that protected against the light in space and during laser and welding work the lenses used colored dyes and small particles of zinc oxide , which absorbs ultraviolet light and is also used in sunscreen lotions corrective lenses or glasses can be manufactured with either tinting or darkened to serve as sunglasses the reasons are that the cost of a set of lenses is less than the cost of a separate pair of glasses , and carrying extra lenses is less bulky than carrying multiple pairs of glasses oversized sunglasses , because of their larger frames and lenses , are useful for individuals who are trying to minimize the apparent size or arch of their nose analogous to inuit goggles ( see above ) , the principle is not to filter light , but to decrease the amount of sun rays falling into the wearer 's eyes flip-up sunglasses add the benefits of sunglasses to corrective eyeglasses , allowing the wearer to flip up the tinted lenses for indoor use stunna shades used as a slang term in the hyphy movement , usually referring to sunglasses with oversized lenses

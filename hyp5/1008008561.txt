for adequate protection , experts recommend sunglasses that reflect or filter out 99 % or more of uva and uvb light , with wavelengths up to 400 nm sunglasses that meet this requirement are often labeled as '' uv400 '' teil 1 : beschaffenheit des lichts , innere und äußere abwehrmechanismen this type of eyewear can filter out uv radiation harmful to the eyes more recently , high-energy visible light ( hev ) has been implicated as a cause of age-related macular degeneration ; before , debates had already existed as to whether '' blue blocking '' or amber tinted lenses may have a protective effect article by charlotte remé , who also developed the guidelines/norms for switzerland : sunglasses are especially important for children , as their ocular lenses are thought to transmit far more hev light than adults ( lenses '' yellow '' with age ) the only '' visible '' quality test for sunglasses is their fit to protect against '' stray light '' from the sides , the lenses should fit close enough to the temples and/or merge into broad temple arms or leather blinders dark lenses do not automatically filter out more harmful uv radiation and blue light than light lenses inadequate dark lenses are even more harmful than inadequate light lenses ( or wearing no sunglasses at all ) because they provoke the pupil to open wider as a result , more unfiltered radiation enters the eye depending on the manufacturing technology , sufficiently protective lenses can block much or little light , resulting in dark or light lenses lenses of various colors can offer sufficient ( or insufficient ) uv protection however , not every yellow or brown lens blocks sufficient blue light one survey even found that a 6.95 pair of generic glasses offered slightly better protection than expensive salvatore ferragamo shades while non-tinted glasses are very rarely worn without the practical purpose of correcting eyesight or protecting one 's eyes , sunglasses have become popular for several further reasons , and are sometimes worn even indoors or at night sunglasses can be worn to hide one 's eyes they can make eye contact impossible , which can be intimidating to those not wearing sunglasses ;

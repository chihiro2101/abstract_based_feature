the purpose of overclocking is to increase the operating speed of a given component normally , on modern systems , the target of overclocking is increasing the performance of a major chip or subsystem , such as the main processor or graphics controller , but other components , such as system memory ( ram ) or system buses ( generally on the motherboard ) , are commonly involved the trade-offs are an increase in power consumption ( heat ) , fan noise ( cooling ) , and shortened lifespan for the targeted components most components are designed with a margin of safety to deal with operating conditions outside of a manufacturer 's control ; examples are ambient temperature and fluctuations in operating voltage overclocking techniques in general aim to trade this safety margin by setting the device to run in the higher end of the margin , with the understanding that temperature and voltage must be more strictly monitored and controlled by the user examples are that operating temperature would need to be more strictly controlled with increased cooling , as the part will be less tolerant of increased temperatures at the higher speeds also base operating voltage may be increased to compensate for unexpected voltage drops and to strengthen signalling and timing signals , as low-voltage excursions are more likely to cause malfunctions at higher operating speeds past this speed the device starts giving incorrect results , which can cause malfunctions and sporadic behavior in any system depending on it at this point an increase in operating voltage of a part may allow more headroom for further increases in clock speed , but the increased voltage can also significantly increase heat output , as well as shorten the lifespan further the speed gained by overclocking depends largely upon the applications and workloads being run on the system , and what components are being overclocked by the user ; benchmarks for different purposes are published conversely , the primary goal of underclocking is to reduce power consumption and the resultant heat generation of a device , with the trade-offs being lower clock speeds and reductions in performance reducing the cooling requirements needed to keep hardware at a given operational temperature has knock-on benefits such as lowering the number and speed of fans to allow quiet pc , and in mobile devices increase the length of battery life per charge additionally , most manufacturer warranties and service agreements do not cover overclocked components nor any incidental damages caused by their use while overclocking can still be an option for increasing personal computing capacity , and thus workflow productivity for professional users , the importance of stability testing components thoroughly before employing them into a production environment can not be overstated overclocking offers several draws for overclocking enthusiasts another approach is overclocking older components to attempt to keep pace with increasing system requirements and extend the useful service life of the older part or at least delay a purchase of new hardware solely for performance reasons another rationale for overclocking older equipment is even if overclocking stresses equipment to the point of failure earlier , little is lost as it is already depreciated , and would have needed to be replaced in any case most modern processors derive their effective operating speeds by multiplying a base clock ( processor bus speed ) by an internal multiplier within the processor ( the cpu multiplier ) to attain their final speed computer processors generally are overclocked by manipulating the cpu multiplier if that option is available , but the processor and other components can also be overclocked by increasing the base speed of the bus clock most oem systems do not expose to the user the adjustments needed to change processor clock speed or voltage in the bios of the oem 's motherboard , which precludes overclocking ( for warranty and support reasons ) components are only guaranteed to operate correctly up to their rated values ; beyond that different samples may have different overclocking potential first is to ensure that the component is supplied with adequate power at a voltage sufficient to operate at the new clock rate if faster speed is required it is often cheaper when all costs are considered to buy faster hardware to overcome this issue , overclockers raise the chip voltage to increase the overclocking potential conversely , the overclocker may decide to decrease the chip voltage while overclocking ( a process known as undervolting ) , to reduce heat emissions while performance remains optimal stock cooling systems are designed for the amount of power produced during non-overclocked use ; overclocked circuits can require more cooling , such as by powerful fans , larger heat sinks , heat pipes and water cooling image:2007taipeiitmonth inteloclivetest overclocking-6.jpg right thumb liquid nitrogen may be used for cooling an overclocked system , when an extreme measure of cooling is needed other cooling methods are forced convection and phase transition cooling which is used in refrigerators and can be adapted for computer use liquid nitrogen , liquid helium , and dry ice are used as coolants in extreme cases , such as record-setting attempts or one-off experiments rather than cooling an everyday system in june 2006 , ibm and georgia institute of technology jointly announced a new record in silicon-based chip clock rate ( the rate a transistor can be switched at , not the cpu clock rate ) above 500 & nbsp ; ghz , which was done by cooling the chip to using liquid helium these extreme methods are generally impractical in the long term , as they require refilling reservoirs of vaporizing coolant , and condensation can form on chilled components amateur overclocking enthusiasts have used a mixture of dry ice and a solvent with a low freezing point , such as acetone or isopropyl alcohol such failures might never be correctly diagnosed and may instead be incorrectly attributed to software bugs in applications , device drivers , or the operating system in overclocking circles , '' stress tests '' or '' torture tests '' are used to check for correct operation of a component since fault coverage is important in software testing , the tests are often run for long periods of time , hours or even days for example , some benchmarks test only one aspect of the system , such as memory bandwidth , without taking into consideration how higher clock rates in this aspect will improve the system performance as a whole fan noise : high-performance fans running at maximum speed used for the required degree of cooling of an overclocked machine can be noisy , some producing 50 & nbsp ; db or more of noise increasing the operation frequency of a component will usually increase its thermal output in a linear fashion , while an increase in voltage usually causes thermal power to increase quadratically there are utilities to achieve this , such as evga 's precision , rivatuner , amd overdrive ( on amd cards only ) , msi afterburner , zotac firestorm , and the peg link mode on asus motherboards flashing and unlocking can be used to improve the performance of a video card , without technically overclocking ( but is much riskier than overclocking just through software ) in 1984 , some consumers were overclocking ibm 's version of the intel 80286 cpu by replacing the clock crystal .

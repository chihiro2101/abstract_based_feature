the purpose of overclocking is to increase the operating speed of a given component normally , on modern systems , the target of overclocking is increasing the performance of a major chip or subsystem , such as the main processor or graphics controller , but other components , such as system memory ( ram ) or system buses ( generally on the motherboard ) , are commonly involved the trade-offs are an increase in power consumption ( heat ) , fan noise ( cooling ) , and shortened lifespan for the targeted components most components are designed with a margin of safety to deal with operating conditions outside of a manufacturer 's control ; examples are ambient temperature and fluctuations in operating voltage overclocking techniques in general aim to trade this safety margin by setting the device to run in the higher end of the margin , with the understanding that temperature and voltage must be more strictly monitored and controlled by the user examples are that operating temperature would need to be more strictly controlled with increased cooling , as the part will be less tolerant of increased temperatures at the higher speeds also base operating voltage may be increased to compensate for unexpected voltage drops and to strengthen signalling and timing signals , as low-voltage excursions are more likely to cause malfunctions at higher operating speeds while most modern devices are fairly tolerant of overclocking , all devices have finite limits at this point an increase in operating voltage of a part may allow more headroom for further increases in clock speed , but the increased voltage can also significantly increase heat output , as well as shorten the lifespan further at some point there will be a limit imposed by the ability to supply the device with sufficient power , the user 's ability to cool the part , and the device 's own maximum voltage tolerance before it achieves destructive failure the speed gained by overclocking depends largely upon the applications and workloads being run on the system , and what components are being overclocked by the user ; benchmarks for different purposes are published conversely , the primary goal of underclocking is to reduce power consumption and the resultant heat generation of a device , with the trade-offs being lower clock speeds and reductions in performance this would use a '' standard-voltage '' part and attempt to run with lower voltages ( while attempting to keep the desktop speeds ) to meet an acceptable performance/noise target for the build this was also attractive as using a '' standard voltage '' processor in a '' low voltage '' application avoided paying the traditional price premium for an officially certified low voltage version however again like overclocking there is no guarantee of success , and the builder 's time researching given system/processor combinations and especially the time and tedium of performing many iterations of stability testing need to be considered the usefulness of underclocking ( again like overclocking ) is determined by what processor offerings , prices , and availability are at the specific time of the build while overclocking can still be an option for increasing personal computing capacity , and thus workflow productivity for professional users , the importance of stability testing components thoroughly before employing them into a production environment can not be overstated overclocking offers several draws for overclocking enthusiasts overclocking allows testing of components at speeds not currently offered by the manufacturer , or at speeds only officially offered on specialized , higher-priced versions of the product if the high-end part only differs by an increased clock speed , an enthusiast can attempt to overclock a mainstream part to simulate the high-end offering another approach is overclocking older components to attempt to keep pace with increasing system requirements and extend the useful service life of the older part or at least delay a purchase of new hardware solely for performance reasons most modern processors derive their effective operating speeds by multiplying a base clock ( processor bus speed ) by an internal multiplier within the processor ( the cpu multiplier ) to attain their final speed computer processors generally are overclocked by manipulating the cpu multiplier if that option is available , but the processor and other components can also be overclocked by increasing the base speed of the bus clock some systems allow additional tuning of other clocks ( such as a clock rate ) that influence the bus clock speed that , again is multiplied by the processor to allow for finer adjustments of the final processor speed the maximum speed is determined by overclocking to the point of first instability , then accepting the last stable slower setting first is to ensure that the component is supplied with adequate power at a voltage sufficient to operate at the new clock rate supplying the power with improper settings or applying excessive voltage can permanently damage a component in a professional production environment , overclocking is only likely to be used where the increase in speed justifies the cost of the expert support required , the possibly reduced reliability , the consequent effect on maintenance contracts and warranties , and the higher power consumption as clock frequencies in digital circuits and voltage applied increase , the heat generated by components running at the higher performance levels also increases voltage increases power consumption and consequently heat generation significantly ( proportionally to the square of the voltage in a linear circuit , for example ) ; this requires more cooling to avoid damaging the hardware by overheating thermoelectric cooling devices which actually refrigerate using the peltier effect can help with high thermal design power ( tdp ) processors made by intel and amd in the early twenty-first century thermoelectric cooling devices create temperature differences between two plates by running an electric current through the plates image:2007taipeiitmonth inteloclivetest overclocking-6.jpg right thumb liquid nitrogen may be used for cooling an overclocked system , when an extreme measure of cooling is needed cpu frequency world record is 8.794 & nbsp ; ghz as of november 2012 apart from demanding applications such as video encoding , high-demand databases and scientific computing , memory bandwidth is typically not a bottleneck , so a great increase in memory bandwidth may be unnoticeable to a user depending on the applications used locking a chip 's clock multiplier does not necessarily prevent users from overclocking , as the speed of the front-side bus or pci multiplier ( on newer cpus ) may still be changed to provide a performance increase amd athlon and athlon xp cpus are generally unlocked by connecting bridges ( jumper-like points ) on the top of the cpu with conductive paint or graphite increasing front-side bus and/or northbridge/pci clocks can overclock locked cpus , but this throws many system frequencies out of sync , since the ram and pci frequencies are modified as well higher clock rates and voltages increase power consumption , also increasing electricity cost and heat production increasing the operation frequency of a component will usually increase its thermal output in a linear fashion , while an increase in voltage usually causes thermal power to increase quadratically in 1984 , some consumers were overclocking ibm 's version of the intel 80286 cpu by replacing the clock crystal .

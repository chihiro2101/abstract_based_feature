the purpose of overclocking is to increase the operating speed of a given component normally , on modern systems , the target of overclocking is increasing the performance of a major chip or subsystem , such as the main processor or graphics controller , but other components , such as system memory ( ram ) or system buses ( generally on the motherboard ) , are commonly involved the trade-offs are an increase in power consumption ( heat ) , fan noise ( cooling ) , and shortened lifespan for the targeted components overclocking techniques in general aim to trade this safety margin by setting the device to run in the higher end of the margin , with the understanding that temperature and voltage must be more strictly monitored and controlled by the user examples are that operating temperature would need to be more strictly controlled with increased cooling , as the part will be less tolerant of increased temperatures at the higher speeds also base operating voltage may be increased to compensate for unexpected voltage drops and to strengthen signalling and timing signals , as low-voltage excursions are more likely to cause malfunctions at higher operating speeds past this speed the device starts giving incorrect results , which can cause malfunctions and sporadic behavior in any system depending on it at this point an increase in operating voltage of a part may allow more headroom for further increases in clock speed , but the increased voltage can also significantly increase heat output , as well as shorten the lifespan further overzealous use of voltage and/or inadequate cooling can rapidly degrade a device 's performance to the point of failure , or in extreme cases outright destroy it the speed gained by overclocking depends largely upon the applications and workloads being run on the system , and what components are being overclocked by the user ; benchmarks for different purposes are published conversely , the primary goal of underclocking is to reduce power consumption and the resultant heat generation of a device , with the trade-offs being lower clock speeds and reductions in performance this was also attractive as using a '' standard voltage '' processor in a '' low voltage '' application avoided paying the traditional price premium for an officially certified low voltage version however again like overclocking there is no guarantee of success , and the builder 's time researching given system/processor combinations and especially the time and tedium of performing many iterations of stability testing need to be considered overclocking has become more accessible with motherboard makers offering overclocking as a marketing feature on their mainstream product lines overclocking offers several draws for overclocking enthusiasts overclocking allows testing of components at speeds not currently offered by the manufacturer , or at speeds only officially offered on specialized , higher-priced versions of the product a general trend in the computing industry is that new technologies tend to debut in the high-end market first , then later trickle down to the performance and mainstream market if the high-end part only differs by an increased clock speed , an enthusiast can attempt to overclock a mainstream part to simulate the high-end offering another approach is overclocking older components to attempt to keep pace with increasing system requirements and extend the useful service life of the older part or at least delay a purchase of new hardware solely for performance reasons most modern processors derive their effective operating speeds by multiplying a base clock ( processor bus speed ) by an internal multiplier within the processor ( the cpu multiplier ) to attain their final speed some systems allow additional tuning of other clocks ( such as a clock rate ) that influence the bus clock speed that , again is multiplied by the processor to allow for finer adjustments of the final processor speed any given component will ultimately stop operating reliably past a certain clock speed components are only guaranteed to operate correctly up to their rated values ; beyond that different samples may have different overclocking potential first is to ensure that the component is supplied with adequate power at a voltage sufficient to operate at the new clock rate supplying the power with improper settings or applying excessive voltage can permanently damage a component in a professional production environment , overclocking is only likely to be used where the increase in speed justifies the cost of the expert support required , the possibly reduced reliability , the consequent effect on maintenance contracts and warranties , and the higher power consumption image : copper heat sink with pipes.jpg thumb high quality heat sinks are often made of copper voltage increases power consumption and consequently heat generation significantly ( proportionally to the square of the voltage in a linear circuit , for example ) ; this requires more cooling to avoid damaging the hardware by overheating conversely , the overclocker may decide to decrease the chip voltage while overclocking ( a process known as undervolting ) , to reduce heat emissions while performance remains optimal stock cooling systems are designed for the amount of power produced during non-overclocked use ; overclocked circuits can require more cooling , such as by powerful fans , larger heat sinks , heat pipes and water cooling this method of cooling is highly effective , but itself generates significant heat elsewhere which must be carried away , often by a convection-based heatsink or a water cooling system other cooling methods are forced convection and phase transition cooling which is used in refrigerators and can be adapted for computer use liquid nitrogen , liquid helium , and dry ice are used as coolants in extreme cases , such as record-setting attempts or one-off experiments rather than cooling an everyday system cpu frequency world record is 8.794 & nbsp ; ghz as of november 2012 these extreme methods are generally impractical in the long term , as they require refilling reservoirs of vaporizing coolant , and condensation can form on chilled components submersion cooling , used by the cray-2 supercomputer , involves sinking a part of computer system directly into a chilled liquid that is thermally conductive but has low electrical conductivity using only the benchmark scores , it may be difficult to judge the difference overclocking makes to the overall performance of a computer it is speculated that manufacturers implement overclocking prevention mechanisms such as cpu locking to prevent users from buying lower-priced items and overclocking them increasing the operation frequency of a component will usually increase its thermal output in a linear fashion , while an increase in voltage usually causes thermal power to increase quadratically flashing and unlocking can be used to improve the performance of a video card , without technically overclocking ( but is much riskier than overclocking just through software ) overclocked processors first became commercially available in 1983 , when amd sold an overclocked version of the intel 8088 cpu

the purpose of overclocking is to increase the operating speed of a given component normally , on modern systems , the target of overclocking is increasing the performance of a major chip or subsystem , such as the main processor or graphics controller , but other components , such as system memory ( ram ) or system buses ( generally on the motherboard ) , are commonly involved the trade-offs are an increase in power consumption ( heat ) , fan noise ( cooling ) , and shortened lifespan for the targeted components overclocking techniques in general aim to trade this safety margin by setting the device to run in the higher end of the margin , with the understanding that temperature and voltage must be more strictly monitored and controlled by the user examples are that operating temperature would need to be more strictly controlled with increased cooling , as the part will be less tolerant of increased temperatures at the higher speeds also base operating voltage may be increased to compensate for unexpected voltage drops and to strengthen signalling and timing signals , as low-voltage excursions are more likely to cause malfunctions at higher operating speeds generally for any given voltage most parts will have a maximum '' stable '' speed where they still operate correctly at this point an increase in operating voltage of a part may allow more headroom for further increases in clock speed , but the increased voltage can also significantly increase heat output , as well as shorten the lifespan further at some point there will be a limit imposed by the ability to supply the device with sufficient power , the user 's ability to cool the part , and the device 's own maximum voltage tolerance before it achieves destructive failure conversely , the primary goal of underclocking is to reduce power consumption and the resultant heat generation of a device , with the trade-offs being lower clock speeds and reductions in performance the usefulness of underclocking ( again like overclocking ) is determined by what processor offerings , prices , and availability are at the specific time of the build overclocking has become more accessible with motherboard makers offering overclocking as a marketing feature on their mainstream product lines however , the practice is embraced more by enthusiasts than professional users , as overclocking carries a risk of reduced reliability , accuracy and damage to data and equipment overclocking offers several draws for overclocking enthusiasts overclocking allows testing of components at speeds not currently offered by the manufacturer , or at speeds only officially offered on specialized , higher-priced versions of the product a general trend in the computing industry is that new technologies tend to debut in the high-end market first , then later trickle down to the performance and mainstream market if the high-end part only differs by an increased clock speed , an enthusiast can attempt to overclock a mainstream part to simulate the high-end offering another approach is overclocking older components to attempt to keep pace with increasing system requirements and extend the useful service life of the older part or at least delay a purchase of new hardware solely for performance reasons another rationale for overclocking older equipment is even if overclocking stresses equipment to the point of failure earlier , little is lost as it is already depreciated , and would have needed to be replaced in any case most modern processors derive their effective operating speeds by multiplying a base clock ( processor bus speed ) by an internal multiplier within the processor ( the cpu multiplier ) to attain their final speed computer processors generally are overclocked by manipulating the cpu multiplier if that option is available , but the processor and other components can also be overclocked by increasing the base speed of the bus clock most oem systems do not expose to the user the adjustments needed to change processor clock speed or voltage in the bios of the oem 's motherboard , which precludes overclocking ( for warranty and support reasons ) components are only guaranteed to operate correctly up to their rated values ; beyond that different samples may have different overclocking potential supplying the power with improper settings or applying excessive voltage can permanently damage a component as clock frequencies in digital circuits and voltage applied increase , the heat generated by components running at the higher performance levels also increases the relationship between clock frequencies and thermal design power ( tdp ) are linear to overcome this issue , overclockers raise the chip voltage to increase the overclocking potential voltage increases power consumption and consequently heat generation significantly ( proportionally to the square of the voltage in a linear circuit , for example ) ; this requires more cooling to avoid damaging the hardware by overheating conversely , the overclocker may decide to decrease the chip voltage while overclocking ( a process known as undervolting ) , to reduce heat emissions while performance remains optimal stock cooling systems are designed for the amount of power produced during non-overclocked use ; overclocked circuits can require more cooling , such as by powerful fans , larger heat sinks , heat pipes and water cooling thermoelectric cooling devices which actually refrigerate using the peltier effect can help with high thermal design power ( tdp ) processors made by intel and amd in the early twenty-first century this method of cooling is highly effective , but itself generates significant heat elsewhere which must be carried away , often by a convection-based heatsink or a water cooling system liquid nitrogen , liquid helium , and dry ice are used as coolants in extreme cases , such as record-setting attempts or one-off experiments rather than cooling an everyday system in june 2006 , ibm and georgia institute of technology jointly announced a new record in silicon-based chip clock rate ( the rate a transistor can be switched at , not the cpu clock rate ) above 500 & nbsp ; ghz , which was done by cooling the chip to using liquid helium submersion cooling , used by the cray-2 supercomputer , involves sinking a part of computer system directly into a chilled liquid that is thermally conductive but has low electrical conductivity many devices sold with a lower rating may behave in all ways as higher-rated ones , while in the worst case operation at the higher rating may be more problematical it is speculated that manufacturers implement overclocking prevention mechanisms such as cpu locking to prevent users from buying lower-priced items and overclocking them users usually unlock cpus to allow overclocking , but sometimes to allow for underclocking in order to maintain the front side bus speed ( on older cpus ) compatibility with certain motherboards system optimization : some systems have '' bottlenecks '' , where small overclocking of one component can help realize the full potential of another component to a greater percentage than when just the limiting hardware itself is overclocked higher clock rates and voltages increase power consumption , also increasing electricity cost and heat production it is common to run into one of those problems when overclocking graphics cards ; both symptoms at the same time usually means that the card is severely pushed beyond its heat , clock rate , and/or voltage limits , however if seen when not overclocked , they indicate a faulty card

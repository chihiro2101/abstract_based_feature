the purpose of overclocking is to increase the operating speed of a given component normally , on modern systems , the target of overclocking is increasing the performance of a major chip or subsystem , such as the main processor or graphics controller , but other components , such as system memory ( ram ) or system buses ( generally on the motherboard ) , are commonly involved the trade-offs are an increase in power consumption ( heat ) , fan noise ( cooling ) , and shortened lifespan for the targeted components most components are designed with a margin of safety to deal with operating conditions outside of a manufacturer 's control ; examples are ambient temperature and fluctuations in operating voltage overclocking techniques in general aim to trade this safety margin by setting the device to run in the higher end of the margin , with the understanding that temperature and voltage must be more strictly monitored and controlled by the user examples are that operating temperature would need to be more strictly controlled with increased cooling , as the part will be less tolerant of increased temperatures at the higher speeds also base operating voltage may be increased to compensate for unexpected voltage drops and to strengthen signalling and timing signals , as low-voltage excursions are more likely to cause malfunctions at higher operating speeds past this speed the device starts giving incorrect results , which can cause malfunctions and sporadic behavior in any system depending on it at this point an increase in operating voltage of a part may allow more headroom for further increases in clock speed , but the increased voltage can also significantly increase heat output , as well as shorten the lifespan further overzealous use of voltage and/or inadequate cooling can rapidly degrade a device 's performance to the point of failure , or in extreme cases outright destroy it the speed gained by overclocking depends largely upon the applications and workloads being run on the system , and what components are being overclocked by the user ; benchmarks for different purposes are published conversely , the primary goal of underclocking is to reduce power consumption and the resultant heat generation of a device , with the trade-offs being lower clock speeds and reductions in performance this was also attractive as using a '' standard voltage '' processor in a '' low voltage '' application avoided paying the traditional price premium for an officially certified low voltage version however again like overclocking there is no guarantee of success , and the builder 's time researching given system/processor combinations and especially the time and tedium of performing many iterations of stability testing need to be considered the usefulness of underclocking ( again like overclocking ) is determined by what processor offerings , prices , and availability are at the specific time of the build overclocking has become more accessible with motherboard makers offering overclocking as a marketing feature on their mainstream product lines overclocking offers several draws for overclocking enthusiasts overclocking allows testing of components at speeds not currently offered by the manufacturer , or at speeds only officially offered on specialized , higher-priced versions of the product a general trend in the computing industry is that new technologies tend to debut in the high-end market first , then later trickle down to the performance and mainstream market if the high-end part only differs by an increased clock speed , an enthusiast can attempt to overclock a mainstream part to simulate the high-end offering another approach is overclocking older components to attempt to keep pace with increasing system requirements and extend the useful service life of the older part or at least delay a purchase of new hardware solely for performance reasons most efforts for computer components however focus on specific components , such as , processors ( a.k.a computer processors generally are overclocked by manipulating the cpu multiplier if that option is available , but the processor and other components can also be overclocked by increasing the base speed of the bus clock components will generally show some sort of malfunctioning behavior or other indication of compromised stability that alerts the user that a given speed is not stable , but there is always a possibility that a component will permanently fail without warning , even if voltages are kept within some pre-determined safe values the maximum speed is determined by overclocking to the point of first instability , then accepting the last stable slower setting first is to ensure that the component is supplied with adequate power at a voltage sufficient to operate at the new clock rate in a professional production environment , overclocking is only likely to be used where the increase in speed justifies the cost of the expert support required , the possibly reduced reliability , the consequent effect on maintenance contracts and warranties , and the higher power consumption in addition , some digital circuits slow down at high temperatures due to changes in mosfet device characteristics conversely , the overclocker may decide to decrease the chip voltage while overclocking ( a process known as undervolting ) , to reduce heat emissions while performance remains optimal stock cooling systems are designed for the amount of power produced during non-overclocked use ; overclocked circuits can require more cooling , such as by powerful fans , larger heat sinks , heat pipes and water cooling many heatsinks combine two or more materials to achieve a balance between performance and cost image:2007taipeiitmonth inteloclivetest overclocking-6.jpg right thumb liquid nitrogen may be used for cooling an overclocked system , when an extreme measure of cooling is needed liquid nitrogen , liquid helium , and dry ice are used as coolants in extreme cases , such as record-setting attempts or one-off experiments rather than cooling an everyday system such failures might never be correctly diagnosed and may instead be incorrectly attributed to software bugs in applications , device drivers , or the operating system overclocked use may permanently damage components enough to cause them to misbehave ( even under normal operating conditions ) without becoming totally unusable although software tools are available for testing hardware stability , it is generally impossible for any private individual to thoroughly test the functionality of a processor for example , an arithmetic operation may produce the correct result but incorrect flags ; if the flags are not checked , the error will go undetected when maximum cooling is not required , in any equipment , fan speeds can be reduced below the maximum : fan noise has been found to be roughly proportional to the fifth power of fan speed ; halving speed reduces noise by about 15 & nbsp ; db additional cooling methods which do not use fans can be used , such as liquid and phase-change cooling it is common to run into one of those problems when overclocking graphics cards ; both symptoms at the same time usually means that the card is severely pushed beyond its heat , clock rate , and/or voltage limits , however if seen when not overclocked , they indicate a faulty card for example , video cards with 3d accelerators ( most , have two voltage and clock rate settings , one for 2d and one for 3d , but were designed to operate with three voltage stages , the third being somewhere between the aforementioned two , serving as a fallback when the card overheats or as a middle-stage when going from 2d to 3d operation mode

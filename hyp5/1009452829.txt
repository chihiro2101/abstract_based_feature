the purpose of overclocking is to increase the operating speed of a given component normally , on modern systems , the target of overclocking is increasing the performance of a major chip or subsystem , such as the main processor or graphics controller , but other components , such as system memory ( ram ) or system buses ( generally on the motherboard ) , are commonly involved the trade-offs are an increase in power consumption ( heat ) , fan noise ( cooling ) , and shortened lifespan for the targeted components overclocking techniques in general aim to trade this safety margin by setting the device to run in the higher end of the margin , with the understanding that temperature and voltage must be more strictly monitored and controlled by the user examples are that operating temperature would need to be more strictly controlled with increased cooling , as the part will be less tolerant of increased temperatures at the higher speeds also base operating voltage may be increased to compensate for unexpected voltage drops and to strengthen signalling and timing signals , as low-voltage excursions are more likely to cause malfunctions at higher operating speeds while most modern devices are fairly tolerant of overclocking , all devices have finite limits at this point an increase in operating voltage of a part may allow more headroom for further increases in clock speed , but the increased voltage can also significantly increase heat output , as well as shorten the lifespan further overzealous use of voltage and/or inadequate cooling can rapidly degrade a device 's performance to the point of failure , or in extreme cases outright destroy it the speed gained by overclocking depends largely upon the applications and workloads being run on the system , and what components are being overclocked by the user ; benchmarks for different purposes are published conversely , the primary goal of underclocking is to reduce power consumption and the resultant heat generation of a device , with the trade-offs being lower clock speeds and reductions in performance this was also attractive as using a '' standard voltage '' processor in a '' low voltage '' application avoided paying the traditional price premium for an officially certified low voltage version overclocking has become more accessible with motherboard makers offering overclocking as a marketing feature on their mainstream product lines however , the practice is embraced more by enthusiasts than professional users , as overclocking carries a risk of reduced reliability , accuracy and damage to data and equipment while overclocking can still be an option for increasing personal computing capacity , and thus workflow productivity for professional users , the importance of stability testing components thoroughly before employing them into a production environment can not be overstated overclocking offers several draws for overclocking enthusiasts overclocking allows testing of components at speeds not currently offered by the manufacturer , or at speeds only officially offered on specialized , higher-priced versions of the product others will purchase a low-cost model of a component in a given product line , and attempt to overclock that part to match a more expensive model 's stock performance another rationale for overclocking older equipment is even if overclocking stresses equipment to the point of failure earlier , little is lost as it is already depreciated , and would have needed to be replaced in any case technically any component that uses a timer ( or clock ) to synchronize its internal operations can be overclocked most modern processors derive their effective operating speeds by multiplying a base clock ( processor bus speed ) by an internal multiplier within the processor ( the cpu multiplier ) to attain their final speed computer processors generally are overclocked by manipulating the cpu multiplier if that option is available , but the processor and other components can also be overclocked by increasing the base speed of the bus clock some systems allow additional tuning of other clocks ( such as a clock rate ) that influence the bus clock speed that , again is multiplied by the processor to allow for finer adjustments of the final processor speed most oem systems do not expose to the user the adjustments needed to change processor clock speed or voltage in the bios of the oem 's motherboard , which precludes overclocking ( for warranty and support reasons ) the same processor installed on a different motherboard offering adjustments will allow the user to change them components are only guaranteed to operate correctly up to their rated values ; beyond that different samples may have different overclocking potential the end-point of a given overclock is determined by parameters such as available cpu multipliers , bus dividers , voltages ; the user 's ability to manage thermal loads , cooling techniques ; and several other factors of the individual devices themselves such as semiconductor clock and thermal tolerances , interaction with other components and the rest of the system first is to ensure that the component is supplied with adequate power at a voltage sufficient to operate at the new clock rate in a professional production environment , overclocking is only likely to be used where the increase in speed justifies the cost of the expert support required , the possibly reduced reliability , the consequent effect on maintenance contracts and warranties , and the higher power consumption as clock frequencies in digital circuits and voltage applied increase , the heat generated by components running at the higher performance levels also increases the relationship between clock frequencies and thermal design power ( tdp ) are linear voltage increases power consumption and consequently heat generation significantly ( proportionally to the square of the voltage in a linear circuit , for example ) ; this requires more cooling to avoid damaging the hardware by overheating stock cooling systems are designed for the amount of power produced during non-overclocked use ; overclocked circuits can require more cooling , such as by powerful fans , larger heat sinks , heat pipes and water cooling many heatsinks combine two or more materials to achieve a balance between performance and cost thermoelectric cooling devices create temperature differences between two plates by running an electric current through the plates other cooling methods are forced convection and phase transition cooling which is used in refrigerators and can be adapted for computer use it is speculated that manufacturers implement overclocking prevention mechanisms such as cpu locking to prevent users from buying lower-priced items and overclocking them higher performance in games , en-/decoding , video editing and system tasks at no additional direct monetary expense , but with increased electrical consumption and thermal output '' because installing windows is very memory-intensive , decoding errors may occur when files are extracted from the windows xp cd-rom the lifespan of semiconductor components may be reduced by increased voltages and heat flashing and unlocking can be used to improve the performance of a video card , without technically overclocking ( but is much riskier than overclocking just through software ) in 1984 , some consumers were overclocking ibm 's version of the intel 80286 cpu by replacing the clock crystal .

the first ni–cd battery was created by waldemar jungner of sweden in 1899 with minor improvements to the first prototypes , energy density rapidly increased to about half of that of primary batteries , and significantly greater than lead–acid batteries thomas edison patented a nickel– or cobalt–cadmium battery in 1902 , us patent 0692507 and adapted the battery design when he introduced the nickel–iron battery to the us two years after jungner had built one in 1932 active materials were deposited inside a porous nickel-plated electrode and fifteen years later work began on a sealed nickel-cadmium battery up to this point , the batteries were '' pocket type , '' constructed of nickel-plated steel pockets containing nickel and cadmium active materials around the middle of the twentieth century , sintered-plate ni–cd batteries became increasingly popular in general , the greater amount of reactive material surface area in a battery , the lower its internal resistance for a common aa-size cell , the maximum discharge rate is approximately 1.8 & nbsp ; amperes ; for a d size battery the discharge rate can be as high as 3.5 & nbsp ; amperes model-aircraft or -boat builders often take much larger currents of up to a hundred amps or so from specially constructed ni–cd batteries , which are used to drive main motors in this , however , they have been largely superseded by lithium polymer ( lipo ) and lithium iron phosphate ( life ) batteries , which can provide even higher energy densities ni–cd cells have a nominal cell potential of 1.2 & nbsp ; volts ( v ) this is lower than the 1.5 & nbsp ; v of alkaline and zinc–carbon primary cells , and consequently they are not appropriate as a replacement in all applications unlike alkaline and zinc–carbon primary cells , a ni–cd cell 's terminal voltage only changes a little as it discharges because many electronic devices are designed to work with primary cells that may discharge to as low as 0.90 to 1.0 & nbsp ; v per cell , the relatively steady 1.2 & nbsp ; v of a ni–cd cell is enough to allow operation ni–cd batteries used to replace 9 & nbsp ; v batteries usually only have six cells , for a terminal voltage of 7.2 & nbsp ; volts while most pocket radios will operate satisfactorily at this voltage , some manufacturers such as varta made 8.4 & nbsp ; volt batteries with seven cells for more critical applications ni–cd batteries can be charged at several different rates , depending on how the cell was manufactured regardless of the charge speed , more energy must be supplied to the battery than its actual capacity , to account for energy loss during charging , with faster charges being more efficient at the rapid-charge rate , done at 100 % of the rated capacity of the battery in 1 hour ( 1c ) , the battery holds roughly 80 % of the charge , so a 100 & nbsp ; mah battery takes 125 & nbsp ; mah to charge ( that is , approximately 1 hour and fifteen minutes ) some specialized batteries can be charged in as little as 10–15 minutes at a 4c or 6c charge rate , but this is very uncommon the safe temperature range when in use is between −20 & nbsp ; °c and 45 & nbsp ; °c when not under load or charge , a ni–cd battery will self-discharge approximately 10 % per month at 20 & nbsp ; °c , ranging up to 20 % per month at higher temperatures a fully charged ni-cd cell contains : a nickel ( iii ) oxide-hydroxide positive plate electrode a cadmium negative electrode plate a separator , and an alkaline electrolyte ( potassium hydroxide ) this is known as the jelly-roll design and allows a ni–cd cell to deliver a much higher maximum current than an equivalent size alkaline cell alkaline cells have a bobbin construction where the cell casing is filled with electrolyte and contains a graphite rod which acts as the positive electrode vented cell ( wet cell , flooded cell ) nicd batteries are used when large capacities and high discharge rates are required traditional nicd batteries are of the sealed type , which means that charge gas is normally recombined and they release no gas unless severely overcharged or a fault develops using vented cell nicd batteries results in reduction in size , weight and maintenance requirements over other types of batteries during the over-charge or top-up charge , the cell voltages will go beyond 1.6 & nbsp ; v and then slowly start to drop small cells are used for portable electronics and toys ( such as solar garden lights ) , often using cells manufactured in the same sizes as primary cells when ni–cd batteries are substituted for primary cells , the lower terminal voltage and smaller ampere-hour capacity may reduce performance as compared to primary cells miniature button cells are sometimes used in photographic equipment , hand-held lamps ( flashlight or torch ) , computer-memory standby , toys , and novelties up until the mid-1990s , ni–cd batteries had an overwhelming majority of the market share for rechargeable batteries in home electronics this is in contrast , for example , to lithium ion battery , which are less stable and will be permanently damaged if discharged below a minimum voltage compared to lead–acid batteries , ni–cd batteries have a much higher energy density even with discharge rates as high as 50c , a ni–cd battery will provide very nearly its rated capacity under the so-called '' batteries directive '' ( 2006/66/ec ) , the sale of consumer ni–cd batteries has now been banned within the european union except for medical use ; alarm systems ; emergency lighting ; and portable power tools

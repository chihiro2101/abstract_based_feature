with minor improvements to the first prototypes , energy density rapidly increased to about half of that of primary batteries , and significantly greater than lead–acid batteries thomas edison patented a nickel– or cobalt–cadmium battery in 1902 , us patent 0692507 and adapted the battery design when he introduced the nickel–iron battery to the us two years after jungner had built one in 1906 , jungner established a factory close to oskarshamn , sweden to produce flooded design ni–cd batteries in 1932 active materials were deposited inside a porous nickel-plated electrode and fifteen years later work began on a sealed nickel-cadmium battery up to this point , the batteries were '' pocket type , '' constructed of nickel-plated steel pockets containing nickel and cadmium active materials around the middle of the twentieth century , sintered-plate ni–cd batteries became increasingly popular since the 2000s , all consumer ni–cd batteries use the '' swiss roll '' or '' jelly-roll '' configuration for a common aa-size cell , the maximum discharge rate is approximately 1.8 & nbsp ; amperes ; for a d size battery the discharge rate can be as high as 3.5 & nbsp ; amperes unlike alkaline and zinc–carbon primary cells , a ni–cd cell 's terminal voltage only changes a little as it discharges some would consider the near-constant voltage a drawback as it makes it difficult to detect when the battery charge is low ni–cd batteries used to replace 9 & nbsp ; v batteries usually only have six cells , for a terminal voltage of 7.2 & nbsp ; volts ni–cd batteries can be charged at several different rates , depending on how the cell was manufactured some specialized batteries can be charged in as little as 10–15 minutes at a 4c or 6c charge rate , but this is very uncommon during charging , the battery temperature typically stays low , around the same as the ambient temperature ( the charging reaction absorbs energy ) , but as the battery nears full charge the temperature will rise to 45–50 & nbsp ; °c when not under load or charge , a ni–cd battery will self-discharge approximately 10 % per month at 20 & nbsp ; °c , ranging up to 20 % per month at higher temperatures it is possible to perform a trickle charge at current levels just high enough to offset this discharge rate ; to keep a battery fully charged sealed ni–cd cells consist of a pressure vessel that is supposed to contain any generation of oxygen and hydrogen gases until they can recombine back to water such generation typically occurs during rapid charge and discharge , and exceedingly at overcharge condition since the vessel is designed to contain an exact amount of electrolyte this loss will rapidly affect the capacity of the cell and its ability to receive and deliver current this is known as the jelly-roll design and allows a ni–cd cell to deliver a much higher maximum current than an equivalent size alkaline cell when jungner built the first ni-cd batteries , he used nickel oxide in the positive electrode , and iron and cadmium materials in the negative vented cell ( wet cell , flooded cell ) nicd batteries are used when large capacities and high discharge rates are required this also means the battery is not normally damaged by excessive rates of overcharge , discharge or even negative charge vented cell nicd batteries have long lives ( up to 20 years or more , depending on type ) and operate at extreme temperatures ( from −40 to 70 & nbsp ; °c ) cells are flooded with an electrolyte of 30 % aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide ( koh ) if this voltage is set too high it will result in rapid electrolyte loss with a relatively low internal resistance , they can supply high surge currents larger flooded cells are used for aircraft battery , electric cars , and standby power up until the mid-1990s , ni–cd batteries had an overwhelming majority of the market share for rechargeable batteries in home electronics battery waste management , defra , 2006 inobat statistics , 2008 epba statistics , 2000 in the eu the 2006 battery directive restricted sales of ni–cd batteries to consumers for portable devices a fully charged single ni–cd cell , under no load , carries a potential difference of between 1.25 and 1.35 volts , which stays relatively constant as the battery is discharged in addition to single cells , batteries exist that contain up to 300 cells ( nominally 360 volts , actual voltage under no load between 380 and 420 volts ) however , the ni–cd battery is still very useful in applications requiring very high discharge rates because it can endure such discharge with no damage or loss of capacity this results in a preference for ni–cd over non-lsd nimh batteries in applications where the current draw on the battery is lower than the battery 's own self-discharge rate ( for example , television remote controls ) the primary trade-off with ni–cd batteries is their higher cost and the use of cadmium ni–cd batteries contain between 6 % ( for industrial batteries ) and 18 % ( for commercial batteries ) cadmium , which is a toxic heavy metal and therefore requires special care during battery disposal '' meps ban cadmium from power tool batteries and mercury from button cells

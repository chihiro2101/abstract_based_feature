the first ni–cd battery was created by waldemar jungner of sweden in 1899 with minor improvements to the first prototypes , energy density rapidly increased to about half of that of primary batteries , and significantly greater than lead–acid batteries jungner experimented with substituting iron for the cadmium in varying quantities , but found the iron formulations to be wanting thomas edison patented a nickel– or cobalt–cadmium battery in 1902 , us patent 0692507 and adapted the battery design when he introduced the nickel–iron battery to the us two years after jungner had built one in 1906 , jungner established a factory close to oskarshamn , sweden to produce flooded design ni–cd batteries up to this point , the batteries were '' pocket type , '' constructed of nickel-plated steel pockets containing nickel and cadmium active materials the maximum discharge rate for a ni–cd battery varies by size for a common aa-size cell , the maximum discharge rate is approximately 1.8 & nbsp ; amperes ; for a d size battery the discharge rate can be as high as 3.5 & nbsp ; amperes model-aircraft or -boat builders often take much larger currents of up to a hundred amps or so from specially constructed ni–cd batteries , which are used to drive main motors in this , however , they have been largely superseded by lithium polymer ( lipo ) and lithium iron phosphate ( life ) batteries , which can provide even higher energy densities ni–cd cells have a nominal cell potential of 1.2 & nbsp ; volts ( v ) unlike alkaline and zinc–carbon primary cells , a ni–cd cell 's terminal voltage only changes a little as it discharges ni–cd batteries used to replace 9 & nbsp ; v batteries usually only have six cells , for a terminal voltage of 7.2 & nbsp ; volts ni–cd batteries can be charged at several different rates , depending on how the cell was manufactured for example , an '' overnight '' charge , might consist of supplying a current equal to one tenth the amperehour rating ( c/10 ) for 14–16 hours ; that is , a 100 & nbsp ; mah battery takes 10 & nbsp ; ma for 14 hours , for a total of 140 & nbsp ; mah to charge at this rate some specialized batteries can be charged in as little as 10–15 minutes at a 4c or 6c charge rate , but this is very uncommon it also greatly increases the risk of the cells overheating and venting due to an internal overpressure condition : the cell 's rate of temperature rise is governed by its internal resistance and the square of the charging rate during charging , the battery temperature typically stays low , around the same as the ambient temperature ( the charging reaction absorbs energy ) , but as the battery nears full charge the temperature will rise to 45–50 & nbsp ; °c when not under load or charge , a ni–cd battery will self-discharge approximately 10 % per month at 20 & nbsp ; °c , ranging up to 20 % per month at higher temperatures it is possible to perform a trickle charge at current levels just high enough to offset this discharge rate ; to keep a battery fully charged such generation typically occurs during rapid charge and discharge , and exceedingly at overcharge condition ni-cd batteries usually have a metal case with a sealing plate equipped with a self-sealing safety valve this is known as the jelly-roll design and allows a ni–cd cell to deliver a much higher maximum current than an equivalent size alkaline cell when jungner built the first ni-cd batteries , he used nickel oxide in the positive electrode , and iron and cadmium materials in the negative another historically important variation on the basic ni-cd cell is the addition of lithium hydroxide to the potassium hydroxide electrolyte the ni–cd battery in its modern form is extremely resistant to electrical abuse anyway , so this practice has been discontinued vented cell ( wet cell , flooded cell ) nicd batteries are used when large capacities and high discharge rates are required traditional nicd batteries are of the sealed type , which means that charge gas is normally recombined and they release no gas unless severely overcharged or a fault develops they are used in aviation , rail and mass transit , backup power for telecoms , engine starting for backup turbines etc vented cell nicd batteries have long lives ( up to 20 years or more , depending on type ) and operate at extreme temperatures ( from −40 to 70 & nbsp ; °c ) large nickel-plated copper studs and thick interconnecting links assure minimum equivalent series resistance for the battery the venting of gases means that the battery is either being discharged at a high rate or recharged at a higher than nominal rate another charge cycle follows at 0.1 ca rate , again until all cells have reached 1.55 v in consumer applications , ni–cd batteries compete directly with alkaline battery however , since the alkaline battery 's chemical reaction is not reversible , a reusable ni–cd battery has a significantly longer total lifetime this results in a preference for ni–cd over non-lsd nimh batteries in applications where the current draw on the battery is lower than the battery 's own self-discharge rate ( for example , television remote controls ) if treated well , a ni–cd battery can last for 1,000 cycles or more before its capacity drops below half its original capacity

the first ni–cd battery was created by waldemar jungner of sweden in 1899 at that time , the only direct competitor was the lead–acid battery , which was less physically and chemically robust with minor improvements to the first prototypes , energy density rapidly increased to about half of that of primary batteries , and significantly greater than lead–acid batteries thomas edison patented a nickel– or cobalt–cadmium battery in 1902 , us patent 0692507 and adapted the battery design when he introduced the nickel–iron battery to the us two years after jungner had built one up to this point , the batteries were '' pocket type , '' constructed of nickel-plated steel pockets containing nickel and cadmium active materials around the middle of the twentieth century , sintered-plate ni–cd batteries became increasingly popular fusing nickel powder at a temperature well below its melting point using high pressures creates sintered plates sintered plates are usually much thinner than the pocket type , resulting in greater surface area per volume and higher currents the maximum discharge rate for a ni–cd battery varies by size for a common aa-size cell , the maximum discharge rate is approximately 1.8 & nbsp ; amperes ; for a d size battery the discharge rate can be as high as 3.5 & nbsp ; amperes ni–cd cells have a nominal cell potential of 1.2 & nbsp ; volts ( v ) ni–cd batteries used to replace 9 & nbsp ; v batteries usually only have six cells , for a terminal voltage of 7.2 & nbsp ; volts while most pocket radios will operate satisfactorily at this voltage , some manufacturers such as varta made 8.4 & nbsp ; volt batteries with seven cells for more critical applications ni–cd batteries can be charged at several different rates , depending on how the cell was manufactured some specialized batteries can be charged in as little as 10–15 minutes at a 4c or 6c charge rate , but this is very uncommon the downside to faster charging is the higher risk of overcharging , which can damage the battery when not under load or charge , a ni–cd battery will self-discharge approximately 10 % per month at 20 & nbsp ; °c , ranging up to 20 % per month at higher temperatures it is possible to perform a trickle charge at current levels just high enough to offset this discharge rate ; to keep a battery fully charged since the vessel is designed to contain an exact amount of electrolyte this loss will rapidly affect the capacity of the cell and its ability to receive and deliver current as a relatively small area of the electrode is in contact with the electrolyte ( as opposed to the jelly-roll design ) , the internal resistance for an equivalent sized alkaline cell is higher which limits the maximum current that can be delivered the alkaline electrolyte ( commonly koh ) is not consumed in this reaction and therefore its specific gravity , unlike in lead–acid batteries , is not a guide to its state of charge vented cell ( wet cell , flooded cell ) nicd batteries are used when large capacities and high discharge rates are required since the battery is not a pressure vessel , it is safer , weighs less , and has a simpler and more economical structure vented cell nicd batteries have long lives ( up to 20 years or more , depending on type ) and operate at extreme temperatures ( from −40 to 70 & nbsp ; °c ) a steel battery box contains the cells connected in series to gain the desired voltage ( 1.2 & nbsp ; v per cell nominal ) large nickel-plated copper studs and thick interconnecting links assure minimum equivalent series resistance for the battery vented cell voltage rises rapidly at the end of charge allowing for very simple charger circuitry to be used a failed charge regulator may allow the charge voltage to rise well above this value , causing a massive overcharge with boiling over of the electrolyte sealed ni–cd cells may be used individually , or assembled into battery packs containing two or more cells small cells are used for portable electronics and toys ( such as solar garden lights ) , often using cells manufactured in the same sizes as primary cells when ni–cd batteries are substituted for primary cells , the lower terminal voltage and smaller ampere-hour capacity may reduce performance as compared to primary cells specialty ni–cd batteries are used in cordless and wireless telephones , emergency lighting , and other applications the battery performs very well under rough conditions , perfect for use in portable tools compared to ni–cd batteries , nimh batteries have a higher capacity and are less toxic , and are now more cost effective finally , a similarly sized ni–cd battery has a slightly lower internal resistance , and thus can achieve a higher maximum discharge rate ( which can be important for applications such as power tools ) some electronics designed to be powered by ni–cd batteries are able to withstand this reduced voltage long enough for the voltage to return to normal ni–cd batteries contain between 6 % ( for industrial batteries ) and 18 % ( for commercial batteries ) cadmium , which is a toxic heavy metal and therefore requires special care during battery disposal

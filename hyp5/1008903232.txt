with minor improvements to the first prototypes , energy density rapidly increased to about half of that of primary batteries , and significantly greater than lead–acid batteries thomas edison patented a nickel– or cobalt–cadmium battery in 1902 , us patent 0692507 and adapted the battery design when he introduced the nickel–iron battery to the us two years after jungner had built one in 1906 , jungner established a factory close to oskarshamn , sweden to produce flooded design ni–cd batteries up to this point , the batteries were '' pocket type , '' constructed of nickel-plated steel pockets containing nickel and cadmium active materials since the 2000s , all consumer ni–cd batteries use the '' swiss roll '' or '' jelly-roll '' configuration this design incorporates several layers of positive and negative material rolled into a cylindrical shape the maximum discharge rate for a ni–cd battery varies by size model-aircraft or -boat builders often take much larger currents of up to a hundred amps or so from specially constructed ni–cd batteries , which are used to drive main motors unlike alkaline and zinc–carbon primary cells , a ni–cd cell 's terminal voltage only changes a little as it discharges because many electronic devices are designed to work with primary cells that may discharge to as low as 0.90 to 1.0 & nbsp ; v per cell , the relatively steady 1.2 & nbsp ; v of a ni–cd cell is enough to allow operation some would consider the near-constant voltage a drawback as it makes it difficult to detect when the battery charge is low ni–cd batteries used to replace 9 & nbsp ; v batteries usually only have six cells , for a terminal voltage of 7.2 & nbsp ; volts while most pocket radios will operate satisfactorily at this voltage , some manufacturers such as varta made 8.4 & nbsp ; volt batteries with seven cells for more critical applications ni–cd batteries can be charged at several different rates , depending on how the cell was manufactured the charge rate is measured based on the percentage of the amp-hour capacity the battery is fed as a steady current over the duration of the charge regardless of the charge speed , more energy must be supplied to the battery than its actual capacity , to account for energy loss during charging , with faster charges being more efficient some battery chargers detect this temperature increase to cut off charging and prevent over-charging when not under load or charge , a ni–cd battery will self-discharge approximately 10 % per month at 20 & nbsp ; °c , ranging up to 20 % per month at higher temperatures it is possible to perform a trickle charge at current levels just high enough to offset this discharge rate ; to keep a battery fully charged however , if the battery is going to be stored unused for a long period of time , it should be discharged down to at most 40 % of capacity ( some manufacturers recommend fully discharging and even short-circuiting once fully discharged , and stored in a cool , dry environment such generation typically occurs during rapid charge and discharge , and exceedingly at overcharge condition ni-cd batteries usually have a metal case with a sealing plate equipped with a self-sealing safety valve this is known as the jelly-roll design and allows a ni–cd cell to deliver a much higher maximum current than an equivalent size alkaline cell when jungner built the first ni-cd batteries , he used nickel oxide in the positive electrode , and iron and cadmium materials in the negative it was not until later that pure cadmium metal and nickel hydroxide were used vented cell nicd batteries have long lives ( up to 20 years or more , depending on type ) and operate at extreme temperatures ( from −40 to 70 & nbsp ; °c ) a steel battery box contains the cells connected in series to gain the desired voltage ( 1.2 & nbsp ; v per cell nominal ) cells are usually made of a light and durable polyamide ( nylon ) , with multiple nickel-cadmium plates welded together for each electrode inside another charge cycle follows at 0.1 ca rate , again until all cells have reached 1.55 v small cells are used for portable electronics and toys ( such as solar garden lights ) , often using cells manufactured in the same sizes as primary cells specialty ni–cd batteries are used in cordless and wireless telephones , emergency lighting , and other applications up until the mid-1990s , ni–cd batteries had an overwhelming majority of the market share for rechargeable batteries in home electronics compared to ni–cd batteries , nimh batteries have a higher capacity and are less toxic , and are now more cost effective the primary trade-off with ni–cd batteries is their higher cost and the use of cadmium however , if the device is unable to operate through this period of decreased voltage , it will be unable to get enough energy out of the battery , and for all practical purposes , the battery appears '' dead '' earlier than normal ni–cd batteries contain between 6 % ( for industrial batteries ) and 18 % ( for commercial batteries ) cadmium , which is a toxic heavy metal and therefore requires special care during battery disposal under the so-called '' batteries directive '' ( 2006/66/ec ) , the sale of consumer ni–cd batteries has now been banned within the european union except for medical use ; alarm systems ; emergency lighting ; and portable power tools

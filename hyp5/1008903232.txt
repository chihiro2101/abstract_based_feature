at that time , the only direct competitor was the lead–acid battery , which was less physically and chemically robust with minor improvements to the first prototypes , energy density rapidly increased to about half of that of primary batteries , and significantly greater than lead–acid batteries thomas edison patented a nickel– or cobalt–cadmium battery in 1902 , us patent 0692507 and adapted the battery design when he introduced the nickel–iron battery to the us two years after jungner had built one in 1932 active materials were deposited inside a porous nickel-plated electrode and fifteen years later work began on a sealed nickel-cadmium battery up to this point , the batteries were '' pocket type , '' constructed of nickel-plated steel pockets containing nickel and cadmium active materials this design reduces internal resistance as there is a greater amount of electrode in contact with the active material in each cell in this , however , they have been largely superseded by lithium polymer ( lipo ) and lithium iron phosphate ( life ) batteries , which can provide even higher energy densities ni–cd cells have a nominal cell potential of 1.2 & nbsp ; volts ( v ) this is lower than the 1.5 & nbsp ; v of alkaline and zinc–carbon primary cells , and consequently they are not appropriate as a replacement in all applications unlike alkaline and zinc–carbon primary cells , a ni–cd cell 's terminal voltage only changes a little as it discharges ni–cd batteries used to replace 9 & nbsp ; v batteries usually only have six cells , for a terminal voltage of 7.2 & nbsp ; volts the charge rate is measured based on the percentage of the amp-hour capacity the battery is fed as a steady current over the duration of the charge regardless of the charge speed , more energy must be supplied to the battery than its actual capacity , to account for energy loss during charging , with faster charges being more efficient some specialized batteries can be charged in as little as 10–15 minutes at a 4c or 6c charge rate , but this is very uncommon sealed ni–cd cells consist of a pressure vessel that is supposed to contain any generation of oxygen and hydrogen gases until they can recombine back to water since the vessel is designed to contain an exact amount of electrolyte this loss will rapidly affect the capacity of the cell and its ability to receive and deliver current a fully charged ni-cd cell contains : a nickel ( iii ) oxide-hydroxide positive plate electrode a cadmium negative electrode plate a separator , and an alkaline electrolyte ( potassium hydroxide ) ni-cd batteries usually have a metal case with a sealing plate equipped with a self-sealing safety valve the positive and negative electrode plates , isolated from each other by the separator , are rolled in a spiral shape inside the case the alkaline electrolyte ( commonly koh ) is not consumed in this reaction and therefore its specific gravity , unlike in lead–acid batteries , is not a guide to its state of charge when jungner built the first ni-cd batteries , he used nickel oxide in the positive electrode , and iron and cadmium materials in the negative until about 1960 , the chemical reaction was not completely understood the debate was finally resolved by infrared spectroscopy , which revealed cadmium hydroxide and nickel hydroxide vented cell ( wet cell , flooded cell ) nicd batteries are used when large capacities and high discharge rates are required unlike typical nicd cells , which are sealed , vented cells have a vent or low relief valve that releases any generated oxygen and hydrogen gases when overcharged or discharged rapidly this also means the battery is not normally damaged by excessive rates of overcharge , discharge or even negative charge they are used in aviation , rail and mass transit , backup power for telecoms , engine starting for backup turbines etc using vented cell nicd batteries results in reduction in size , weight and maintenance requirements over other types of batteries a steel battery box contains the cells connected in series to gain the desired voltage ( 1.2 & nbsp ; v per cell nominal ) cells are usually made of a light and durable polyamide ( nylon ) , with multiple nickel-cadmium plates welded together for each electrode inside typically a battery is constant current charged at 1 ca rate until all the cells have reached at least 1.55 v specialty ni–cd batteries are used in cordless and wireless telephones , emergency lighting , and other applications battery waste management , defra , 2006 inobat statistics , 2008 epba statistics , 2000 in the eu the 2006 battery directive restricted sales of ni–cd batteries to consumers for portable devices compared to lead–acid batteries , ni–cd batteries have a much higher energy density a ni–cd battery is smaller and lighter than a comparable lead–acid battery , but not a comparable nimh or li-ion battery under the so-called '' batteries directive '' ( 2006/66/ec ) , the sale of consumer ni–cd batteries has now been banned within the european union except for medical use ; alarm systems ; emergency lighting ; and portable power tools '' meps ban cadmium from power tool batteries and mercury from button cells

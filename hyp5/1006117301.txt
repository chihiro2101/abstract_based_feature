much like the term '' byzantine '' , which was invented in the 16th century , '' latin empire '' was not a contemporary name used by or for the regime set up by the crusaders of the fourth crusade in constantinople instead , both terms were invented much later by historians seeking to differentiate between the classical period of the roman empire , the medieval period of the byzantine empire , and the late medieval latin empire , all of which called themselves '' roman '' the term '' latin '' has been used by these later historians because the crusaders ( franks , venetians , and other westerners ) were roman catholic and used latin as their liturgical and scholarly language although this is a marked departure from the standard byzantine nomenclature and ideology ( designating the empire as the basileía rhōmaíōn , '' empire of the romans '' ) , imperium constantinopolitanum was the standard name used for the eastern empire in western sources , such as in papal correspondence , and suggests that the latin leaders viewed themselves as “ taking over ” the empire rather than “ replacing ” it it would have been difficult for the crusaders to justify referring to the empire as '' roman '' considering that western europe generally held the germanic holy roman empire to represent the legitimate roman empire nevertheless , the crusaders were well aware of the fact that constantinople was the capital of the roman empire and that the greek-speaking inhabitants of the empire saw themselves as romaioi ( romans ) his title is a near perfect replication of the title used by byzantine emperor alexios iv angelos , placed on the throne by the crusaders previously , in a letter ( only known in its latin version ) to pope innocent iii : fidelis in christo imperator a deo coronatus romanorum moderator et semper augustus letters by baldwin to pope innocent iii give his title as imperator constantinopolitanus , possibly altered by papal scribes as the pope recognized the holy roman emperor as the imperator romanorum it is probably more likely that he meant romanorum usage of the title emperor of constantinople may not just have been to appease the pope and western europe , but might also have been used to legitimize the rule of the latin emperors in regards to the byzantines that they ruled in the partitio terrarum imperii romaniae , signed on 1 october 1204 , three eighths of the empire — including crete and other islands — went to the republic of venice these duchies remained theoretical , due to the establishment of the empire of nicaea in the area philadelphia never came under actual latin control , although the latin emperor henry of flanders laid claim to the region after defeating the local strongman , theodore mangaphas , in 1205 the doge of venice did not rank as a vassal to the latin empire , but his position in control of three-eighths of its territory and of parts of constantinople itself ensured venice 's influence in the empire 's affairs however , much of the former byzantine territory remained in the hands of rival successor states led by byzantine greek aristocrats , such as the despotate of epirus , the empire of nicaea , and the empire of trebizond , each bent on reconquest from the latins the peace was maintained until 1222 , when the resurgent power of nicaea felt sufficiently strong to challenge the latin empire , by that time weakened by constant warfare in its european provinces unlike in asia , where the latin empire faced only an initially weak nicaea , in europe it was immediately confronted with a powerful enemy : the bulgarian tsar kaloyan thus , on 25 july 1261 , with most of the latin troops away on campaign , the nicaean general alexios strategopoulos found an unguarded entrance to the city , and entered it with 800 troops only , restoring the byzantine empire for his master , michael viii palaiologos in several senses , the only significant export on which the economy of the latin empire had any real basis was the sale of relics back to western europe which had been looted from greek churches

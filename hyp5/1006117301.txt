much like the term '' byzantine '' , which was invented in the 16th century , '' latin empire '' was not a contemporary name used by or for the regime set up by the crusaders of the fourth crusade in constantinople instead , both terms were invented much later by historians seeking to differentiate between the classical period of the roman empire , the medieval period of the byzantine empire , and the late medieval latin empire , all of which called themselves '' roman '' the term '' latin '' has been used by these later historians because the crusaders ( franks , venetians , and other westerners ) were roman catholic and used latin as their liturgical and scholarly language founding treaties issued by the crusaders specifically refer to the empire as the imperium constantinopolitanum ( '' empire of constantinople '' ) it would have been difficult for the crusaders to justify referring to the empire as '' roman '' considering that western europe generally held the germanic holy roman empire to represent the legitimate roman empire nevertheless , the crusaders were well aware of the fact that constantinople was the capital of the roman empire and that the greek-speaking inhabitants of the empire saw themselves as romaioi ( romans ) the full title actually used by the first latin emperor , baldwin i , was balduinus dei gratia fidelissimus in christo imperator a deo coronatus romanorum moderator et semper augustus letters by baldwin to pope innocent iii give his title as imperator constantinopolitanus , possibly altered by papal scribes as the pope recognized the holy roman emperor as the imperator romanorum usage of the title emperor of constantinople may not just have been to appease the pope and western europe , but might also have been used to legitimize the rule of the latin emperors in regards to the byzantines that they ruled philadelphia never came under actual latin control , although the latin emperor henry of flanders laid claim to the region after defeating the local strongman , theodore mangaphas , in 1205 the doge of venice did not rank as a vassal to the latin empire , but his position in control of three-eighths of its territory and of parts of constantinople itself ensured venice 's influence in the empire 's affairs however , much of the former byzantine territory remained in the hands of rival successor states led by byzantine greek aristocrats , such as the despotate of epirus , the empire of nicaea , and the empire of trebizond , each bent on reconquest from the latins the crowning of baldwin i ( 16 may 1204 ) and the establishment of the latin empire had the curious effect of creating five simultaneously existing entities claiming to be successors of the roman empire : the latin empire , the holy roman empire , and the three remnants of the byzantine empire , the despotate of epirus , the empire of nicaea , and the empire of trebizond the peace was maintained until 1222 , when the resurgent power of nicaea felt sufficiently strong to challenge the latin empire , by that time weakened by constant warfare in its european provinces at the battle of poimanenon in 1224 , the latin army was defeated , and by the next year emperor robert of courtenay was forced to cede all his asian possessions to nicaea , except for nicomedia and the territories directly across from constantinople unlike in asia , where the latin empire faced only an initially weak nicaea , in europe it was immediately confronted with a powerful enemy : the bulgarian tsar kaloyan emperor john iii doukas vatatzes of nicaea concluded an alliance with bulgaria , which in 1235 resulted in a joint campaign against the latin empire , and an unsuccessful siege of constantinople the same year in several senses , the only significant export on which the economy of the latin empire had any real basis was the sale of relics back to western europe which had been looted from greek churches timeline of the latin empire succession of the roman empire

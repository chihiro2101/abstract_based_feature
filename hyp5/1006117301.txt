much like the term '' byzantine '' , which was invented in the 16th century , '' latin empire '' was not a contemporary name used by or for the regime set up by the crusaders of the fourth crusade in constantinople instead , both terms were invented much later by historians seeking to differentiate between the classical period of the roman empire , the medieval period of the byzantine empire , and the late medieval latin empire , all of which called themselves '' roman '' the term '' latin '' has been used by these later historians because the crusaders ( franks , venetians , and other westerners ) were roman catholic and used latin as their liturgical and scholarly language the byzantines referred to the latin empire as the frankokratia ( φραγκοκρατία , lit '' rule of the franks '' ) or the latinokratia ( λατινοκρατία , lit founding treaties issued by the crusaders specifically refer to the empire as the imperium constantinopolitanum ( '' empire of constantinople '' ) it would have been difficult for the crusaders to justify referring to the empire as '' roman '' considering that western europe generally held the germanic holy roman empire to represent the legitimate roman empire nevertheless , the crusaders were well aware of the fact that constantinople was the capital of the roman empire and that the greek-speaking inhabitants of the empire saw themselves as romaioi ( romans ) the full title actually used by the first latin emperor , baldwin i , was balduinus dei gratia fidelissimus in christo imperator a deo coronatus romanorum moderator et semper augustus his title is a near perfect replication of the title used by byzantine emperor alexios iv angelos , placed on the throne by the crusaders previously , in a letter ( only known in its latin version ) to pope innocent iii : fidelis in christo imperator a deo coronatus romanorum moderator et semper augustus the term '' romania '' had been used unofficially by the population of the byzantine empire for their country for centuries wolff , '' romania : the latin empire of constantinople '' possession of the city itself was a key legitimizing factor that set the latin emperors apart from byzantine claimants in nicaea , trebizond and thessalonica the doge of venice did not rank as a vassal to the latin empire , but his position in control of three-eighths of its territory and of parts of constantinople itself ensured venice 's influence in the empire 's affairs the crowning of baldwin i ( 16 may 1204 ) and the establishment of the latin empire had the curious effect of creating five simultaneously existing entities claiming to be successors of the roman empire : the latin empire , the holy roman empire , and the three remnants of the byzantine empire , the despotate of epirus , the empire of nicaea , and the empire of trebizond distracted by the renewed war with nicaea , and waiting in vain for assistance from pope honorius iii and the king of france philip ii , the latin empire was unable to prevent the final fall of thessalonica to epirus in 1224 after the disastrous epirote defeat by the bulgarians at the battle of klokotnitsa , the epirote threat to the latin empire was removed , only to be replaced by nicaea , which started acquiring territories in greece emperor john iii doukas vatatzes of nicaea concluded an alliance with bulgaria , which in 1235 resulted in a joint campaign against the latin empire , and an unsuccessful siege of constantinople the same year the elite of the empire were the frankish and venetian lords , headed by the emperor , the barons and the lower-ranking vassals and liege lords , including many former byzantine aristocrats

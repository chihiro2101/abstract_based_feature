much like the term '' byzantine '' , which was invented in the 16th century , '' latin empire '' was not a contemporary name used by or for the regime set up by the crusaders of the fourth crusade in constantinople instead , both terms were invented much later by historians seeking to differentiate between the classical period of the roman empire , the medieval period of the byzantine empire , and the late medieval latin empire , all of which called themselves '' roman '' the term '' latin '' has been used by these later historians because the crusaders ( franks , venetians , and other westerners ) were roman catholic and used latin as their liturgical and scholarly language the byzantines referred to the latin empire as the frankokratia ( φραγκοκρατία , lit founding treaties issued by the crusaders specifically refer to the empire as the imperium constantinopolitanum ( '' empire of constantinople '' ) it would have been difficult for the crusaders to justify referring to the empire as '' roman '' considering that western europe generally held the germanic holy roman empire to represent the legitimate roman empire nevertheless , the crusaders were well aware of the fact that constantinople was the capital of the roman empire and that the greek-speaking inhabitants of the empire saw themselves as romaioi ( romans ) the term '' romania '' had been used unofficially by the population of the byzantine empire for their country for centuries wolff , '' romania : the latin empire of constantinople '' cambridge , england : cambridge university press usage of the title emperor of constantinople may not just have been to appease the pope and western europe , but might also have been used to legitimize the rule of the latin emperors in regards to the byzantines that they ruled possession of the city itself was a key legitimizing factor that set the latin emperors apart from byzantine claimants in nicaea , trebizond and thessalonica the term '' duchy '' in this case reflects the earlier byzantine use of the term thema , usually governed by a dux , to designate a province however , much of the former byzantine territory remained in the hands of rival successor states led by byzantine greek aristocrats , such as the despotate of epirus , the empire of nicaea , and the empire of trebizond , each bent on reconquest from the latins unlike in asia , where the latin empire faced only an initially weak nicaea , in europe it was immediately confronted with a powerful enemy : the bulgarian tsar kaloyan the latin empire was saved for a time by the threat posed to theodore by the bulgarian tsar ivan ii asen , and a truce was concluded in 1228 the empire 's precarious situation forced him to travel often to western europe seeking aid , but largely without success the empire was formed and administered on western european feudal principles , incorporating some elements of the byzantine bureaucracy timeline of the latin empire succession of the roman empire

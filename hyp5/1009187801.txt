the treaty of paris was signed on 30 march 1856 at the congress of paris with russia on one side of the negotiating table and france , britain , the ottoman empire and the kingdom of sardinia on the other side the treaty came about to resolve the crimean war , which had begun on 23 october 1853 , when the ottoman empire formally declared war on russia after it moved troops into the danubian principalities the western european alliance powers pledged to maintain the integrity of the ottoman empire and restored the respective territories of the russian and the ottoman empires to their pre-war boundaries they also demilitarised the black sea to improve trade , which greatly weakened russia 's influence in the region they gained the left bank of the mouth of the danube and part of bessarabia from russia as a result of the treaty even amongst the allies , disagreements between nations concerning the nature of the treaty created an uncertain peace , resulting in further diplomatic issues involving the ottoman empire , especially in terms of its relations with the russian empire and the concert of europe russian aims despite losing the war , the russians wanted to ensure that they attained the best possible outcome for the empire at the congress of paris there were problems throughout the empire , stretching from parts of finland to poland and crimea and many tribal conflicts , and the russian economy was on the brink of collapse 65–94 britain and france during the war britain and france resumed their latent rivalry , largely derived from the napoleonic wars the french blamed many of the defeats of the alliance on the fact that britain had marched into war without a clear plan britain and france desired to ensure that the ottoman empire were made stronger by the treaty of paris , ensuring a stable balance of power in europe britain and france hoped that peace and restricting russian access to key areas , such as the black sea , would allow the ottoman empire to focus on internal issues including rising nationalism in many nations under the empire 's authority without the ottomans being in full control of their empire , the great powers feared that it could lose much of its territory in future wars with the russian empire and the german confederation , eventually strengthening these nations that could pose a significant threat to the french and british 27–33 thus , the full removal of russian presence in the danubian provinces and the black sea served both to protect british dominance and to inhibit the russian empire from expanding its influence so readily russia was forced to abandon its claim to protect christians in the ottoman empire , which initially served as part of the pretext for the crimean war the defeat accentuated the impediments of the russian empire , contributing to future reform including the emancipation of the serfs and the spread of revolutionary ideas image : treaty of paris 1856 - 1.jpg treaty of paris : debates image : crimea_treaty_of_paris_medallion_war_peace_medallion_1856.jpg a medallion issued to celebrate the end of the crimean war and the treaty of paris , made from a soft , '' silver colour '' alloy the treaty reopened the black sea for international trade to be safe and effectual after both the naval warfare of the crimean war and the presence of russian warships had made trade difficult , including many trade disputes palabiyik , mustafa serdar , the emergence of the idea of ‘ internationallaw ’ in the ottoman empire before the treaty of paris ( 1856 ) , middle eastern studies , 50:2 , 2014 , 233-251 the treaty admitted the ottoman empire to the european concert , and the powers promised to respect its independence and territorial integrity '' the treaty of paris of 1856 and its execution , '' journal of modern history ( 1932 ) 4 3 pp 387–414 in jstor

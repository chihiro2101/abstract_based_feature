the treaty of paris was signed on 30 march 1856 at the congress of paris with russia on one side of the negotiating table and france , britain , the ottoman empire and the kingdom of sardinia on the other side the treaty came about to resolve the crimean war , which had begun on 23 october 1853 , when the ottoman empire formally declared war on russia after it moved troops into the danubian principalities the western european alliance powers pledged to maintain the integrity of the ottoman empire and restored the respective territories of the russian and the ottoman empires to their pre-war boundaries even amongst the allies , disagreements between nations concerning the nature of the treaty created an uncertain peace , resulting in further diplomatic issues involving the ottoman empire , especially in terms of its relations with the russian empire and the concert of europe also , mistrust between the french and british allies during the war effort compounded problems in formulating a comprehensive peace russian aims despite losing the war , the russians wanted to ensure that they attained the best possible outcome for the empire at the congress of paris russia knew that within a few months , a total defeat in the war was imminent , which would mean the complete humiliation of russia on an international scale , and further loss of territory peace talks were pursued by alexander ii with britain and france in paris in 1856 as a means of attempting to keep some imperial possession , but also of stopping the deaths of thousands of its army reserves as well as preventing an economic crisis allies in disarray : the messy end of the crimean war , history today , 58 , no britain and france desired to ensure that the ottoman empire were made stronger by the treaty of paris , ensuring a stable balance of power in europe britain and france hoped that peace and restricting russian access to key areas , such as the black sea , would allow the ottoman empire to focus on internal issues including rising nationalism in many nations under the empire 's authority without the ottomans being in full control of their empire , the great powers feared that it could lose much of its territory in future wars with the russian empire and the german confederation , eventually strengthening these nations that could pose a significant threat to the french and british 27â€“33 thus , the full removal of russian presence in the danubian provinces and the black sea served both to protect british dominance and to inhibit the russian empire from expanding its influence so readily peace was accelerated in part because the general population of the western allies had greater access to and understanding of political intrigue and foreign policy , and therefore demanded an end to the war nationalism was bolstered in many ways by the crimean war , and very little could be done at a systemic level to stem the tides of growing nationalist sentiment in many nations the ottoman empire , for the next few decades until world war i , had to face a number of patriotic uprisings in many of its provinces the ottomans joined the concert of europe after the peace was signed , but most european nations looked to the crumbling empire with either hungry or terrified eyes the importance of the ottoman empire to britain and france in maintaining the balance of power in the black and the mediterranean seas made many view the signing of the treaty of paris to be the entrance of the ottoman empire to the european international theatre greater penetration of european influence into ottoman international law and a decline in emphasis of islamic practices in their legal system illustrate more of an inclusion of the ottoman empire into european politics and disputes , leading to its major role in the first world war the treaty admitted the ottoman empire to the european concert , and the powers promised to respect its independence and territorial integrity peace of paris , 1856 : studies in war , diplomacy & peacemaking ( 1981 ) , 230 pp figes , orlando

the pudendal nerve passes between the piriformis muscle and coccygeus ( ischiococcygeus ) muscles and leaves the pelvis through the lower part of the greater sciatic foramen after reentering the pelvis , it accompanies the internal pudendal artery and internal pudendal vein upwards and forwards along the lateral wall of the ischiorectal fossa , being contained in a sheath of the obturator fascia termed the pudendal canal , along with the internal pudendal blood vessels inside the pudendal canal , the nerve divides into branches , first giving off the inferior rectal nerve , then the perineal nerve , before continuing as the dorsal nerve of the penis ( in males ) or the dorsal nerve of the clitoris ( in females ) for example , the pudendal nerve may actually originate in the sciatic nerve consequently , damage to the sciatic nerve can affect the pudendal nerve as well the pudendal nerve supplies sensation to the penis in males , and to the clitoris in females , which travels through the branches of both the dorsal nerve of the penis and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris pudendal nerve entrapment , also known as alcock canal syndrome , is very rare and is associated with professional cycling the pudendal canal is also known by the eponymous term '' alcock 's canal '' , after benjamin alcock , an irish anatomist who documented the canal in 1836 alcock documented the existence of the canal and pudendal nerve in a contribution about iliac arteries in robert bentley todd 's '' the cyclopaedia of anatomy and physiology '' '' diagnosis and treatment at www.nervemed.com www.pudendal.com pudendal nerve entrapment at chronicprostatitis.com ct sequence showing a pudendal nerve block .

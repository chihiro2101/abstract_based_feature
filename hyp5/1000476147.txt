the pudendal nerve is paired , meaning there are two nerves , one on the left and one on the right side of the body the pudendal nerve passes between the piriformis muscle and coccygeus ( ischiococcygeus ) muscles and leaves the pelvis through the lower part of the greater sciatic foramen inside the pudendal canal , the nerve divides into branches , first giving off the inferior rectal nerve , then the perineal nerve , before continuing as the dorsal nerve of the penis ( in males ) or the dorsal nerve of the clitoris ( in females ) for example , the pudendal nerve may actually originate in the sciatic nerve consequently , damage to the sciatic nerve can affect the pudendal nerve as well sometimes dorsal rami of the first sacral nerve contribute fibers to the pudendal nerve , and even more rarely the pudendal nerve supplies sensation to the penis in males , and to the clitoris in females , which travels through the branches of both the dorsal nerve of the penis and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris ( clarification : unlike the internal sphincter muscle , the external sphincter is made of skeletal muscle , therefore it is under voluntary control of the somatic nervous system the pudendal nerve is difficult to visualize on routine ct or mri , however under ct guidance , a needle may be placed adjacent to the pudendal neurovascular bundle '' diagnosis and treatment at www.nervemed.com www.pudendal.com pudendal nerve entrapment at chronicprostatitis.com ct sequence showing a pudendal nerve block .

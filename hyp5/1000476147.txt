the pudendal nerve is paired , meaning there are two nerves , one on the left and one on the right side of the body the pudendal nerve passes between the piriformis muscle and coccygeus ( ischiococcygeus ) muscles and leaves the pelvis through the lower part of the greater sciatic foramen inside the pudendal canal , the nerve divides into branches , first giving off the inferior rectal nerve , then the perineal nerve , before continuing as the dorsal nerve of the penis ( in males ) or the dorsal nerve of the clitoris ( in females ) consequently , damage to the sciatic nerve can affect the pudendal nerve as well the pudendal nerve has both motor and sensory functions the pudendal nerve supplies sensation to the penis in males , and to the clitoris in females , which travels through the branches of both the dorsal nerve of the penis and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris by providing sensation to the penis and the clitoris , the pudendal nerve is responsible for the afferent component of penile erection and clitoral erection a pudendal anesthesia , also known as a saddle nerve block , is a local anesthesia technique used in an obstetric procedure to anesthetize the perineum during labor the pudendal canal is also known by the eponymous term '' alcock 's canal '' , after benjamin alcock , an irish anatomist who documented the canal in 1836 '' diagnosis and treatment at www.nervemed.com www.pudendal.com pudendal nerve entrapment at chronicprostatitis.com ct sequence showing a pudendal nerve block .

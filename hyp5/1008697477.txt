'' tickets for some of her concerts were in such demand that barnum sold them by auction , and public enthusiasm was so strong that the press coined the term '' lind mania '' '' reading lind mania : print culture and the construction of nineteenth-century audiences '' , book history , vol 94–106 the blatant commercialism of barnum 's ticket auctions distressed lind , and she persuaded him to make a substantial number of tickets available at reduced prices '' jenny lind 's progress in america '' , the observer , october 6 , 1850 , p barnum presents jenny lind – the american tour of the swedish nightingale '' , louisiana history : the journal of the louisiana historical association , vol by early 1851 , lind had become uncomfortable with barnum 's relentless marketing of the tour , and she invoked a contractual right to sever her ties with him he organized flower shows , beauty contests , dog shows , and poultry contests , but the most popular were baby contests such as the fattest baby or the handsomest twins in 1853 , he started the pictorial weekly newspaper illustrated news ; he completed his autobiography a year later which sold more than a million copies over the course of numerous revisions in the early 1850s , barnum began investing to develop east bridgeport , connecticut but tom thumb offered his services , as he was touring on his own , and the two undertook another european tour barnum also started a lecture tour , mostly as a temperance speaker in 1862 , he discovered giantess anna swan and commodore nutt , a new tom thumb with whom barnum visited president abraham lincoln at the white house barnum re-established it at another location in new york city , but this also was destroyed by fire in march 1868 the loss was too great the second time , and barnum retired from the museum business barnum did not enter the circus business until he was 60 years old barnum persisted in growing the circus in spite of more fires , train disasters , and other setbacks , and he was aided by circus professionals who ran the daily operations he and bailey split up in 1885 , but they came back together in 1888 with the '' barnum & bailey greatest show on earth '' , later '' barnum & bailey circus '' which toured the world in this new industry , barnum leaned more on the advice of his partners , most of whom were young enough to be his sons however , he was contemptuous of those who made money through fraud , especially the spiritualist mediums popular in his day ; he testified against noted '' spirit photographer '' william h he mainly focused on race , slavery , and sectionalism in the period leading up to the american civil war he spread lies about her age and her occupation , then encouraged her death by telling people that an autopsy would reveal her true age -- - > he opposed the kansas–nebraska act of 1854 , which supported slavery , so he left the democratic party which endorsed slavery and became part of the new anti-slavery republican party barnum claimed that '' politics were always distasteful to me '' , yet he was elected to the connecticut legislature in 1865 as republican representative for fairfield and served four terms he said during the ratification of the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution : '' a human soul , 'that god has created and christ died for , ' is not to be trifled with barnum ( 1980 ) – broadway musical based on barnum 's life , with jim dale in the title role the great and only barnum ; the tremendous , stupendous life of showman p barnum – the lost legend '' documentary an 1890 recording of barnum 's voice marina mansion tribute to ringling bros.and barnum & bailey circus by brothers charles elias disney & daniel h

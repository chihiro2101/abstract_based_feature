barnum was born in bethel , connecticut , the son of innkeeper , tailor , and store-keeper philo barnum ( 1778–1826 ) and his second wife irene taylor barnum had several businesses over the years , including a general store , a book auctioning trade , real estate speculation , and a statewide lottery network he began his career as a showman in 1835 when he was 25 with the purchase and exhibition of a blind and almost completely paralyzed slave woman named joice heth , whom an acquaintance was trumpeting around philadelphia as george washington 's former nurse and 161 years old slavery was already outlawed in new york , but he exploited a loophole which allowed him to lease her for a year for 1,000 , borrowing 500 to complete the sale barnum had worked her for 10 to 12 hours a day , and he hosted a live autopsy of her body in a new york saloon where spectators paid 50 cents to see the dead woman cut up , as he revealed that she was likely half her purported age barnum had a year of mixed success with his first variety troupe called '' barnum 's grand scientific and musical theater '' , followed by the panic of 1837 and three years of difficult circumstances he purchased barnum 's american museum in 1841 , located at broadway and ann street , new york city he improved the attraction , upgrading the building and adding exhibits , then renamed it '' barnum 's american museum '' ; it became a popular showplace fiji mermaid and tom thumb in 1842 , barnum introduced his first major hoax : a creature with the body of a monkey and the tail of a fish known as the fiji mermaid '' barnum 's last laugh ? general tom thumb 's wedding cake in the library of congress '' he followed the mermaid by exhibiting charles stratton , the little person called '' general tom thumb '' ( '' the smallest person that ever walked alone '' ) who was then four years old but was stated to be 11 during 1844–45 , he toured with general tom thumb in europe and met queen victoria , who was amused but saddened by the little man , and the event was a publicity coup it opened the door to visits from royalty throughout europe , including the tsar of russia , and enabled barnum to acquire dozens of new attractions , including automatons and other mechanical marvels during this time , he went on a spending spree and bought other museums , including artist rembrandt peale 's museum in philadelphia , the nation 's first major museum barnum became aware of the popularity of jenny lind , the '' swedish nightingale '' , during his european tour with tom thumb when her career was at its height in europe 437–48 but he approached her to sing in america at 1,000 a night for 150 nights , all expenses paid by him lind demanded the fee in advance and barnum agreed ; this permitted her to raise a fund for charities , principally endowing schools for poor children in sweden the press was also in attendance , and '' jenny lind items '' were available to buy when she realized how much money barnum stood to make from the tour , she insisted on a new agreement which he signed on september 3 , 1850 the tour began with a concert at castle garden on september 11 , 1850 , and it was a major success , recouping barnum four times his investment so god save jenny lind ! '' tickets for some of her concerts were in such demand that barnum sold them by auction , and public enthusiasm was so strong that the press coined the term '' lind mania '' 3 on the tour , barnum 's publicity always preceded lind 's arrival and whipped up enthusiasm ; he had up to 26 journalists on his payroll barnum presents jenny lind – the american tour of the swedish nightingale '' , louisiana history : the journal of the louisiana historical association , vol 208–09 after new york , the company toured the east coast with continued success , and later went through the southern states and cuba he wanted to position theaters as palaces of edification and delight , and as respectable middle-class entertainment he followed that with melodramas , farces , and historical plays put on by highly regarded actors he watered down shakespearean plays and others such as uncle tom 's cabin to make them family entertainment in 1853 , he started the pictorial weekly newspaper illustrated news ; he completed his autobiography a year later which sold more than a million copies over the course of numerous revisions he made substantial loans to the jerome clock company to get it to move to his new industrial area , but the company went bankrupt by 1856 , taking barnum 's wealth with it ralph waldo emerson proclaimed that barnum 's downfall showed '' the gods visible again '' and other critics celebrated barnum 's public dilemma by 1860 , he emerged from debt and built a mansion which he called '' lindencroft '' , and he resumed ownership of his museum the collections expanded to four buildings , and he published a '' guide book to the museum '' which claimed 850,000 '' curiosities '' they also appeared at barnum 's museum for six weeks also in 1860 , barnum introduced '' man-monkey '' william henry johnson , a microcephalic black little person who spoke a mysterious language created by barnum in 1862 , he discovered giantess anna swan and commodore nutt , a new tom thumb with whom barnum visited president abraham lincoln at the white house during the civil war , his museum drew large audiences seeking diversion from the conflict barnum re-established it at another location in new york city , but this also was destroyed by fire in march 1868 barnum 's grand traveling museum , menagerie , caravan & hippodrome '' in delavan , wisconsin , in 1870 with william cameron coup ; it was a traveling circus , menagerie , and museum of '' freaks '' hutchinson , soon shortened to '' barnum & bailey 's '' the barnum and bailey circus still contained acts similar to his traveling menagerie , including acrobats , freak shows , and general tom thumb barnum persisted in growing the circus in spite of more fires , train disasters , and other setbacks , and he was aided by circus professionals who ran the daily operations given the lack of paved highways in america at that time , this turned out to be a shrewd decision that vastly expanded barnum 's geographical reach he spread lies about her age and her occupation , then encouraged her death by telling people that an autopsy would reveal her true age -- - > he opposed the kansas–nebraska act of 1854 , which supported slavery , so he left the democratic party which endorsed slavery and became part of the new anti-slavery republican party barnum claimed that '' politics were always distasteful to me '' , yet he was elected to the connecticut legislature in 1865 as republican representative for fairfield and served four terms it may tenant the body of a chinaman , a turk , an arab or a hottentot—it is still an immortal spirit barnum 's genealogy at the barnum family genealogy website the barnum museum barnum 's circus affiliation p an 1890 recording of barnum 's voice marina mansion tribute to ringling bros.and barnum & bailey circus by brothers charles elias disney & daniel h

in parallel to the rise and fall of hilbert 's program , the foundations of structural proof theory were being founded jan łukasiewicz suggested in 1926 that one could improve on hilbert systems as a basis for the axiomatic presentation of logic if one allowed the drawing of conclusions from assumptions in the inference rules of the logic and went on to make fundamental advances in the formalisation of intuitionistic logic , and provide the first combinatorial proof of the consistency of peano arithmetic together , the presentation of natural deduction and the sequent calculus introduced the fundamental idea of analytic proof to proof theory structural proof theory is the subdiscipline of proof theory that studies the specifics of proof calculi proof theorists are typically interested in proof calculi that support a notion of analytic proof the notion of analytic proof was introduced by gentzen for the sequent calculus ; there the analytic proofs are those that are cut-free gentzen 's natural deduction calculus also supports a notion of analytic proof , as shown by dag prawitz the ability to transform a proof system into a focused form is a good indication of its syntactic quality , in a manner similar to how admissibility of cut shows that a proof system is syntactically consistent other research topics in structural theory include analytic tableau , which apply the central idea of analytic proof from structural proof theory to provide decision procedures and semi-decision procedures for a wide range of logics , and the proof theory of substructural logics ordinal analysis is a powerful technique for providing combinatorial consistency proofs for subsystems of arithmetic , analysis , and set theory gödel 's second incompleteness theorem is often interpreted as demonstrating that finitistic consistency proofs are impossible for theories of sufficient strength gödel 's second incompleteness theorem implies that the well-foundedness of such an ordinal can not be proved in the theory t ordinal analysis was originated by gentzen , who proved the consistency of peano arithmetic using transfinite induction up to ordinal ε 0 ordinal analysis has been extended to many fragments of first and second order arithmetic and set theory that is , the propositional theory of provability in peano arithmetic is completely represented by the modal logic gl the goal of reverse mathematics , however , is to study possible axioms of ordinary theorems of mathematics rather than possible axioms for set theory the first proof shows t is provable from s ; this is an ordinary mathematical proof along with a justification that it can be carried out in the system s functional interpretations also provide a way to extract constructive information from proofs in the reduced theory the informal proofs of everyday mathematical practice are unlike the formal proofs of proof theory intermediate logic model theory proof ( truth ) proof techniques

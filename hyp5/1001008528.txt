the failure of the program was induced by kurt gödel 's incompleteness theorems , which showed that any ω-consistent theory that is sufficiently strong to express certain simple arithmetic truths , can not prove its own consistency , which on gödel 's formulation is a \pi^0_1 sentence however , modified versions of hilbert 's program emerged and research has been carried out on related topics this has led , in particular , to : refinement of gödel 's result , particularly j in parallel to the rise and fall of hilbert 's program , the foundations of structural proof theory were being founded and went on to make fundamental advances in the formalisation of intuitionistic logic , and provide the first combinatorial proof of the consistency of peano arithmetic together , the presentation of natural deduction and the sequent calculus introduced the fundamental idea of analytic proof to proof theory structural proof theory is the subdiscipline of proof theory that studies the specifics of proof calculi proof theorists are typically interested in proof calculi that support a notion of analytic proof more exotic proof calculi such as jean-yves girard 's proof nets also support a notion of analytic proof other research topics in structural theory include analytic tableau , which apply the central idea of analytic proof from structural proof theory to provide decision procedures and semi-decision procedures for a wide range of logics , and the proof theory of substructural logics ordinal analysis is a powerful technique for providing combinatorial consistency proofs for subsystems of arithmetic , analysis , and set theory gödel 's second incompleteness theorem implies that the well-foundedness of such an ordinal can not be proved in the theory t ordinal analysis was originated by gentzen , who proved the consistency of peano arithmetic using transfinite induction up to ordinal ε 0 that is , the propositional theory of provability in peano arithmetic is completely represented by the modal logic gl reverse mathematics is a program in mathematical logic that seeks to determine which axioms are required to prove theorems of mathematics the goal of reverse mathematics , however , is to study possible axioms of ordinary theorems of mathematics rather than possible axioms for set theory research in reverse mathematics often incorporates methods and techniques from recursion theory as well as proof theory second , one reduces the intuitionistic theory i to a quantifier free theory of functionals f an informal proof in the mathematics literature , by contrast , requires weeks of peer review to be checked , and may still contain errors intermediate logic model theory proof ( truth ) proof techniques the development of proof theory

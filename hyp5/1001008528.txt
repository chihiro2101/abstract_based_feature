the failure of the program was induced by kurt gödel 's incompleteness theorems , which showed that any ω-consistent theory that is sufficiently strong to express certain simple arithmetic truths , can not prove its own consistency , which on gödel 's formulation is a \pi^0_1 sentence in parallel to the rise and fall of hilbert 's program , the foundations of structural proof theory were being founded and went on to make fundamental advances in the formalisation of intuitionistic logic , and provide the first combinatorial proof of the consistency of peano arithmetic together , the presentation of natural deduction and the sequent calculus introduced the fundamental idea of analytic proof to proof theory structural proof theory is the subdiscipline of proof theory that studies the specifics of proof calculi proof theorists are typically interested in proof calculi that support a notion of analytic proof the notion of analytic proof was introduced by gentzen for the sequent calculus ; there the analytic proofs are those that are cut-free this allows one to show consistency of the sequent calculus easily ; if the empty sequent were derivable it would have to be a subformula of some premise , which it is not gentzen 's midsequent theorem , the craig interpolation theorem , and herbrand 's theorem also follow as corollaries of the cut-elimination theorem more exotic proof calculi such as jean-yves girard 's proof nets also support a notion of analytic proof the ability to transform a proof system into a focused form is a good indication of its syntactic quality , in a manner similar to how admissibility of cut shows that a proof system is syntactically consistent structural proof theory is connected to type theory by means of the curry–howard correspondence , which observes a structural analogy between the process of normalisation in the natural deduction calculus and beta reduction in the typed lambda calculus ordinal analysis is a powerful technique for providing combinatorial consistency proofs for subsystems of arithmetic , analysis , and set theory for a consistent recursively axiomatized theory t , one can prove in finitistic arithmetic that the well-foundedness of a certain transfinite ordinal implies the consistency of t gödel 's second incompleteness theorem implies that the well-foundedness of such an ordinal can not be proved in the theory t consequences of ordinal analysis include ( 1 ) consistency of subsystems of classical second order arithmetic and set theory relative to constructive theories , ( 2 ) combinatorial independence results , and ( 3 ) classifications of provably total recursive functions and provably well-founded ordinals ordinal analysis was originated by gentzen , who proved the consistency of peano arithmetic using transfinite induction up to ordinal ε 0 as basic axioms of the provability logic gl ( gödel-löb ) , which captures provable in peano arithmetic , one takes modal analogues of the hilbert-bernays derivability conditions and löb 's theorem ( if it is provable that the provability of a implies a , then a is provable ) the reverse mathematics program was foreshadowed by results in set theory such as the classical theorem that the axiom of choice and zorn 's lemma are equivalent over zf set theory together with the double-negation interpretation of classical logic in intuitionistic logic , it provides a reduction of classical arithmetic to intuitionistic arithmetic intermediate logic model theory proof ( truth ) proof techniques

the failure of the program was induced by kurt gödel 's incompleteness theorems , which showed that any ω-consistent theory that is sufficiently strong to express certain simple arithmetic truths , can not prove its own consistency , which on gödel 's formulation is a \pi^0_1 sentence in parallel to the rise and fall of hilbert 's program , the foundations of structural proof theory were being founded together , the presentation of natural deduction and the sequent calculus introduced the fundamental idea of analytic proof to proof theory structural proof theory is the subdiscipline of proof theory that studies the specifics of proof calculi proof theorists are typically interested in proof calculi that support a notion of analytic proof gentzen 's natural deduction calculus also supports a notion of analytic proof , as shown by dag prawitz more exotic proof calculi such as jean-yves girard 's proof nets also support a notion of analytic proof structural proof theory is connected to type theory by means of the curry–howard correspondence , which observes a structural analogy between the process of normalisation in the natural deduction calculus and beta reduction in the typed lambda calculus this provides the foundation for the intuitionistic type theory developed by per martin-löf , and is often extended to a three way correspondence , the third leg of which are the cartesian closed category for a consistent recursively axiomatized theory t , one can prove in finitistic arithmetic that the well-foundedness of a certain transfinite ordinal implies the consistency of t ordinal analysis was originated by gentzen , who proved the consistency of peano arithmetic using transfinite induction up to ordinal ε 0 ordinal analysis has been extended to many fragments of first and second order arithmetic and set theory the first breakthrough in this direction was takeuti 's proof of the consistency of π-ca 0 using the method of ordinal diagrams some of the basic results concerning the incompleteness of peano arithmetic and related theories have analogues in provability logic the reverse mathematics program was foreshadowed by results in set theory such as the classical theorem that the axiom of choice and zorn 's lemma are equivalent over zf set theory the goal of reverse mathematics , however , is to study possible axioms of ordinary theorems of mathematics rather than possible axioms for set theory research in reverse mathematics often incorporates methods and techniques from recursion theory as well as proof theory first , one '' reduces '' a classical theory c to an intuitionistic one i second , one reduces the intuitionistic theory i to a quantifier free theory of functionals f intermediate logic model theory proof ( truth ) proof techniques the development of proof theory

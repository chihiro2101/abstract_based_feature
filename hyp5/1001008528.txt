although the formalisation of logic was much advanced by the work of such figures as gottlob frege , giuseppe peano , bertrand russell , and richard dedekind , the story of modern proof theory is often seen as being established by david hilbert , who initiated what is called hilbert 's program in the foundations of mathematics the failure of the program was induced by kurt gödel 's incompleteness theorems , which showed that any ω-consistent theory that is sufficiently strong to express certain simple arithmetic truths , can not prove its own consistency , which on gödel 's formulation is a \pi^0_1 sentence in parallel to the rise and fall of hilbert 's program , the foundations of structural proof theory were being founded . gentzen ( 1934 ) further introduced the idea of the sequent calculus , a calculus advanced in a similar spirit that better expressed the duality of the logical connectives , girard , lafont , and taylor ( 1988 ) and went on to make fundamental advances in the formalisation of intuitionistic logic , and provide the first combinatorial proof of the consistency of peano arithmetic together , the presentation of natural deduction and the sequent calculus introduced the fundamental idea of analytic proof to proof theory structural proof theory is the subdiscipline of proof theory that studies the specifics of proof calculi proof theorists are typically interested in proof calculi that support a notion of analytic proof much of the interest in cut-free proofs comes from the subformula property : every formula in the end sequent of a cut-free proof is a subformula of one of the premises gentzen 's natural deduction calculus also supports a notion of analytic proof , as shown by dag prawitz more exotic proof calculi such as jean-yves girard 's proof nets also support a notion of analytic proof other research topics in structural theory include analytic tableau , which apply the central idea of analytic proof from structural proof theory to provide decision procedures and semi-decision procedures for a wide range of logics , and the proof theory of substructural logics ordinal analysis is a powerful technique for providing combinatorial consistency proofs for subsystems of arithmetic , analysis , and set theory for a consistent recursively axiomatized theory t , one can prove in finitistic arithmetic that the well-foundedness of a certain transfinite ordinal implies the consistency of t gödel 's second incompleteness theorem implies that the well-foundedness of such an ordinal can not be proved in the theory t consequences of ordinal analysis include ( 1 ) consistency of subsystems of classical second order arithmetic and set theory relative to constructive theories , ( 2 ) combinatorial independence results , and ( 3 ) classifications of provably total recursive functions and provably well-founded ordinals the reverse mathematics program was foreshadowed by results in set theory such as the classical theorem that the axiom of choice and zorn 's lemma are equivalent over zf set theory research in reverse mathematics often incorporates methods and techniques from recursion theory as well as proof theory together with the double-negation interpretation of classical logic in intuitionistic logic , it provides a reduction of classical arithmetic to intuitionistic arithmetic the informal proofs of everyday mathematical practice are unlike the formal proofs of proof theory intermediate logic model theory proof ( truth ) proof techniques

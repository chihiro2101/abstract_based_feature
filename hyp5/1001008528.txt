the failure of the program was induced by kurt gödel 's incompleteness theorems , which showed that any ω-consistent theory that is sufficiently strong to express certain simple arithmetic truths , can not prove its own consistency , which on gödel 's formulation is a \pi^0_1 sentence jan łukasiewicz suggested in 1926 that one could improve on hilbert systems as a basis for the axiomatic presentation of logic if one allowed the drawing of conclusions from assumptions in the inference rules of the logic and went on to make fundamental advances in the formalisation of intuitionistic logic , and provide the first combinatorial proof of the consistency of peano arithmetic together , the presentation of natural deduction and the sequent calculus introduced the fundamental idea of analytic proof to proof theory structural proof theory is the subdiscipline of proof theory that studies the specifics of proof calculi proof theorists are typically interested in proof calculi that support a notion of analytic proof gentzen 's natural deduction calculus also supports a notion of analytic proof , as shown by dag prawitz more exotic proof calculi such as jean-yves girard 's proof nets also support a notion of analytic proof the ability to transform a proof system into a focused form is a good indication of its syntactic quality , in a manner similar to how admissibility of cut shows that a proof system is syntactically consistent structural proof theory is connected to type theory by means of the curry–howard correspondence , which observes a structural analogy between the process of normalisation in the natural deduction calculus and beta reduction in the typed lambda calculus other research topics in structural theory include analytic tableau , which apply the central idea of analytic proof from structural proof theory to provide decision procedures and semi-decision procedures for a wide range of logics , and the proof theory of substructural logics for a consistent recursively axiomatized theory t , one can prove in finitistic arithmetic that the well-foundedness of a certain transfinite ordinal implies the consistency of t gödel 's second incompleteness theorem implies that the well-foundedness of such an ordinal can not be proved in the theory t consequences of ordinal analysis include ( 1 ) consistency of subsystems of classical second order arithmetic and set theory relative to constructive theories , ( 2 ) combinatorial independence results , and ( 3 ) classifications of provably total recursive functions and provably well-founded ordinals ordinal analysis has been extended to many fragments of first and second order arithmetic and set theory its defining method can be described as '' going backwards from the theorems to the axioms '' , in contrast to the ordinary mathematical practice of deriving theorems from axioms the goal of reverse mathematics , however , is to study possible axioms of ordinary theorems of mathematics rather than possible axioms for set theory the second proof , known as a reversal , shows that t itself implies s ; this proof is carried out in the base system the informal proofs of everyday mathematical practice are unlike the formal proofs of proof theory intermediate logic model theory proof ( truth ) proof techniques the development of proof theory

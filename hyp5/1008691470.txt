the extra digit is most common on the ulnar ( little finger ) side of the hand , less common on the radial ( thumb ) side , and very rarely within the middle three digits these are respectively known as postaxial ( little finger ) , preaxial ( thumb ) , and central ( ring , middle , index fingers ) polydactyly the extra digit is most commonly an abnormal fork in an existing digit , or it may rarely originate at the wrist as a normal digit does because there is an association between polydactyly and several syndromes , children with a congenital upper extremity deformity should be examined by a geneticist for other congenital anomalies polydactyly has been associated with 39 genetic mutations this is the most common situation , in which the extra digit is on the ulnar side of the hand , thus the side of the little finger radial polydactyly refers to the presence of an extra digit ( or extra digits ) on the radial side of the hand this is a very rare situation , in which the extra digit is on the ring , middle or index finger polydactyly is associated with different mutations , either mutations in a gene itself or in a cis-regulatory element responsible for the expression of a specific gene in addition to the study of genetic causes of polydactyly limb patterning models are used to simulate the congenital disorder at the limb , being able to explain the development paths of polydactyly polydactyly can occur by itself , or more commonly , as one feature of a syndrome of congenital anomalies typically the mutated gene is involved in developmental patterning , and a syndrome of congenital anomalies results , of which polydactyly is one feature or two

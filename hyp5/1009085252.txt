the economics and sociology thorstein veblen ( 1857–1929 ) introduced the term '' conspicuous consumption '' in 1899 in his book the theory of the leisure class ( 1899 ) theory of the leisure class : an economic study in the evolution of institutions in that nineteenth-century social and historical context , the term '' conspicuous consumption '' applied narrowly in association with the men , women , and families of the upper class who applied their great wealth as a means of publicly manifesting their social power and prestige , either real or perceived in the twentieth century the significant improvement of the material standard of living of societies and the consequent growth of the middle class saw the term '' conspicuous consumption '' broadly applied to the men , women , and households who possessed the discretionary income that allowed them to practice the patterns of economic consumerism—of goods and services—which were motivated by the desire for prestige , the public display of social status , rather than by the intrinsic , practical utility of the goods and the services proper in the 1920s economists , such as paul nystrom ( 1878–1969 ) , proposed that changes in the style of life , made feasible by the economics of the industrial age , had induced in the mass of society a '' philosophy of futility '' that would increase the consumption of goods and services as a social fashion – i.e an activity done for its own sake in that context , commentators discuss '' conspicuous consumption '' either as a behavioural addiction or as a narcissism , or as both , emphasising the psychological conditions induced by consumerism—the desire for the immediate gratification of hedonic expectations under veblen 's theory , conspicuous consumption was theorized to comprise socio-economic behaviours practiced by high wealth or high-income people danko reported that americans with a net worth of more than one million dollars are likely to avoid conspicuous consumption , and that millionaires tend to practice frugality—for example , preferring to buy used cars with cash rather than new cars with credit , in order to avoid material depreciation and paying interest for a loan to buy a new car conspicuous compassion , the practice of publicly donating large sums of money to charity to enhance the reputation of the donor , is sometimes described as a type of conspicuous consumption as proposed by thorstein veblen in the 19th century , conspicuous consumption explains the psychological mechanics of a consumer society , and the increase in the number and the types of the goods and services that people consider necessary to and for their lives in a developed economy each variant interpretation and complementary explanation is derived from thorstein veblen 's original sociologic proposition in the theory of the leisure class : that conspicuous consumption is a psychological end in itself , from which the practitioner ( man , woman , family ) derived the honour of superior social status trigg defined conspicuous consumption as the behaviours whereby a man or a woman can display great wealth , by means of idleness—expending much time in the practice of leisure activities , and spending much money to consume luxury goods and services station wagon ) , as a form of psychologically comforting conspicuous consumption , because such big motor-vehicles usually are bought by people who reside in a city , an urban nuclear family in a later study , o'cass and frost determined that , as sociologic constructs , the terms '' status consumption '' and '' conspicuous consumption '' denote different sociologic behaviours because the activity of conspicuous consumption , itself , is a form of superior good , diminishing the income inequality of the income distribution by way of an egalitarian policy reduces the conspicuous consumption of positional goods and services

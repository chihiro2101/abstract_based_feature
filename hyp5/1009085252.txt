the economics and sociology thorstein veblen ( 1857–1929 ) introduced the term '' conspicuous consumption '' in 1899 in his book the theory of the leisure class veblen described the behavioural characteristics of the nouveau riche ( new rich ) social class which emerged as a result of capital accumulation during the second industrial revolution 1860–1914 ) ( 1899 ) theory of the leisure class : an economic study in the evolution of institutions in that nineteenth-century social and historical context , the term '' conspicuous consumption '' applied narrowly in association with the men , women , and families of the upper class who applied their great wealth as a means of publicly manifesting their social power and prestige , either real or perceived under veblen 's theory , conspicuous consumption was theorized to comprise socio-economic behaviours practiced by high wealth or high-income people more recent economic research indicated that conspicuous consumption is in fact less common among the affluent and more common among lower-income groups , regardless of racial or ethnic background , and also common to the societies of countries with emerging markets : '' it signals that the owner came from a poor group and has something to prove conspicuous compassion , the practice of publicly donating large sums of money to charity to enhance the reputation of the donor , is sometimes described as a type of conspicuous consumption as proposed by thorstein veblen in the 19th century , conspicuous consumption explains the psychological mechanics of a consumer society , and the increase in the number and the types of the goods and services that people consider necessary to and for their lives in a developed economy supporting interpretations and explanations of contemporary conspicuous consumption are presented in consumer culture ( 1996 ) , by c each variant interpretation and complementary explanation is derived from thorstein veblen 's original sociologic proposition in the theory of the leisure class : that conspicuous consumption is a psychological end in itself , from which the practitioner ( man , woman , family ) derived the honour of superior social status definitions – the term conspicuous consumption denotes the act of buying many things , especially expensive things , that are not necessary to one 's life , done in a way that makes people notice the buyer 's having bought the merchandise trigg defined conspicuous consumption as the behaviours whereby a man or a woman can display great wealth , by means of idleness—expending much time in the practice of leisure activities , and spending much money to consume luxury goods and services decades later , in the year 2000 , that practice of conspicuous consumption resulted in people buying houses that were double the average size needed to comfortably house a nuclear family a luxury tax applied to goods and services for conspicuous consumption is a type of progressive sales tax that at least partially corrects the negative externality associated with the conspicuous consumption of positional goods frank proposed the application of a progressive consumption tax ; in the article '' the big city : rich and poor , consumed by consuming '' ( 1998 ) , john tierney said that as a remedy for the social and psychological malaise that is conspicuous consumption , the personal income tax should be replaced with a progressive tax upon the yearly sum of discretionary income spent on the conspicuous consumption of goods and services because the activity of conspicuous consumption , itself , is a form of superior good , diminishing the income inequality of the income distribution by way of an egalitarian policy reduces the conspicuous consumption of positional goods and services

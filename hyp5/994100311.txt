meyer and allen 's ( 1991 ) three-component model of commitment was created to argue that commitment has three different components that correspond with different psychological states meyer and allen created this model for two reasons : first '' aid in the interpretation of existing research '' and second '' to serve as a framework for future research '' their study was based mainly around previous studies of organizational commitment meyer and allen 's research indicated that there are three '' mind sets '' which can characterize an employee 's commitment to the organization mercurio ( 2015 ) extended this model by reviewing the empirical and theoretical studies on organizational commitment mercurio posits that emotional , or affective commitment is the core essence of organizational commitment affective commitment is defined as the employee 's positive emotional attachment to the organization meyer and allen pegged ac as the '' desire '' component of organizational commitment '' affective commitment was found to be an enduring , demonstrably indispensable , and central characteristic of organizational commitment '' the individual commits to and remains with an organization because of feelings of obligation , the last component of organizational commitment normative commitment in employees is also high where employees regularly see visible examples of the employer being committed to employee well-being an employee with greater organizational commitment has a greater chance of contributing to organizational success and will also experience higher levels of job satisfaction meyer and allen based their research in this area more on theoretical evidence rather than empirical , which may explain the lack of depth in this section of their study compared to the others in a sense the model describes why people should stay with the organization whether it is because they want to , need to , or ought to they believe the studies should return to the original understanding of organizational commitment as an attitude toward the organization and measure it accordingly more recently , scholars have proposed a five component model of commitment , though it has been developed in the context of product and service consumption this model proposes habitual and forced commitment as two additional dimensions which are very germane in consumption settings it seems , however , that habitual commitment or inertial may also become relevant in many job settings role conflict and ambiguity have been proposed as determining factors of workers ' job satisfaction and organizational commitment the study also found that job satisfaction and organizational commitment were highly correlated with being a permanent worker john meyer responded to this gap by proposing a model of organizational change commitment

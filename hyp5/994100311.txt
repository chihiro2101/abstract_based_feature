meyer and allen 's ( 1991 ) three-component model of commitment was created to argue that commitment has three different components that correspond with different psychological states their study was based mainly around previous studies of organizational commitment meyer and allen 's research indicated that there are three '' mind sets '' which can characterize an employee 's commitment to the organization mercurio ( 2015 ) extended this model by reviewing the empirical and theoretical studies on organizational commitment mercurio posits that emotional , or affective commitment is the core essence of organizational commitment '' affective commitment was found to be an enduring , demonstrably indispensable , and central characteristic of organizational commitment '' '' side bets '' , or investments , are the gains and losses that may occur should an individual stay or leave an organization the individual commits to and remains with an organization because of feelings of obligation , the last component of organizational commitment for example , the organization may have invested resources in training an employee who then feels a 'moral ' obligation to put forth effort on the job and stay with the organization to 'repay the debt ' it may also reflect an internalized norm , developed before the person joins the organization through family or other socialization processes , that one should be loyal to one 's organization an employee with greater organizational commitment has a greater chance of contributing to organizational success and will also experience higher levels of job satisfaction high levels of job satisfaction , in turn , reduces employee turnover and increases the organization 's ability to recruit and retain talent attitude toward a target ( the organization ) is obviously applicable to a wider range of behaviors than an attitude toward a specific behavior ( staying ) this model proposes habitual and forced commitment as two additional dimensions which are very germane in consumption settings people get habituated to a job—the routine , the processes , the cognitive schemas associated with a job can make people develop a latent commitment to the job—just as it may occur in a consumption setting much of the literature on the relationship between commitment and satisfaction with one 's job indicates that if employees are satisfied they develop stronger commitment to their work a study conducted by dirani and kuchinke produced results indicating a strong correlation between job commitment and job satisfaction and that satisfaction was a reliable predictor of commitment taking cultural context into consideration , the study still showed a positive correlation between empowerment and job satisfaction/commitment focused on the impact of the distribution of leadership and leadership support among teachers and how that affected job satisfaction and commitment previously held beliefs about job satisfaction and commitment among teachers was that they were negatively correlated with absenteeism and turnover and positively correlated with job effort and job performance the study found that when leadership was distributed by the 'leader ' out to the teachers as well workers reported higher job satisfaction and organizational commitment than when most of the leadership fell to one person

meyer and allen 's ( 1991 ) three-component model of commitment was created to argue that commitment has three different components that correspond with different psychological states their study was based mainly around previous studies of organizational commitment meyer and allen 's research indicated that there are three '' mind sets '' which can characterize an employee 's commitment to the organization mercurio ( 2015 ) extended this model by reviewing the empirical and theoretical studies on organizational commitment mercurio posits that emotional , or affective commitment is the core essence of organizational commitment meyer and allen pegged ac as the '' desire '' component of organizational commitment this commitment can be influenced by many different demographic characteristics : age , tenure , sex , and education but these influences are neither strong nor consistent '' affective commitment was found to be an enduring , demonstrably indispensable , and central characteristic of organizational commitment '' continuance commitment is the '' need '' component or the gains versus losses of working in an organization the individual commits to and remains with an organization because of feelings of obligation , the last component of organizational commitment an employee with greater organizational commitment has a greater chance of contributing to organizational success and will also experience higher levels of job satisfaction high levels of job satisfaction , in turn , reduces employee turnover and increases the organization 's ability to recruit and retain talent meyer and allen based their research in this area more on theoretical evidence rather than empirical , which may explain the lack of depth in this section of their study compared to the others in a sense the model describes why people should stay with the organization whether it is because they want to , need to , or ought to this observation backs up their conclusion that organizational commitment is perceived by tcm as combining different target attitudes and behavioral attitudes , which they believe to be both confusing and logically incorrect that is that affective commitment has stronger associations with relevant behavior and a wider range of behaviors , compared to normative and continuance commitment it seems , however , that habitual commitment or inertial may also become relevant in many job settings participants were tested in the areas of ; perceiving a calling , job satisfaction , and job commitment role conflict and ambiguity have been proposed as determining factors of workers ' job satisfaction and organizational commitment the study also found that job satisfaction and organizational commitment were highly correlated with being a permanent worker john meyer responded to this gap by proposing a model of organizational change commitment

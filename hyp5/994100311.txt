meyer and allen 's ( 1991 ) three-component model of commitment was created to argue that commitment has three different components that correspond with different psychological states meyer and allen created this model for two reasons : first '' aid in the interpretation of existing research '' and second '' to serve as a framework for future research '' their study was based mainly around previous studies of organizational commitment meyer and allen 's research indicated that there are three '' mind sets '' which can characterize an employee 's commitment to the organization mercurio ( 2015 ) extended this model by reviewing the empirical and theoretical studies on organizational commitment mercurio posits that emotional , or affective commitment is the core essence of organizational commitment affective commitment is defined as the employee 's positive emotional attachment to the organization meyer and allen pegged ac as the '' desire '' component of organizational commitment an employee who is affectively committed strongly identifies with the goals of the organization and desires to remain a part of the organization '' affective commitment was found to be an enduring , demonstrably indispensable , and central characteristic of organizational commitment '' the individual commits to and remains with an organization because of feelings of obligation , the last component of organizational commitment ' it may also reflect an internalized norm , developed before the person joins the organization through family or other socialization processes , that one should be loyal to one 's organization normative commitment in employees is also high where employees regularly see visible examples of the employer being committed to employee well-being an employee with greater organizational commitment has a greater chance of contributing to organizational success and will also experience higher levels of job satisfaction since the model was made , there has been conceptual critique to what the model is trying to achieve they believe the studies should return to the original understanding of organizational commitment as an attitude toward the organization and measure it accordingly because eagly and chaiken 's model is so general , it seems that the tcm can be described as a specific subdivision of their model when looking at a general sense of organizational commitment role conflict and ambiguity have been proposed as determining factors of workers ' job satisfaction and organizational commitment job insecurity was found to negatively correlate with job satisfaction and affective organizational commitment in permanent workers the study also found that job satisfaction and organizational commitment were highly correlated with being a permanent worker five rules help to enhance organizational commitment : ; commit to people-first values : put it in writing , hire the right-kind managers , and walk the talk

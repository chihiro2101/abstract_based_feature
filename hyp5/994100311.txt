meyer and allen 's ( 1991 ) three-component model of commitment was created to argue that commitment has three different components that correspond with different psychological states meyer and allen created this model for two reasons : first '' aid in the interpretation of existing research '' and second '' to serve as a framework for future research '' their study was based mainly around previous studies of organizational commitment meyer and allen 's research indicated that there are three '' mind sets '' which can characterize an employee 's commitment to the organization mercurio ( 2015 ) extended this model by reviewing the empirical and theoretical studies on organizational commitment mercurio posits that emotional , or affective commitment is the core essence of organizational commitment affective commitment is defined as the employee 's positive emotional attachment to the organization meyer and allen pegged ac as the '' desire '' component of organizational commitment '' affective commitment was found to be an enduring , demonstrably indispensable , and central characteristic of organizational commitment '' the individual commits to and remains with an organization because of feelings of obligation , the last component of organizational commitment for example , the organization may have invested resources in training an employee who then feels a 'moral ' obligation to put forth effort on the job and stay with the organization to 'repay the debt an employee with greater organizational commitment has a greater chance of contributing to organizational success and will also experience higher levels of job satisfaction however , a collection of studies have shown that the model is not consistent with empirical findings solinger , olffen , and roe use a later model by alice eagly and shelly chaiken , attitude-behavior model ( 2004 ) , to present that tcm combines different attitude phenomena the model appears to mix together an attitude toward a target , that being the organization , with an attitude toward a behavior , which is leaving or staying they believe the studies should return to the original understanding of organizational commitment as an attitude toward the organization and measure it accordingly because eagly and chaiken 's model is so general , it seems that the tcm can be described as a specific subdivision of their model when looking at a general sense of organizational commitment a study conducted by dirani and kuchinke produced results indicating a strong correlation between job commitment and job satisfaction and that satisfaction was a reliable predictor of commitment job insecurity was found to negatively correlate with job satisfaction and affective organizational commitment in permanent workers this study examined how one leader ( usually a principal ) effected the job satisfaction and commitment of teachers john meyer responded to this gap by proposing a model of organizational change commitment

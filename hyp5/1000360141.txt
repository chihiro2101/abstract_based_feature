in its early development in the uk in the 1930s , traffic calming was based on the idea that residential areas should be protected from through-traffic subsequently , it became valued for its ability to improve pedestrian safety and reduce noise and air pollution from traffic for much of the 20th century , streets were designed by engineers who were charged only with ensuring smooth motor vehicular traffic flow and not with fostering the other functions of streets the livable streets study by donald appleyard ( 1981 ) found that residents of streets with light traffic had , on average , three more friends and twice as many acquaintances as the people on streets with heavy traffic which were otherwise similar in dimensions , income , etc traffic engineers refer to three '' e 's '' when discussing traffic calming : engineering , ( community ) education , and ( police ) enforcement because neighborhood traffic management studies have shown that residents often contribute to the perceived speeding problem within their neighborhoods , instructions on traffic calming ( for example in hass-klau et al measures include speed humps , chicanes , curb extensions , modal filters , and living street and shared space type schemes the town of hilden in germany has achieved a rate of 24 % of trips being on two wheels , mainly via traffic calming and the use of 30 & nbsp ; km/h or 20 & nbsp ; mph zones home zones briefing sheet , robert huxford , proceedings , institution of civil engineers , transport , 135 , 45-46 , february 1999 however , some uk and irish '' traffic calming '' schemes , particularly involving road narrowings , are viewed as extremely hostile and have been implicated directly in death and injury to cyclists and pedestrians visual traffic calming includes lane narrowings ( 9-10 ' ) , road diets ( reduction in lanes ) , use of trees next to streets , on-street parking , and buildings placed in urban fashion close to streets physical devices include speed humps , speed cushions and speed tables , sized for the desired speed traffic calming can include the following engineering measures , grouped by similarity of method : narrowing : narrowing traffic lanes makes slower speeds seem more natural to drivers and are less intrusive than other treatments that limit speed or restrict route choice vertical deflection measures include : speed bumps , sometimes split or offset in the middle to avoid delaying emergency vehicles speed humps , parabolic devices that are less aggressive than speed bumps speed tables , long flat-topped speed humps that slow cars more gradually than humps raised pedestrian crossings , which act as speed tables , often situated at junctions speed limit enforcement techniques include : direct police action , automated systems such as speed cameras or vehicle activated signs or traffic lights triggered by traffic exceeding a preset speed threshold traffic calming has been successfully used for decades in cities across europe devon county council , 1991 , '' traffic calming guidelines '' in the united kingdom , low traffic neighbourhoods incorporate traffic calming and filtered permeability in addition to eliminating the left turn from 23rd street onto harrison street , oakdot 's traffic calming scheme notably reduced the number of lanes on harrison st from six to four a cochrane review of studies found that there is evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of traffic calming measures in reducing traffic-related injuries and may even reduce deaths

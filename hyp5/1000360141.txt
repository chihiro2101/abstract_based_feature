in its early development in the uk in the 1930s , traffic calming was based on the idea that residential areas should be protected from through-traffic subsequently , it became valued for its ability to improve pedestrian safety and reduce noise and air pollution from traffic traffic calming initiatives have grown to consider other design functions as well for example , it has been shown that car traffic severely impairs the social and recreational functions of public streets the livable streets study by donald appleyard ( 1981 ) found that residents of streets with light traffic had , on average , three more friends and twice as many acquaintances as the people on streets with heavy traffic which were otherwise similar in dimensions , income , etc traffic engineers refer to three '' e 's '' when discussing traffic calming : engineering , ( community ) education , and ( police ) enforcement because neighborhood traffic management studies have shown that residents often contribute to the perceived speeding problem within their neighborhoods , instructions on traffic calming ( for example in hass-klau et al , 1992 ) stress that the most effective traffic calming plans entail all three componentsâ€”that engineering measures alone will not produce satisfactory results the town of hilden in germany has achieved a rate of 24 % of trips being on two wheels , mainly via traffic calming and the use of 30 & nbsp ; km/h or 20 & nbsp ; mph zones home zones briefing sheet , robert huxford , proceedings , institution of civil engineers , transport , 135 , 45-46 , february 1999 however , some uk and irish '' traffic calming '' schemes , particularly involving road narrowings , are viewed as extremely hostile and have been implicated directly in death and injury to cyclists and pedestrians visual traffic calming includes lane narrowings ( 9-10 ' ) , road diets ( reduction in lanes ) , use of trees next to streets , on-street parking , and buildings placed in urban fashion close to streets traffic calming can include the following engineering measures , grouped by similarity of method : narrowing : narrowing traffic lanes makes slower speeds seem more natural to drivers and are less intrusive than other treatments that limit speed or restrict route choice vertical deflection measures include : speed bumps , sometimes split or offset in the middle to avoid delaying emergency vehicles speed humps , parabolic devices that are less aggressive than speed bumps rumble strips , when placed perpendicular to traffic in the travel lane ( rather than placed between lanes parallel to traffic ) act as speed bumps as they produce unpleasant sounds and vibration when crossed at higher speeds traffic speeds of 30 & nbsp ; km/h ( 20 & nbsp ; mph ) and lower are said to be more desirable on urban roads with mixed traffic more recently , in response to growing numbers of traffic accidents and speeding problems , cities across north america have begun creating traffic calming programs to improve safety and liveability on residential streets a 2018 study found that traffic calming measures in portland reduced excessive speeds , reduced daily traffic volume by 16 % and increased home prices by 1 % according to right wing libertarian economic commentator and smart growth critic randal o'toole , the main goal of traffic calming is to increase traffic congestion for the sake of social engineering he claims that some traffic calming measures such as reverting one way roads into two-way roads or creating '' bump outs '' have increased motor traffic congestion , resulted in more accidents and increased pedestrian fatalities

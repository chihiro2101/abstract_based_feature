in its early development in the uk in the 1930s , traffic calming was based on the idea that residential areas should be protected from through-traffic subsequently , it became valued for its ability to improve pedestrian safety and reduce noise and air pollution from traffic for much of the 20th century , streets were designed by engineers who were charged only with ensuring smooth motor vehicular traffic flow and not with fostering the other functions of streets the livable streets study by donald appleyard ( 1981 ) found that residents of streets with light traffic had , on average , three more friends and twice as many acquaintances as the people on streets with heavy traffic which were otherwise similar in dimensions , income , etc traffic engineers refer to three '' e 's '' when discussing traffic calming : engineering , ( community ) education , and ( police ) enforcement because neighborhood traffic management studies have shown that residents often contribute to the perceived speeding problem within their neighborhoods , instructions on traffic calming ( for example in hass-klau et al , 1992 ) stress that the most effective traffic calming plans entail all three componentsâ€”that engineering measures alone will not produce satisfactory results measures include speed humps , chicanes , curb extensions , modal filters , and living street and shared space type schemes the town of hilden in germany has achieved a rate of 24 % of trips being on two wheels , mainly via traffic calming and the use of 30 & nbsp ; km/h or 20 & nbsp ; mph zones ( accessed 27 january 2007 ) a number of visual changes to roads are being made to encourage more attentive driving , reduced speed , reduced crashes , and a greater tendency to yield to pedestrians visual traffic calming includes lane narrowings ( 9-10 ' ) , road diets ( reduction in lanes ) , use of trees next to streets , on-street parking , and buildings placed in urban fashion close to streets physical devices include speed humps , speed cushions and speed tables , sized for the desired speed traffic calming can include the following engineering measures , grouped by similarity of method : narrowing : narrowing traffic lanes makes slower speeds seem more natural to drivers and are less intrusive than other treatments that limit speed or restrict route choice such traffic calming means include : median diverters to prevent left turns or through movements into a residential area other means quite often residents have used a variety of homemade devices ranging from faux enforcement camera signs and even faux speed cameras and including dummy police devon county council , 1991 , '' traffic calming guidelines '' in the united kingdom , low traffic neighbourhoods incorporate traffic calming and filtered permeability more recently , in response to growing numbers of traffic accidents and speeding problems , cities across north america have begun creating traffic calming programs to improve safety and liveability on residential streets a cochrane review of studies found that there is evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of traffic calming measures in reducing traffic-related injuries and may even reduce deaths he claims that some traffic calming measures such as reverting one way roads into two-way roads or creating '' bump outs '' have increased motor traffic congestion , resulted in more accidents and increased pedestrian fatalities

subsequently , it became valued for its ability to improve pedestrian safety and reduce noise and air pollution from traffic traffic calming initiatives have grown to consider other design functions as well the livable streets study by donald appleyard ( 1981 ) found that residents of streets with light traffic had , on average , three more friends and twice as many acquaintances as the people on streets with heavy traffic which were otherwise similar in dimensions , income , etc traffic engineers refer to three '' e 's '' when discussing traffic calming : engineering , ( community ) education , and ( police ) enforcement because neighborhood traffic management studies have shown that residents often contribute to the perceived speeding problem within their neighborhoods , instructions on traffic calming ( for example in hass-klau et al , 1992 ) stress that the most effective traffic calming plans entail all three componentsâ€”that engineering measures alone will not produce satisfactory results the town of hilden in germany has achieved a rate of 24 % of trips being on two wheels , mainly via traffic calming and the use of 30 & nbsp ; km/h or 20 & nbsp ; mph zones visual traffic calming includes lane narrowings ( 9-10 ' ) , road diets ( reduction in lanes ) , use of trees next to streets , on-street parking , and buildings placed in urban fashion close to streets physical devices include speed humps , speed cushions and speed tables , sized for the desired speed traffic calming can include the following engineering measures , grouped by similarity of method : narrowing : narrowing traffic lanes makes slower speeds seem more natural to drivers and are less intrusive than other treatments that limit speed or restrict route choice speed cushions , two or three small speed humps sitting in a line across the road that slow cars down but allows wider emergency vehicles to straddle them so as not to slow emergency response time rumble strips , when placed perpendicular to traffic in the travel lane ( rather than placed between lanes parallel to traffic ) act as speed bumps as they produce unpleasant sounds and vibration when crossed at higher speeds such traffic calming means include : median diverters to prevent left turns or through movements into a residential area enforcement and education measures for traffic calming include : reducing speed limits near institutions such as schools and hospitals ( see below ) vehicle activated sign , signs which react with a message if they detect a vehicle exceeding a pre-determined speed traffic speeds of 30 & nbsp ; km/h ( 20 & nbsp ; mph ) and lower are said to be more desirable on urban roads with mixed traffic speed limit enforcement techniques include : direct police action , automated systems such as speed cameras or vehicle activated signs or traffic lights triggered by traffic exceeding a preset speed threshold more recently , in response to growing numbers of traffic accidents and speeding problems , cities across north america have begun creating traffic calming programs to improve safety and liveability on residential streets a cochrane review of studies found that there is evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of traffic calming measures in reducing traffic-related injuries and may even reduce deaths he claims that some traffic calming measures such as reverting one way roads into two-way roads or creating '' bump outs '' have increased motor traffic congestion , resulted in more accidents and increased pedestrian fatalities

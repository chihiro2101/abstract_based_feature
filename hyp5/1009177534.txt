discrimination based on skin color , ( measured for example on the fitzpatrick scale ) is closely related to racial discrimination , as skin color is often used as a proxy for race in everyday interactions , and is one factor used by legal systems that apply detailed criteria for example , the population registration act , 1950 was used to enforce the apartheid system in south africa , and brazil has set up boards to assign a racial category to people for the purpose of enforcing racial quotas for affirmative action , brazil sets up controversial boards to determine race because of genetic variation , skin color , and other physical appearance can vary considerably even among siblings in such cases , racial discrimination can occur because someone is of an ethnicity defined as outside that race , or ethnic discrimination ( or ethnic hatred , ethnic conflict , and ethnic violence ) can occur between groups who consider each other to be the same race discrimination based on caste is similar ; because caste is hereditary , people of the same caste are usually considered to be of the same race and ethnicity a person 's national origin ( the country in which they were born or have citizenship ) is sometimes used in determining a person 's ethnicity or race , but discrimination based on national origin can also be independent of race ( and is sometimes specifically addressed in anti-discrimination laws ) language and culture are sometimes markers of national origin and can prompt instances of discrimination based on national origin such a difference in treatment might still informally be described as a form of racism , or more precisely as xenophobia or anti-immigrant sentiment in countries where migration , unification , or breakup has occurred relatively recently , the process of ethnogenesis may complicate the determination of both ethnicity and race and is related to identity ( social science ) census asks separate questions about hispanic and latino americans to distinguish language from racial identity discrimination based on being hispanic or latino does occur in the united states and might be considered a form of racial discrimination if '' hispanic '' or '' latino '' are considered a new racial category derived from ethnicities which formed after the independence of the former colonies of the americas many statistical reports apply both characteristics , for example comparing non-hispanic whites to other groups when people of different races are treated differently , decisions about how to treat a particular person raise the question of which racial classification that person belongs to if a race is defined as a set of ethnolinguistic groups , then common language origin can be used to define the boundaries of that group the actual ancestry of most jewish people is more varied than simply ancient hebrew tribes as the jewish diaspora spread across europe and africa over time many jewish ethnic divisions arose , resulting in jews who identify as white , black , and other races the reunification of diverse populations in modern israel has led to some problems of racial discrimination against dark-skinned jews by light-skinned jews a 2013 analysis of world values survey data by the washington post looked at the fraction of people in each country that indicated they would prefer not to have neighbours of the same race a study conducted in the netherlands and published in 2013 found significant levels of discrimination against job applicants with arabic-sounding names the british colonial impact greatly affected the cultures of african society but the differences in the countries like nigeria remain as close to tradition compared to countries like south africa for example , in the north , an indirect policy of rule settled a new way of life between the colonizing government and the fulani- hausa ruling class although the studies â€™ results correlate reported racial discrimination with outcomes to well-being , this does not conclude that one or more racial groups experience greater discrimination than other racial groups additionally , critical consciousness can grow in individuals as a result of inequalities they may face such as racial discrimination in the united states , civil rights act of 1964 title vii prohibits all racial discrimination based on race equal employment opportunity commission ( eeoc ) applies the same standard to all claims of racial discrimination without regard to the victim 's race .

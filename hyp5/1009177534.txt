racial boundaries can involve many factors ( such as ancestry , physical appearance , national origin , language , religion , and culture ) , and maybe set in law by governments , or may depend on local cultural norms discrimination based on skin color , ( measured for example on the fitzpatrick scale ) is closely related to racial discrimination , as skin color is often used as a proxy for race in everyday interactions , and is one factor used by legal systems that apply detailed criteria for example , the population registration act , 1950 was used to enforce the apartheid system in south africa , and brazil has set up boards to assign a racial category to people for the purpose of enforcing racial quotas for affirmative action , brazil sets up controversial boards to determine race because of genetic variation , skin color , and other physical appearance can vary considerably even among siblings hyperdescent ) classify the same people differently , and for various reasons some people '' pass '' as a member of a different race than they would otherwise be classified in , possibly avoiding legal or interpersonal discrimination a given race is sometimes defined as a set of ethnicities from populations in neighboring geographic areas ( such as a continent like australia or a subcontinental region like south asia ) that are typically similar in appearance in such cases , racial discrimination can occur because someone is of an ethnicity defined as outside that race , or ethnic discrimination ( or ethnic hatred , ethnic conflict , and ethnic violence ) can occur between groups who consider each other to be the same race discrimination based on caste is similar ; because caste is hereditary , people of the same caste are usually considered to be of the same race and ethnicity a person 's national origin ( the country in which they were born or have citizenship ) is sometimes used in determining a person 's ethnicity or race , but discrimination based on national origin can also be independent of race ( and is sometimes specifically addressed in anti-discrimination laws ) language and culture are sometimes markers of national origin and can prompt instances of discrimination based on national origin such a difference in treatment might still informally be described as a form of racism , or more precisely as xenophobia or anti-immigrant sentiment in countries where migration , unification , or breakup has occurred relatively recently , the process of ethnogenesis may complicate the determination of both ethnicity and race and is related to identity ( social science ) for example , the 2015 community survey of the united states census accepted identification as mexican americans of any race ( for example including native americans from mexico , descendants of africans transported to new spain as enslaved people , and descendants of spanish colonists ) in surveys taken by the mexican government , the same people would have been described as indigenous , black , or white ( with a large number of people unclassified who might be described as mestizo ) discrimination based on being hispanic or latino does occur in the united states and might be considered a form of racial discrimination if '' hispanic '' or '' latino '' are considered a new racial category derived from ethnicities which formed after the independence of the former colonies of the americas american and south african laws which divided the population into whites from europe and blacks from sub-saharan africa often caused problems of interpretation when dealing with people from other areas , such as the rest of the mediterranean basin , asia , north africa , or even native americans , with classification as non-white usually resulting in legal discrimination ) though as an ethno-religious group they often face religious discrimination , the whiteness of all jews was also challenged in the united states , with attempts to classify them as asiatic ( palestine being in western asia ) or semitic ( which would also include arabs ) more than 30 years of field experimental studies have found significant levels of discrimination against non-whites in labor , housing , and product markets in 10 countries a study conducted in the netherlands and published in 2013 found significant levels of discrimination against job applicants with arabic-sounding names with regard to employment , multiple audit study have found strong evidence of racial discrimination in the united states ' labor market , with magnitudes of employers ' preferences of white applicants found in these studies ranging from 50 % to 240 % researchers marianne bertrand and sendhil mullainathan , at the university of chicago and mit found in a 2004 study , that there was widespread racial discrimination in the workplace to investigate these relationships , the researchers examined data containing reports of racial discrimination from children , which served as a significant tool to further explore these ideas for example , evidence of a weaker relationship between racial discrimination and well-being in children of african descent may be linked to parent-guided socialization practices to help children cope with racial discrimination , or possibly lack of research concerning the severity of discrimination . critical consciousness in youth and racial discrimination in the united states , civil rights act of 1964 title vii prohibits all racial discrimination based on race

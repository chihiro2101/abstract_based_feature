racial boundaries can involve many factors ( such as ancestry , physical appearance , national origin , language , religion , and culture ) , and maybe set in law by governments , or may depend on local cultural norms discrimination based on skin color , ( measured for example on the fitzpatrick scale ) is closely related to racial discrimination , as skin color is often used as a proxy for race in everyday interactions , and is one factor used by legal systems that apply detailed criteria for example , the population registration act , 1950 was used to enforce the apartheid system in south africa , and brazil has set up boards to assign a racial category to people for the purpose of enforcing racial quotas hyperdescent ) classify the same people differently , and for various reasons some people '' pass '' as a member of a different race than they would otherwise be classified in , possibly avoiding legal or interpersonal discrimination a given race is sometimes defined as a set of ethnicities from populations in neighboring geographic areas ( such as a continent like australia or a subcontinental region like south asia ) that are typically similar in appearance in such cases , racial discrimination can occur because someone is of an ethnicity defined as outside that race , or ethnic discrimination ( or ethnic hatred , ethnic conflict , and ethnic violence ) can occur between groups who consider each other to be the same race discrimination based on caste is similar ; because caste is hereditary , people of the same caste are usually considered to be of the same race and ethnicity a person 's national origin ( the country in which they were born or have citizenship ) is sometimes used in determining a person 's ethnicity or race , but discrimination based on national origin can also be independent of race ( and is sometimes specifically addressed in anti-discrimination laws ) discrimination based on being hispanic or latino does occur in the united states and might be considered a form of racial discrimination if '' hispanic '' or '' latino '' are considered a new racial category derived from ethnicities which formed after the independence of the former colonies of the americas for example , definitions of whiteness in the united states were used before the civil rights movement for the purpose of immigration and the ability to hold citizenship or be enslaved if a race is defined as a set of ethnolinguistic groups , then common language origin can be used to define the boundaries of that group american and south african laws which divided the population into whites from europe and blacks from sub-saharan africa often caused problems of interpretation when dealing with people from other areas , such as the rest of the mediterranean basin , asia , north africa , or even native americans , with classification as non-white usually resulting in legal discrimination ) though as an ethno-religious group they often face religious discrimination , the whiteness of all jews was also challenged in the united states , with attempts to classify them as asiatic ( palestine being in western asia ) or semitic ( which would also include arabs ) as the jewish diaspora spread across europe and africa over time many jewish ethnic divisions arose , resulting in jews who identify as white , black , and other races a 2013 analysis of world values survey data by the washington post looked at the fraction of people in each country that indicated they would prefer not to have neighbours of the same race the british colonial impact greatly affected the cultures of african society but the differences in the countries like nigeria remain as close to tradition compared to countries like south africa because of this the north falls behind the south and west on education development which causes racial malignity with regard to employment , multiple audit study have found strong evidence of racial discrimination in the united states ' labor market , with magnitudes of employers ' preferences of white applicants found in these studies ranging from 50 % to 240 % racial discrimination in the workplace falls into two basic categories : disparate treatment : an employer 's policies discriminate based upon any immutable racial characteristic , such as skin , eye or hair color , and certain facial features ; disparate impact : although an employer may not intend to discriminate based on racial characteristics , its policies nonetheless have an adverse effect based upon race researchers marianne bertrand and sendhil mullainathan , at the university of chicago and mit found in a 2004 study , that there was widespread racial discrimination in the workplace studies have shown an association between reported racial discrimination and adverse physical and mental health outcomes although the medicaid program was passed to ensure african americans and other minorities received the healthcare treatment they deserved and to limit discrimination in hospital facilities , there still seems to be an underlying cause for the low number of black patients admitted to hospitals , like not receiving the proper dosage of medication for example , evidence of a weaker relationship between racial discrimination and well-being in children of african descent may be linked to parent-guided socialization practices to help children cope with racial discrimination , or possibly lack of research concerning the severity of discrimination ( 2020 ) argued that a decrease in racial discrimination can happen when white youth are aware of differences in groups and injustices due to their critical consciousness in the united states , civil rights act of 1964 title vii prohibits all racial discrimination based on race

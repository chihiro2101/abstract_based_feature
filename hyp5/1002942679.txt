in industry , edta is mainly used to sequester metal ions in aqueous solution in the pulp and paper industry , edta inhibits the ability of metal ions , especially manganese , from catalysing the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide , which is used in totally chlorine free in a similar manner , edta is added to some food as a preservative or stabiliser to prevent catalytic oxidative decolouration , which is catalysed by metal ions in soft drinks containing ascorbic acid and sodium benzoate , edta mitigates formation of benzene ( a carcinogen ) the solubilisation of iron ions at or below near neutral ph can be accomplished using edta however , given the ph dependence of ligand formation , edta is not helpful for improving iron solubility in above neutral soils aqueous fe ( edta ) − is used for removing ( '' scrubbing '' ) hydrogen sulfide from gas streams in similar manner , nitrogen oxides are removed from gas streams using fe ( edta ) 2− the oxidising properties of fe ( edta ) − are also exploited in photography , where it is used to solubilise silver particles edta was used in separation of the lanthanide metals by ion-exchange chromatography sodium calcium edetate , an edta derivative , is used to bind metal ions in the practice of chelation therapy , such as for treating mercury and lead poisoning in shampoos , cleaners , and other personal care products , edta salts are used as a sequestering agent to improve their stability in air in the laboratory , edta is widely used for scavenging metal ions : in biochemistry and molecular biology , ion depletion is commonly used to deactivate metalloenzymes , either as an assay for their reactivity or to suppress damage to dna , proteins , and polysaccharides in analytical chemistry , edta is used in complexometric titrations and analysis of water hardness or as a masking agent to sequester metal ions that would interfere with the analyses in tissue culture edta is used as a chelating agent that binds to calcium and prevents joining of cadherins between cells , preventing clumping of cells grown in liquid suspension , or detaching adherent cells for passaging edta is also known to inhibit a range of metalloproteinase , the method of inhibition occurs via the chelation of the metal ion required for catalytic activity . also today , edta is mainly synthesised from ethylenediamine ( 1,2-diaminoethane ) , formaldehyde , and sodium cyanide to describe edta and its various protonation , chemists distinguish between edta 4− , the conjugate base that is the ligand , and h 4 edta , the precursor to that ligand image : metal-edta.svg thumb metal–edta chelate as found in co ( iii ) complexes while edta serves many positive functions in different industrial , pharmaceutical and other avenues , the longevity of edta can pose serious issues in the environment depending on the light conditions , the photolysis half-life of iron ( iii ) edta in surface waters can range as low as 11.3 minutes up to more than 100 hours agrobacterium radiobacter only degrades fe ( iii ) edta while bnc1 and dsm 9103 are not capable of degrading iron ( iii ) edta and are more suited for calcium , barium , magnesium and manganese complexes polyaspartic acid , like ids , binds to calcium and other heavy metal ions the merops online database for peptidases and their inhibitors : edta edta : molecule of the month edta determination of total water hardness

in industry , edta is mainly used to sequester metal ions in aqueous solution in the pulp and paper industry , edta inhibits the ability of metal ions , especially manganese , from catalysing the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide , which is used in totally chlorine free in a similar manner , edta is added to some food as a preservative or stabiliser to prevent catalytic oxidative decolouration , which is catalysed by metal ions in soft drinks containing ascorbic acid and sodium benzoate , edta mitigates formation of benzene ( a carcinogen ) in a similar manner edta is used in the cement industry for the determination of free lime and free magnesia in cement and clinkers the solubilisation of iron ions at or below near neutral ph can be accomplished using edta otherwise , at near-neutral ph and above , iron ( iii ) forms insoluble salts , which are less bioavailable to susceptible plant species aqueous fe ( edta ) − is used for removing ( '' scrubbing '' ) hydrogen sulfide from gas streams in similar manner , nitrogen oxides are removed from gas streams using fe ( edta ) 2− the oxidising properties of fe ( edta ) − are also exploited in photography , where it is used to solubilise silver particles in 1954 , the method relies on the steady increase in stability constant of the lanthanide edta complexes with atomic number sodium calcium edetate , an edta derivative , is used to bind metal ions in the practice of chelation therapy , such as for treating mercury and lead poisoning in evaluating kidney function , the chromium complex cr ( edta ) − ( as radioactive chromium-51 ( 51 cr ) ) is administered intravenously and its filtration into the urine is monitored edta is also in tan top tubes for lead testing and can be used in royal blue top tubes for trace metal testing in the laboratory , edta is widely used for scavenging metal ions : in biochemistry and molecular biology , ion depletion is commonly used to deactivate metalloenzymes , either as an assay for their reactivity or to suppress damage to dna , proteins , and polysaccharides in analytical chemistry , edta is used in complexometric titrations and analysis of water hardness or as a masking agent to sequester metal ions that would interfere with the analyses edta finds many specialised uses in the biomedical labs , such as in veterinary ophthalmology as an collagenase to prevent the worsening of corneal ulcers in animals to describe edta and its various protonation , chemists distinguish between edta 4− , the conjugate base that is the ligand , and h 4 edta , the precursor to that ligand in this article , the term edta is used to mean h 4−x edta x− , whereas in its complexes edta 4− stands for the tetraanion ligand image : metal-edta.svg thumb metal–edta chelate as found in co ( iii ) complexes in coordination complex , edta 4− is a member of the aminopolycarboxylic acid family of ligands depending on the light conditions , the photolysis half-life of iron ( iii ) edta in surface waters can range as low as 11.3 minutes up to more than 100 hours polyaspartic acid , like ids , binds to calcium and other heavy metal ions the merops online database for peptidases and their inhibitors : edta edta : molecule of the month edta determination of total water hardness

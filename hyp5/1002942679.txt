in industry , edta is mainly used to sequester metal ions in aqueous solution in the pulp and paper industry , edta inhibits the ability of metal ions , especially manganese , from catalysing the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide , which is used in totally chlorine free in a similar manner , edta is added to some food as a preservative or stabiliser to prevent catalytic oxidative decolouration , which is catalysed by metal ions in soft drinks containing ascorbic acid and sodium benzoate , edta mitigates formation of benzene ( a carcinogen ) once bound to edta , these metal centres tend not to form precipitates or to interfere with the action of the soaps and detergents the solubilisation of iron ions at or below near neutral ph can be accomplished using edta aqueous fe ( edta ) − is used for removing ( '' scrubbing '' ) hydrogen sulfide from gas streams in similar manner , nitrogen oxides are removed from gas streams using fe ( edta ) 2− the oxidising properties of fe ( edta ) − are also exploited in photography , where it is used to solubilise silver particles edta was used in separation of the lanthanide metals by ion-exchange chromatography using sulfonated polystyrene beads and copper as a retaining ion , edta causes the lanthanides to migrate down the column of resin while separating into bands of pure lanthanides due to the expense of this method , relative to countercurrent solvent extraction , ion exchange is now used only to obtain the highest purities of lanthanides ( typically greater than 99.99 % ) sodium calcium edetate , an edta derivative , is used to bind metal ions in the practice of chelation therapy , such as for treating mercury and lead poisoning some alternative medicine believe edta acts as an antioxidant , preventing free radicals from injuring blood vessel walls , therefore reducing atherosclerosis in analytical chemistry , edta is used in complexometric titrations and analysis of water hardness or as a masking agent to sequester metal ions that would interfere with the analyses in histopathology , edta can be used as a decalcifying agent making it possible to cut sections using a microtome once the tissue sample is demineralised to describe edta and its various protonation , chemists distinguish between edta 4− , the conjugate base that is the ligand , and h 4 edta , the precursor to that ligand image : metal-edta.svg thumb metal–edta chelate as found in co ( iii ) complexes several features of edta 's complexes are relevant to its applications while edta serves many positive functions in different industrial , pharmaceutical and other avenues , the longevity of edta can pose serious issues in the environment the most important process for the elimination of edta from surface waters is direct photolysis at wavelengths below 400 & nbsp ; nm agrobacterium radiobacter only degrades fe ( iii ) edta while bnc1 and dsm 9103 are not capable of degrading iron ( iii ) edta and are more suited for calcium , barium , magnesium and manganese complexes polyaspartic acid , like ids , binds to calcium and other heavy metal ions the merops online database for peptidases and their inhibitors : edta edta : molecule of the month edta determination of total water hardness

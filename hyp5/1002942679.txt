in industry , edta is mainly used to sequester metal ions in aqueous solution in the pulp and paper industry , edta inhibits the ability of metal ions , especially manganese , from catalysing the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide , which is used in totally chlorine free in a similar manner , edta is added to some food as a preservative or stabiliser to prevent catalytic oxidative decolouration , which is catalysed by metal ions in soft drinks containing ascorbic acid and sodium benzoate , edta mitigates formation of benzene ( a carcinogen ) once bound to edta , these metal centres tend not to form precipitates or to interfere with the action of the soaps and detergents for similar reasons , cleaning solutions often contain edta in a similar manner edta is used in the cement industry for the determination of free lime and free magnesia in cement and clinkers the solubilisation of iron ions at or below near neutral ph can be accomplished using edta however , given the ph dependence of ligand formation , edta is not helpful for improving iron solubility in above neutral soils aqueous fe ( edta ) − is used for removing ( '' scrubbing '' ) hydrogen sulfide from gas streams the oxidising properties of fe ( edta ) − are also exploited in photography , where it is used to solubilise silver particles edta was used in separation of the lanthanide metals by ion-exchange chromatography in 1954 , the method relies on the steady increase in stability constant of the lanthanide edta complexes with atomic number using sulfonated polystyrene beads and copper as a retaining ion , edta causes the lanthanides to migrate down the column of resin while separating into bands of pure lanthanides edta is used extensively in the analysis of blood edta is also in tan top tubes for lead testing and can be used in royal blue top tubes for trace metal testing edta is a slime dispersant , and has been found to be highly effective in reducing bacterial growth during implantation of intraocular lenses ( iols ) these findings urge the rethinking of the utilisation of edta as a biochemically inactive metal ion scavenger in enzymatic experiments in analytical chemistry , edta is used in complexometric titrations and analysis of water hardness or as a masking agent to sequester metal ions that would interfere with the analyses edta exhibits low acute toxicity with ( rat ) of 2.0 & nbsp ; g/kg to 2.2 & nbsp ; g/kg to describe edta and its various protonation , chemists distinguish between edta 4− , the conjugate base that is the ligand , and h 4 edta , the precursor to that ligand many complexes of edta 4− adopt more complex structures due to either the formation of an additional bond to water , i.e polyaspartic acid , like ids , binds to calcium and other heavy metal ions the merops online database for peptidases and their inhibitors : edta edta : molecule of the month edta determination of total water hardness

in industry , edta is mainly used to sequester metal ions in aqueous solution in the pulp and paper industry , edta inhibits the ability of metal ions , especially manganese , from catalysing the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide , which is used in totally chlorine free in a similar manner , edta is added to some food as a preservative or stabiliser to prevent catalytic oxidative decolouration , which is catalysed by metal ions in soft drinks containing ascorbic acid and sodium benzoate , edta mitigates formation of benzene ( a carcinogen ) in a similar manner edta is used in the cement industry for the determination of free lime and free magnesia in cement and clinkers the solubilisation of iron ions at or below near neutral ph can be accomplished using edta aqueous fe ( edta ) − is used for removing ( '' scrubbing '' ) hydrogen sulfide from gas streams the oxidising properties of fe ( edta ) − are also exploited in photography , where it is used to solubilise silver particles edta was used in separation of the lanthanide metals by ion-exchange chromatography in 1954 , the method relies on the steady increase in stability constant of the lanthanide edta complexes with atomic number sodium calcium edetate , an edta derivative , is used to bind metal ions in the practice of chelation therapy , such as for treating mercury and lead poisoning edta is used extensively in the analysis of blood it is an anticoagulant for blood samples for cbc/fbcs , where the edta chelates the calcium present in the blood specimen , arresting the coagulation process and preserving blood cell morphology in shampoos , cleaners , and other personal care products , edta salts are used as a sequestering agent to improve their stability in air in analytical chemistry , edta is used in complexometric titrations and analysis of water hardness or as a masking agent to sequester metal ions that would interfere with the analyses edta exhibits low acute toxicity with ( rat ) of 2.0 & nbsp ; g/kg to 2.2 & nbsp ; g/kg . also today , edta is mainly synthesised from ethylenediamine ( 1,2-diaminoethane ) , formaldehyde , and sodium cyanide to describe edta and its various protonation , chemists distinguish between edta 4− , the conjugate base that is the ligand , and h 4 edta , the precursor to that ligand in this article , the term edta is used to mean h 4−x edta x− , whereas in its complexes edta 4− stands for the tetraanion ligand in coordination complex , edta 4− is a member of the aminopolycarboxylic acid family of ligands because metal ions are extensively enveloped by edta , their catalysis are often suppressed in many industrial wastewater treatment plants , edta elimination can be achieved at about 80 % using microorganisms several bacterial strains isolated from sewage treatment plants efficiently degrade edta polyaspartic acid , like ids , binds to calcium and other heavy metal ions

in industry , edta is mainly used to sequester metal ions in aqueous solution in the pulp and paper industry , edta inhibits the ability of metal ions , especially manganese , from catalysing the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide , which is used in totally chlorine free in a similar manner , edta is added to some food as a preservative or stabiliser to prevent catalytic oxidative decolouration , which is catalysed by metal ions in soft drinks containing ascorbic acid and sodium benzoate , edta mitigates formation of benzene ( a carcinogen ) once bound to edta , these metal centres tend not to form precipitates or to interfere with the action of the soaps and detergents the solubilisation of iron ions at or below near neutral ph can be accomplished using edta however , given the ph dependence of ligand formation , edta is not helpful for improving iron solubility in above neutral soils otherwise , at near-neutral ph and above , iron ( iii ) forms insoluble salts , which are less bioavailable to susceptible plant species aqueous fe ( edta ) − is used for removing ( '' scrubbing '' ) hydrogen sulfide from gas streams using sulfonated polystyrene beads and copper as a retaining ion , edta causes the lanthanides to migrate down the column of resin while separating into bands of pure lanthanides sodium calcium edetate , an edta derivative , is used to bind metal ions in the practice of chelation therapy , such as for treating mercury and lead poisoning dentists and endodontists use edta solutions to remove inorganic debris ( smear layer ) and lubricate the root canals in endodontics edta is used extensively in the analysis of blood it is an anticoagulant for blood samples for cbc/fbcs , where the edta chelates the calcium present in the blood specimen , arresting the coagulation process and preserving blood cell morphology some alternative medicine believe edta acts as an antioxidant , preventing free radicals from injuring blood vessel walls , therefore reducing atherosclerosis in shampoos , cleaners , and other personal care products , edta salts are used as a sequestering agent to improve their stability in air in the laboratory , edta is widely used for scavenging metal ions : in biochemistry and molecular biology , ion depletion is commonly used to deactivate metalloenzymes , either as an assay for their reactivity or to suppress damage to dna , proteins , and polysaccharides in analytical chemistry , edta is used in complexometric titrations and analysis of water hardness or as a masking agent to sequester metal ions that would interfere with the analyses in tissue culture edta is used as a chelating agent that binds to calcium and prevents joining of cadherins between cells , preventing clumping of cells grown in liquid suspension , or detaching adherent cells for passaging in coordination complex , edta 4− is a member of the aminopolycarboxylic acid family of ligands several bacterial strains isolated from sewage treatment plants efficiently degrade edta agrobacterium radiobacter only degrades fe ( iii ) edta while bnc1 and dsm 9103 are not capable of degrading iron ( iii ) edta and are more suited for calcium , barium , magnesium and manganese complexes polyaspartic acid , like ids , binds to calcium and other heavy metal ions mgda has been shown to be an effective chelating agent , with a capacity for mobilization comparable with that of nitrilotriacetic acid ( nta ) , with application to water for industrial use and for the removal of calcium oxalate from urine from patients with kidney stones

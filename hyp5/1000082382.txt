for light aircraft , usually full power is used during takeoff for most aircraft , attempting a takeoff without a pitch-up would require cruise speeds while still on the runway fixed-wing aircraft designed for high-speed operation ( such as commercial jet aircraft ) have difficulty generating enough lift at the low speeds encountered during takeoff for a given aircraft , the takeoff speed is usually dependent on the aircraft weight ; the heavier the weight , the greater the speed needed the takeoff speed required varies with aircraft weight and aircraft configuration ( flap or slat position , as applicable ) , and is provided to the flight crew as indicated airspeed the v r for transport category aircraft is calculated such as to allow the aircraft to reach the regulatory screen height at v 2 with one engine failed in a single-engine or light twin-engine aircraft , the pilot calculates the length of runway required to take off and clear any obstacles , to ensure sufficient runway to use for takeoff in most such aircraft , any engine failure results in a rejected takeoff as a matter of course , since even overrunning the end of the runway is preferable to lifting off with insufficient power to maintain flight vertical take-off and landing ( vtol ) aircraft include fixed-wing aircraft that can hover , take off and land vertically as well as helicopters and other aircraft with powered rotors , such as tiltrotors '' vertical take-off and landing ( vtol ) aircraft balanced field takeoff climb ( aeronautics ) cruise ( aeronautics ) descent ( aeronautics ) landing space launch v speeds

for light aircraft , usually full power is used during takeoff for most aircraft , attempting a takeoff without a pitch-up would require cruise speeds while still on the runway fixed-wing aircraft designed for high-speed operation ( such as commercial jet aircraft ) have difficulty generating enough lift at the low speeds encountered during takeoff for a given aircraft , the takeoff speed is usually dependent on the aircraft weight ; the heavier the weight , the greater the speed needed the takeoff speed required varies with aircraft weight and aircraft configuration ( flap or slat position , as applicable ) , and is provided to the flight crew as indicated airspeed these speeds are determined not only by the above factors affecting takeoff performance , but also by the length and slope of the runway and any peculiar conditions , such as obstacles off the end of the runway below v 1 , in case of critical failures , the takeoff should be aborted ; above v 1 the pilot continues the takeoff and returns for landing assisted takeoff is any system for helping aircraft into the air ( as opposed to strictly under its own power ) vertical take-off and landing ( vtol ) aircraft include fixed-wing aircraft that can hover , take off and land vertically as well as helicopters and other aircraft with powered rotors , such as tiltrotors some vtol aircraft can operate in other modes as well , such as ctol ( conventional take-off and landing ) , stol ( short take-off and landing ) , and/or stovl ( short take-off and vertical landing ) vtol is a subset of v/stol ( vertical and/or short take-off and landing )

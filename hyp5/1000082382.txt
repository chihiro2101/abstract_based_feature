for light aircraft , usually full power is used during takeoff the aircraft is permitted to accelerate to rotation speed ( often referred to as v r ) fixed-wing aircraft designed for high-speed operation ( such as commercial jet aircraft ) have difficulty generating enough lift at the low speeds encountered during takeoff a headwind will reduce the ground speed needed for takeoff , as there is a greater flow of air over the wings for a given aircraft , the takeoff speed is usually dependent on the aircraft weight ; the heavier the weight , the greater the speed needed in a single-engine or light twin-engine aircraft , the pilot calculates the length of runway required to take off and clear any obstacles , to ensure sufficient runway to use for takeoff most vertical take off aircraft are also able to land horizontally , but there were certain rocket-powered aircraft of the luftwaffe that only took off vertically , landing in other ways vertical take-off and landing ( vtol ) aircraft include fixed-wing aircraft that can hover , take off and land vertically as well as helicopters and other aircraft with powered rotors , such as tiltrotors '' vertical take-off and landing ( vtol ) aircraft some vtol aircraft can operate in other modes as well , such as ctol ( conventional take-off and landing ) , stol ( short take-off and landing ) , and/or stovl ( short take-off and vertical landing ) others , such as some helicopters , can only operate by vtol , due to the aircraft lacking landing gear that can handle horizontal motion

for light aircraft , usually full power is used during takeoff before takeoff , the engines , particularly piston engines , are routinely run up at high power to check for engine-related problems the aircraft is permitted to accelerate to rotation speed ( often referred to as v r ) for most aircraft , attempting a takeoff without a pitch-up would require cruise speeds while still on the runway fixed-wing aircraft designed for high-speed operation ( such as commercial jet aircraft ) have difficulty generating enough lift at the low speeds encountered during takeoff a headwind will reduce the ground speed needed for takeoff , as there is a greater flow of air over the wings for a given aircraft , the takeoff speed is usually dependent on the aircraft weight ; the heavier the weight , the greater the speed needed retrieved 12 august 2015 some aircraft are specifically designed for short takeoff and landing , which they achieve by becoming airborne at very low speeds generally speaking , v x is a lower speed than v y , and requires a higher pitch attitude to achieve '' vertical take-off and landing ( vtol ) aircraft some vtol aircraft can operate in other modes as well , such as ctol ( conventional take-off and landing ) , stol ( short take-off and landing ) , and/or stovl ( short take-off and vertical landing )

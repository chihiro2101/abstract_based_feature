for light aircraft , usually full power is used during takeoff for most aircraft , attempting a takeoff without a pitch-up would require cruise speeds while still on the runway fixed-wing aircraft designed for high-speed operation ( such as commercial jet aircraft ) have difficulty generating enough lift at the low speeds encountered during takeoff for a given aircraft , the takeoff speed is usually dependent on the aircraft weight ; the heavier the weight , the greater the speed needed retrieved 12 august 2015 some aircraft are specifically designed for short takeoff and landing , which they achieve by becoming airborne at very low speeds the takeoff speed required varies with aircraft weight and aircraft configuration ( flap or slat position , as applicable ) , and is provided to the flight crew as indicated airspeed after the co-pilot calls v 1 , they will call v r or '' rotate , '' marking speed at which to rotate the aircraft in a single-engine or light twin-engine aircraft , the pilot calculates the length of runway required to take off and clear any obstacles , to ensure sufficient runway to use for takeoff vertical take-off and landing ( vtol ) aircraft include fixed-wing aircraft that can hover , take off and land vertically as well as helicopters and other aircraft with powered rotors , such as tiltrotors '' vertical take-off and landing ( vtol ) aircraft besides the helicopter , there are two types of vtol aircraft in military service : craft using a tiltrotor , such as the bell boeing v-22 osprey , and some aircraft using directed jet thrust such as the harrier family

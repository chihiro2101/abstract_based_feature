for light aircraft , usually full power is used during takeoff the term rotation is used because the aircraft pivots around the axis of its main landing gear while still on the ground , usually because of gentle manipulation of the flight controls to make or facilitate this change in aircraft attitude ( once proper air displacement occurs under / over the wings , an aircraft will lift off on its own ; controls are to ease that in ) fixed-wing aircraft designed for high-speed operation ( such as commercial jet aircraft ) have difficulty generating enough lift at the low speeds encountered during takeoff retrieved 12 august 2015 some aircraft are specifically designed for short takeoff and landing , which they achieve by becoming airborne at very low speeds the takeoff speed required varies with aircraft weight and aircraft configuration ( flap or slat position , as applicable ) , and is provided to the flight crew as indicated airspeed in a single-engine or light twin-engine aircraft , the pilot calculates the length of runway required to take off and clear any obstacles , to ensure sufficient runway to use for takeoff in most such aircraft , any engine failure results in a rejected takeoff as a matter of course , since even overrunning the end of the runway is preferable to lifting off with insufficient power to maintain flight most vertical take off aircraft are also able to land horizontally , but there were certain rocket-powered aircraft of the luftwaffe that only took off vertically , landing in other ways vertical take-off and landing ( vtol ) aircraft include fixed-wing aircraft that can hover , take off and land vertically as well as helicopters and other aircraft with powered rotors , such as tiltrotors some vtol aircraft can operate in other modes as well , such as ctol ( conventional take-off and landing ) , stol ( short take-off and landing ) , and/or stovl ( short take-off and vertical landing ) besides the helicopter , there are two types of vtol aircraft in military service : craft using a tiltrotor , such as the bell boeing v-22 osprey , and some aircraft using directed jet thrust such as the harrier family

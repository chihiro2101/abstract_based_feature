the national institute on drug abuse defines medical cannabis as '' using the whole , unprocessed marijuana plant or its basic extracts to treat symptoms of illness and other conditions '' the number of active chemicals in cannabis is one reason why treatment with cannabis is difficult to classify and study a 2014 review stated that the variations in ratio of cbd-to-thc in botanical and pharmaceutical preparations determines the therapeutic vs psychoactive effects ( cbd attenuates thc 's psychoactive effects ) of cannabis products overall research into the health effects of medical cannabis has been of low quality and it is not clear whether it is a useful treatment for any condition , or whether harms outweight any benefit low quality evidence suggests its use for reducing nausea during chemotherapy , improving appetite in hiv/aids , improving sleep , and improving tics in tourette syndrome it is unclear whether american states might be able to mitigate the adverse effects of the opioid epidemic by prescribing medical cannabis as an alternative pain management drug medical cannabis is somewhat effective in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting ( cinv ) and may be a reasonable option in those who do not improve following preferential treatment comparative studies have found cannabinoids to be more effective than some conventional antiemetics such as prochlorperazine , promethazine , and metoclopramide in controlling cinv , but these are used less frequently because of side effects including dizziness , dysphoria , and hallucinations long-term cannabis use may cause nausea and vomiting , a condition known as cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome ( chs ) evidence is lacking for both efficacy and safety of cannabis and cannabinoids in treating patients with hiv/aids or for anorexia associated with aids research into the use of cannabis for treating chronic pain has yielded inconsistent results for neuropathic pain , spasms associated with multiple sclerosis and pain from rheumatic disorders when cannabis is inhaled to relieve pain , blood levels of cannabinoids rise faster than when oral products are used , peaking within three minutes and attaining an analgesic effect in seven minutes a 2011 review considered cannabis to be generally safe , and it appears safer than opioids in palliative care evidence also suggests that oral cannabis extract is effective for reducing patient-centered measures of spasticity a trial of cannabis is deemed to be a reasonable option if other treatments have not been effective there is no good evidence that medical cannabis is effective for treating posttraumatic stress disorder , and its use for this purpose is not recommended typically , adverse effects of medical cannabis use are not serious ; they include tiredness , dizziness , increased appetite , and cardiovascular and psychoactive effects other effects can include impaired short-term memory ; impaired motor coordination ; altered judgment ; and paranoia or psychosis at high doses withdrawal symptoms are rarely a problem with controlled medical administration of cannabinoids although supporters of medical cannabis say that it is safe , further research is required to assess the long-term safety of its use tetrahydrocannabinol ( thc ) , the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant , has low toxicity while the ld50 ( dose of thc needed to kill 50 % of tested rodents ) is high according to the united states department of health and human services , there were 455,000 emergency room visits associated with cannabis use in 2011 effects of chronic use may include bronchitis , a cannabis dependence syndrome , and subtle impairments of attention and memory a follow-up review found that iq deficit may be a precursor , rather than result , of cannabis use , and that social and environmental factors are a likely influence there has been a limited amount of studies that have looked at the effects of smoking cannabis on the respiratory system chronic heavy marijuana smoking is associated with coughing , production of sputum , wheezing , coughing , and other symptoms of chronic bronchitis light and moderate use of cannabis is not believed to increase risk of lung or upper airway cancer evidence for causing these cancers is mixed concerning heavy , long-term use cannabis is believed to be an aggravating factor in rare cases of arteritis , a serious condition that in some cases leads to amputation if arteritis turns out to be a distinct clinical entity , it might be the consequence of vasoconstrictor activity observed from delta-8-thc and delta-9-thc research in these events is complicated because cannabis is often used in conjunction with tobacco , and drugs such as alcohol and cocaine these putative effects can be taken in context of a wide range of cardiovascular phenomena regulated by the endocannabinoid system and an overall role of cannabis in causing decreased peripheral resistance and increased cardiac output , which potentially could pose a threat to those with cardiovascular disease the rate goes up to one in six among those who begin use as adolescents , and one-quarter to one-half of those who use it daily according to a nida review there are numerous other reasons why people look for medical cannabis and to make people aware of whether they are eligible to accept medical cannabis as a dose , there are numerous websites that are currently providing online consultations through video calling people are provided licenses with the help of which , they can either grow medical cannabis , or purchase it legally throughout the state a 2011 systematic review evaluated published studies of the acute and long-term cognitive effects of cannabis thc intoxication is well established to impair cognitive functioning on an acute basis , including effects on the ability to plan , organize , solve problems , make decisions , and control impulses a second systematic review focused on neuroimaging studies found little evidence supporting an effect of cannabis use on brain structure and function exposure to thc can cause acute transient psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals and people with schizophrenia a 2007 meta analysis concluded that cannabis use reduced the average age of onset of psychosis by 2.7 years relative to non-cannabis use a 2005 meta analysis concluded that adolescent use of cannabis increases the risk of psychosis , and that the risk is dose-related cannabis contains more than 460 compounds ; at least 80 of these are cannabinoids â€“ chemical compounds that interact with cannabinoid receptors in the brain the most psychoactive cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant is tetrahydrocannabinol ( or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol , commonly known as thc ) emperor shen-nung , who was also a pharmacologist , wrote a book on treatment methods in 2737 bce that included the medical benefits of cannabis in the united states , the use of cannabis for medical purposes is legal in 35 states , four out of five permanently inhabited u.s organizations that oppose the legalization of medical cannabis include the american academy of pediatrics and american psychiatric association the american cancer society and american psychological association have noted the obstacles that exist for conducting research on cannabis , and have called on the federal government to better enable scientific study of the drug medical cannabis research includes any medical research on using cannabis as a treatment for any medical condition

the national institute on drug abuse defines medical cannabis as '' using the whole , unprocessed marijuana plant or its basic extracts to treat symptoms of illness and other conditions '' the number of active chemicals in cannabis is one reason why treatment with cannabis is difficult to classify and study a 2014 review stated that the variations in ratio of cbd-to-thc in botanical and pharmaceutical preparations determines the therapeutic vs psychoactive effects ( cbd attenuates thc 's psychoactive effects ) of cannabis products overall research into the health effects of medical cannabis has been of low quality and it is not clear whether it is a useful treatment for any condition , or whether harms outweight any benefit low quality evidence suggests its use for reducing nausea during chemotherapy , improving appetite in hiv/aids , improving sleep , and improving tics in tourette syndrome it is unclear whether american states might be able to mitigate the adverse effects of the opioid epidemic by prescribing medical cannabis as an alternative pain management drug it is recommended that cannabis use be stopped in pregnancy medical cannabis is somewhat effective in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting ( cinv ) and may be a reasonable option in those who do not improve following preferential treatment long-term cannabis use may cause nausea and vomiting , a condition known as cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome ( chs ) evidence is lacking for both efficacy and safety of cannabis and cannabinoids in treating patients with hiv/aids or for anorexia associated with aids research into the use of cannabis for treating chronic pain has yielded inconsistent results for neuropathic pain , spasms associated with multiple sclerosis and pain from rheumatic disorders when cannabis is inhaled to relieve pain , blood levels of cannabinoids rise faster than when oral products are used , peaking within three minutes and attaining an analgesic effect in seven minutes cannabis ' efficacy is not clear in treating neurological problems , including multiple sclerosis ( ms ) and movement problems evidence also suggests that oral cannabis extract is effective for reducing patient-centered measures of spasticity a trial of cannabis is deemed to be a reasonable option if other treatments have not been effective in the united states , cannabidiol , one of the cannabinoids found in the marijuana plant , has been approved for treating two severe forms of epilepsy , lennox-gastaut syndrome and dravet syndrome other effects can include impaired short-term memory ; impaired motor coordination ; altered judgment ; and paranoia or psychosis at high doses the amount of cannabis normally used for medicinal purposes is not believed to cause any permanent cognitive impairment in adults , though long-term treatment in adolescents should be weighed carefully as they are more susceptible to these impairments the ability to drive vehicles or to operate machinery may be impaired until a tolerance is developed although supporters of medical cannabis say that it is safe , further research is required to assess the long-term safety of its use there have been few reports of symptoms lasting longer according to the united states department of health and human services , there were 455,000 emergency room visits associated with cannabis use in 2011 these statistics include visits in which the patient was treated for a condition induced by or related to recent cannabis use effects of chronic use may include bronchitis , a cannabis dependence syndrome , and subtle impairments of attention and memory compared to non-smokers , people who smoked cannabis regularly in adolescence exhibit reduced connectivity in specific brain regions associated with memory , learning , alertness , and executive function one study suggested that sustained heavy , daily , adolescent onset cannabis use over decades is associated with a decline in iq by age 38 , with no effects found in those who initiated cannabis use later , or in those who ceased use earlier in adulthood a follow-up review found that iq deficit may be a precursor , rather than result , of cannabis use , and that social and environmental factors are a likely influence regular cannabis use has not been shown to cause significant abnormalities in lung function light and moderate use of cannabis is not believed to increase risk of lung or upper airway cancer evidence for causing these cancers is mixed concerning heavy , long-term use in general there are far lower risks of pulmonary complications for regular cannabis smokers when compared with those of tobacco combustion products are not present when using a vaporizer , consuming thc in pill form , or consuming cannabis edibles there is serious suspicion among cardiologists , spurring research but falling short of definitive proof , that cannabis use has the potential to contribute to cardiovascular disease these putative effects can be taken in context of a wide range of cardiovascular phenomena regulated by the endocannabinoid system and an overall role of cannabis in causing decreased peripheral resistance and increased cardiac output , which potentially could pose a threat to those with cardiovascular disease cannabis usually causes no tolerance or withdrawal symptoms except in heavy users the rate goes up to one in six among those who begin use as adolescents , and one-quarter to one-half of those who use it daily according to a nida review the extent of this impact may be greater in novice users , and paradoxically , those habituated to high-level ingestion may have reduced cognition during withdrawal a second systematic review focused on neuroimaging studies found little evidence supporting an effect of cannabis use on brain structure and function a 2005 meta analysis concluded that adolescent use of cannabis increases the risk of psychosis , and that the risk is dose-related a french review from 2009 came to a conclusion that cannabis use , particularly that before age 15 , was a factor in the development of schizophrenic disorders the genus cannabis contains two species which produce useful amounts of psychoactive cannabinoids : cannabis indica and cannabis sativa , which are listed as schedule i medicinal plants in the us ; a third species , cannabis ruderalis , has few psychogenic properties cannabis contains more than 460 compounds ; at least 80 of these are cannabinoids â€“ chemical compounds that interact with cannabinoid receptors in the brain the most psychoactive cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant is tetrahydrocannabinol ( or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol , commonly known as thc ) cb1 and cb2 are the primary cannabinoid receptors responsible for several of the effects of cannabinoids , although other receptors may play a role as well cannabis began to attract renewed interest as medicine in the 1970s and 1980s , in particular due to its use by cancer and aids patients who reported relief from the effects of chemotherapy and cachexia in the us , the fda has approved two oral cannabinoids for use as medicine : dronabinol and nabilone relative to inhaled consumption , peak concentration of oral thc is delayed , and it may be difficult to determine optimal dosage because of variability in patient absorption for reasons including increased popular support of cannabis use , a trend of cannabis legalization , and the perception of medical usefulness , more scientists are doing medical cannabis research

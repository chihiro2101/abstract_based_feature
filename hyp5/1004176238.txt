the number of active chemicals in cannabis is one reason why treatment with cannabis is difficult to classify and study overall research into the health effects of medical cannabis has been of low quality and it is not clear whether it is a useful treatment for any condition , or whether harms outweight any benefit low quality evidence suggests its use for reducing nausea during chemotherapy , improving appetite in hiv/aids , improving sleep , and improving tics in tourette syndrome it is unclear whether american states might be able to mitigate the adverse effects of the opioid epidemic by prescribing medical cannabis as an alternative pain management drug medical cannabis is somewhat effective in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting ( cinv ) and may be a reasonable option in those who do not improve following preferential treatment long-term cannabis use may cause nausea and vomiting , a condition known as cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome ( chs ) a 2016 cochrane review said that cannabinoids were '' probably effective '' in treating chemotherapy-induced nausea in children , but with a high side-effect profile ( mainly drowsiness , dizziness , altered moods , and increased appetite ) evidence is lacking for both efficacy and safety of cannabis and cannabinoids in treating patients with hiv/aids or for anorexia associated with aids research into the use of cannabis for treating chronic pain has yielded inconsistent results for neuropathic pain , spasms associated with multiple sclerosis and pain from rheumatic disorders cannabis is not effective at treating chronic cancer pain a 2011 review considered cannabis to be generally safe , and it appears safer than opioids in palliative care cannabis ' efficacy is not clear in treating neurological problems , including multiple sclerosis ( ms ) and movement problems evidence also suggests that oral cannabis extract is effective for reducing patient-centered measures of spasticity a trial of cannabis is deemed to be a reasonable option if other treatments have not been effective in the united states , cannabidiol , one of the cannabinoids found in the marijuana plant , has been approved for treating two severe forms of epilepsy , lennox-gastaut syndrome and dravet syndrome there is no good evidence that medical cannabis is effective for treating posttraumatic stress disorder , and its use for this purpose is not recommended there is insufficient data to draw strong conclusions about the safety of medical cannabis typically , adverse effects of medical cannabis use are not serious ; they include tiredness , dizziness , increased appetite , and cardiovascular and psychoactive effects other effects can include impaired short-term memory ; impaired motor coordination ; altered judgment ; and paranoia or psychosis at high doses although supporters of medical cannabis say that it is safe , further research is required to assess the long-term safety of its use acute effects may include anxiety and panic , impaired attention , and memory ( while intoxicated ) , an increased risk of psychotic symptoms , and possibly increased risk of accidents if a person drives a motor vehicle while intoxicated according to the united states department of health and human services , there were 455,000 emergency room visits associated with cannabis use in 2011 these statistics include visits in which the patient was treated for a condition induced by or related to recent cannabis use effects of chronic use may include bronchitis , a cannabis dependence syndrome , and subtle impairments of attention and memory compared to non-smokers , people who smoked cannabis regularly in adolescence exhibit reduced connectivity in specific brain regions associated with memory , learning , alertness , and executive function a follow-up review found that iq deficit may be a precursor , rather than result , of cannabis use , and that social and environmental factors are a likely influence this tar is chemically similar to that found in tobacco smoke , and over fifty known carcinogens have been identified in cannabis smoke , including nitrosamines , reactive aldehydes , and polycyclic hydrocarbons , including benzapyrene light and moderate use of cannabis is not believed to increase risk of lung or upper airway cancer combustion products are not present when using a vaporizer , consuming thc in pill form , or consuming cannabis edibles there is serious suspicion among cardiologists , spurring research but falling short of definitive proof , that cannabis use has the potential to contribute to cardiovascular disease cannabis is believed to be an aggravating factor in rare cases of arteritis , a serious condition that in some cases leads to amputation other serious cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction , stroke , sudden cardiac death , and cardiomyopathy have been reported to be temporally associated with cannabis use in a survey of heavy users 42.4 % experienced withdrawal symptoms when they tried to quit marijuana such as craving , irritability , boredom , anxiety and sleep disturbances the rate goes up to one in six among those who begin use as adolescents , and one-quarter to one-half of those who use it daily according to a nida review a 2013 review estimates daily use is associated with a 10-20 % rate of dependence thc intoxication is well established to impair cognitive functioning on an acute basis , including effects on the ability to plan , organize , solve problems , make decisions , and control impulses a 2005 meta analysis concluded that adolescent use of cannabis increases the risk of psychosis , and that the risk is dose-related the most psychoactive cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant is tetrahydrocannabinol ( or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol , commonly known as thc ) cb1 and cb2 are the primary cannabinoid receptors responsible for several of the effects of cannabinoids , although other receptors may play a role as well oral administration has the lowest bioavailability of approximately 6 % , variable absorption depending on the vehicle used , and the longest time to peak plasma levels ( 2 to 6 hours ) compared to smoked or vaporized thc similar to thc , cbd has poor oral bioavailability , approximately 6 % sublingual administration in rabbits yielded bioavailability of 16 % and time to peak concentration of 4 hours smoking and inhalation of vaporized cannabis have better absorption than do other routes of administration , and therefore also have more predictable distribution thc further distributes into fatty tissues a few days after administration due to its high lipophilicity , and is found deposited in the spleen and fat after redistribution delta-9-thc is the primary molecule responsible for the effects of cannabis inhaled cannabis can result in thc going directly to the brain , where it then travels from the brain back to the liver in recirculation for metabolism in the united states , the use of cannabis for medical purposes is legal in 35 states , four out of five permanently inhabited u.s medical cannabis research includes any medical research on using cannabis as a treatment for any medical condition

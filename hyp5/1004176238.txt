the national institute on drug abuse defines medical cannabis as '' using the whole , unprocessed marijuana plant or its basic extracts to treat symptoms of illness and other conditions '' a cannabis plant includes more than 400 different chemicals , of which about 70 are cannabinoids a 2014 review stated that the variations in ratio of cbd-to-thc in botanical and pharmaceutical preparations determines the therapeutic vs psychoactive effects ( cbd attenuates thc 's psychoactive effects ) of cannabis products overall research into the health effects of medical cannabis has been of low quality and it is not clear whether it is a useful treatment for any condition , or whether harms outweight any benefit it is unclear whether american states might be able to mitigate the adverse effects of the opioid epidemic by prescribing medical cannabis as an alternative pain management drug medical cannabis is somewhat effective in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting ( cinv ) and may be a reasonable option in those who do not improve following preferential treatment comparative studies have found cannabinoids to be more effective than some conventional antiemetics such as prochlorperazine , promethazine , and metoclopramide in controlling cinv , but these are used less frequently because of side effects including dizziness , dysphoria , and hallucinations long-term cannabis use may cause nausea and vomiting , a condition known as cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome ( chs ) evidence is lacking for both efficacy and safety of cannabis and cannabinoids in treating patients with hiv/aids or for anorexia associated with aids research into the use of cannabis for treating chronic pain has yielded inconsistent results for neuropathic pain , spasms associated with multiple sclerosis and pain from rheumatic disorders a 2011 review considered cannabis to be generally safe , and it appears safer than opioids in palliative care evidence also suggests that oral cannabis extract is effective for reducing patient-centered measures of spasticity its use for ms is approved in ten countries in the united states , cannabidiol , one of the cannabinoids found in the marijuana plant , has been approved for treating two severe forms of epilepsy , lennox-gastaut syndrome and dravet syndrome there is no good evidence that medical cannabis is effective for treating posttraumatic stress disorder , and its use for this purpose is not recommended other effects can include impaired short-term memory ; impaired motor coordination ; altered judgment ; and paranoia or psychosis at high doses the amount of cannabis normally used for medicinal purposes is not believed to cause any permanent cognitive impairment in adults , though long-term treatment in adolescents should be weighed carefully as they are more susceptible to these impairments withdrawal symptoms are rarely a problem with controlled medical administration of cannabinoids tetrahydrocannabinol ( thc ) , the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant , has low toxicity while the ld50 ( dose of thc needed to kill 50 % of tested rodents ) is high psychotic episodes are well-documented and typically resolve within minutes or hours these statistics include visits in which the patient was treated for a condition induced by or related to recent cannabis use the drug use must be '' implicated '' in the emergency department visit , but does not need to be the direct cause of the visit compared to non-smokers , people who smoked cannabis regularly in adolescence exhibit reduced connectivity in specific brain regions associated with memory , learning , alertness , and executive function there has been a limited amount of studies that have looked at the effects of smoking cannabis on the respiratory system this tar is chemically similar to that found in tobacco smoke , and over fifty known carcinogens have been identified in cannabis smoke , including nitrosamines , reactive aldehydes , and polycyclic hydrocarbons , including benzapyrene light and moderate use of cannabis is not believed to increase risk of lung or upper airway cancer there is serious suspicion among cardiologists , spurring research but falling short of definitive proof , that cannabis use has the potential to contribute to cardiovascular disease cannabis is believed to be an aggravating factor in rare cases of arteritis , a serious condition that in some cases leads to amputation because 97 % of case-reports also smoked tobacco , a formal association with cannabis could not be made other serious cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction , stroke , sudden cardiac death , and cardiomyopathy have been reported to be temporally associated with cannabis use research in these events is complicated because cannabis is often used in conjunction with tobacco , and drugs such as alcohol and cocaine cannabis usually causes no tolerance or withdrawal symptoms except in heavy users in a survey of heavy users 42.4 % experienced withdrawal symptoms when they tried to quit marijuana such as craving , irritability , boredom , anxiety and sleep disturbances a 2013 review estimates daily use is associated with a 10-20 % rate of dependence there are numerous other reasons why people look for medical cannabis and to make people aware of whether they are eligible to accept medical cannabis as a dose , there are numerous websites that are currently providing online consultations through video calling people are provided licenses with the help of which , they can either grow medical cannabis , or purchase it legally throughout the state thc intoxication is well established to impair cognitive functioning on an acute basis , including effects on the ability to plan , organize , solve problems , make decisions , and control impulses the extent of this impact may be greater in novice users , and paradoxically , those habituated to high-level ingestion may have reduced cognition during withdrawal a second systematic review focused on neuroimaging studies found little evidence supporting an effect of cannabis use on brain structure and function a 2005 meta analysis concluded that adolescent use of cannabis increases the risk of psychosis , and that the risk is dose-related a 2004 literature review on the subject concluded that cannabis use is associated with a two-fold increase in the risk of psychosis , but that cannabis use is '' neither necessary nor sufficient '' to cause psychosis . other potential long-term effects the genus cannabis contains two species which produce useful amounts of psychoactive cannabinoids : cannabis indica and cannabis sativa , which are listed as schedule i medicinal plants in the us ; a third species , cannabis ruderalis , has few psychogenic properties the most psychoactive cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant is tetrahydrocannabinol ( or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol , commonly known as thc ) marijuana vending machines for selling or dispensing cannabis are in use in the united states and are planned to be used in canada the report authors suggested rather that medical cannabis users occupied a '' continuum '' between medical and nonmedical use nabiximols , an oromucosal spray derived from two strains of cannabis sativa and containing thc and cbd , is not approved in the united states , but is approved in several european countries , canada , and new zealand as of 2013 medical cannabis research includes any medical research on using cannabis as a treatment for any medical condition

the national institute on drug abuse defines medical cannabis as '' using the whole , unprocessed marijuana plant or its basic extracts to treat symptoms of illness and other conditions '' a cannabis plant includes more than 400 different chemicals , of which about 70 are cannabinoids the number of active chemicals in cannabis is one reason why treatment with cannabis is difficult to classify and study overall research into the health effects of medical cannabis has been of low quality and it is not clear whether it is a useful treatment for any condition , or whether harms outweight any benefit low quality evidence suggests its use for reducing nausea during chemotherapy , improving appetite in hiv/aids , improving sleep , and improving tics in tourette syndrome it is unclear whether american states might be able to mitigate the adverse effects of the opioid epidemic by prescribing medical cannabis as an alternative pain management drug medical cannabis is somewhat effective in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting ( cinv ) and may be a reasonable option in those who do not improve following preferential treatment comparative studies have found cannabinoids to be more effective than some conventional antiemetics such as prochlorperazine , promethazine , and metoclopramide in controlling cinv , but these are used less frequently because of side effects including dizziness , dysphoria , and hallucinations long-term cannabis use may cause nausea and vomiting , a condition known as cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome ( chs ) a 2016 cochrane review said that cannabinoids were '' probably effective '' in treating chemotherapy-induced nausea in children , but with a high side-effect profile ( mainly drowsiness , dizziness , altered moods , and increased appetite ) less common side effects were '' ocular problems , orthostatic hypotension , muscle twitching , pruritus , vagueness , hallucinations , lightheadedness and dry mouth '' evidence is lacking for both efficacy and safety of cannabis and cannabinoids in treating patients with hiv/aids or for anorexia associated with aids cannabis ' efficacy is not clear in treating neurological problems , including multiple sclerosis ( ms ) and movement problems evidence also suggests that oral cannabis extract is effective for reducing patient-centered measures of spasticity in the united states , cannabidiol , one of the cannabinoids found in the marijuana plant , has been approved for treating two severe forms of epilepsy , lennox-gastaut syndrome and dravet syndrome there is insufficient data to draw strong conclusions about the safety of medical cannabis typically , adverse effects of medical cannabis use are not serious ; they include tiredness , dizziness , increased appetite , and cardiovascular and psychoactive effects the amount of cannabis normally used for medicinal purposes is not believed to cause any permanent cognitive impairment in adults , though long-term treatment in adolescents should be weighed carefully as they are more susceptible to these impairments withdrawal symptoms are rarely a problem with controlled medical administration of cannabinoids although supporters of medical cannabis say that it is safe , further research is required to assess the long-term safety of its use tetrahydrocannabinol ( thc ) , the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant , has low toxicity while the ld50 ( dose of thc needed to kill 50 % of tested rodents ) is high according to the united states department of health and human services , there were 455,000 emergency room visits associated with cannabis use in 2011 one study suggested that sustained heavy , daily , adolescent onset cannabis use over decades is associated with a decline in iq by age 38 , with no effects found in those who initiated cannabis use later , or in those who ceased use earlier in adulthood a follow-up review found that iq deficit may be a precursor , rather than result , of cannabis use , and that social and environmental factors are a likely influence there has been a limited amount of studies that have looked at the effects of smoking cannabis on the respiratory system chronic heavy marijuana smoking is associated with coughing , production of sputum , wheezing , coughing , and other symptoms of chronic bronchitis regular cannabis use has not been shown to cause significant abnormalities in lung function light and moderate use of cannabis is not believed to increase risk of lung or upper airway cancer evidence for causing these cancers is mixed concerning heavy , long-term use in general there are far lower risks of pulmonary complications for regular cannabis smokers when compared with those of tobacco combustion products are not present when using a vaporizer , consuming thc in pill form , or consuming cannabis edibles there is serious suspicion among cardiologists , spurring research but falling short of definitive proof , that cannabis use has the potential to contribute to cardiovascular disease cannabis usually causes no tolerance or withdrawal symptoms except in heavy users the rate goes up to one in six among those who begin use as adolescents , and one-quarter to one-half of those who use it daily according to a nida review people are provided licenses with the help of which , they can either grow medical cannabis , or purchase it legally throughout the state a second systematic review focused on neuroimaging studies found little evidence supporting an effect of cannabis use on brain structure and function a 2003 meta-analysis concluded that any long-term cognitive effects were relatively modest in magnitude and limited to certain aspects of learning and memory exposure to thc can cause acute transient psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals and people with schizophrenia a 2007 meta analysis concluded that cannabis use reduced the average age of onset of psychosis by 2.7 years relative to non-cannabis use a 2005 meta analysis concluded that adolescent use of cannabis increases the risk of psychosis , and that the risk is dose-related a 2004 literature review on the subject concluded that cannabis use is associated with a two-fold increase in the risk of psychosis , but that cannabis use is '' neither necessary nor sufficient '' to cause psychosis a 2008 national institutes of health study of 19 chronic heavy marijuana users with cardiac and cerebral abnormalities ( averaging 28 & nbsp ; g to 272 & nbsp ; g ( 1 to 9+ oz ) weekly ) and 24 controls found elevated levels of apolipoprotein c3 ( apoc-iii ) in the chronic smokers smoking has been the means of administration of cannabis for many users , but it is not suitable for the use of cannabis as a medicine the ancient egyptians used hemp ( cannabis ) in suppositories for relieving the pain of hemorrhoids harvesting the plant led to the spread of cannabis throughout eurasia about 10,000 to 5,000 years ago , with further distribution to the middle east and africa about 2,000 to 500 years ago countries with the most relaxed policies include canada , uruguay , and the netherlands , where cannabis can be purchased without need for a prescription organizations that oppose the legalization of medical cannabis include the american academy of pediatrics and american psychiatric association for reasons including increased popular support of cannabis use , a trend of cannabis legalization , and the perception of medical usefulness , more scientists are doing medical cannabis research

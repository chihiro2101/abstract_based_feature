the national institute on drug abuse defines medical cannabis as '' using the whole , unprocessed marijuana plant or its basic extracts to treat symptoms of illness and other conditions '' the number of active chemicals in cannabis is one reason why treatment with cannabis is difficult to classify and study a 2014 review stated that the variations in ratio of cbd-to-thc in botanical and pharmaceutical preparations determines the therapeutic vs psychoactive effects ( cbd attenuates thc 's psychoactive effects ) of cannabis products overall research into the health effects of medical cannabis has been of low quality and it is not clear whether it is a useful treatment for any condition , or whether harms outweight any benefit there is no consistent evidence that it helps with chronic pain and spasticity low quality evidence suggests its use for reducing nausea during chemotherapy , improving appetite in hiv/aids , improving sleep , and improving tics in tourette syndrome it is unclear whether american states might be able to mitigate the adverse effects of the opioid epidemic by prescribing medical cannabis as an alternative pain management drug medical cannabis is somewhat effective in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting ( cinv ) and may be a reasonable option in those who do not improve following preferential treatment long-term cannabis use may cause nausea and vomiting , a condition known as cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome ( chs ) a 2016 cochrane review said that cannabinoids were '' probably effective '' in treating chemotherapy-induced nausea in children , but with a high side-effect profile ( mainly drowsiness , dizziness , altered moods , and increased appetite ) evidence is lacking for both efficacy and safety of cannabis and cannabinoids in treating patients with hiv/aids or for anorexia associated with aids research into the use of cannabis for treating chronic pain has yielded inconsistent results for neuropathic pain , spasms associated with multiple sclerosis and pain from rheumatic disorders when cannabis is inhaled to relieve pain , blood levels of cannabinoids rise faster than when oral products are used , peaking within three minutes and attaining an analgesic effect in seven minutes cannabis ' efficacy is not clear in treating neurological problems , including multiple sclerosis ( ms ) and movement problems in the united states , cannabidiol , one of the cannabinoids found in the marijuana plant , has been approved for treating two severe forms of epilepsy , lennox-gastaut syndrome and dravet syndrome there is no good evidence that medical cannabis is effective for treating posttraumatic stress disorder , and its use for this purpose is not recommended typically , adverse effects of medical cannabis use are not serious ; they include tiredness , dizziness , increased appetite , and cardiovascular and psychoactive effects other effects can include impaired short-term memory ; impaired motor coordination ; altered judgment ; and paranoia or psychosis at high doses tetrahydrocannabinol ( thc ) , the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant , has low toxicity while the ld50 ( dose of thc needed to kill 50 % of tested rodents ) is high according to the united states department of health and human services , there were 455,000 emergency room visits associated with cannabis use in 2011 effects of chronic use may include bronchitis , a cannabis dependence syndrome , and subtle impairments of attention and memory compared to non-smokers , people who smoked cannabis regularly in adolescence exhibit reduced connectivity in specific brain regions associated with memory , learning , alertness , and executive function one study suggested that sustained heavy , daily , adolescent onset cannabis use over decades is associated with a decline in iq by age 38 , with no effects found in those who initiated cannabis use later , or in those who ceased use earlier in adulthood a follow-up review found that iq deficit may be a precursor , rather than result , of cannabis use , and that social and environmental factors are a likely influence there has been a limited amount of studies that have looked at the effects of smoking cannabis on the respiratory system regular cannabis use has not been shown to cause significant abnormalities in lung function light and moderate use of cannabis is not believed to increase risk of lung or upper airway cancer because 97 % of case-reports also smoked tobacco , a formal association with cannabis could not be made these putative effects can be taken in context of a wide range of cardiovascular phenomena regulated by the endocannabinoid system and an overall role of cannabis in causing decreased peripheral resistance and increased cardiac output , which potentially could pose a threat to those with cardiovascular disease a 2013 review estimates daily use is associated with a 10-20 % rate of dependence the highest risk of cannabis dependence is found in those with a history of poor academic achievement , deviant behavior in childhood and adolescence , rebelliousness , poor parental relationships , or a parental history of drug and alcohol problems there are numerous other reasons why people look for medical cannabis and to make people aware of whether they are eligible to accept medical cannabis as a dose , there are numerous websites that are currently providing online consultations through video calling a 2011 systematic review evaluated published studies of the acute and long-term cognitive effects of cannabis studies of long-term effects on cognition have provided conflicting results , with some studies finding no difference between long-term abstainers and never-users and others finding long-term deficits the discrepancies between studies may reflect greater long-term effects among heavier users relative to occasional users , and greater duration of effect among those with heavy use as adolescents compared to later in life a second systematic review focused on neuroimaging studies found little evidence supporting an effect of cannabis use on brain structure and function exposure to thc can cause acute transient psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals and people with schizophrenia a 2004 literature review on the subject concluded that cannabis use is associated with a two-fold increase in the risk of psychosis , but that cannabis use is '' neither necessary nor sufficient '' to cause psychosis a french review from 2009 came to a conclusion that cannabis use , particularly that before age 15 , was a factor in the development of schizophrenic disorders the genus cannabis contains two species which produce useful amounts of psychoactive cannabinoids : cannabis indica and cannabis sativa , which are listed as schedule i medicinal plants in the us ; a third species , cannabis ruderalis , has few psychogenic properties similar to thc , cbd has poor oral bioavailability , approximately 6 % smoking and inhalation of vaporized cannabis have better absorption than do other routes of administration , and therefore also have more predictable distribution smoking has been the means of administration of cannabis for many users , but it is not suitable for the use of cannabis as a medicine in the united states , the legality of medical cannabis varies by state cannabis remains illegal at the federal level under the controlled substances act , which classifies it as a schedule i drug with a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use in the us , the fda has approved two oral cannabinoids for use as medicine : dronabinol and nabilone for reasons including increased popular support of cannabis use , a trend of cannabis legalization , and the perception of medical usefulness , more scientists are doing medical cannabis research medical cannabis is unusually broad as a treatment for many conditions , each of which has its own state of research

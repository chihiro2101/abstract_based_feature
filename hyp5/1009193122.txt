galvanic corrosion occurs when two different metals have physical or electrical contact with each other and are immersed in a common electrolyte , or when the same metal is exposed to electrolyte with different concentrations in a galvanic cell , the more active metal ( the anode ) corrodes at an accelerated rate and the more noble metal ( the cathode ) corrodes at a slower rate galvanic corrosion is of major interest to the marine industry and also anywhere water ( containing salts ) contacts pipes or metal structures factors such as relative size of anode , types of metal , and operating conditions ( temperature , humidity , salinity , etc the surface area ratio of the anode and cathode directly affects the corrosion rates of the materials galvanic corrosion is often prevented by the use of sacrificial anodes two metals in electrical contact share the same electrons , so that the '' tug-of-war '' at each surface is analogous to competition for free electrons between the two materials using the electrolyte as a host for the flow of ions in the same direction , the noble metal will take electrons from the active one often it is possible to chemically remove the products of corrosion corrosion removal should not be confused with electropolishing , which removes some layers of the underlying metal to make a smooth surface for example , phosphoric acid may also be used to electropolish copper but it does this by removing copper , not the products of copper corrosion the materials most resistant to corrosion are those for which corrosion is thermodynamics unfavorable any corrosion products of gold or platinum tend to decompose spontaneously into pure metal , which is why these elements can be found in metallic form on earth and have long been valued an extreme example is graphite , which releases large amounts of energy upon oxidation , but has such slow kinetics that it is effectively immune to electrochemical corrosion under normal conditions passivation refers to the spontaneous formation of an ultrathin film of corrosion products , known as a passive film , on the metal 's surface that act as a barrier to further oxidation the chemical composition and microstructure of a passive film are different from the underlying metal in the worst case , almost all of the surface will remain protected , but tiny local fluctuations will degrade the oxide film in a few critical points pitting remains among the most common and damaging forms of corrosion in passivated alloys , but it can be prevented by control of the alloy 's environment pitting results when a small hole , or cavity , forms in the metal , usually as a result of de-passivation of a small area this form of corrosion is often difficult to detect due to the fact that it is usually relatively small and may be covered and hidden by corrosion-produced compounds because of the elevated temperatures of welding and heat treatment , chromium carbides can form in the crystallite of stainless alloys this chemical reaction robs the material of chromium in the zone near the grain boundary , making those areas much less resistant to corrosion formation of a differential aeration cell leads to corrosion inside the crevices the susceptibility to crevice corrosion can be evaluated with astm standard procedures a critical crevice corrosion temperature is commonly used to rank a material 's resistance to crevice corrosion the iron sulfate coating will protect the steel from further reaction ; however , if hydrogen bubbles contact this coating , it will be removed high-temperature corrosion is chemical deterioration of a material ( typically a metal ) as a result of heating this non-galvanic form of corrosion can occur when a metal is subjected to a hot atmosphere containing oxygen , sulfur , or other compounds capable of oxidizing ( or assisting the oxidation of ) the material concerned microbial corrosion , or commonly known as microbiologically influenced corrosion ( mic ) , is a corrosion caused or promoted by microorganisms , usually chemoautotrophs in the presence of oxygen ( aerobic ) , some bacteria may directly oxidize iron to iron oxides and hydroxides , other bacteria oxidize sulfur and produce sulfuric acid causing biogenic sulfide corrosion concentration cells can form in the deposits of corrosion products , leading to localized corrosion the corrosion manifests itself as a break-up of bulk metal to metal powder controlled permeability formwork ( cpf ) is a method of preventing the corrosion of reinforcement by naturally enhancing the durability of the cover during concrete placement cathodic protection ( cp ) is a technique to control the corrosion of a metal surface by making that surface the cathode of an electrochemical cell

galvanic corrosion occurs when two different metals have physical or electrical contact with each other and are immersed in a common electrolyte , or when the same metal is exposed to electrolyte with different concentrations in a galvanic cell , the more active metal ( the anode ) corrodes at an accelerated rate and the more noble metal ( the cathode ) corrodes at a slower rate for example , zinc is often used as a sacrificial anode for steel structures galvanic corrosion is of major interest to the marine industry and also anywhere water ( containing salts ) contacts pipes or metal structures the surface area ratio of the anode and cathode directly affects the corrosion rates of the materials galvanic corrosion is often prevented by the use of sacrificial anodes in any given environment ( one standard medium is aerated , room-temperature seawater ) , one metal will be either more noble or more active than others , based on how strongly its ions are bound to the surface two metals in electrical contact share the same electrons , so that the '' tug-of-war '' at each surface is analogous to competition for free electrons between the two materials this hierarchy is called a galvanic series and is useful in predicting and understanding corrosion often it is possible to chemically remove the products of corrosion corrosion removal should not be confused with electropolishing , which removes some layers of the underlying metal to make a smooth surface for example , phosphoric acid may also be used to electropolish copper but it does this by removing copper , not the products of copper corrosion the materials most resistant to corrosion are those for which corrosion is thermodynamics unfavorable any corrosion products of gold or platinum tend to decompose spontaneously into pure metal , which is why these elements can be found in metallic form on earth and have long been valued while corrosion of these metals is continuous and ongoing , it happens at an acceptably slow rate an extreme example is graphite , which releases large amounts of energy upon oxidation , but has such slow kinetics that it is effectively immune to electrochemical corrosion under normal conditions passivation refers to the spontaneous formation of an ultrathin film of corrosion products , known as a passive film , on the metal 's surface that act as a barrier to further oxidation passivation in natural environments such as air , water and soil at moderate ph is seen in such materials as aluminium , stainless steel , titanium , and silicon if breakdown occurs in the passive film due to chemical or mechanical factors , the resulting major modes of corrosion may include pitting corrosion , crevice corrosion , and stress corrosion cracking in the worst case , almost all of the surface will remain protected , but tiny local fluctuations will degrade the oxide film in a few critical points corrosion at these points will be greatly amplified , and can cause corrosion pits of several types , depending upon conditions this area becomes anodic , while part of the remaining metal becomes cathodic , producing a localized galvanic reaction this form of corrosion is often difficult to detect due to the fact that it is usually relatively small and may be covered and hidden by corrosion-produced compounds this chemical reaction robs the material of chromium in the zone near the grain boundary , making those areas much less resistant to corrosion this creates a galvanic couple with the well-protected alloy nearby , which leads to '' weld decay '' ( corrosion of the grain boundaries in the heat affected zones ) in highly corrosive environments as its name implies , corrosion is limited to a very narrow zone adjacent to the weld , often only a few micrometers across , making it even less noticeable crevice corrosion is a localized form of corrosion occurring in confined spaces ( crevices ) , to which the access of the working fluid from the environment is limited such high-temperature corrosion products , in the form of compacted oxide layer glazes , prevent or reduce wear during high-temperature sliding contact of metallic ( or metallic and ceramic ) surfaces in the presence of oxygen ( aerobic ) , some bacteria may directly oxidize iron to iron oxides and hydroxides , other bacteria oxidize sulfur and produce sulfuric acid causing biogenic sulfide corrosion concentration cells can form in the deposits of corrosion products , leading to localized corrosion metal dusting is a catastrophic form of corrosion that occurs when susceptible materials are exposed to environments with high carbon activities , such as synthesis gas and other high-co environments this graphite layer is then thought to form metastable m 3 c species ( where m is the metal ) , which migrate away from the metal surface cathodic protection ( cp ) is a technique to control the corrosion of a metal surface by making that surface the cathode of an electrochemical cell these include high silicon cast iron , graphite , mixed metal oxide or platinum coated titanium or niobium coated rod and wires

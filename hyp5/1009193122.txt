galvanic corrosion occurs when two different metals have physical or electrical contact with each other and are immersed in a common electrolyte , or when the same metal is exposed to electrolyte with different concentrations in a galvanic cell , the more active metal ( the anode ) corrodes at an accelerated rate and the more noble metal ( the cathode ) corrodes at a slower rate what type of metal ( s ) to use is readily determined by following the galvanic series for example , zinc is often used as a sacrificial anode for steel structures galvanic corrosion is of major interest to the marine industry and also anywhere water ( containing salts ) contacts pipes or metal structures the surface area ratio of the anode and cathode directly affects the corrosion rates of the materials galvanic corrosion is often prevented by the use of sacrificial anodes the resulting mass flow or electric current can be measured to establish a hierarchy of materials in the medium of interest often it is possible to chemically remove the products of corrosion for example , phosphoric acid in the form of naval jelly is often applied to ferrous tools or surfaces to remove rust corrosion removal should not be confused with electropolishing , which removes some layers of the underlying metal to make a smooth surface for example , phosphoric acid may also be used to electropolish copper but it does this by removing copper , not the products of copper corrosion some metals are more intrinsically resistant to corrosion than others ( for some examples , see galvanic series ) the materials most resistant to corrosion are those for which corrosion is thermodynamics unfavorable any corrosion products of gold or platinum tend to decompose spontaneously into pure metal , which is why these elements can be found in metallic form on earth and have long been valued passivation refers to the spontaneous formation of an ultrathin film of corrosion products , known as a passive film , on the metal 's surface that act as a barrier to further oxidation the chemical composition and microstructure of a passive film are different from the underlying metal the passive film is different from oxide layers that are formed upon heating and are in the micrometer thickness range â€“ the passive film recovers if removed or damaged whereas the oxide layer does not passivation in natural environments such as air , water and soil at moderate ph is seen in such materials as aluminium , stainless steel , titanium , and silicon passivation is extremely useful in mitigating corrosion damage , however even a high-quality alloy will corrode if its ability to form a passivating film is hindered if breakdown occurs in the passive film due to chemical or mechanical factors , the resulting major modes of corrosion may include pitting corrosion , crevice corrosion , and stress corrosion cracking corrosion at these points will be greatly amplified , and can cause corrosion pits of several types , depending upon conditions pitting remains among the most common and damaging forms of corrosion in passivated alloys , but it can be prevented by control of the alloy 's environment this chemical reaction robs the material of chromium in the zone near the grain boundary , making those areas much less resistant to corrosion formation of a differential aeration cell leads to corrosion inside the crevices a critical crevice corrosion temperature is commonly used to rank a material 's resistance to crevice corrosion for example , when sulfuric acid 2 4 ) flows through steel pipes , the iron in the steel reacts with the acid to form a passivation coating of iron sulfate 4 ) and hydrogen gas 2 ) high-temperature corrosion is chemical deterioration of a material ( typically a metal ) as a result of heating the products of high-temperature corrosion can potentially be turned to the advantage of the engineer microbial corrosion , or commonly known as microbiologically influenced corrosion ( mic ) , is a corrosion caused or promoted by microorganisms , usually chemoautotrophs concentration cells can form in the deposits of corrosion products , leading to localized corrosion the corrosion manifests itself as a break-up of bulk metal to metal powder these chemicals form an electrically insulating or chemically impermeable coating on exposed metal surfaces , to suppress electrochemical reactions cathodic protection ( cp ) is a technique to control the corrosion of a metal surface by making that surface the cathode of an electrochemical cell

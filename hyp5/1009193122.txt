galvanic corrosion occurs when two different metals have physical or electrical contact with each other and are immersed in a common electrolyte , or when the same metal is exposed to electrolyte with different concentrations in a galvanic cell , the more active metal ( the anode ) corrodes at an accelerated rate and the more noble metal ( the cathode ) corrodes at a slower rate for example , zinc is often used as a sacrificial anode for steel structures galvanic corrosion is of major interest to the marine industry and also anywhere water ( containing salts ) contacts pipes or metal structures the surface area ratio of the anode and cathode directly affects the corrosion rates of the materials galvanic corrosion is often prevented by the use of sacrificial anodes using the electrolyte as a host for the flow of ions in the same direction , the noble metal will take electrons from the active one this hierarchy is called a galvanic series and is useful in predicting and understanding corrosion often it is possible to chemically remove the products of corrosion for example , phosphoric acid may also be used to electropolish copper but it does this by removing copper , not the products of copper corrosion some metals are more intrinsically resistant to corrosion than others ( for some examples , see galvanic series ) there are various ways of anti-corrosion ( oxidation ) including painting , hot dip galvanizing , cathodic protection , and combinations of these while corrosion of these metals is continuous and ongoing , it happens at an acceptably slow rate passivation refers to the spontaneous formation of an ultrathin film of corrosion products , known as a passive film , on the metal 's surface that act as a barrier to further oxidation on the other hand , unusual conditions may result in passivation of materials that are normally unprotected , as the alkaline environment of concrete does for steel rebar passivation is extremely useful in mitigating corrosion damage , however even a high-quality alloy will corrode if its ability to form a passivating film is hindered if breakdown occurs in the passive film due to chemical or mechanical factors , the resulting major modes of corrosion may include pitting corrosion , crevice corrosion , and stress corrosion cracking corrosion at these points will be greatly amplified , and can cause corrosion pits of several types , depending upon conditions pitting remains among the most common and damaging forms of corrosion in passivated alloys , but it can be prevented by control of the alloy 's environment stainless steel can pose special corrosion challenges , since its passivating behavior relies on the presence of a major alloying component ( chromium , at least 11.5 % ) a stainless steel is said to be '' sensitized '' if chromium carbides are formed in the microstructure crevice corrosion is a localized form of corrosion occurring in confined spaces ( crevices ) , to which the access of the working fluid from the environment is limited formation of a differential aeration cell leads to corrosion inside the crevices crevice corrosion is influenced by the crevice type ( metal-metal , metal-nonmetal ) , crevice geometry ( size , surface finish ) , and metallurgical and environmental factors high-temperature corrosion is chemical deterioration of a material ( typically a metal ) as a result of heating this non-galvanic form of corrosion can occur when a metal is subjected to a hot atmosphere containing oxygen , sulfur , or other compounds capable of oxidizing ( or assisting the oxidation of ) the material concerned the products of high-temperature corrosion can potentially be turned to the advantage of the engineer concentration cells can form in the deposits of corrosion products , leading to localized corrosion accelerated low-water corrosion ( alwc ) is a particularly aggressive form of mic that affects steel piles in seawater near the low water tide mark it is characterized by an orange sludge , which smells of hydrogen sulfide when treated with acid corrosion rates can be very high and design corrosion allowances can soon be exceeded leading to premature failure of the steel pile the corrosion manifests itself as a break-up of bulk metal to metal powder cathodic protection ( cp ) is a technique to control the corrosion of a metal surface by making that surface the cathode of an electrochemical cell hydrolytic class 2 ( type ii ) : this class usually contains sodium silicate glasses with a high hydrolytic resistance through surface finishing

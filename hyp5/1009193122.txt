galvanic corrosion occurs when two different metals have physical or electrical contact with each other and are immersed in a common electrolyte , or when the same metal is exposed to electrolyte with different concentrations in a galvanic cell , the more active metal ( the anode ) corrodes at an accelerated rate and the more noble metal ( the cathode ) corrodes at a slower rate what type of metal ( s ) to use is readily determined by following the galvanic series for example , zinc is often used as a sacrificial anode for steel structures galvanic corrosion is of major interest to the marine industry and also anywhere water ( containing salts ) contacts pipes or metal structures the surface area ratio of the anode and cathode directly affects the corrosion rates of the materials galvanic corrosion is often prevented by the use of sacrificial anodes corrosion removal should not be confused with electropolishing , which removes some layers of the underlying metal to make a smooth surface methods of protecting against corrosion piping technology & products , ( retrieved january 2012 ) any corrosion products of gold or platinum tend to decompose spontaneously into pure metal , which is why these elements can be found in metallic form on earth and have long been valued more common '' base '' metals can only be protected by more temporary means while corrosion of these metals is continuous and ongoing , it happens at an acceptably slow rate an extreme example is graphite , which releases large amounts of energy upon oxidation , but has such slow kinetics that it is effectively immune to electrochemical corrosion under normal conditions passivation refers to the spontaneous formation of an ultrathin film of corrosion products , known as a passive film , on the metal 's surface that act as a barrier to further oxidation the passive film is different from oxide layers that are formed upon heating and are in the micrometer thickness range â€“ the passive film recovers if removed or damaged whereas the oxide layer does not passivation in natural environments such as air , water and soil at moderate ph is seen in such materials as aluminium , stainless steel , titanium , and silicon if breakdown occurs in the passive film due to chemical or mechanical factors , the resulting major modes of corrosion may include pitting corrosion , crevice corrosion , and stress corrosion cracking corrosion at these points will be greatly amplified , and can cause corrosion pits of several types , depending upon conditions this area becomes anodic , while part of the remaining metal becomes cathodic , producing a localized galvanic reaction this form of corrosion is often difficult to detect due to the fact that it is usually relatively small and may be covered and hidden by corrosion-produced compounds stainless steel can pose special corrosion challenges , since its passivating behavior relies on the presence of a major alloying component ( chromium , at least 11.5 % ) this chemical reaction robs the material of chromium in the zone near the grain boundary , making those areas much less resistant to corrosion a typical microstructure of a normalized sae 304 stainless steel shows no signs of sensitization , while a heavily sensitized steel shows the presence of grain boundary precipitates as its name implies , corrosion is limited to a very narrow zone adjacent to the weld , often only a few micrometers across , making it even less noticeable crevice corrosion is a localized form of corrosion occurring in confined spaces ( crevices ) , to which the access of the working fluid from the environment is limited crevice corrosion is influenced by the crevice type ( metal-metal , metal-nonmetal ) , crevice geometry ( size , surface finish ) , and metallurgical and environmental factors a critical crevice corrosion temperature is commonly used to rank a material 's resistance to crevice corrosion in the chemical industry , hydrogen grooving is the corrosion of piping by grooves created by the interaction of a corrosive agent , corroded pipe constituents , and hydrogen gas bubbles the iron sulfate coating will protect the steel from further reaction ; however , if hydrogen bubbles contact this coating , it will be removed high-temperature corrosion is chemical deterioration of a material ( typically a metal ) as a result of heating concentration cells can form in the deposits of corrosion products , leading to localized corrosion cathodic protection ( cp ) is a technique to control the corrosion of a metal surface by making that surface the cathode of an electrochemical cell these include high silicon cast iron , graphite , mixed metal oxide or platinum coated titanium or niobium coated rod and wires glass of this class contains essential quantities of boron oxides , aluminium oxides and alkaline-earth oxide

galvanic corrosion occurs when two different metals have physical or electrical contact with each other and are immersed in a common electrolyte , or when the same metal is exposed to electrolyte with different concentrations in a galvanic cell , the more active metal ( the anode ) corrodes at an accelerated rate and the more noble metal ( the cathode ) corrodes at a slower rate galvanic corrosion is of major interest to the marine industry and also anywhere water ( containing salts ) contacts pipes or metal structures factors such as relative size of anode , types of metal , and operating conditions ( temperature , humidity , salinity , etc the surface area ratio of the anode and cathode directly affects the corrosion rates of the materials galvanic corrosion is often prevented by the use of sacrificial anodes this hierarchy is called a galvanic series and is useful in predicting and understanding corrosion often it is possible to chemically remove the products of corrosion corrosion removal should not be confused with electropolishing , which removes some layers of the underlying metal to make a smooth surface for example , phosphoric acid may also be used to electropolish copper but it does this by removing copper , not the products of copper corrosion there are various ways of anti-corrosion ( oxidation ) including painting , hot dip galvanizing , cathodic protection , and combinations of these methods of protecting against corrosion piping technology & products , ( retrieved january 2012 ) the materials most resistant to corrosion are those for which corrosion is thermodynamics unfavorable any corrosion products of gold or platinum tend to decompose spontaneously into pure metal , which is why these elements can be found in metallic form on earth and have long been valued some metals have naturally slow chemical kinetics , even though their corrosion is thermodynamically favorable while corrosion of these metals is continuous and ongoing , it happens at an acceptably slow rate an extreme example is graphite , which releases large amounts of energy upon oxidation , but has such slow kinetics that it is effectively immune to electrochemical corrosion under normal conditions passivation refers to the spontaneous formation of an ultrathin film of corrosion products , known as a passive film , on the metal 's surface that act as a barrier to further oxidation passivation in natural environments such as air , water and soil at moderate ph is seen in such materials as aluminium , stainless steel , titanium , and silicon if breakdown occurs in the passive film due to chemical or mechanical factors , the resulting major modes of corrosion may include pitting corrosion , crevice corrosion , and stress corrosion cracking corrosion at these points will be greatly amplified , and can cause corrosion pits of several types , depending upon conditions pitting results when a small hole , or cavity , forms in the metal , usually as a result of de-passivation of a small area this chemical reaction robs the material of chromium in the zone near the grain boundary , making those areas much less resistant to corrosion crevice corrosion is a localized form of corrosion occurring in confined spaces ( crevices ) , to which the access of the working fluid from the environment is limited a critical crevice corrosion temperature is commonly used to rank a material 's resistance to crevice corrosion the iron sulfate coating will protect the steel from further reaction ; however , if hydrogen bubbles contact this coating , it will be removed high-temperature corrosion is chemical deterioration of a material ( typically a metal ) as a result of heating this non-galvanic form of corrosion can occur when a metal is subjected to a hot atmosphere containing oxygen , sulfur , or other compounds capable of oxidizing ( or assisting the oxidation of ) the material concerned sulfate-reducing bacteria are active in the absence of oxygen ( anaerobic ) ; they produce hydrogen sulfide , causing sulfide stress cracking concentration cells can form in the deposits of corrosion products , leading to localized corrosion this graphite layer is then thought to form metastable m 3 c species ( where m is the metal ) , which migrate away from the metal surface these chemicals form an electrically insulating or chemically impermeable coating on exposed metal surfaces , to suppress electrochemical reactions cathodic protection ( cp ) is a technique to control the corrosion of a metal surface by making that surface the cathode of an electrochemical cell a simple test for measuring corrosion is the weight loss method

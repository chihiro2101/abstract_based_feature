the standard first degree for students studying arts or humanities in scotland is either a bachelor of arts or a master of arts ( the latter traditionally awarded by the ancient universities of scotland for a first degree in an arts/humanities subject ) the standard undergraduate degree for natural and social science subjects is the bachelor of science a general or ordinary degree ( ba/ma or bsc ) takes three years to complete ; an honours degree ( ba/ma hons or bsc hons ) takes four years the honours degree involves two years of study at a sub-honours level in which a range of subjects within the relevant faculty are studied and then two years of study at honours level which is specialised in a single field ( for example classics , history , chemistry , biology , etc not all universities in scotland adhere to this , in some you study in several subjects within a faculty for three years and can then specialise in two areas and attain a joint honours degree in fourth year this also reflects the broader scope of the final years of education in scotland , where traditionally five highers are studied , compared to ( typically ) three english or welsh a-levels the higher is a one-year qualification , as opposed to the two years of a-levels , which accounts for scottish honours degrees being a year longer than those in england postgraduate qualifications are not designated master of arts as in the rest of the uk , as this is an undergraduate degree postgraduate degrees in arts and humanities subjects are usually designated master of letters ( m.litt ) or , in natural and social sciences , master of science ( m.sc the postgraduate teaching qualification is the postgraduate diploma in education ( pgde ) postgraduate qualifications are classified into four classes : distinction credit merit pass bachelor 's degrees are normally three to four years in duration , more commonly three years in quebec ( where they follow on from college courses rather than directly from secondary education ) outside quebec , three-year bachelor 's degrees are normally ordinary degrees , while four-year bachelor 's degrees are honours degrees ; an honours degree is normally needed for further study at the master 's level master 's degrees take one to three years ( in quebec they normally take one and a half to two years ) once in university , students begin the carrera , the study of a precise academic branch like economics , business administration , sciences , law , engineering or medicine students will be in university for 8–10 semesters of full-time study , which typically takes 4–5 years several mexican universities offer students the possibility of obtaining an equivalent to an associate degree , called in mexico técnico superior universitario ( tsu ) , studying only half of the licenciatura , with the possibility of finishing a full bachelor 's degree later these courses last 4–12 months and are a means to further study without continuing to the next degree level , usually studied to demonstrate that the student still updated in his field most students stay at this level , but some choose to continue to the maestría , equivalent to the master 's degree study at the maestría level takes 1–3 years and mandates completion of a thesis post-graduate students in mexico typically enter a master 's program after a few years in the workforce and often continue working while studying in last years this schemes has become flexible such that in some phd programmes , students are accepted before or not completing at all a master course in the united states , since the late 19th century , the threefold degree system of bachelor , master and doctor has been in place , but has evolved into a slightly different pattern from the european equivalent department of education now classifies degrees in six categories : associate degrees , bachelor 's degrees , first professional degrees , master 's degrees , intermediate graduate qualifications and doctorates most standard academic programs are based on the four-year bachelor 's degree , most often bachelor of arts ( b.a ) made up 1.1 % ( not including ed.d.s classified as professional degrees rather than research doctorates ) and all other research doctorates were less than 1 % in total some schools , mostly junior colleges and community colleges and some four-year schools , offer an associate degree for two full years of study articulation agreements may allow credit earned on an associate degree to be counted toward completion of a bachelor 's degree first professional degrees require a minimum of two years prior college-level education to enter the program and a minimum of six years total college-level education ( including that undertaken prior to entry ) to complete the program most professional degree programs require a prior bachelor 's degree for admission and many require seven or eight years of total study first professional degrees should also not be confused with professional master 's degrees such as the m.arch , which are classified as master 's degrees , or with intermediate graduate qualifications that also bear the title of doctor , such as d.min oregon student assistance commission office of degree authorization ( oda ) : religious exempt schools such degrees are used primarily to attain church-related employment students , the media and the general public have shown much concern over the value of getting a higher degree in the us ever since the great recession of 2007 statistics citing that college graduates make around 1 million more in their lifetimes than those who did n't attend college and living longer , healthier lives work in favor of those who argue the continued value of higher degrees the australian qualifications framework ( aqf ) covers 10 levels , of which 6 – 10 correspond to academic degrees in australia , most degrees are issued ungraded , with bachelor 's degrees with honours being the exception doctorates in australia may be research doctorates ( normally titled phds ) or professional doctorates ( normally titled to refer to the field of practice , e.g individuals who hold either a bachelor 's degree , licentiate or technologist are eligible for admission into graduate courses leading to advanced master 's or doctor 's degrees postgraduate education follows conventions of the united states ( being named '' master 's '' and '' doctorate '' after the programs there ) the other sciences and arts degrees are under the competence of the department of education of the philippine republic

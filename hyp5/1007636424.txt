the standard first degree for students studying arts or humanities in scotland is either a bachelor of arts or a master of arts ( the latter traditionally awarded by the ancient universities of scotland for a first degree in an arts/humanities subject ) the standard undergraduate degree for natural and social science subjects is the bachelor of science students can work towards a first degree at either ordinary or honours level a general or ordinary degree ( ba/ma or bsc ) takes three years to complete ; an honours degree ( ba/ma hons or bsc hons ) takes four years the honours degree involves two years of study at a sub-honours level in which a range of subjects within the relevant faculty are studied and then two years of study at honours level which is specialised in a single field ( for example classics , history , chemistry , biology , etc not all universities in scotland adhere to this , in some you study in several subjects within a faculty for three years and can then specialise in two areas and attain a joint honours degree in fourth year this also reflects the broader scope of the final years of education in scotland , where traditionally five highers are studied , compared to ( typically ) three english or welsh a-levels the higher is a one-year qualification , as opposed to the two years of a-levels , which accounts for scottish honours degrees being a year longer than those in england postgraduate qualifications are not designated master of arts as in the rest of the uk , as this is an undergraduate degree non-doctoral postgraduate research degrees are usually designated master of philosophy ( m.phil outside quebec , three-year bachelor 's degrees are normally ordinary degrees , while four-year bachelor 's degrees are honours degrees ; an honours degree is normally needed for further study at the master 's level master 's degrees take one to three years ( in quebec they normally take one and a half to two years ) in canada , first professional degrees such as dds , md , pharmd and llb or jd are considered bachelor 's level qualifications , despite their often being named as if they were doctorates moreover , while a few other pre-university programs with various concentrations exist , many other technical/career programs are available depending on the college of choice the pre-university academic level is the bachillerato ( also called preparatoria ) , similar to high school after high school , students progress to university , where they study for a técnico superior universitario ( associate degree ) or a licenciatura ( bachelor ) , then a maestría ( master ) , then a doctorado ( doctorate ) once in university , students begin the carrera , the study of a precise academic branch like economics , business administration , sciences , law , engineering or medicine students will be in university for 8–10 semesters of full-time study , which typically takes 4–5 years upon graduation , students receive a licenciatura in their chosen subject area , which is equivalent to an american bachelor 's degree they can also get the degree of '' ingenieria '' or '' medico '' that refers to an engineer or md respectively several mexican universities offer students the possibility of obtaining an equivalent to an associate degree , called in mexico técnico superior universitario ( tsu ) , studying only half of the licenciatura , with the possibility of finishing a full bachelor 's degree later after receiving the licenciatura , students may take extra courses called diplomados ( similar to a certification but issued by a university ) most students stay at this level , but some choose to continue to the maestría , equivalent to the master 's degree study at the maestría level takes 1–3 years and mandates completion of a thesis post-graduate students in mexico typically enter a master 's program after a few years in the workforce and often continue working while studying doctoral study typically lasts 3–4 years in the united states , since the late 19th century , the threefold degree system of bachelor , master and doctor has been in place , but has evolved into a slightly different pattern from the european equivalent department of education now classifies degrees in six categories : associate degrees , bachelor 's degrees , first professional degrees , master 's degrees , intermediate graduate qualifications and doctorates ) , a one- or two-year master 's degree ( most often master of arts ( m.a ) made up 1.1 % ( not including ed.d.s classified as professional degrees rather than research doctorates ) and all other research doctorates were less than 1 % in total most professional degree programs require a prior bachelor 's degree for admission and many require seven or eight years of total study first professional degrees should also not be confused with professional master 's degrees such as the m.arch census reports that 10.5 million men have master 's degrees or higher , compared with 10.6 million women statistics citing that college graduates make around 1 million more in their lifetimes than those who did n't attend college and living longer , healthier lives work in favor of those who argue the continued value of higher degrees also included within the higher education system are graduate certificates and graduate diplomas , both of which are at level 8 ( honours degree level ) , as well as advanced diplomas , at level 6 ( associate degree level ) and diplomas at level 5 ( first year of a degree course ) bachelor of engineering or bachelor of medicine/bachelor of surgery ) may take longer than three years to complete and double bachelor 's degrees ( i.e however , the names given to qualifications at different levels are not the same and new zealand does not have associate degrees , thus only levels 7 – 10 correspond to academic degrees these are the bachelor 's degree ( level 7 ) , honours degree ( level 8 ) , master 's degree ( level 9 ) and the doctorate ( level 10 ) formal education after the bachelor 's degree is the master 's degree with the title of '' '' and doctorate degree known as '' '' ( doctorate ) in chile , there 's a distinction between academic degrees and professional titles : is the denomination given to an academic degree granted by a higher education institution recognized by the chilean mineduc ( ministry of education ) technical schools award the student with the title of técnico superior universitario ( university higher technician , to distinguish from science technician ) from this core pontifical universities confer degrees including : theology baccalaureate in sacred theology , sacrae theologiae baccalaureatus ( s.t.b

star control is a combination of a strategy game and real-time one-on-one ship combat simulator the ship combat is inspired by the classic game spacewar ! , while the turn-based strategy is inspired by paul reiche iii 's 1983 game archon players begin the game in one of 15 different scenarios on a rotating star map the goal is to move your ships across the galaxy , claim planets along the way , and finally destroy your opponent â€™ s star base the game offers different ships to pilot , which are deliberately imbalanced in ability ships typically have a unique firing attack , as well as some kind of secondary ability this ties into the strategic meta-game between combat , where the crew can be replenished at colonies star control is the first collaboration between paul reiche iii and fred ford the meeting was hosted at game designer greg johnson 's house , and one of the friends who encouraged the meeting was fantasy artist erol otus star control would base its combat sequences on the classic game spacewar ! , as well as the core experience of space combat game star raiders as ford and reiche were still building their workflow as a team , the game took on a more limited scope compared to the sequel the game was ultimately ported to the sega genesis , in a team led by fred ford when stardock became the top bidder atari 's star control assets , paul reiche indicated that he still owned the copyright in the original star control games , so stardock must have purchased the star control trademark reiche and ford echoed this understanding in their 2015 game developer conference interview , stating that stardock 's game would use the star control trademark only

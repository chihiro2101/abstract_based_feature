cupronickel alloys are used for marine applications marine applications for copper-nickel alloys due to their resistance to seawater corrosion , good fabricability , and their effectiveness in lowering macrofouling levels alloys ranging in composition from 90 % cu–10 % ni to 70 % cu–30 % ni are commonly specified in heat exchanger or condenser tubes in a wide variety of marine applications kobelco : copper alloy tubes for heat-exchanger ; shinko metal products , japan ; important marine applications for cupronickel include : shipbuilding and repair : hulls of boats and ships , seawater cooling , bilge and ballast , sanitary , fire fighting , inert gas , hydraulic and pneumatic chiller systems copper-nickel alloys in boat and ship hulls alloys in shipbuilding and repair desalination plants : brine heaters , heat rejection and recovery , and in evaporator tubing copper-nickel alloys in desalination plants offshore oil and gas platforms and processing and fpso vessels : systems and splash zone sheathings copper-nickel alloys in power generation seawater system components : condenser and heat exchanger tubes , tubesheets , piping , high pressure systems , fittings , pumps , and water boxes the successful use of cupronickel in coinage is due to its corrosion resistance , electrical conductivity , durability , malleability , low allergy risk , ease of stamping , antimicrobial properties and recyclability in 1968 , switzerland adopted the far cheaper 75:25 copper to nickel ratio then being used in belgium , the united states , and germany from 1947 to 2012 , all '' silver '' coinage in the uk was made from cupronickel , but from 2012 onwards the two smallest cupronickel denominations were replaced with lower-cost nickel-plated steel coins cupronickel is the cladding on either side of united states half-dollars ( 50¢ ) since 1971 , and all quarters ( 25¢ ) and dimes ( 10¢ ) made after 1964 currently , some circulating coins , such as the united states jefferson nickel ( 5¢ ) , the swiss franc , and the south korean 500 and 100 won are made of solid cupronickel ( 75:25 ratio ) these have the heating element of constantan or nickel-chromium alloy within a sheath of copper , cupronickel or stainless steel cryogenic properties of copper-nickel properties of copper and copper alloys properties of copper and copper alloys at low temperatures beginning around the turn of the 20th century , bullet jackets were commonly made from this material currently , cupronickel and nickel silver remain the basic material for silver-plated cutlery fender musical instruments used '' cunife '' magnets in their '' wide range humbucker '' pickup for various telecaster and starcaster guitars during the 1970s cupronickel lacks a copper color due to nickel 's high electronegativity , which causes a loss of one electron in copper 's d-shell ( leaving 9 electrons in the d-shell versus pure copper 's typical 10 electrons ) in seawater , the alloys have excellent corrosion rates which remain low as long as the maximum design flow velocity is not exceeded however , cu–ni alloys can show high corrosion rates in polluted or stagnant seawater when sulfides or ammonia are present as copper and nickel alloy with each other easily and have simple structures , the alloys are ductile and readily fabricated applications for cu–ni alloys have withstood the test of time , as they are still widely used and range from seawater system piping , condensers and heat exchangers in naval vessels , commercial shipping , multiple-stage flash desalination and power stations details of fabrication procedures , including general handling , cutting and machining , forming , heat treatment , preparing for welding , weld preparations , tack welding , welding consumables , welding processes , paintina , mechanical properties of welds , and tube and pipe bending are available astm , en , and iso standards exist for ordering wrought and cast forms of cupronickel copper-nickel standards thermocouples and resistors whose resistance is stable across changes in temperature contain alloy constantan , which consists of 55 % copper and 45 % nickel the theory of chinese origins of bactrian cupronickel was suggested in 1868 by flight , who found that the coins considered the oldest cupronickel coins yet discovered were of a very similar alloy to chinese paktong in 1973 , cheng and schwitter in their new analyses suggested that the bactrian alloys ( copper , lead , iron , nickel and cobalt ) were closely similar to the chinese paktong , and of nine known asian nickel deposits , only those in china could provide the identical chemical compositions copper-nickel alloys copper-nickel-alloys : properties , processing , applications ( source : german copper institute ( dki ) ) ] copper-nickel alloys for seawater corrosion resistance and antifouling - a state of the art review ( c.a

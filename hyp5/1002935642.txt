cupronickel alloys are used for marine applications marine applications for copper-nickel alloys due to their resistance to seawater corrosion , good fabricability , and their effectiveness in lowering macrofouling levels alloys ranging in composition from 90 % cu–10 % ni to 70 % cu–30 % ni are commonly specified in heat exchanger or condenser tubes in a wide variety of marine applications copper-nickel alloys in boat and ship hulls alloys in shipbuilding and repair desalination plants : brine heaters , heat rejection and recovery , and in evaporator tubing copper-nickel alloys in desalination plants offshore oil and gas platforms and processing and fpso vessels : systems and splash zone sheathings copper-nickel alloys in power generation seawater system components : condenser and heat exchanger tubes , tubesheets , piping , high pressure systems , fittings , pumps , and water boxes the successful use of cupronickel in coinage is due to its corrosion resistance , electrical conductivity , durability , malleability , low allergy risk , ease of stamping , antimicrobial properties and recyclability in 1968 , switzerland adopted the far cheaper 75:25 copper to nickel ratio then being used in belgium , the united states , and germany from 1947 to 2012 , all '' silver '' coinage in the uk was made from cupronickel , but from 2012 onwards the two smallest cupronickel denominations were replaced with lower-cost nickel-plated steel coins in part due to silver hoarding in the civil war , the united states mint first used cupronickel for circulating coinage in three-cent pieces starting in 1865 , and then for five-cent pieces starting in 1866 prior to these dates , both denominations had been made only in silver in the united states currently , some circulating coins , such as the united states jefferson nickel ( 5¢ ) , the swiss franc , and the south korean 500 and 100 won are made of solid cupronickel ( 75:25 ratio ) these have the heating element of constantan or nickel-chromium alloy within a sheath of copper , cupronickel or stainless steel robert monro black , the history of electric wires and cables science museum ( great britain ) , iet , 1983 , , p cryogenic properties of copper-nickel properties of copper and copper alloys properties of copper and copper alloys at low temperatures beginning around the turn of the 20th century , bullet jackets were commonly made from this material currently , cupronickel and nickel silver remain the basic material for silver-plated cutlery properties of copper-nickel alloys these values may vary in other standards subtle differences in corrosion resistance and strength determine which alloy is selected in seawater , the alloys have excellent corrosion rates which remain low as long as the maximum design flow velocity is not exceeded they have high resistance to crevice corrosion , stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement that can be troublesome to other alloy systems to use this property to its full potential , the alloy needs to be free of the effects of , or insulated from , any form of cathodic protection however , cu–ni alloys can show high corrosion rates in polluted or stagnant seawater when sulfides or ammonia are present the 70–30 rather than 90–10 weld consumables are normally preferred for both alloys and no after-welding heat treatment is required copper-nickel standards thermocouples and resistors whose resistance is stable across changes in temperature contain alloy constantan , which consists of 55 % copper and 45 % nickel cupronickel alloys were known as '' white copper '' to the china since about the third century bc some weapons made during the warring states period were made with cu-ni alloys notably , andreas libavius , in his alchemia of 1597 , mentions a surface-whitened copper aes album by mercury or silver copper-nickel alloys copper-nickel-alloys : properties , processing , applications ( source : german copper institute ( dki ) ) ] copper-nickel alloys for seawater corrosion resistance and antifouling - a state of the art review ( c.a

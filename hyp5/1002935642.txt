cupronickel alloys are used for marine applications marine applications for copper-nickel alloys due to their resistance to seawater corrosion , good fabricability , and their effectiveness in lowering macrofouling levels alloys ranging in composition from 90 % cu–10 % ni to 70 % cu–30 % ni are commonly specified in heat exchanger or condenser tubes in a wide variety of marine applications copper-nickel alloys in boat and ship hulls alloys in shipbuilding and repair desalination plants : brine heaters , heat rejection and recovery , and in evaporator tubing copper-nickel alloys in power generation seawater system components : condenser and heat exchanger tubes , tubesheets , piping , high pressure systems , fittings , pumps , and water boxes copper-nickel alloys in seawater system design alloys in seawater system components the successful use of cupronickel in coinage is due to its corrosion resistance , electrical conductivity , durability , malleability , low allergy risk , ease of stamping , antimicrobial properties and recyclability from 1947 to 2012 , all '' silver '' coinage in the uk was made from cupronickel , but from 2012 onwards the two smallest cupronickel denominations were replaced with lower-cost nickel-plated steel coins in part due to silver hoarding in the civil war , the united states mint first used cupronickel for circulating coinage in three-cent pieces starting in 1865 , and then for five-cent pieces starting in 1866 cupronickel is the cladding on either side of united states half-dollars ( 50¢ ) since 1971 , and all quarters ( 25¢ ) and dimes ( 10¢ ) made after 1964 currently , some circulating coins , such as the united states jefferson nickel ( 5¢ ) , the swiss franc , and the south korean 500 and 100 won are made of solid cupronickel ( 75:25 ratio ) these have the heating element of constantan or nickel-chromium alloy within a sheath of copper , cupronickel or stainless steel cryogenic properties of copper-nickel properties of copper and copper alloys properties of copper and copper alloys at low temperatures beginning around the turn of the 20th century , bullet jackets were commonly made from this material currently , cupronickel and nickel silver remain the basic material for silver-plated cutlery for high-quality cylinder locks and locking systems , cylinder cores are made from wear-resistant cupronickel cupronickel has been used as an alternative to traditional steel brake lines , as it does not rust cupronickel lacks a copper color due to nickel 's high electronegativity , which causes a loss of one electron in copper 's d-shell ( leaving 9 electrons in the d-shell versus pure copper 's typical 10 electrons ) properties of copper-nickel alloys these values may vary in other standards subtle differences in corrosion resistance and strength determine which alloy is selected as copper and nickel alloy with each other easily and have simple structures , the alloys are ductile and readily fabricated they can also be welded directly to steel , providing a 65 % nickel-copper weld consumable is used to avoid iron dilution effects copper-nickel standards thermocouples and resistors whose resistance is stable across changes in temperature contain alloy constantan , which consists of 55 % copper and 45 % nickel cupronickel alloys were known as '' white copper '' to the china since about the third century bc ancient chinese weapons and a halberd of copper-nickel alloy , from the warring states period the alloy seems to have been rediscovered by the west during alchemy experiments guesswork ended when james dinwiddie of the macartney embassy brought back in 1793 , at considerable personal risk ( smuggling of paktong ore was a capital crime by the chinese emperor ) , some of the ore from which paktong was made a 90–10 alloy first became available in the 1950s , initially for seawater piping , and is now the more widely used alloy copper-nickel alloys copper-nickel-alloys : properties , processing , applications ( source : german copper institute ( dki ) ) ] copper-nickel alloys for seawater corrosion resistance and antifouling - a state of the art review ( c.a

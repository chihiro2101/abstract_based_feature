cupronickel alloys are used for marine applications marine applications for copper-nickel alloys due to their resistance to seawater corrosion , good fabricability , and their effectiveness in lowering macrofouling levels alloys ranging in composition from 90 % cu–10 % ni to 70 % cu–30 % ni are commonly specified in heat exchanger or condenser tubes in a wide variety of marine applications copper-nickel alloys in desalination plants offshore oil and gas platforms and processing and fpso vessels : systems and splash zone sheathings the successful use of cupronickel in coinage is due to its corrosion resistance , electrical conductivity , durability , malleability , low allergy risk , ease of stamping , antimicrobial properties and recyclability in 1968 , switzerland adopted the far cheaper 75:25 copper to nickel ratio then being used in belgium , the united states , and germany from 1947 to 2012 , all '' silver '' coinage in the uk was made from cupronickel , but from 2012 onwards the two smallest cupronickel denominations were replaced with lower-cost nickel-plated steel coins in part due to silver hoarding in the civil war , the united states mint first used cupronickel for circulating coinage in three-cent pieces starting in 1865 , and then for five-cent pieces starting in 1866 these have the heating element of constantan or nickel-chromium alloy within a sheath of copper , cupronickel or stainless steel 161 cupronickel is used in cryogenic applications its combination of good ductility retention and thermal conductivity at very low temperatures is advantageous for low-temperature processing and storage equipment as well as for heat exchangers at cryogenic plants cryogenic properties of copper-nickel properties of copper and copper alloys properties of copper and copper alloys at low temperatures beginning around the turn of the 20th century , bullet jackets were commonly made from this material for high-quality cylinder locks and locking systems , cylinder cores are made from wear-resistant cupronickel since cupronickel is much softer than steel , it bends and flares more easily , and the same property allows it to form a better seal with hydraulic components cupronickel lacks a copper color due to nickel 's high electronegativity , which causes a loss of one electron in copper 's d-shell ( leaving 9 electrons in the d-shell versus pure copper 's typical 10 electrons ) properties of copper-nickel alloys these values may vary in other standards subtle differences in corrosion resistance and strength determine which alloy is selected they have high resistance to crevice corrosion , stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement that can be troublesome to other alloy systems additionally , they have a high inherent biofouling resistance to attachment by macrofoulers ( e.g as copper and nickel alloy with each other easily and have simple structures , the alloys are ductile and readily fabricated they can also be welded directly to steel , providing a 65 % nickel-copper weld consumable is used to avoid iron dilution effects they have also been used as splash zone cladding on offshore structures and protective cladding on boat hulls , as well as for solid hulls themselves due to its ductility , cupronickel alloys can be readily fabricated in a wide variety of product forms copper-nickel alloy product forms and fittings cupronickel alloys were known as '' white copper '' to the china since about the third century bc the theory of chinese origins of bactrian cupronickel was suggested in 1868 by flight , who found that the coins considered the oldest cupronickel coins yet discovered were of a very similar alloy to chinese paktong the paktong alloy was described as being made by adding small pills of naturally occurring yunnan ore to a bath of molten copper peat and cookson found that '' the darkest proved to contain 7.7 % nickel and the lightest said to be indistinguishable from silver with a characteristic bell-like resonance when struck and considerable resistance to corrosion , 11.1 % '' a 90–10 alloy first became available in the 1950s , initially for seawater piping , and is now the more widely used alloy

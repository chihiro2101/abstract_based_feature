cupronickel alloys are used for marine applications marine applications for copper-nickel alloys due to their resistance to seawater corrosion , good fabricability , and their effectiveness in lowering macrofouling levels alloys ranging in composition from 90 % cu–10 % ni to 70 % cu–30 % ni are commonly specified in heat exchanger or condenser tubes in a wide variety of marine applications kobelco : copper alloy tubes for heat-exchanger ; shinko metal products , japan ; important marine applications for cupronickel include : shipbuilding and repair : hulls of boats and ships , seawater cooling , bilge and ballast , sanitary , fire fighting , inert gas , hydraulic and pneumatic chiller systems copper-nickel alloys in boat and ship hulls alloys in shipbuilding and repair desalination plants : brine heaters , heat rejection and recovery , and in evaporator tubing copper-nickel alloys in offshore oil and gas platforms and processing power generation : steam turbine condensers , oil coolers , auxiliary cooling systems and high pressure pre-heaters at nuclear and fossil fuel power plants copper-nickel alloys in power generation seawater system components : condenser and heat exchanger tubes , tubesheets , piping , high pressure systems , fittings , pumps , and water boxes the successful use of cupronickel in coinage is due to its corrosion resistance , electrical conductivity , durability , malleability , low allergy risk , ease of stamping , antimicrobial properties and recyclability copper-nickel in coinage in europe , switzerland pioneered the nickel billon coinage in 1850 , with the addition of silver in 1968 , switzerland adopted the far cheaper 75:25 copper to nickel ratio then being used in belgium , the united states , and germany from 1947 to 2012 , all '' silver '' coinage in the uk was made from cupronickel , but from 2012 onwards the two smallest cupronickel denominations were replaced with lower-cost nickel-plated steel coins in part due to silver hoarding in the civil war , the united states mint first used cupronickel for circulating coinage in three-cent pieces starting in 1865 , and then for five-cent pieces starting in 1866 currently , some circulating coins , such as the united states jefferson nickel ( 5¢ ) , the swiss franc , and the south korean 500 and 100 won are made of solid cupronickel ( 75:25 ratio ) these have the heating element of constantan or nickel-chromium alloy within a sheath of copper , cupronickel or stainless steel cryogenic properties of copper-nickel properties of copper and copper alloys properties of copper and copper alloys at low temperatures beginning around the turn of the 20th century , bullet jackets were commonly made from this material currently , cupronickel and nickel silver remain the basic material for silver-plated cutlery it is commonly used for mechanical and electrical equipment , medical equipment , zippers , jewelry items , and both for strings for instruments in the violin family , and for guitar frets for high-quality cylinder locks and locking systems , cylinder cores are made from wear-resistant cupronickel cupronickel lacks a copper color due to nickel 's high electronegativity , which causes a loss of one electron in copper 's d-shell ( leaving 9 electrons in the d-shell versus pure copper 's typical 10 electrons ) properties of copper-nickel alloys these values may vary in other standards subtle differences in corrosion resistance and strength determine which alloy is selected they have high resistance to crevice corrosion , stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement that can be troublesome to other alloy systems however , cu–ni alloys can show high corrosion rates in polluted or stagnant seawater when sulfides or ammonia are present applications for cu–ni alloys have withstood the test of time , as they are still widely used and range from seawater system piping , condensers and heat exchangers in naval vessels , commercial shipping , multiple-stage flash desalination and power stations due to its ductility , cupronickel alloys can be readily fabricated in a wide variety of product forms copper-nickel alloy product forms and fittings copper-nickel standards thermocouples and resistors whose resistance is stable across changes in temperature contain alloy constantan , which consists of 55 % copper and 45 % nickel coins of a similar alloy with busts of his younger brothers , pantaleon and agathocles , were minted around 170 bce a 90–10 alloy first became available in the 1950s , initially for seawater piping , and is now the more widely used alloy

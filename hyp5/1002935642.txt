cupronickel alloys are used for marine applications marine applications for copper-nickel alloys due to their resistance to seawater corrosion , good fabricability , and their effectiveness in lowering macrofouling levels alloys ranging in composition from 90 % cu–10 % ni to 70 % cu–30 % ni are commonly specified in heat exchanger or condenser tubes in a wide variety of marine applications kobelco : copper alloy tubes for heat-exchanger ; shinko metal products , japan ; important marine applications for cupronickel include : shipbuilding and repair : hulls of boats and ships , seawater cooling , bilge and ballast , sanitary , fire fighting , inert gas , hydraulic and pneumatic chiller systems copper-nickel alloys in boat and ship hulls alloys in shipbuilding and repair desalination plants : brine heaters , heat rejection and recovery , and in evaporator tubing copper-nickel alloys in desalination plants offshore oil and gas platforms and processing and fpso vessels : systems and splash zone sheathings copper-nickel alloys in offshore oil and gas platforms and processing power generation : steam turbine condensers , oil coolers , auxiliary cooling systems and high pressure pre-heaters at nuclear and fossil fuel power plants copper-nickel alloys in power generation seawater system components : condenser and heat exchanger tubes , tubesheets , piping , high pressure systems , fittings , pumps , and water boxes copper-nickel alloys in seawater system design alloys in seawater system components copper-nickel in coinage in europe , switzerland pioneered the nickel billon coinage in 1850 , with the addition of silver from 1947 to 2012 , all '' silver '' coinage in the uk was made from cupronickel , but from 2012 onwards the two smallest cupronickel denominations were replaced with lower-cost nickel-plated steel coins in part due to silver hoarding in the civil war , the united states mint first used cupronickel for circulating coinage in three-cent pieces starting in 1865 , and then for five-cent pieces starting in 1866 currently , some circulating coins , such as the united states jefferson nickel ( 5¢ ) , the swiss franc , and the south korean 500 and 100 won are made of solid cupronickel ( 75:25 ratio ) these have the heating element of constantan or nickel-chromium alloy within a sheath of copper , cupronickel or stainless steel cryogenic properties of copper-nickel properties of copper and copper alloys properties of copper and copper alloys at low temperatures beginning around the turn of the 20th century , bullet jackets were commonly made from this material currently , cupronickel and nickel silver remain the basic material for silver-plated cutlery it is commonly used for mechanical and electrical equipment , medical equipment , zippers , jewelry items , and both for strings for instruments in the violin family , and for guitar frets cupronickel lacks a copper color due to nickel 's high electronegativity , which causes a loss of one electron in copper 's d-shell ( leaving 9 electrons in the d-shell versus pure copper 's typical 10 electrons ) copper-nickels naturally form a thin protective surface layer over the first several weeks of exposure to seawater and this provides its ongoing resistance as copper and nickel alloy with each other easily and have simple structures , the alloys are ductile and readily fabricated they can also be welded directly to steel , providing a 65 % nickel-copper weld consumable is used to avoid iron dilution effects the c71640 alloy tends to be used as seamless tubing and expanded rather than welded into the tube plate copper-nickel standards thermocouples and resistors whose resistance is stable across changes in temperature contain alloy constantan , which consists of 55 % copper and 45 % nickel cupronickel alloys were known as '' white copper '' to the china since about the third century bc the paktong alloy was described as being made by adding small pills of naturally occurring yunnan ore to a bath of molten copper peat and cookson found that '' the darkest proved to contain 7.7 % nickel and the lightest said to be indistinguishable from silver with a characteristic bell-like resonance when struck and considerable resistance to corrosion , 11.1 % '' a 90–10 alloy first became available in the 1950s , initially for seawater piping , and is now the more widely used alloy

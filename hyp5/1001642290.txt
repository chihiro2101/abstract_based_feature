the benedictine abbey of vézelay was founded , the primary source for the history of vézelay is a codex compiled in the twelfth century , containing the abbey 's annals , a cartulary , a history of the early counts of nevers , and much besides , in the bibliothèque municipale , auxerre , ms 227 ; it was edited by r huygens , in his magisterial monumenta vizeliacensia : textes relatifs à l'histoire de l'abbaye de vézelay ( corpus christianorum ) turnhout , belgium , 1976 as many abbeys were , on land that had been a late roman villa , of vercellus ( vercelle becoming vézelay ) the two convents he founded there were looted and dispersed by moorish raiding parties in the 8th century , and a hilltop convent was burnt by norman raiders in the 9th century , the abbey was refounded under the guidance of badilo , who became an affiliate of the reformed benedictine order of cluny vézelay also stood at the beginning of one of the four major routes through france for pilgrims going to santiago de compostela in galicia , in the north-western corner of spain about 1050 the monks of vézelay began to claim to hold the relics of mary magdalene , brought , they said , from the holy land either by their 9th-century founder-saint , badilo , or by envoys despatched by him a little later a monk of vézelay declared that he had detected in a crypt at st-maximin in provence , carved on an empty sarcophagus , a representation of the anointing of jesus , when jesus ' head was anointed by mary of bethany , who was assumed in the middle ages to be mary magdalene the monks of vézelay pronounced this to be mary magdalene 's tomb , from which her relics had been translated to their abbey freed captives then brought their chains as votive objects to the abbey , and it was the newly elected abbot geoffroy in 1037 who had the ironwork melted down and reforged as wrought iron railings surrounding the magdalene 's altar thus the erection of one of the finest examples of romanesque architecture which followed was made possible by pilgrims to the declared relics and these tactile examples demonstrating the efficacy of prayers mary magdalene is the prototype of the penitent , and vézelay has remained an important place of pilgrimage for the roman catholic faithful , though the actual claimed relics were torched by huguenots in the 16th century to accommodate the influx of pilgrims a new abbey church was begun , dedicated on april 21 , 1104 , but the expense of building so increased the tax burden on the abbey 's lands that the peasants rose up and killed the abbot thomas becket , in exile , chose vézelay for his pentecost sermon in 1166 , announcing the excommunication of the main supporters of his english king , henry ii , and threatening the king with excommunication too the diocese of autun , who challenged its claims to exemption ; the counts of nevers , who claimed jurisdiction in their court and rights of hospitality at vézelay ; the abbey of cluny , which had reformed its rule and sought to maintain control of the abbot within its hierarchy ; the townsmen of vézelay , who demanded a modicum of communal self-government the beginning of vézelay 's decline coincided with the well-publicized discovery in 1279 of the body of mary magdalene at saint-maximin-la-sainte-baume in provence , given regal patronage by charles ii , the angevin king of sicily when charles erected a dominican convent at la sainte-baume , the shrine was found intact , with an explanatory inscription stating why the relics had been hidden the tympanum of the central portal of the madeleine de vézelay is different from its counterparts across europe when compared to contemporary churches such as autun cathedral and moissac abbey , the distinctiveness of vézelay becomes apparent the art historian george zarnecki wrote , '' to most people the term romanesque sculpture brings to mind a large church portal , dominated by a tympanum carved with an apocalyptic vision , usually the last judgment fifteen years after its completion , bernard of clairvaux chose vézelay as the place from which he would call for a second crusade it is there that king richard the lionheart of england and king philip augustus of france met and joined their armies for a combined western invasion of the holy land the vézelay lintel is distinct , but some comparisons can be made between it and other romanesque portal sculptures of the time that is why the traditional romanesque christ , with its angry stare , was replaced at vézelay by a kind and welcoming christ with arms wide open jerusalem monastic community vézelay - present state maison du visiteur , vezelay vézelay page on the site bourgogne romane gallery of detailed images

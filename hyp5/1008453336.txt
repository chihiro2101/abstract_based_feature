and religious groups in the campaign from 1871 to 1878 under chancellor otto von bismarck of the german empire against the influence of the roman catholic church in american usage , '' culture war '' may imply a conflict between those values considered traditionalist or conservative and those considered progressive or liberal this followed several decades of immigration to the states by people who earlier european immigrants considered 'alien ' in subsequent decades during the 20th century , the term was published occasionally in american newspapers politics in 1991 with the publication of culture wars : the struggle to define america by james davison hunter , who redefined the american notion of '' culture war '' tracing the concept to the 1960s , hunter perceived a dramatic realignment and polarization that had transformed u.s politics and culture , including the issues of abortion , federal and state gun laws , immigration , separation of church and state , privacy , recreational drug use , lgbt rights , and censorship andrew hartman , a war for the soul of america : a history of the culture wars ( university of chicago press , 2015 ) james davison hunter , a sociologist at the university of virginia , introduced the expression again in his 1991 publication , culture wars : the struggle to define america hunter described what he saw as a dramatic realignment and polarization that had transformed american politics and culture he argued that on an increasing number of '' hot-button '' defining issues—abortion , gun politics , separation of church and state , privacy , recreational drug use , homosexuality , censorship—there existed two definable polarities furthermore , not only were there a number of divisive issues , but society had divided along essentially the same lines on these issues , so as to constitute two warring groups , defined primarily not by nominal religion , ethnicity , social class , or even political affiliation , but rather by ideological world-views for example , bill o'reilly , a conservative political commentator and former host of the fox news talk show the o'reilly factor , emphasizes differences

substitute for the cohesive conservative ideology that existed during the cold war journalist caitlin dewey described gamergate as a '' proxy war '' for a larger culture war between those who want greater inclusion of women and minorities in cultural institutions versus anti-feminists and traditionalists who do not according to media scholar whitney phillips , gamergate '' prototyped '' strategies of harassment and controversy-stoking that proved useful in political strategy for example , republican political strategist steve bannon publicized pop-culture conflicts during the 2016 presidential campaign of donald trump , encouraging a young audience to '' come in through gamergate or whatever and then get turned onto politics and trump nevertheless , canadian society is

a person is given the choice between two scenarios : one with a guaranteed payoff , and one with a risky payoff with same average value the expected payoff for both scenarios is 50 , meaning that an individual who was insensitive to risk would not care whether they took the guaranteed payment or the gamble a person is said to be : risk averse ( or risk avoiding ) - if they would accept a certain payment ( certainty equivalent ) of less than 50 ( for example , 40 ) , rather than taking the gamble and possibly receiving nothing the smallest dollar amount that an individual would be indifferent to spending on a gamble or guarantee is called the certainty equivalent , which is also used as a measure of risk aversion for risk-averse individuals , risk premium is positive , for risk-neutral persons it is zero , and for risk-loving individuals their risk premium is negative in expected utility theory , an agent has a utility function u ( c ) where c represents the value that he might receive in money or goods ( in the above example c could be 0 or 40 or 100 ) the expected utility of the above bet ( with a 50 % chance of receiving 100 and a 50 % chance of receiving 0 ) is : e ( u ) ( u ( 0 ) +u ( 100 ) ) /2 , and if the person has the utility function with u ( 0 ) 0 , u ( 40 ) 5 , and u ( 100 ) 10 then the expected utility of the bet equals 5 , which is the same as the known utility of the amount 40 the risk premium is ( 50 minus 40 ) 10 , or in proportional terms : ( \ 50-\ 40 ) /\ 40 or 25 % ( where 50 is the expected value of the risky bet : ( \tfrac using expected utility theory 's approach to risk aversion to analyze small stakes decisions has come under criticism rabin criticizes this implication of expected utility theory on grounds of implausibilityâ€”individuals who are risk averse for small gambles due to diminishing marginal utility would exhibit extreme forms of risk aversion in risky decisions under larger stakes one solution to the problem observed by rabin is that proposed by prospect theory and cumulative prospect theory , where outcomes are considered relative to a reference point ( usually the status quo ) , rather than considering only the final wealth the reflection effect is an identified pattern of opposite preferences between negative as opposed to positive prospects : people tend to avoid risk when the gamble is between gains , and to seek risks when the gamble is between losses ambiguity aversion equity premium puzzle investor profile loss aversion marginal utility neuroeconomics optimism bias problem gambling , a contrary behavior prudence in economics risk premium st

a person is given the choice between two scenarios : one with a guaranteed payoff , and one with a risky payoff with same average value the expected payoff for both scenarios is 50 , meaning that an individual who was insensitive to risk would not care whether they took the guaranteed payment or the gamble a person is said to be : risk averse ( or risk avoiding ) - if they would accept a certain payment ( certainty equivalent ) of less than 50 ( for example , 40 ) , rather than taking the gamble and possibly receiving nothing risk neutral – if they are indifferent between the bet and a certain 50 payment risk loving ( or risk seeking ) – if they would accept the bet even when the guaranteed payment is more than 50 ( for example , 60 ) the risk premium is the difference between the expected value and the certainty equivalent for risk-averse individuals , risk premium is positive , for risk-neutral persons it is zero , and for risk-loving individuals their risk premium is negative in expected utility theory , an agent has a utility function u ( c ) where c represents the value that he might receive in money or goods ( in the above example c could be 0 or 40 or 100 ) an agent possesses risk aversion if and only if the utility function is concave limitations of expected utility treatment of risk aversion using expected utility theory 's approach to risk aversion to analyze small stakes decisions has come under criticism suggested that the activity of a specific brain area ( right inferior frontal gyrus ) correlates with risk aversion , with more risk averse participants ( i.e petersburg paradox statistical risk uncertainty avoidance , which is different , as uncertainty is not the same as risk utility

a person is given the choice between two scenarios : one with a guaranteed payoff , and one with a risky payoff with same average value the expected payoff for both scenarios is 50 , meaning that an individual who was insensitive to risk would not care whether they took the guaranteed payment or the gamble however , individuals may have different risk attitudes a person is said to be : risk averse ( or risk avoiding ) - if they would accept a certain payment ( certainty equivalent ) of less than 50 ( for example , 40 ) , rather than taking the gamble and possibly receiving nothing risk loving ( or risk seeking ) â€“ if they would accept the bet even when the guaranteed payment is more than 50 ( for example , 60 ) the average payoff of the gamble , known as its expected value , is 50 an agent possesses risk aversion if and only if the utility function is concave for instance u ( 0 ) could be 0 , u ( 100 ) might be 10 , u ( 40 ) might be 5 , and for comparison u ( 50 ) might be 6 the risk premium is ( 50 minus 40 ) 10 , or in proportional terms : ( \ 50-\ 40 ) /\ 40 or 25 % ( where 50 is the expected value of the risky bet : ( \tfrac limitations of expected utility treatment of risk aversion matthew rabin has showed that a risk-averse , expected-utility-maximizing individual who , from any initial wealth level when posed the same problem , but for losses , most people prefer an 80 % chance of a loss of 4,000 to a certain loss of 3,000 petersburg paradox statistical risk uncertainty avoidance , which is different , as uncertainty is not the same as risk utility

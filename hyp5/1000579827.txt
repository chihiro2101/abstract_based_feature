from 1942 to 1979 lomax was repeatedly investigated and interviewed by the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) , although nothing incriminating was ever discovered and the investigation was eventually abandoned scholar and jazz pianist ted gioia uncovered and published extracts from alan lomax 's 800-page fbi files the investigation appears to have started when an anonymous informant reported overhearing lomax 's father telling guests in 1941 about what he considered his son 's communism sympathies looking for leads , the fbi seized on the fact that , at the age of 17 in 1932 while attending harvard for a year , lomax had been arrested in boston , massachusetts , in connection with a political demonstration nevertheless , the bureau continued trying vainly to show that in 1932 lomax had either distributed communist literature or made public speeches in support of the communist party he was , he claimed , 15 at the time – he was actually 17 and a college student – and he said he had intended to participate in a peaceful demonstration lomax said he and his colleagues agreed to stop their protest when police asked them to , but that he was grabbed by a couple of policemen as he was walking away lomax left harvard , after having spent his sophomore year there , to join john a lomax and john lomax , jr in collecting folk songs for the library of congress and to assist his father in writing his books in withdrawing him ( in addition to not being able to afford the tuition ) , the elder lomax had probably wanted to separate his son from new political associates that he considered undesirable but alan had also not been happy there and probably also wanted to be nearer his bereaved father and young sister , bess , and to return to the close friends he had made during his first year at the university of texas in june 1942 the fbi approached the librarian of congress , archibald mcleish , in an attempt to have lomax fired as assistant in charge of the library 's archive of american folk song at the time , lomax was preparing for a field trip to the mississippi delta on behalf of the library , where he would make landmark recordings of muddy waters , son house , and david '' honeyboy '' edwards , among others mcleish wrote to hoover , defending lomax : '' i have studied the findings of these reports very carefully an fbi report dated july 23 , 1943 , describes lomax as possessing '' an erratic , artistic temperament '' and a '' bohemian attitude '' it says : '' he has a tendency to neglect his work over a period of time and then just before a deadline he produces excellent results '' the file quotes one informant who said that '' lomax was a very peculiar individual , that he seemed to be very absent-minded and that he paid practically no attention to his personal appearance lomax , who was a founding member of people 's songs , was in charge of campaign music for henry a subsequently , lomax was one of the performers listed in the publication red channels as a possible communist sympathizer and was consequently blacklisted from working in us entertainment industries a 2007 bbc news article revealed that in the early 1950s , the british mi5 placed alan lomax under surveillance as a suspected communist its report concluded that although lomax undoubtedly held '' left wing '' views , there was no evidence he was a communist correspondence ensued with the american authorities as to lomax ' suspected membership of the communist party , though no positive proof is found on this file the fbi again investigated lomax in 1956 and sent a 68-page report to the cia and the attorney general 's office the fbi file notes that lomax stood tall , weighed 240 pounds and was 64 at the time : lomax resisted the fbi 's attempts to interview him about the impersonation charges , but he finally met with agents at his home in november 1979 he denied that he 'd been involved in the matter but did note that he 'd been in new hampshire in july 1979 , visiting a film editor about a documentary the fbi 's report concluded that '' lomax made no secret of the fact that he disliked the fbi and disliked being interviewed by the fbi gleason music book award in 1993 for his book the land where the blues began , connecting the story of the origins of blues music with the prevalence of forced labor in the pre-world war ii south ( especially on the mississippi levees ) the '' world music '' phenomenon arose partly from those efforts , as did his great book , folk song style and culture it is one of the very rare attempts to put cultural criticism onto a serious , comprehensible , and rational footing by someone who had the experience and breadth of vision to be able to do it brian eno , in liner

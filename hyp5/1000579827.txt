from 1942 to 1979 lomax was repeatedly investigated and interviewed by the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) , although nothing incriminating was ever discovered and the investigation was eventually abandoned scholar and jazz pianist ted gioia uncovered and published extracts from alan lomax 's 800-page fbi files the investigation appears to have started when an anonymous informant reported overhearing lomax 's father telling guests in 1941 about what he considered his son 's communism sympathies looking for leads , the fbi seized on the fact that , at the age of 17 in 1932 while attending harvard for a year , lomax had been arrested in boston , massachusetts , in connection with a political demonstration according to ted gioia : lomax must have felt it necessary to address the suspicions lomax said he and his colleagues agreed to stop their protest when police asked them to , but that he was grabbed by a couple of policemen as he was walking away '' that is pretty much the story there , except that it distressed my father very , very much '' , lomax told the fbi it has made a lot of unhappiness for the two of us because he loved harvard and wanted me to be a great success there '' lomax transferred to the university of texas the following year lomax and john lomax , jr in collecting folk songs for the library of congress and to assist his father in writing his books in withdrawing him ( in addition to not being able to afford the tuition ) , the elder lomax had probably wanted to separate his son from new political associates that he considered undesirable but alan had also not been happy there and probably also wanted to be nearer his bereaved father and young sister , bess , and to return to the close friends he had made during his first year at the university of texas lomax has been engaged in subversive activities and i am therefore taking no disciplinary action toward him '' nevertheless , according to gioia : yet what the probe failed to find in terms of prosecutable evidence , it made up for in speculation about his character an fbi report dated july 23 , 1943 , describes lomax as possessing '' an erratic , artistic temperament '' and a '' bohemian attitude '' the file quotes one informant who said that '' lomax was a very peculiar individual , that he seemed to be very absent-minded and that he paid practically no attention to his personal appearance subsequently , lomax was one of the performers listed in the publication red channels as a possible communist sympathizer and was consequently blacklisted from working in us entertainment industries a 2007 bbc news article revealed that in the early 1950s , the british mi5 placed alan lomax under surveillance as a suspected communist its report concluded that although lomax undoubtedly held '' left wing '' views , there was no evidence he was a communist the file contains a partial record of lomax ' movements , contacts and activities while in britain , and includes for example a police report of the '' songs of the iron road '' concert at st pancras in december 1953 his association with blacklisted american film director joseph losey is also mentioned ( serial 30a ) then , as late as 1979 , an fbi report suggested that lomax had recently impersonated an fbi agent the person who reported the incident to the fbi said that the man in question was around 43 , about 5 feet 9 & nbsp ; inches and 190 pounds the fbi file notes that lomax stood tall , weighed 240 pounds and was 64 at the time : lomax resisted the fbi 's attempts to interview him about the impersonation charges , but he finally met with agents at his home in november 1979 the fbi 's report concluded that '' lomax made no secret of the fact that he disliked the fbi and disliked being interviewed by the fbi the fbi investigation was concluded the following year , shortly after lomax 's 65th birthday lomax also received a posthumous grammy trustees award for his lifetime achievements in 2003 the '' world music '' phenomenon arose partly from those efforts , as did his great book , folk song style and culture i believe this is one of the most important books ever written about music , in my all time top ten it is one of the very rare attempts to put cultural criticism onto a serious , comprehensible , and rational footing by someone who had the experience and breadth of vision to be able to do it lomax spent the last 20 years of his life working on an interactive multimedia educational computer project he called the global jukebox , which included 5,000 hours of sound recordings , 400,000 feet of film , 3,000 videotapes , and 5,000 photographs by february 2012 , 17,000 music tracks from his archived collection were expected to be made available for free streaming , and later some of that music may be for sale as cds or digital downloads this is material from alan lomax 's independent archive , begun in 1946 , which has been digitized and offered by the association for cultural equity i learned a lot there and alan â€¦ alan was one of those who unlocked the secrets of this kind of music bob dylan , quoted in jeffrey greenberg , liner notes to alan lomax : popular songbook , rounder 82161-1863-2t , on website album liner notes.com in 1999 electronica musician moby released his fifth album play it extensively used samples from field recordings collected by lomax on the 1993 box set sounds of the south : a musical journey from the georgia sea islands to the mississippi delta nathan salsburg , curator of the alan lomax archive , on lomax 's '' list of american folk songs on commercial recordings '' ( 1940 ) , root hog or die , sept 24 , 2012 and alan lomax articles by alan lomax alan lomax discography alan lomax filmography alan lomax radio programs the v.d

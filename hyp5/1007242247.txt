the term '' unschooling '' probably derives from ivan illich 's term '' deschooling '' , and was popularized through john holt 's newsletter growing without schooling ( gws ) holt is also widely regarded as the father of unschooling the term '' unschooling '' became used as a contrast to versions of home schooling that were perceived as politically and pedagogically '' school-like , '' using textbooks and exercises at home , the same way they would be used at school in 2003 , in holt 's book teach your own ( originally published in 1981 ) , pat farenga , co-author of the new edition , provided a definition : when pressed , i define unschooling as allowing children as much freedom to learn in the world as their parents can comfortably bear new mexico homeschooling parent sandra dodd proposed the term '' radical unschooling '' to emphasize the complete rejection of any distinction between educational and non-educational activities radical unschooling emphasizes that unschooling is a non-coercive , cooperative practice , and seeks to promote those values in all areas of life even though unschooling is often seen as a subset of homeschooling and homeschooling has been the subject of broad public debate , unschooling in particular has received relatively little media attention and has only become increasingly popular in recent years unschooling is also sometimes considered the freest form of homeschooling there are a variety of complex reasons why parents choose to unschool their children , many of which overlap with those for homeschooling some unschoolers criticize that in schools , children are taught a set of facts and skills that they might not need in the future anymore , while with unschooling , they learn how to learn , which is far more sustainable for their life according to unschooling pioneer john holt , child-led learning is more efficient and respectful of children 's time , takes advantage of their interests , and allows deeper exploration of subjects than what is possible in conventional education some unschoolers believe that conditions in conventional schools , such as age segregation , the ratio of children to adults , or the amount of time spent sitting and obeying orders of one authority figure , are not conducive to proper education a fundamental premise of unschooling is that learning is a natural process constantly taking place and that curiosity is innate and children want to learn unschoolers note that psychologists have documented many differences between children in the way they learn , and assert that unschooling is better equipped to adapt to these differences developmental psychologists note that just as children reach growth milestones at different ages from each other , children are also prepared to learn different things at different ages in fact , experts have discovered that natural learning produces far greater changes in behavior than do traditional learning methods , though not necessarily an increase in the amount of information learned parents tend to involve themselves , especially with younger children ( older children , unless new to unschooling , often need less help finding resources and making and carrying out plans ) unschooling is a form of homeschooling , which is the education of children at home or other places rather than in a school unschooling expands from children 's natural curiosity as an extension of their interests , concerns , needs , goals , and plans guaranteeing that children will learn â€“ some persons doubt that every unschooled children wants to learn and , for example , think it is more likely that they will play video games all day instead .

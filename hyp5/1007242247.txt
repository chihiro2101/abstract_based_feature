the term '' unschooling '' probably derives from ivan illich 's term '' deschooling '' , and was popularized through john holt 's newsletter growing without schooling ( gws ) holt is also widely regarded as the father of unschooling in an early essay , holt contrasted the two terms : gws will say 'unschooling ' when we mean taking children out of school , and 'deschooling ' when we mean changing the laws to make schools non-compulsory the term '' unschooling '' became used as a contrast to versions of home schooling that were perceived as politically and pedagogically '' school-like , '' using textbooks and exercises at home , the same way they would be used at school holt 's use of the term emphasizes learning as a natural process , integrated into the spaces and activities of everyday life , and not benefiting from adult manipulation after holt 's death a range of unschooling practitioners and observers defined the term in various ways for instance , the freechild project defines unschooling as : the process of learning through life , without formalized or institutionalized classrooms or schoolwork new mexico homeschooling parent sandra dodd proposed the term '' radical unschooling '' to emphasize the complete rejection of any distinction between educational and non-educational activities even though unschooling is often seen as a subset of homeschooling and homeschooling has been the subject of broad public debate , unschooling in particular has received relatively little media attention and has only become increasingly popular in recent years some unschoolers criticize that in schools , children are taught a set of facts and skills that they might not need in the future anymore , while with unschooling , they learn how to learn , which is far more sustainable for their life also , some say that in school , children are only taught how to follow instructions , which means that they face problems with doing tasks they have not done before according to unschooling pioneer john holt , child-led learning is more efficient and respectful of children 's time , takes advantage of their interests , and allows deeper exploration of subjects than what is possible in conventional education '' others point out that some schools can be non-coercive and cooperative , in a manner consistent with the philosophies behind unschooling some unschoolers believe that conditions in conventional schools , such as age segregation , the ratio of children to adults , or the amount of time spent sitting and obeying orders of one authority figure , are not conducive to proper education a fundamental premise of unschooling is that learning is a natural process constantly taking place and that curiosity is innate and children want to learn new unschoolers are advised that they should not expect to understand the unschooling philosophy at first unschooling is a form of homeschooling , which is the education of children at home or other places rather than in a school unschooling expands from children 's natural curiosity as an extension of their interests , concerns , needs , goals , and plans many other forms of alternative education also place a great deal of importance on student control of learning , albeit not necessarily of the individual learner qualifications â€“ some parents may not have the skills required to guide and advise their children in life skills or help them pursue their own interests

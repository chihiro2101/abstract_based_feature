the term '' unschooling '' probably derives from ivan illich 's term '' deschooling '' , and was popularized through john holt 's newsletter growing without schooling ( gws ) in an early essay , holt contrasted the two terms : gws will say 'unschooling ' when we mean taking children out of school , and 'deschooling ' when we mean changing the laws to make schools non-compulsory the term '' unschooling '' became used as a contrast to versions of home schooling that were perceived as politically and pedagogically '' school-like , '' using textbooks and exercises at home , the same way they would be used at school in 2003 , in holt 's book teach your own ( originally published in 1981 ) , pat farenga , co-author of the new edition , provided a definition : when pressed , i define unschooling as allowing children as much freedom to learn in the world as their parents can comfortably bear holt 's use of the term emphasizes learning as a natural process , integrated into the spaces and activities of everyday life , and not benefiting from adult manipulation new mexico homeschooling parent sandra dodd proposed the term '' radical unschooling '' to emphasize the complete rejection of any distinction between educational and non-educational activities points of disagreement include whether unschooling is primarily defined by the initiative of the learner and their control over the curriculum , or by the techniques , methods , and spaces being used even though unschooling is often seen as a subset of homeschooling and homeschooling has been the subject of broad public debate , unschooling in particular has received relatively little media attention and has only become increasingly popular in recent years unschooling is also sometimes considered the freest form of homeschooling some unschoolers criticize that in schools , children are taught a set of facts and skills that they might not need in the future anymore , while with unschooling , they learn how to learn , which is far more sustainable for their life another argument is that the structure of school is not suitable for people who want to make their own decisions about what , when , how and with whom they learn because many things are predetermined there , while you are more free in these decisions when unschooled according to unschooling pioneer john holt , child-led learning is more efficient and respectful of children 's time , takes advantage of their interests , and allows deeper exploration of subjects than what is possible in conventional education a fundamental premise of unschooling is that learning is a natural process constantly taking place and that curiosity is innate and children want to learn unschoolers note that psychologists have documented many differences between children in the way they learn , and assert that unschooling is better equipped to adapt to these differences developmental psychologists note that just as children reach growth milestones at different ages from each other , children are also prepared to learn different things at different ages unschoolers sometimes state that learning any specific subject is less important than learning how to learn unschooling is a form of homeschooling , which is the education of children at home or other places rather than in a school unschooling expands from children 's natural curiosity as an extension of their interests , concerns , needs , goals , and plans qualifications – some parents may not have the skills required to guide and advise their children in life skills or help them pursue their own interests guaranteeing that children will learn – some persons doubt that every unschooled children wants to learn and , for example , think it is more likely that they will play video games all day instead .

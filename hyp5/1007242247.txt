the term '' unschooling '' probably derives from ivan illich 's term '' deschooling '' , and was popularized through john holt 's newsletter growing without schooling ( gws ) in an early essay , holt contrasted the two terms : gws will say 'unschooling ' when we mean taking children out of school , and 'deschooling ' when we mean changing the laws to make schools non-compulsory the term '' unschooling '' became used as a contrast to versions of home schooling that were perceived as politically and pedagogically '' school-like , '' using textbooks and exercises at home , the same way they would be used at school in 2003 , in holt 's book teach your own ( originally published in 1981 ) , pat farenga , co-author of the new edition , provided a definition : when pressed , i define unschooling as allowing children as much freedom to learn in the world as their parents can comfortably bear holt 's use of the term emphasizes learning as a natural process , integrated into the spaces and activities of everyday life , and not benefiting from adult manipulation for instance , the freechild project defines unschooling as : the process of learning through life , without formalized or institutionalized classrooms or schoolwork radical unschooling emphasizes that unschooling is a non-coercive , cooperative practice , and seeks to promote those values in all areas of life even though unschooling is often seen as a subset of homeschooling and homeschooling has been the subject of broad public debate , unschooling in particular has received relatively little media attention and has only become increasingly popular in recent years unschooling is also sometimes considered the freest form of homeschooling parents of school children also have little say regarding who their instructors and teachers are , whereas parents of unschoolers may be more involved in the selection of the coaches or mentors their children work with and with whom they build lasting and ongoing relationships according to unschooling pioneer john holt , child-led learning is more efficient and respectful of children 's time , takes advantage of their interests , and allows deeper exploration of subjects than what is possible in conventional education sudbury model schools are non-coercive , non-indoctrinative , cooperative , democratically run partnerships between children and adults , including full parents ' partnership , where learning is individualized and child-led , and complements home education a fundamental premise of unschooling is that learning is a natural process constantly taking place and that curiosity is innate and children want to learn unschoolers note that psychologists have documented many differences between children in the way they learn , and assert that unschooling is better equipped to adapt to these differences in fact , experts have discovered that natural learning produces far greater changes in behavior than do traditional learning methods , though not necessarily an increase in the amount of information learned unschoolers sometimes state that learning any specific subject is less important than learning how to learn unschooling is a form of homeschooling , which is the education of children at home or other places rather than in a school many other forms of alternative education also place a great deal of importance on student control of learning , albeit not necessarily of the individual learner qualifications – some parents may not have the skills required to guide and advise their children in life skills or help them pursue their own interests guaranteeing that children will learn – some persons doubt that every unschooled children wants to learn and , for example , think it is more likely that they will play video games all day instead .

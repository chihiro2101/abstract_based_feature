the term '' unschooling '' probably derives from ivan illich 's term '' deschooling '' , and was popularized through john holt 's newsletter growing without schooling ( gws ) in an early essay , holt contrasted the two terms : gws will say 'unschooling ' when we mean taking children out of school , and 'deschooling ' when we mean changing the laws to make schools non-compulsory the term '' unschooling '' became used as a contrast to versions of home schooling that were perceived as politically and pedagogically '' school-like , '' using textbooks and exercises at home , the same way they would be used at school in 2003 , in holt 's book teach your own ( originally published in 1981 ) , pat farenga , co-author of the new edition , provided a definition : when pressed , i define unschooling as allowing children as much freedom to learn in the world as their parents can comfortably bear radical unschooling emphasizes that unschooling is a non-coercive , cooperative practice , and seeks to promote those values in all areas of life unschoolers question schools for lessening the parent/child bond and reducing family time and creating atmospheres of fear , or atmospheres that are not conducive for learning and may not even correspond with later success some unschoolers criticize that in schools , children are taught a set of facts and skills that they might not need in the future anymore , while with unschooling , they learn how to learn , which is far more sustainable for their life also , some say that in school , children are only taught how to follow instructions , which means that they face problems with doing tasks they have not done before another argument is that the structure of school is not suitable for people who want to make their own decisions about what , when , how and with whom they learn because many things are predetermined there , while you are more free in these decisions when unschooled unschoolers may have time to share a role in their greater community , therefore relating more to older and younger individuals and finding their place within more diverse groups of people according to unschooling pioneer john holt , child-led learning is more efficient and respectful of children 's time , takes advantage of their interests , and allows deeper exploration of subjects than what is possible in conventional education sudbury model schools are non-coercive , non-indoctrinative , cooperative , democratically run partnerships between children and adults , including full parents ' partnership , where learning is individualized and child-led , and complements home education opportunities for unschoolers to meet and interact with other unschoolers has increased in recent years , allowing unschoolers to have interactions with other children with similar experiences many unschoolers believe that opportunities for valuable hands-on , community-based , spontaneous , and real-world experiences may be missed when educational opportunities are limited to , or dominated by , those inside a school building unschoolers note that psychologists have documented many differences between children in the way they learn , and assert that unschooling is better equipped to adapt to these differences developmental psychologists note that just as children reach growth milestones at different ages from each other , children are also prepared to learn different things at different ages parents of unschoolers provide resources , support , guidance , information , and advice to facilitate experiences that aid their children in accessing , navigating , and making sense of the world unschooling is a form of homeschooling , which is the education of children at home or other places rather than in a school parents who unschool their children act as facilitators , providing a range of resources , helping their children access , navigate , and make sense of the world , and aiding them in making and implementing goals and plans for both the distant and immediate future guaranteeing that children will learn â€“ some persons doubt that every unschooled children wants to learn and , for example , think it is more likely that they will play video games all day instead .

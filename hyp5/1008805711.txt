there is still not a consensus over the precise botany species of clover that is the '' true '' shamrock john gerard in his herbal of 1597 defined the shamrock as trifolium pratense or trifolium pratense flore albo , meaning red or white clover he described the plant in english as '' three leaved grasse '' or '' medow trefoile '' , '' which are called in irish shamrockes '' the irish botanist caleb threlkeld , writing in 1726 in his work entitled synopsis stirpium hibernicarum or a treatise on native irish plants followed gerard in identifying the shamrock as trifolium pratense , calling it white field clover linnaeus based his information that the irish ate shamrock on the comments of english elizabethan authors such as edmund spenser who remarked that the shamrock used to be eaten by the irish , especially in times of hardship and famine it has since been argued however , that the elizabethans were confused by the similarity between the irish ( gaelic ) name for young clover seamr처g , and the name for wood sorrel seams처g bichino falsely claimed that clover was not a native irish plant and had only been introduced into ireland in the middle of the 17th century , and based his argument on the same comments by elizabethan authors that shamrock had been eaten bicheno argued that this fitted the wood sorrel better than clover , as wood sorrel was often eaten as a green and used to flavour food the results of both surveys were very similar , showing that the conception of the shamrock in ireland had changed little in almost a hundred years the rose , thistle and shamrock motif also appears regularly on british public buildings such as buckingham palace throughout the nineteenth century the popularity of the shamrock as a symbol of ireland grew , and it was depicted in many illustrations on items such as book covers and st for example , a popular ballad called the shamrock shore lamented the state of ireland in the nineteenth century for example , the shamrock appeared on many buildings in ireland as a decorative motif , such as on the facade of the kildare street club building in dublin , st shamrock is also used in emblems of uk organisations with an association with ireland , such as the irish guards examples include the irish football association ( northern ireland ) , irish rugby football union , swim ireland , cricket ireland , and the olympic council of ireland the shamrock is the official emblem of irish football club shamrock rovers london irish rugby football club has a shamrock on its crest the german football club spvgg greuther f체rth also has a shamrock in its badge as it is a symbol of the city of f체rth

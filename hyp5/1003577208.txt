in particular , the steepness and complexity of the response curve is a deciding factor for the filter order and feasibility in relation to the desired frequency function , there may also be an accompanying weighting function , which describes , for each frequency , how important it is that the resulting frequency function approximates the desired one typical examples of frequency function are : a low-pass filter is used to cut unwanted high-frequency signals a high-pass filter passes high frequencies fairly well ; it is helpful as a filter to cut any unwanted low-frequency components a band-stop filter passes frequencies above and below a certain range a low-shelf filter passes all frequencies , but increases or reduces frequencies below the shelf frequency by specified amount a high-shelf filter passes all frequencies , but increases or reduces frequencies above the shelf frequency by specified amount that means that any requirement on the frequency function is a requirement on the impulse response , and vice versa in some cases it may even be relevant to consider a frequency function and impulse response of the filter which are chosen independently from each other the latter condition can be realized by considering a very narrow function as the wanted impulse response of the filter even though this function has no relation to the desired frequency function in order to be implementable , any time-dependent filter ( operating in real time ) must be causal : the filter response only depends on the current and past inputs allows the design of zero delay recursive filters , where the group delay of a causal filter is canceled by its hermitian non-causal filter a stable filter assures that every limited input signal produces a limited filter response this implies that it is sometimes important to keep the width of the filter 's impulse response function as short as possible consequently , it may not be possible to simultaneously meet requirements on the locality of the filter 's impulse response function as well as on its frequency function in this case , a significant reduction in computational complexity can be obtained if the filter can be separated as the convolution of one 1d filter in the horizontal direction and one 1d filter in the vertical direction , be to approximate some desired filter as a separable filter or as a sum of separable filters ) infinite impulse response , or iir , filters are the digital counterpart to analog filters for example , it is not possible to obtain a filter which has both an arbitrary impulse response and arbitrary frequency function this implies that if a specific frequency function is requested , corresponding to a specific frequency width , the minimum width of the filter in the signal domain is set this is done by choosing a narrow ideal filter impulse response function , e.g

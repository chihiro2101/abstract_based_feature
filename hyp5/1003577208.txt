in particular , the steepness and complexity of the response curve is a deciding factor for the filter order and feasibility typical examples of frequency function are : a low-pass filter is used to cut unwanted high-frequency signals a high-pass filter passes high frequencies fairly well ; it is helpful as a filter to cut any unwanted low-frequency components a very narrow band-stop filter is known as a notch filter a peak eq filter makes a peak or a dip in the frequency response , commonly used in equalization ( audio ) for example , we may want both a specific frequency function of the filter and that the resulting filter have a small effective width in the signal domain as possible the latter condition can be realized by considering a very narrow function as the wanted impulse response of the filter even though this function has no relation to the desired frequency function the goal of the design process is then to realize a filter which tries to meet both these contradicting design goals as much as possible in order to be implementable , any time-dependent filter ( operating in real time ) must be causal : the filter response only depends on the current and past inputs allows the design of zero delay recursive filters , where the group delay of a causal filter is canceled by its hermitian non-causal filter a filter which does not meet this requirement may in some situations prove useless or even harmful this implies that it is sometimes important to keep the width of the filter 's impulse response function as short as possible a general desire in any design is that the number of operations ( additions and multiplications ) needed to compute the filter response is as low as possible if the filter has many coefficients , for example in the case of multidimensional signals such as tomography data , it may be relevant to reduce the number of coefficients by removing those which are sufficiently close to zero in this case , a significant reduction in computational complexity can be obtained if the filter can be separated as the convolution of one 1d filter in the horizontal direction and one 1d filter in the vertical direction a moving average filter or cic filter are examples of fir filters that are normally recursive ( that use feedback ) such a filter contains internal state , and the output and the next internal state are determined by a linear combination of the previous inputs and outputs ( in other words , they use feedback , which fir filters normally do not ) for any digital filter design , it is crucial to analyze and avoid aliasing effects this is a typical example of contradictory requirements where the filter design process may try to find a useful compromise the previous method can be extended to include an additional error term related to a desired filter impulse response in the signal domain , with a corresponding weighting function the optimal filter can still be calculated by solving a simple least squares problem and the resulting filter is then a '' compromise '' which has a total optimal fit to the ideal functions in both domains

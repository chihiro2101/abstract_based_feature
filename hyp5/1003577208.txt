in relation to the desired frequency function , there may also be an accompanying weighting function , which describes , for each frequency , how important it is that the resulting frequency function approximates the desired one typical examples of frequency function are : a low-pass filter is used to cut unwanted high-frequency signals a high-pass filter passes high frequencies fairly well ; it is helpful as a filter to cut any unwanted low-frequency components a band-pass filter passes a limited range of frequencies a low-shelf filter passes all frequencies , but increases or reduces frequencies below the shelf frequency by specified amount filters of this type can be used to equalize the group delay of recursive filters however , in certain applications it may be the filter 's impulse response that is explicit and the design process then aims at producing as close an approximation as possible to the requested impulse response given all other requirements in some cases it may even be relevant to consider a frequency function and impulse response of the filter which are chosen independently from each other for example , we may want both a specific frequency function of the filter and that the resulting filter have a small effective width in the signal domain as possible the latter condition can be realized by considering a very narrow function as the wanted impulse response of the filter even though this function has no relation to the desired frequency function allows the design of zero delay recursive filters , where the group delay of a causal filter is canceled by its hermitian non-causal filter a consequence of applying a filter to a signal is , in intuitive terms , that the duration of the local phenomena is extended by the width of the filter this implies that it is sometimes important to keep the width of the filter 's impulse response function as short as possible this means that any requirement on the filter 's locality also implies a bound on its frequency function 's width consequently , it may not be possible to simultaneously meet requirements on the locality of the filter 's impulse response function as well as on its frequency function a general desire in any design is that the number of operations ( additions and multiplications ) needed to compute the filter response is as low as possible for discrete filters the computational complexity is more or less proportional to the number of filter coefficients fir filters are generally easier to design than iir filters - the parks-mcclellan filter design algorithm ( based on the remez algorithm ) is one suitable method for designing quite good filters semi-automatically this implies that if a specific frequency function is requested , corresponding to a specific frequency width , the minimum width of the filter in the signal domain is set this is a typical example of contradictory requirements where the filter design process may try to find a useful compromise this is done by choosing a narrow ideal filter impulse response function , e.g

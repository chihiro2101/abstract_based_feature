in relation to the desired frequency function , there may also be an accompanying weighting function , which describes , for each frequency , how important it is that the resulting frequency function approximates the desired one a high-pass filter passes high frequencies fairly well ; it is helpful as a filter to cut any unwanted low-frequency components a band-pass filter passes a limited range of frequencies a band-stop filter passes frequencies above and below a certain range a very narrow band-stop filter is known as a notch filter a high-shelf filter passes all frequencies , but increases or reduces frequencies above the shelf frequency by specified amount an all-pass filter passes through all frequencies unchanged , but changes the phase of the signal a fractional delay filter is an all-pass that has a specified and constant group or phase delay for all frequencies there is a direct correspondence between the filter 's frequency function and its impulse response : the former is the fourier transform of the latter that means that any requirement on the frequency function is a requirement on the impulse response , and vice versa however , in certain applications it may be the filter 's impulse response that is explicit and the design process then aims at producing as close an approximation as possible to the requested impulse response given all other requirements in some cases it may even be relevant to consider a frequency function and impulse response of the filter which are chosen independently from each other for example , we may want both a specific frequency function of the filter and that the resulting filter have a small effective width in the signal domain as possible the goal of the design process is then to realize a filter which tries to meet both these contradicting design goals as much as possible a stable filter assures that every limited input signal produces a limited filter response a filter which does not meet this requirement may in some situations prove useless or even harmful this implies that it is sometimes important to keep the width of the filter 's impulse response function as short as possible a result of the filter design process may , e.g iir filters normally require less computing resources than an fir filter of similar performance this is a typical example of contradictory requirements where the filter design process may try to find a useful compromise this is done by choosing a narrow ideal filter impulse response function , e.g

in particular , the steepness and complexity of the response curve is a deciding factor for the filter order and feasibility in relation to the desired frequency function , there may also be an accompanying weighting function , which describes , for each frequency , how important it is that the resulting frequency function approximates the desired one typical examples of frequency function are : a low-pass filter is used to cut unwanted high-frequency signals a very narrow band-stop filter is known as a notch filter a low-shelf filter passes all frequencies , but increases or reduces frequencies below the shelf frequency by specified amount a high-shelf filter passes all frequencies , but increases or reduces frequencies above the shelf frequency by specified amount filters of this type can be used to equalize the group delay of recursive filters however , in certain applications it may be the filter 's impulse response that is explicit and the design process then aims at producing as close an approximation as possible to the requested impulse response given all other requirements in some cases it may even be relevant to consider a frequency function and impulse response of the filter which are chosen independently from each other the goal of the design process is then to realize a filter which tries to meet both these contradicting design goals as much as possible if the resulting filter is not causal , it can be made causal by introducing an appropriate time-shift ( or delay ) allows the design of zero delay recursive filters , where the group delay of a causal filter is canceled by its hermitian non-causal filter in this case , the filters must be carefully designed in order to avoid instability a consequence of applying a filter to a signal is , in intuitive terms , that the duration of the local phenomena is extended by the width of the filter this implies that it is sometimes important to keep the width of the filter 's impulse response function as short as possible this means that any requirement on the filter 's locality also implies a bound on its frequency function 's width it must also be decided how the filter is going to be implemented : analog filter analog sampled filter digital filter mechanical filter a moving average filter or cic filter are examples of fir filters that are normally recursive ( that use feedback ) parts of the design problem relate to the fact that certain requirements are described in the frequency domain while others are expressed in the signal domain and that these may contradict this is a typical example of contradictory requirements where the filter design process may try to find a useful compromise the previous method can be extended to include an additional error term related to a desired filter impulse response in the signal domain , with a corresponding weighting function

in particular , the steepness and complexity of the response curve is a deciding factor for the filter order and feasibility in relation to the desired frequency function , there may also be an accompanying weighting function , which describes , for each frequency , how important it is that the resulting frequency function approximates the desired one typical examples of frequency function are : a low-pass filter is used to cut unwanted high-frequency signals a high-pass filter passes high frequencies fairly well ; it is helpful as a filter to cut any unwanted low-frequency components a very narrow band-stop filter is known as a notch filter a low-shelf filter passes all frequencies , but increases or reduces frequencies below the shelf frequency by specified amount a peak eq filter makes a peak or a dip in the frequency response , commonly used in equalization ( audio ) filters of this type can be used to equalize the group delay of recursive filters however , in certain applications it may be the filter 's impulse response that is explicit and the design process then aims at producing as close an approximation as possible to the requested impulse response given all other requirements in some cases it may even be relevant to consider a frequency function and impulse response of the filter which are chosen independently from each other for example , we may want both a specific frequency function of the filter and that the resulting filter have a small effective width in the signal domain as possible the latter condition can be realized by considering a very narrow function as the wanted impulse response of the filter even though this function has no relation to the desired frequency function the goal of the design process is then to realize a filter which tries to meet both these contradicting design goals as much as possible if the filter is a part of a larger system ( which it normally is ) these types of delays have to be introduced with care since they affect the operation of the entire system a stable filter assures that every limited input signal produces a limited filter response consequently , it may not be possible to simultaneously meet requirements on the locality of the filter 's impulse response function as well as on its frequency function in this case , a significant reduction in computational complexity can be obtained if the filter can be separated as the convolution of one 1d filter in the horizontal direction and one 1d filter in the vertical direction a moving average filter or cic filter are examples of fir filters that are normally recursive ( that use feedback ) for any digital filter design , it is crucial to analyze and avoid aliasing effects parts of the design problem relate to the fact that certain requirements are described in the frequency domain while others are expressed in the signal domain and that these may contradict this is a typical example of contradictory requirements where the filter design process may try to find a useful compromise

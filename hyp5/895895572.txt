prior to 1895 , all income taxes had been considered indirect taxes ( not required to be apportioned among the states according to the population of each state ) , however , the court had overturned longstanding precedent and ruled that while a tax on income from labor was an excise , or indirect tax ( which was not required to be apportioned ) , a tax on income derived from property such as interest , dividends , or rents was or should be treated as a direct tax congress had enacted legislation pursuant to the amendment assessing taxes to the wealthiest of income earners , including the railroad company in this case the revenue act of 1913 , imposing income taxes that are not apportioned among the states according to each state 's population , is constitutional there can be no dispute that there was power by virtue of the amendment during that period to levy the tax , without apportionment , and so far as the limitations of the constitution in other respects are concerned , the contention is not open the court also held that the revenue act does not violate the fifth amendment 's prohibition against the government taking property without due process of law the court further held that the revenue act does not violate the uniformity clause of article i , section 8 of the u.s in brushaber the court noted that even before the sixteenth amendment was passed , the congress had authority to tax income if a particular income tax was a direct tax or was treated as a direct tax in the constitutional sense , that tax could be imposed ( after pollock but before the passage of the amendment ) only by apportionment among the states , according to their census populations no income tax enacted by the us congress ( either before or after the sixteenth amendment ) has ever been apportioned among the states by population all income taxes enacted after the amendment have been treated as excises ( they have been imposed with geographic uniformity but have not been required to be apportioned ) the sixteenth amendment removed the need imposed by the pollock decision to determine whether an income tax in any particular case was required to be apportioned , as the congress could again ( after 1913 ) tax income from any source without having to apportion the tax according to population for example , if the us congress were to enact a national property tax ( a property tax or other tax by reason of its ownership ) or a national capitation ( a poll tax or head tax ) , such taxes would be required to be apportioned

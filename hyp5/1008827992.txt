the other important aspect of the multiplier is that to the extent that government spending generates new consumption , it also generates '' new '' tax revenues indeed , in theory , it is possible , if the initial expenditure is targeted well , that the government could receive back more than the initial 1 expended the multiplier effect is exploited by governments attempting to use fiscal stimulus policies to increase the general level of economic activity the idea is that the total increase in production and income by all parties throughout the economy may be greater than the original increment to government spending , as additional resources are drawn into the circular flows of money spending and business activity through the economy the existence of idle capacity and involuntary unemployment of labor in the economy can be represented as an output gap—a difference between actual gdp and potential gdp—and a policy of fiscal stimulus may aim at introducing sufficient additional spending , amplified by the multiplier , to speed the closing of the output gap any additional spending by government must be financed , by drawing down reserves , by additional taxes or by issuing additional government debt instruments ( i.e increased borrowing to finance additional government purchases might also be supposed to be designed to draw out of the circulating flow an amount equal to the additional government purchases , perhaps by crowding out private borrowing for investment spending in the history of economic thought , the notion that any increase in government spending necessarily crowds out an equal amount of private spending or investment , through taxation or borrowing , and thus has no net impact on economic activity , is known as the treasury view , and is regarded as generally fallacious when unemployment of resources in the economy is high , and cash , in effect , is being hoarded in the financial and credit system , the fiscal multiplier may be 1 or greater government borrowing to finance additional public purchases in circumstances in which cash is being hoarded in the financial and credit system will not displace private investment spending an additional supply of low-risk government securities may simply provide vehicles for continued hoarding as short-term government securities are regarded as closely equivalent to cash in such circumstances , policy to increase aggregate demand and total business activity by means of fiscal measures may treat additional purchases and reductions in taxes as interchangeable near equivalents , with the changes in the net difference between spending and taxation identified as the deficit-financed fiscal stimulus the net fiscal stimulus may be increased by raising spending above the level of tax revenues , reducing taxes below the level of government spending , or any combination of the two that results in the government taxing less than it spends for example , it may be argued that tax cuts or spending aimed at the lowest income households , whose spending is most constrained by income , will have a higher multiplier , because such households will spend a larger fraction of any addition to income faster additional public borrowing and spending would tend to increase interest rates , because the monetary authority would increase interest rates in response to additional public borrowing and spending , in an effort to contain the effects on the level of public activity—to prevent overheating in the demand for resources and inflation , for example y is original output ( gdp ) b_c is marginal propensity to consume ( mpc ) b_t is original income tax rate b_m is marginal propensity to import \delta y is change in income ( equivalent to gdp ) \delta g is change in government spending \delta t is change in aggregate taxes complex multiplier fiscal policy keynesian economics local multiplier effect transfer payments multiplier multiplier uncertainty

the other important aspect of the multiplier is that to the extent that government spending generates new consumption , it also generates '' new '' tax revenues the multiplier effect is exploited by governments attempting to use fiscal stimulus policies to increase the general level of economic activity increased spending by government increases the rate of aggregate demand , increasing business activity , which increases income , which further increases spending and aggregate demand , in a virtuous cycle the idea is that the total increase in production and income by all parties throughout the economy may be greater than the original increment to government spending , as additional resources are drawn into the circular flows of money spending and business activity through the economy the existence of idle capacity and involuntary unemployment of labor in the economy can be represented as an output gap—a difference between actual gdp and potential gdp—and a policy of fiscal stimulus may aim at introducing sufficient additional spending , amplified by the multiplier , to speed the closing of the output gap increased borrowing to finance additional government purchases might also be supposed to be designed to draw out of the circulating flow an amount equal to the additional government purchases , perhaps by crowding out private borrowing for investment spending in the history of economic thought , the notion that any increase in government spending necessarily crowds out an equal amount of private spending or investment , through taxation or borrowing , and thus has no net impact on economic activity , is known as the treasury view , and is regarded as generally fallacious the argument that the choice of taxes or borrowing to finance government spending must be equivalent in that taxpayers observe borrowing and save in anticipation of taxes to repay the borrowing is known as ricardian equivalence , and is sometimes cited as a rationale for believing that fiscal stimulus policy will be made futile by the reactions of rational consumers and businesses , reducing their spending or investing in exact proportion to increases in public spending , in a scenario similar to that envisioned in the treasury view even a balanced budget fiscal stimulus—additional public purchases fully financed by equivalent increases in taxation without any additional public borrowing—may have a multiplier greater than 1 , as the increase in output and business activity reduces persistent unemployment and the anxiety driving hoarding , with resulting increases in private consumption and investment reducing the time it takes for the economy to return to full employment government borrowing to finance additional public purchases in circumstances in which cash is being hoarded in the financial and credit system will not displace private investment spending in such circumstances , policy to increase aggregate demand and total business activity by means of fiscal measures may treat additional purchases and reductions in taxes as interchangeable near equivalents , with the changes in the net difference between spending and taxation identified as the deficit-financed fiscal stimulus the net fiscal stimulus may be increased by raising spending above the level of tax revenues , reducing taxes below the level of government spending , or any combination of the two that results in the government taxing less than it spends for example , it may be argued that tax cuts or spending aimed at the lowest income households , whose spending is most constrained by income , will have a higher multiplier , because such households will spend a larger fraction of any addition to income faster how potent a fiscal stimulus is in stimulating expansion of economic activity may depend on how accommodating the monetary authority—the central bank—is whether that would or should justify otherwise wasteful government spending is controversial , on the one hand , and on the other hand , whether the supposed wastefulness of government spending justifies reducing multiplier estimates that reflect only gdp effects to smaller estimates reflecting welfare effects , remains a matter of political controversy osborne 's indiscriminate austerity fiscal multipliers , the imf and the obr it has been conservatively estimated by the tuc that the obr 's use of the imf 's under-estimated fiscal multiplication values means that they may have under-estimated the economic damage caused by the uk government 's austerity policies by £76 billion complex multiplier fiscal policy keynesian economics local multiplier effect transfer payments multiplier multiplier uncertainty

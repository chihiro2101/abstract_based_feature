the other important aspect of the multiplier is that to the extent that government spending generates new consumption , it also generates '' new '' tax revenues for example , when money is spent in a shop , purchases taxes such as vat are paid on the expenditure , and the shopkeeper earns a higher income , and thus pays more income taxes indeed , in theory , it is possible , if the initial expenditure is targeted well , that the government could receive back more than the initial 1 expended the builders will have higher disposable income , and consumption may rise , so that aggregate demand will also rise the multiplier effect is exploited by governments attempting to use fiscal stimulus policies to increase the general level of economic activity increased spending by government increases the rate of aggregate demand , increasing business activity , which increases income , which further increases spending and aggregate demand , in a virtuous cycle the idea is that the total increase in production and income by all parties throughout the economy may be greater than the original increment to government spending , as additional resources are drawn into the circular flows of money spending and business activity through the economy increased borrowing to finance additional government purchases might also be supposed to be designed to draw out of the circulating flow an amount equal to the additional government purchases , perhaps by crowding out private borrowing for investment spending in the history of economic thought , the notion that any increase in government spending necessarily crowds out an equal amount of private spending or investment , through taxation or borrowing , and thus has no net impact on economic activity , is known as the treasury view , and is regarded as generally fallacious even a balanced budget fiscal stimulus—additional public purchases fully financed by equivalent increases in taxation without any additional public borrowing—may have a multiplier greater than 1 , as the increase in output and business activity reduces persistent unemployment and the anxiety driving hoarding , with resulting increases in private consumption and investment reducing the time it takes for the economy to return to full employment in such circumstances , policy to increase aggregate demand and total business activity by means of fiscal measures may treat additional purchases and reductions in taxes as interchangeable near equivalents , with the changes in the net difference between spending and taxation identified as the deficit-financed fiscal stimulus the net fiscal stimulus may be increased by raising spending above the level of tax revenues , reducing taxes below the level of government spending , or any combination of the two that results in the government taxing less than it spends for example , it may be argued that tax cuts or spending aimed at the lowest income households , whose spending is most constrained by income , will have a higher multiplier , because such households will spend a larger fraction of any addition to income faster additional public borrowing and spending would tend to increase interest rates , because the monetary authority would increase interest rates in response to additional public borrowing and spending , in an effort to contain the effects on the level of public activity—to prevent overheating in the demand for resources and inflation , for example y is original output ( gdp ) b_c is marginal propensity to consume ( mpc ) b_t is original income tax rate b_m is marginal propensity to import \delta y is change in income ( equivalent to gdp ) \delta g is change in government spending \delta t is change in aggregate taxes it has been claimed that increased fiscal activity does not always lead to increased economic activity because deficit spending can crowd out financing for other economic activity by pushing up interest rates complex multiplier fiscal policy keynesian economics local multiplier effect transfer payments multiplier multiplier uncertainty

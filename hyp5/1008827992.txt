the other important aspect of the multiplier is that to the extent that government spending generates new consumption , it also generates '' new '' tax revenues for example , when money is spent in a shop , purchases taxes such as vat are paid on the expenditure , and the shopkeeper earns a higher income , and thus pays more income taxes the multiplier effect is exploited by governments attempting to use fiscal stimulus policies to increase the general level of economic activity the idea is that the total increase in production and income by all parties throughout the economy may be greater than the original increment to government spending , as additional resources are drawn into the circular flows of money spending and business activity through the economy increased taxes exactly matched to increased spending might seem designed to draw out of the circulating flow of the economy an amount of income in taxes exactly equal to the amount being injected by additional government purchases in the history of economic thought , the notion that any increase in government spending necessarily crowds out an equal amount of private spending or investment , through taxation or borrowing , and thus has no net impact on economic activity , is known as the treasury view , and is regarded as generally fallacious when unemployment of resources in the economy is high , and cash , in effect , is being hoarded in the financial and credit system , the fiscal multiplier may be 1 or greater even a balanced budget fiscal stimulus—additional public purchases fully financed by equivalent increases in taxation without any additional public borrowing—may have a multiplier greater than 1 , as the increase in output and business activity reduces persistent unemployment and the anxiety driving hoarding , with resulting increases in private consumption and investment reducing the time it takes for the economy to return to full employment government borrowing to finance additional public purchases in circumstances in which cash is being hoarded in the financial and credit system will not displace private investment spending in such circumstances , policy to increase aggregate demand and total business activity by means of fiscal measures may treat additional purchases and reductions in taxes as interchangeable near equivalents , with the changes in the net difference between spending and taxation identified as the deficit-financed fiscal stimulus the net fiscal stimulus may be increased by raising spending above the level of tax revenues , reducing taxes below the level of government spending , or any combination of the two that results in the government taxing less than it spends the extent of the multiplier effect in increasing domestic business activity is dependent upon the marginal propensity to consume and marginal propensity to import for example , it may be argued that tax cuts or spending aimed at the lowest income households , whose spending is most constrained by income , will have a higher multiplier , because such households will spend a larger fraction of any addition to income faster additional public borrowing and spending would tend to increase interest rates , because the monetary authority would increase interest rates in response to additional public borrowing and spending , in an effort to contain the effects on the level of public activity—to prevent overheating in the demand for resources and inflation , for example y is original output ( gdp ) b_c is marginal propensity to consume ( mpc ) b_t is original income tax rate b_m is marginal propensity to import \delta y is change in income ( equivalent to gdp ) \delta g is change in government spending \delta t is change in aggregate taxes osborne 's indiscriminate austerity fiscal multipliers , the imf and the obr it has been conservatively estimated by the tuc that the obr 's use of the imf 's under-estimated fiscal multiplication values means that they may have under-estimated the economic damage caused by the uk government 's austerity policies by £76 billion it has been claimed that increased fiscal activity does not always lead to increased economic activity because deficit spending can crowd out financing for other economic activity by pushing up interest rates

but marginally affordable , so they became one of the most popular home computer models in the soviet union , despite the fact that they had numerous problems later , in the 1990s , their powerful cpu and straightforward , easy-to-program design made them popular as demoscene the intellivision used a very similar , fully 16-bit cpu , the general instrument cp1600 , and with the keyboard component or ecs expansions , it was turned into a fully 16-bit home computer the ibm pc and pcjr were 8/16-bit computers , as their 8088 cpu has an 8-bit data bus and a 16-bit internal bus the bk series was essentially a barebones machine , without any peripherals or development tools the rom firmware includes a simple program to enter machine codes , basic and focal interpreters the dvk became a popular development platform for bk software , and when the bk memory was later extended to 128 kib , most dvk software could be used directly with minimal changes this led to an explosion of homebrew software , from text editors and databases to operating systems and games one of the operating systems was andos , although officially the computer was shipped with os bk-11 , a modification of rt-11 the first versions has 32 kib onboard dram , half of which was used as video memory that is extended to 128 kib in later models , with video memory extended to two 16 kib pages later models has 16 hardwired 4-color sets selectable from 64 color palette later models includes a manufacturer-supplied floppy drive controller ( that can be plugged into a q-bus slot ) by default it was available for earlier models as an aftermarket part , but homebrew ones ( that also often extends rather anemic 16k memory of original bk ) are more popular the resulting model , the bk-0011m , quickly went into production , and most bk-0011 series computers are actually bk-0011ms this changes the processor clock rate from the standard 3 & nbsp ; mhz ( bk-0010 series ) to 4 or 6 & nbsp ; mhz , or from the standard 4 & nbsp ; mhz ( bk-0011 series ) to 3 or 6 & nbsp ; mhz electronika bk0010 ( -01 ) & bk0011 ( m ) ussr pc pdp-11 bk0010 russian computer emul

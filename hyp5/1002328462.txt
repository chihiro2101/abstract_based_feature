doc adams of the knickerbockers created the concept of the shortstop position , according to baseball historian john thorn and baseball hall of fame researcher freddy berowski adams 's shortstop position , which he started playing at some time from 1849 to 1850 , was used to field throws from the outfielders and throw to the three infielders because right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball more toward third base , a shortstop will generally move closer to third base if the batter is batting right-handed , and more toward first base if the batter is batting left-handed a shortstop typically has a strong throwing arm , because he has a relatively long throw to first base , and often has less time in which to make a throw , given that the ground balls he fields have often traveled relatively far a shortstop must also be extremely agile , because balls hit to or near the shortstop position are usually hit harder than to other infield positions they also cover second when a runner is attempting a stolen base , but only when a left-handed hitter is batting because the infield will respond to a left-handed batter by shifting toward first base , resulting in the shortstop being the infielder who is closest to second base shortstops also must cover third at various times , including the rotation play ; the latter occurs when there are runners on first and second and a sacrifice bunt is attempted toward third base , requiring the third baseman to move in away from third base in order to field it they often become the cutoff man on balls to any part of the outfield that are being directed towards third base and all balls to left and center field that are destined for second base george wright was elected as a pioneer , but also starred as a shortstop in the 1860s and 1870s image : jetershortstop.jpg thumb right 200px yankees former shortstop derek jeter getting ready to field his position in 2007 : 583 ( baltimore orioles , 1984 ) whitey wietelmann : 581 ( boston braves , 1943 ) dave bancroft : 579 ( new york giants , 1922 ) rabbit maranville : 574 ( boston braves , 1914 ) don kessinger : 573 ( chicago cubs , 1968 ) source : ( does not list teams )

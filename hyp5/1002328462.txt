doc adams of the knickerbockers created the concept of the shortstop position , according to baseball historian john thorn and baseball hall of fame researcher freddy berowski adams 's shortstop position , which he started playing at some time from 1849 to 1850 , was used to field throws from the outfielders and throw to the three infielders see www.baseballexplained.com the shortstop ordinarily is positioned near second base on the third-base side because right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball more toward third base , a shortstop will generally move closer to third base if the batter is batting right-handed , and more toward first base if the batter is batting left-handed a shortstop typically has a strong throwing arm , because he has a relatively long throw to first base , and often has less time in which to make a throw , given that the ground balls he fields have often traveled relatively far a shortstop must also be extremely agile , because balls hit to or near the shortstop position are usually hit harder than to other infield positions they also cover second when a runner is attempting a stolen base , but only when a left-handed hitter is batting because the infield will respond to a left-handed batter by shifting toward first base , resulting in the shortstop being the infielder who is closest to second base they often become the cutoff man on balls to any part of the outfield that are being directed towards third base and all balls to left and center field that are destined for second base depending on the system the shortstop may cut balls from left field heading home ; however , this is usually the job of the third baseman some of the weakest hitters in major league baseball have played the position , including mario mendoza , for whom george brett popularized the eponymous mendoza line to describe a batting average below gold glove award winners : list of gold glove award winners at shortstop list of gold glove middle infield duos one theory of how the shortstop position got its name

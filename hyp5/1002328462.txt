doc adams of the knickerbockers created the concept of the shortstop position , according to baseball historian john thorn and baseball hall of fame researcher freddy berowski in the first five years the knickerbockers played , the team fielded anywhere from eight to eleven players adams 's shortstop position , which he started playing at some time from 1849 to 1850 , was used to field throws from the outfielders and throw to the three infielders with the advent of higher-quality baseballs , adams moved to the infield , since the distance the balls could travel increased because right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball more toward third base , a shortstop will generally move closer to third base if the batter is batting right-handed , and more toward first base if the batter is batting left-handed a shortstop typically has a strong throwing arm , because he has a relatively long throw to first base , and often has less time in which to make a throw , given that the ground balls he fields have often traveled relatively far a shortstop must also be extremely agile , because balls hit to or near the shortstop position are usually hit harder than to other infield positions they also cover second when a runner is attempting a stolen base , but only when a left-handed hitter is batting because the infield will respond to a left-handed batter by shifting toward first base , resulting in the shortstop being the infielder who is closest to second base shortstops also must cover third at various times , including the rotation play ; the latter occurs when there are runners on first and second and a sacrifice bunt is attempted toward third base , requiring the third baseman to move in away from third base in order to field it depending on the system the shortstop may cut balls from left field heading home ; however , this is usually the job of the third baseman ( 2007 ) phil rizzuto ( 1994 ) joe sewell ( 1977 ) ozzie smith ( 2002 ) joe tinker ( 1946 ) alan trammell ( 2018 ) arky vaughan ( 1985 ) honus wagner ( 1936 ) bobby wallace ( 1953 ) john montgomery ward ( 1964 ) willie wells ( 1997 ) george wright ( 1937 ) robin yount ( 1999 )

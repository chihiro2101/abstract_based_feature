aflatoxin b1 is considered the most toxic and is produced by both aspergillus flavus and aspergillus parasiticus aflatoxin m1 is present in the fermentation broth of aspergillus parasiticus , but it and aflatoxin m 2 are also produced when an infected liver metabolizes aflatoxin b 1 and b 2 aflatoxin b 1 and b 2 ( afb ) , produced by aspergillus flavus and a parasiticus aflatoxin g 1 and g 2 ( afg ) , produced by some group ii a aflatoxins are produced by both aspergillus flavus and aspergillus parasiticus , which are common forms of 'weedy ' molds widespread in nature the molds can colonize and contaminate food before harvest or during storage , especially following prolonged exposure to a high-humidity environment , or to stressful conditions such as drought aflatoxin transformation products are sometimes found in eggs , milk products , and meat when animals are fed contaminated grains there is very limited evidence to show that agricultural and nutritional education can reduce exposure to aflatoxin in low to middle income countries adult humans have a high tolerance for aflatoxin exposure and rarely succumb to acute aflatoxicosis , but children are particularly affected , and their exposure can lead to stunted growth and delayed development , in addition to all the symptoms mentioned below chronic exposure increases the risk of developing liver and gallbladder cancer , as aflatoxin metabolites may intercalate into dna and alkylate the bases through epoxide moiety in 2005 , diamond pet foods discovered aflatoxin in a product manufactured at their facility in gaston , south carolina due to the half-life of this metabolite , the level of afb 1 -guanine measured may vary from day to day , based on diet , it is not ideal for assessing long-term exposure

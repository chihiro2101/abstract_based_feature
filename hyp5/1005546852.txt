aflatoxin b1 is considered the most toxic and is produced by both aspergillus flavus and aspergillus parasiticus aflatoxin m1 is present in the fermentation broth of aspergillus parasiticus , but it and aflatoxin m 2 are also produced when an infected liver metabolizes aflatoxin b 1 and b 2 aflatoxin b 1 and b 2 ( afb ) , produced by aspergillus flavus and a aflatoxins are produced by both aspergillus flavus and aspergillus parasiticus , which are common forms of 'weedy ' molds widespread in nature the presence of those molds does not always indicate that harmful levels of aflatoxin are present , but does indicate a significant risk the native habitat of aspergillus is in soil , decaying vegetation , hay , and grains undergoing microbiological deterioration , but it invades all types of organic substrates whenever conditions are favorable for its growth the staple commodities regularly contaminated with aflatoxins include cassava , chilies , corn , cotton seed , millet , peanuts , rice , sorghum , sunflower seeds , tree nuts , wheat , and a variety of spices intended for human or animal consumption aflatoxin transformation products are sometimes found in eggs , milk products , and meat when animals are fed contaminated grains a study conducted in kenya and mali found that the predominant practices for drying and storage of maize were inadequate in minimizing exposure to aflatoxins recent studies have revealed that this is due to the efficient cytochrome p450 mediated metabolism of aflatoxin b 1 in the liver of turkeys and deficient glutathione-s-transferase mediated detoxification in many of these contaminated food products , the aflatoxin exceeded the safe limits of the u.s 2021 usa : contamination of pet food manufactured by midwestern pet food , causing the deaths of at least 70 dogs .

aflatoxin m1 is present in the fermentation broth of aspergillus parasiticus , but it and aflatoxin m 2 are also produced when an infected liver metabolizes aflatoxin b 1 and b 2 aflatoxin b 1 and b 2 ( afb ) , produced by aspergillus flavus and a parasiticus aflatoxin g 1 and g 2 ( afg ) , produced by some group ii a the molds can colonize and contaminate food before harvest or during storage , especially following prolonged exposure to a high-humidity environment , or to stressful conditions such as drought the native habitat of aspergillus is in soil , decaying vegetation , hay , and grains undergoing microbiological deterioration , but it invades all types of organic substrates whenever conditions are favorable for its growth aflatoxin transformation products are sometimes found in eggs , milk products , and meat when animals are fed contaminated grains adult humans have a high tolerance for aflatoxin exposure and rarely succumb to acute aflatoxicosis , but children are particularly affected , and their exposure can lead to stunted growth and delayed development , in addition to all the symptoms mentioned below high-level aflatoxin exposure produces an acute liver necrosis ( acute aflatoxicosis ) , resulting later in cirrhosis or liver cancer chronic exposure increases the risk of developing liver and gallbladder cancer , as aflatoxin metabolites may intercalate into dna and alkylate the bases through epoxide moiety some articles have suggested the toxic level in dog food is 100â€“300 ppb and requires continuous exposure or consumption for a few weeks to months to develop aflatoxicosis akc standard article contaminated diamond pet food products and 'best by ' dates narrowed akcstandard.com in december 2020 and january 2021 , midwestern pet foods recalled dog food that contained fatal levels of aflatoxin in many of these contaminated food products , the aflatoxin exceeded the safe limits of the u.s

in 1903 , nikolai koltsov proposed that the shape of cells was determined by a network of tubules that he termed the cytoskeleton when the cytoskeleton was first introduced , it was thought to be an uninteresting gel-like substance that helped organelles stay in place initially , it was thought that the cytoskeleton was exclusive to eukaryotes but in 1992 it was discovered to be present in prokaryotes as well this discovery came after the realization that bacteria possess proteins that are homologous to tubulin and actin ; the main components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton eukaryotic cells contain three main kinds of cytoskeletal filaments : microfilaments , microtubules , and intermediate filaments intermediate filaments are composed of various proteins , depending on the type of cell in which they are found ; they are normally 8-12 & nbsp ; nm in diameter the cytoskeleton provides the cell with structure and shape , and by excluding macromolecules from some of the cytosol , it adds to the level of macromolecular crowding in this compartment research into neurodegeneration such as parkinson 's disease , alzheimer 's disease , huntington 's disease , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) indicate that the cytoskeleton is affected in these diseases in alzheimer 's disease , tau proteins which stabilize microtubules malfunction in the progression of the illness causing pathology of the cytoskeleton excess glutamine in the huntington protein involved with linking vesicles onto the cytoskeleton is also proposed to be a factor in the development of huntington 's disease accessory proteins including motor proteins regulate and link the filaments to other cell compounds and each other and are essential for controlled assembly of cytoskeletal filaments in particular locations microfilaments , also known as actin filaments , are composed of linear polymers of g-actin proteins , and generate force when the growing ( plus ) end of the filament pushes against a barrier , such as the cell membrane these subunits then assemble into two chains that intertwine into what are called f-actin chains myosin motoring along f-actin filaments generates contractile forces in so-called actomyosin fibers , both in muscle as well as most non-muscle cell types functions include : muscle contraction cell movement intracellular transport/trafficking maintenance of eukaryote cell shape cytokinesis cytoplasmic streaming strengthening of epithelial cells with these intermediate filaments may prevent onset of apoptosis , or cell death , by reducing the probability of stress intermediate filaments are most commonly known as the support system or “ scaffolding ” for the cell and nucleus while also playing a role in some cell functions in combination with proteins and desmosomes , the intermediate filaments form cell-cell connections and anchor the cell-matrix junctions that are used in messaging between cells as well as vital functions of the cell these connections allow the cell to communicate through the desmosome of multiple cells to adjust structures of the tissue based on signals from the cells environment vimentin intermediate filaments are in general present in mesenchymal cells in yeast cells , they build scaffolding to provide structural support during cell division and compartmentalize parts of the cell actin cables are bundles of actin filaments and are involved in the transport of vesicles towards the cap ( which contains a number of different proteins to polarize cell growth ) and in the positioning of mitochondria cytoskeletal proteins are usually correlated with cell shape , dna segregation and cell division in prokaryotes and eukaryotes this is because the cell ’ s extra volume requires cytoplasmic streaming in order to move organelles throughout the entire cell

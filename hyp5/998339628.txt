in 1903 , nikolai koltsov proposed that the shape of cells was determined by a network of tubules that he termed the cytoskeleton when the cytoskeleton was first introduced , it was thought to be an uninteresting gel-like substance that helped organelles stay in place this discovery came after the realization that bacteria possess proteins that are homologous to tubulin and actin ; the main components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton eukaryotic cells contain three main kinds of cytoskeletal filaments : microfilaments , microtubules , and intermediate filaments microfilaments are polymers of the protein actin and are 7 & nbsp ; nm in diameter microtubules are composed of tubulin and are 25 & nbsp ; nm in diameter intermediate filaments are composed of various proteins , depending on the type of cell in which they are found ; they are normally 8-12 & nbsp ; nm in diameter the cytoskeleton provides the cell with structure and shape , and by excluding macromolecules from some of the cytosol , it adds to the level of macromolecular crowding in this compartment accessory proteins including motor proteins regulate and link the filaments to other cell compounds and each other and are essential for controlled assembly of cytoskeletal filaments in particular locations these compounds have proven useful in studying the cytoskeleton , and several have clinical applications myosin motoring along f-actin filaments generates contractile forces in so-called actomyosin fibers , both in muscle as well as most non-muscle cell types functions include : muscle contraction cell movement intracellular transport/trafficking maintenance of eukaryote cell shape cytokinesis cytoplasmic streaming intermediate filaments are a part of the cytoskeleton of many eukaryote cells some animals like the fruit fly do not have any cytoplasmic intermediate filaments strengthening of epithelial cells with these intermediate filaments may prevent onset of apoptosis , or cell death , by reducing the probability of stress intermediate filaments are most commonly known as the support system or “ scaffolding ” for the cell and nucleus while also playing a role in some cell functions in combination with proteins and desmosomes , the intermediate filaments form cell-cell connections and anchor the cell-matrix junctions that are used in messaging between cells as well as vital functions of the cell made of desmin , play an important role in structural and mechanical support of muscle cells as both flagella and cilia are structural components of the cell , and are maintained by microtubules , they can be considered part of the cytoskeleton in addition to the roles described above , stuart hameroff and roger penrose have proposed that microtubules function in consciousness the cytoskeleton was once thought to be a feature only of eukaryote cells , but homologues to all the major proteins of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton have been found in prokaryotes by definition , the cytoskeleton is composed of proteins that can form longitudinal arrays ( fibres ) in all organisms cytoskeletal proteins are usually correlated with cell shape , dna segregation and cell division in prokaryotes and eukaryotes cytoplasmic streaming , also known as cyclosis , is the active movement of a cell ’ s contents along the components of the cytoskeleton

in 1903 , nikolai koltsov proposed that the shape of cells was determined by a network of tubules that he termed the cytoskeleton this discovery came after the realization that bacteria possess proteins that are homologous to tubulin and actin ; the main components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton eukaryotic cells contain three main kinds of cytoskeletal filaments : microfilaments , microtubules , and intermediate filaments in neurons the intermediate filaments are known as neurofilaments intermediate filaments are composed of various proteins , depending on the type of cell in which they are found ; they are normally 8-12 & nbsp ; nm in diameter the cytoskeleton provides the cell with structure and shape , and by excluding macromolecules from some of the cytosol , it adds to the level of macromolecular crowding in this compartment research into neurodegeneration such as parkinson 's disease , alzheimer 's disease , huntington 's disease , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) indicate that the cytoskeleton is affected in these diseases in alzheimer 's disease , tau proteins which stabilize microtubules malfunction in the progression of the illness causing pathology of the cytoskeleton accessory proteins including motor proteins regulate and link the filaments to other cell compounds and each other and are essential for controlled assembly of cytoskeletal filaments in particular locations microfilaments , also known as actin filaments , are composed of linear polymers of g-actin proteins , and generate force when the growing ( plus ) end of the filament pushes against a barrier , such as the cell membrane myosin motoring along f-actin filaments generates contractile forces in so-called actomyosin fibers , both in muscle as well as most non-muscle cell types actin structures are controlled by the rho family of small gtp-binding proteins such as rho itself for contractile acto-myosin filaments ( '' stress fibers '' ) , rac for lamellipodia and cdc42 for filopodia functions include : muscle contraction cell movement intracellular transport/trafficking maintenance of eukaryote cell shape cytokinesis cytoplasmic streaming intermediate filaments are a part of the cytoskeleton of many eukaryote cells these filaments , averaging 10 nanometers in diameter , are more stable ( strongly bound ) than microfilaments , and heterogeneous constituents of the cytoskeleton intermediate filaments organize the internal tridimensional structure of the cell , anchoring organelles and serving as structural components of the nuclear lamina keratin intermediate filaments in epithelial cells provide protection for different mechanical stresses the skin may endure in combination with proteins and desmosomes , the intermediate filaments form cell-cell connections and anchor the cell-matrix junctions that are used in messaging between cells as well as vital functions of the cell mutations in the if proteins have been shown to cause serious medical issues such as premature aging , desmin mutations compromising organs , alexander disease , and muscular dystrophy during cell division , ftsz is the first protein to move to the division site , and is essential for recruiting other proteins that synthesize the new cell wall between the dividing cells prokaryotic actin-like proteins , such as mreb , are involved in the maintenance of cell shape cytoskeletal proteins are usually correlated with cell shape , dna segregation and cell division in prokaryotes and eukaryotes cytoplasmic streaming , also known as cyclosis , is the active movement of a cell ’ s contents along the components of the cytoskeleton this is because the cell ’ s extra volume requires cytoplasmic streaming in order to move organelles throughout the entire cell

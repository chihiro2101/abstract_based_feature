in 1903 , nikolai koltsov proposed that the shape of cells was determined by a network of tubules that he termed the cytoskeleton initially , it was thought that the cytoskeleton was exclusive to eukaryotes but in 1992 it was discovered to be present in prokaryotes as well this discovery came after the realization that bacteria possess proteins that are homologous to tubulin and actin ; the main components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton eukaryotic cells contain three main kinds of cytoskeletal filaments : microfilaments , microtubules , and intermediate filaments microfilaments are polymers of the protein actin and are 7 & nbsp ; nm in diameter intermediate filaments are composed of various proteins , depending on the type of cell in which they are found ; they are normally 8-12 & nbsp ; nm in diameter research has shown that microtubule assembly and stability in the cytoskeleton is compromised causing the neurons to degrade over time in alzheimer 's disease , tau proteins which stabilize microtubules malfunction in the progression of the illness causing pathology of the cytoskeleton accessory proteins including motor proteins regulate and link the filaments to other cell compounds and each other and are essential for controlled assembly of cytoskeletal filaments in particular locations myosin motoring along f-actin filaments generates contractile forces in so-called actomyosin fibers , both in muscle as well as most non-muscle cell types actin structures are controlled by the rho family of small gtp-binding proteins such as rho itself for contractile acto-myosin filaments ( '' stress fibers '' ) , rac for lamellipodia and cdc42 for filopodia functions include : muscle contraction cell movement intracellular transport/trafficking maintenance of eukaryote cell shape cytokinesis cytoplasmic streaming intermediate filaments are a part of the cytoskeleton of many eukaryote cells in those animals that express cytoplasmic intermediate filaments , these are tissue specific keratin intermediate filaments in epithelial cells provide protection for different mechanical stresses the skin may endure intermediate filaments are most commonly known as the support system or “ scaffolding ” for the cell and nucleus while also playing a role in some cell functions these connections allow the cell to communicate through the desmosome of multiple cells to adjust structures of the tissue based on signals from the cells environment as both flagella and cilia are structural components of the cell , and are maintained by microtubules , they can be considered part of the cytoskeleton , 2001 , the cell wall was believed to be the deciding factor for many bacterial cell shapes , including rods and spirals the cytoskeleton was once thought to be a feature only of eukaryote cells , but homologues to all the major proteins of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton have been found in prokaryotes prokaryotic actin-like proteins , such as mreb , are involved in the maintenance of cell shape all non-spherical bacteria have genes encoding actin-like proteins , and these proteins form a helical network beneath the cell membrane that guides the proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis cytoplasmic streaming , also known as cyclosis , is the active movement of a cell ’ s contents along the components of the cytoskeleton this is because the cell ’ s extra volume requires cytoplasmic streaming in order to move organelles throughout the entire cell

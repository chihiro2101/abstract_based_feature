in 1903 , nikolai koltsov proposed that the shape of cells was determined by a network of tubules that he termed the cytoskeleton when the cytoskeleton was first introduced , it was thought to be an uninteresting gel-like substance that helped organelles stay in place this discovery came after the realization that bacteria possess proteins that are homologous to tubulin and actin ; the main components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton eukaryotic cells contain three main kinds of cytoskeletal filaments : microfilaments , microtubules , and intermediate filaments each type is formed by the polymerization of a distinct type of protein subunit and has its own characteristic shape and intracellular distribution microtubules are composed of tubulin and are 25 & nbsp ; nm in diameter intermediate filaments are composed of various proteins , depending on the type of cell in which they are found ; they are normally 8-12 & nbsp ; nm in diameter the cytoskeleton provides the cell with structure and shape , and by excluding macromolecules from some of the cytosol , it adds to the level of macromolecular crowding in this compartment accessory proteins including motor proteins regulate and link the filaments to other cell compounds and each other and are essential for controlled assembly of cytoskeletal filaments in particular locations microfilaments , also known as actin filaments , are composed of linear polymers of g-actin proteins , and generate force when the growing ( plus ) end of the filament pushes against a barrier , such as the cell membrane they also act as tracks for the movement of myosin molecules that affix to the microfilament and '' walk '' along them the g-actin monomer combines to form a polymer which continues to form the microfilament ( actin filament ) myosin motoring along f-actin filaments generates contractile forces in so-called actomyosin fibers , both in muscle as well as most non-muscle cell types functions include : muscle contraction cell movement intracellular transport/trafficking maintenance of eukaryote cell shape cytokinesis cytoplasmic streaming intermediate filaments are a part of the cytoskeleton of many eukaryote cells like actin filaments , they function in the maintenance of cell-shape by bearing tension ( microtubules , by contrast , resist compression but can also bear tension during mitosis and during the positioning of the centrosome ) in combination with proteins and desmosomes , the intermediate filaments form cell-cell connections and anchor the cell-matrix junctions that are used in messaging between cells as well as vital functions of the cell these connections allow the cell to communicate through the desmosome of multiple cells to adjust structures of the tissue based on signals from the cells environment made of desmin , play an important role in structural and mechanical support of muscle cells they have a very dynamic behavior , binding gtp for polymerization actin cables are bundles of actin filaments and are involved in the transport of vesicles towards the cap ( which contains a number of different proteins to polarize cell growth ) and in the positioning of mitochondria during cell division , ftsz is the first protein to move to the division site , and is essential for recruiting other proteins that synthesize the new cell wall between the dividing cells cytoskeletal proteins are usually correlated with cell shape , dna segregation and cell division in prokaryotes and eukaryotes cytoplasmic streaming , also known as cyclosis , is the active movement of a cell â€™ s contents along the components of the cytoskeleton

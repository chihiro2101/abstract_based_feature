in 1903 , nikolai koltsov proposed that the shape of cells was determined by a network of tubules that he termed the cytoskeleton initially , it was thought that the cytoskeleton was exclusive to eukaryotes but in 1992 it was discovered to be present in prokaryotes as well this discovery came after the realization that bacteria possess proteins that are homologous to tubulin and actin ; the main components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton eukaryotic cells contain three main kinds of cytoskeletal filaments : microfilaments , microtubules , and intermediate filaments in neurons the intermediate filaments are known as neurofilaments microfilaments are polymers of the protein actin and are 7 & nbsp ; nm in diameter intermediate filaments are composed of various proteins , depending on the type of cell in which they are found ; they are normally 8-12 & nbsp ; nm in diameter the cytoskeleton provides the cell with structure and shape , and by excluding macromolecules from some of the cytosol , it adds to the level of macromolecular crowding in this compartment excess glutamine in the huntington protein involved with linking vesicles onto the cytoskeleton is also proposed to be a factor in the development of huntington 's disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis results in a loss of movement caused by the degradation of motor neurons , and also involves defects of the cytoskeleton accessory proteins including motor proteins regulate and link the filaments to other cell compounds and each other and are essential for controlled assembly of cytoskeletal filaments in particular locations microfilaments , also known as actin filaments , are composed of linear polymers of g-actin proteins , and generate force when the growing ( plus ) end of the filament pushes against a barrier , such as the cell membrane they also act as tracks for the movement of myosin molecules that affix to the microfilament and '' walk '' along them functions include : muscle contraction cell movement intracellular transport/trafficking maintenance of eukaryote cell shape cytokinesis cytoplasmic streaming intermediate filaments are a part of the cytoskeleton of many eukaryote cells like actin filaments , they function in the maintenance of cell-shape by bearing tension ( microtubules , by contrast , resist compression but can also bear tension during mitosis and during the positioning of the centrosome ) intermediate filaments organize the internal tridimensional structure of the cell , anchoring organelles and serving as structural components of the nuclear lamina intermediate filaments are most commonly known as the support system or “ scaffolding ” for the cell and nucleus while also playing a role in some cell functions in combination with proteins and desmosomes , the intermediate filaments form cell-cell connections and anchor the cell-matrix junctions that are used in messaging between cells as well as vital functions of the cell in yeast cells , they build scaffolding to provide structural support during cell division and compartmentalize parts of the cell the cytoskeleton was once thought to be a feature only of eukaryote cells , but homologues to all the major proteins of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton have been found in prokaryotes prokaryotic actin-like proteins , such as mreb , are involved in the maintenance of cell shape all non-spherical bacteria have genes encoding actin-like proteins , and these proteins form a helical network beneath the cell membrane that guides the proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis cytoskeletal proteins are usually correlated with cell shape , dna segregation and cell division in prokaryotes and eukaryotes

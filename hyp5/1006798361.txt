aristotle defines x 's matter as '' that out of which '' x is made physics 195a16 thus , '' matter '' is a relative term : physics 194b9 an object counts as matter relative to something else bronze is the matter , and this matter loses one form ( morphe ) ( that of a lump ) and gains a new form ( that of a statue ) physics 195a6-8 metaphysics 1045a26-29 according to aristotle 's theory of perception , we perceive an object by receiving its form ( eidos ) with our sense organs on the soul 424a19 thus , forms include complex qualia such as colors , textures , and flavors , not just shapes on the soul 418a11–12 substantial form , accidental form , and prime matter a substance necessarily possesses at least one substantial form if substance a is made out of substance b , then substance b is the matter of substance a however , what is the matter of a substance that is not made out of any other substance ? according to aristotelians , such a substance has only '' prime matter '' as its matter prime matter is matter with no substantial form of its own he defines a soul as that which makes a living thing alive on the soul 412a20 , 414a15-18 furthermore , aristotle says that a soul is related to its body as form to matter on the soul 412b5-7 , 413a1-3 , 414a15-18 hence , aristotle argues , there is no problem in explaining the unity of body and soul , just as there is no problem in explaining the unity of wax and its shape on the basis of his hylomorphic theory , aristotle rejects the pythagorean doctrine of metempsychosis , ridiculing the notion that just any soul could inhabit just any body on the soul 407b20-24 , 414a22-24 according to timothy robinson , it is unclear whether aristotle identifies the soul with the body 's structure robinson 45-47 according to one interpretation of aristotle , a properly organized body is already alive simply by virtue of its structure robinson 46 however , according to another interpretation , the property of life—that is , the soul—is something in addition to the body 's structure robinson 46 likewise , according to this second interpretation , a living body is alive not only because of its structure but also because of an additional property : the soul , which a properly organized body needs in order to be alive some scholars have pointed out a problem facing aristotle 's theory of soul-body hylomorphism shields , aristotle 290-93 according to aristotle , a living thing 's matter is its body , which needs a soul in order to be alive 412b15 but if a living thing 's matter is its body , then that body should be potentially alive by definition if the five-year-old body and the seventy-year-old body consist of different matter , then what makes them the same body ? the answer is presumably the soul apart from the soul , we can not identify what collection of matter is the body another approach to resolving the problem shields , '' a fundamental problem '' relies on a distinction between '' proximate '' and '' non-proximate '' matter when aristotle says that the body is matter for a living thing , he may be using the word '' body '' to refer to the matter that makes up the fully organized body , rather than the fully organized body itself unlike the fully organized body , this '' body '' remains the same thing even after death robinson 50 he says that the '' active intellect '' is not mixed with the body on the soul 429a24-25 and suggests that it can exist apart from it shields , '' soul as subject '' 142 according to this interpretation , the soul is a property of the body , but the ability to think is a property of the soul itself , not of the body however , they disagreed about whether x 's soul is x 's only substantial form stump , '' non-cartesian substance dualism and materialism without reductionism '' 514 a dead body is merely matter that was once configured by the soul

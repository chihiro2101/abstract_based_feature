jakob ammann is known because of his prominent involvement in a schism among the swiss brethren that began in 1693 because of their prominent roles , jakob ammann and hans reist have been used to characterize the two sides of the schism , but the issues were broader than the two most prominent men involved these fresh converts—zealous for their new faith—were in fact a sort of new movement within swiss anabaptism at this point , jakob ammann became irritated ( verdreiszlich ) and then proceeded to announce that hans reist was excommunicated on six points when ammann questioned some of the other swiss ministers at the meeting where they stood on the issues , they pleaded for time to consult with their congregations amman and the four men with him then left '' without shaking hands with anyone however , while hans reist and some of the swiss ministers appear to have accepted the repentance of ammann and his co-workers , they held firm to their position of not accepting social shunning however , official sharing of ministry and communion is rare among the most conservative groups of old order amish and mennonites

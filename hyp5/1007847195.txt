the powerpc 740 and 750 ( codename arthur ) gwennap 1997 were introduced in late 1997 as an evolutionary replacement for the powerpc 603e the 740/750 models had 6.35 million transistors and were initially manufactured by ibm and motorola in an aluminium based fabrication process the off-die l2 cache of the 750 increased performance by approximately 30 % in most situations the powerpc 740 is completely pin compatible with the older 603 , allowing upgrades to the powerbook 1400 , 2400 , and even a prototype powerbook 500/g3 the powerpc 750 was used in many computers from apple , including the original imac it is intended for use in high radiation environments such as experienced on board satellites and other spacecraft motorola revised the 740/750 design in 1998 and shrunk die size to 51 & nbsp ; mm 2 thanks to a newer aluminium based fabrication at 0.22 μm the 755 was used in some ibook models after this model , motorola chose not to keep developing the 750 processors in favour of their powerpc g4 processor and other cores ibm continued to develop the powerpc 750 line and introduced the powerpc 750cx ( code-named sidewinder ) in 2000 several ibook models and the last g3-based imac used this processor it is based on a powerpc 750cxe and adds about 50 new instructions as well as a modified fpu capable of some simd functionality it was the last g3 type processor used by apple ( employed on the ibook g3 ) 750vx ( codenamed '' mojave '' ) is a rumored , not confirmed and canceled version of the 7xx line ibm powerpc 750cl microprocessor revision level dd2.x ibm powerpc 750cl risc microprocessor user ’ s manual ibm has ceased to publish a roadmap to the 750 family , in favor of marketing themselves as a custom processor vendor

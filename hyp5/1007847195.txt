the powerpc 740 and 750 ( codename arthur ) gwennap 1997 were introduced in late 1997 as an evolutionary replacement for the powerpc 603e the 740 and 750 added branch predictor and a 64-entry branch target instruction cache ( btic ) the 740/750 models had 6.35 million transistors and were initially manufactured by ibm and motorola in an aluminium based fabrication process the die measured 67 & nbsp ; mm 2 at 0.26 & nbsp ; μm and it reached speeds of up to 366 & nbsp ; mhz while consuming 7.3 & nbsp ; w in 1999 , ibm fabricated versions in a 0.20 & nbsp ; μm process with copper interconnects , which increased the frequency up to 500 & nbsp ; mhz and decreased power consumption to 6 & nbsp ; w and the die size to 40 & nbsp ; mm 2 the powerpc 750 was used in many computers from apple , including the original imac motorola revised the 740/750 design in 1998 and shrunk die size to 51 & nbsp ; mm 2 thanks to a newer aluminium based fabrication at 0.22 μm ibm continued to develop the powerpc 750 line and introduced the powerpc 750cx ( code-named sidewinder ) in 2000 it had a die size of 43 & nbsp ; mm 2 through a 0.18 μm copper process 750cxe ( codename anaconda ) , introduced in 2001 , was a minor revision of 750cx which increased its frequency up to 700 and memory bus from 100 & nbsp ; mhz to 133 & nbsp ; mhz it has 256 kib of on die l2 cache , operates at 485 & nbsp ; mhz with a 162 & nbsp ; mhz memory bus , is fabricated by ibm on a 180 & nbsp ; nm process the 750fx ( code-named sahara ) came in 2002 and increased frequency up to 900 & nbsp ; mhz , the bus speed to 166 & nbsp ; mhz and the on-die l2 cache to 512 kib 750fx has 39 million transistors , a die size of 35 & nbsp ; mm 2 and consumes less than 4 w at 800 & nbsp ; mhz at typical loads it is manufactured using a 0.13 & nbsp ; μm process with copper interconnects , low-k , and silicon on insulator technology the 750cl is manufactured using a 90 & nbsp ; nm copper based fabrication with low-k and silicon on insulator technology and features 20 million transistors on a 16 & nbsp ; mm 2 die it draws up to 2.7 w at 600 & nbsp ; mhz , 9.8 w at 1 & nbsp ; ghz

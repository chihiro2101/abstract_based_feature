the powerpc 740 and 750 ( codename arthur ) gwennap 1997 were introduced in late 1997 as an evolutionary replacement for the powerpc 603e the 740/750 models had 6.35 million transistors and were initially manufactured by ibm and motorola in an aluminium based fabrication process the die measured 67 & nbsp ; mm 2 at 0.26 & nbsp ; μm and it reached speeds of up to 366 & nbsp ; mhz while consuming 7.3 & nbsp ; w in 1999 , ibm fabricated versions in a 0.20 & nbsp ; μm process with copper interconnects , which increased the frequency up to 500 & nbsp ; mhz and decreased power consumption to 6 & nbsp ; w and the die size to 40 & nbsp ; mm 2 the design was so successful that it quickly surpassed the powerpc 604e in integer performance , causing a planned 604 successor to be scrapped the powerpc 750 was used in many computers from apple , including the original imac the processor has 10.4 million transistors , is manufactured by bae systems using either 250 or 150 & nbsp ; nm process and has a die area of 130 & nbsp ; mm² motorola revised the 740/750 design in 1998 and shrunk die size to 51 & nbsp ; mm 2 thanks to a newer aluminium based fabrication at 0.22 μm after this model , motorola chose not to keep developing the 750 processors in favour of their powerpc g4 processor and other cores at 400 & nbsp ; mhz , it drew under 4 w it has 256 kib of on die l2 cache , operates at 485 & nbsp ; mhz with a 162 & nbsp ; mhz memory bus , is fabricated by ibm on a 180 & nbsp ; nm process 750fx has 39 million transistors , a die size of 35 & nbsp ; mm 2 and consumes less than 4 w at 800 & nbsp ; mhz at typical loads it would be the most powerful and featured version to date with up to 4mb of off die l3 cache , a 400mhz ddr front side bus and the same implementation of altivec used in the powerpc 970 it was expected to clock as high as 1.8 & nbsp ; ghz ( starting at 1.5 & nbsp ; ghz ) and reported to have additional pipeline stages , and advanced power management features it draws up to 2.7 w at 600 & nbsp ; mhz , 9.8 w at 1 & nbsp ; ghz the largely unconfirmed characteristics are a triple core cpu which runs at 1.24 & nbsp ; ghz and is manufactured on a 45 & nbsp ; nm process

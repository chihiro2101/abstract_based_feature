the powerpc 740 and 750 ( codename arthur ) gwennap 1997 were introduced in late 1997 as an evolutionary replacement for the powerpc 603e the 740/750 models had 6.35 million transistors and were initially manufactured by ibm and motorola in an aluminium based fabrication process the die measured 67 & nbsp ; mm 2 at 0.26 & nbsp ; μm and it reached speeds of up to 366 & nbsp ; mhz while consuming 7.3 & nbsp ; w in 1999 , ibm fabricated versions in a 0.20 & nbsp ; μm process with copper interconnects , which increased the frequency up to 500 & nbsp ; mhz and decreased power consumption to 6 & nbsp ; w and the die size to 40 & nbsp ; mm 2 the powerpc 740 is completely pin compatible with the older 603 , allowing upgrades to the powerbook 1400 , 2400 , and even a prototype powerbook 500/g3 the powerpc 750 was used in many computers from apple , including the original imac the processor has 10.4 million transistors , is manufactured by bae systems using either 250 or 150 & nbsp ; nm process and has a die area of 130 & nbsp ; mm² motorola revised the 740/750 design in 1998 and shrunk die size to 51 & nbsp ; mm 2 thanks to a newer aluminium based fabrication at 0.22 μm it has a 256 kib on-die l2 cache ; this increased performance while reducing power consumption and complexity a cost reduced version of 750cxe , called 750cxr , is available at lower frequencies the 750fx ( code-named sahara ) came in 2002 and increased frequency up to 900 & nbsp ; mhz , the bus speed to 166 & nbsp ; mhz and the on-die l2 cache to 512 kib it is manufactured using a 0.13 μm copper based fabrication with low-k and silicon on insulator technology 750gx ( codenamed gobi ) , revealed in 2004 , was a 7xx processor from ibm it draws up to 2.7 w at 600 & nbsp ; mhz , 9.8 w at 1 & nbsp ; ghz ibm powerpc 750cl microprocessor revision level dd2.x ibm powerpc 750cl risc microprocessor user ’ s manual the largely unconfirmed characteristics are a triple core cpu which runs at 1.24 & nbsp ; ghz and is manufactured on a 45 & nbsp ; nm process

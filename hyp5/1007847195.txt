the powerpc 740 and 750 ( codename arthur ) gwennap 1997 were introduced in late 1997 as an evolutionary replacement for the powerpc 603e enhancements included a faster 60x system bus ( 66 & nbsp ; mhz ) , larger l1 caches ( 32 kb instruction and 32 kb data ) , a second integer unit , an enhanced floating point unit , and higher core frequency the 740/750 models had 6.35 million transistors and were initially manufactured by ibm and motorola in an aluminium based fabrication process the die measured 67 & nbsp ; mm 2 at 0.26 & nbsp ; μm and it reached speeds of up to 366 & nbsp ; mhz while consuming 7.3 & nbsp ; w in 1999 , ibm fabricated versions in a 0.20 & nbsp ; μm process with copper interconnects , which increased the frequency up to 500 & nbsp ; mhz and decreased power consumption to 6 & nbsp ; w and the die size to 40 & nbsp ; mm 2 the powerpc 750 was used in many computers from apple , including the original imac the rad750 is a radiation-hardened processor , based on the powerpc 750 the processor has 10.4 million transistors , is manufactured by bae systems using either 250 or 150 & nbsp ; nm process and has a die area of 130 & nbsp ; mm² after this model , motorola chose not to keep developing the 750 processors in favour of their powerpc g4 processor and other cores 750cxe ( codename anaconda ) , introduced in 2001 , was a minor revision of 750cx which increased its frequency up to 700 and memory bus from 100 & nbsp ; mhz to 133 & nbsp ; mhz it has 256 kib of on die l2 cache , operates at 485 & nbsp ; mhz with a 162 & nbsp ; mhz memory bus , is fabricated by ibm on a 180 & nbsp ; nm process it has an on-die 1 & nbsp ; mb l2 cache , a top frequency of 1.1 & nbsp ; ghz , and support for bus speeds up to 200 & nbsp ; mhz among other enhancements compared to 750fx the 750cl is manufactured using a 90 & nbsp ; nm copper based fabrication with low-k and silicon on insulator technology and features 20 million transistors on a 16 & nbsp ; mm 2 die this is smaller than half the size of the '' gekko '' microprocessor ( 43 & nbsp ; mm 2 ) incorporated in the gamecube at its first release the largely unconfirmed characteristics are a triple core cpu which runs at 1.24 & nbsp ; ghz and is manufactured on a 45 & nbsp ; nm process in 2015 rochester electronics started providing legacy support for the devices

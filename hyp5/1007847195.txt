enhancements included a faster 60x system bus ( 66 & nbsp ; mhz ) , larger l1 caches ( 32 kb instruction and 32 kb data ) , a second integer unit , an enhanced floating point unit , and higher core frequency the cache controller and cache tags are on-die the 740/750 models had 6.35 million transistors and were initially manufactured by ibm and motorola in an aluminium based fabrication process the die measured 67 & nbsp ; mm 2 at 0.26 & nbsp ; μm and it reached speeds of up to 366 & nbsp ; mhz while consuming 7.3 & nbsp ; w in 1999 , ibm fabricated versions in a 0.20 & nbsp ; μm process with copper interconnects , which increased the frequency up to 500 & nbsp ; mhz and decreased power consumption to 6 & nbsp ; w and the die size to 40 & nbsp ; mm 2 the powerpc 740 is completely pin compatible with the older 603 , allowing upgrades to the powerbook 1400 , 2400 , and even a prototype powerbook 500/g3 the processor has 10.4 million transistors , is manufactured by bae systems using either 250 or 150 & nbsp ; nm process and has a die area of 130 & nbsp ; mm² motorola revised the 740/750 design in 1998 and shrunk die size to 51 & nbsp ; mm 2 thanks to a newer aluminium based fabrication at 0.22 μm it is based on a powerpc 750cxe and adds about 50 new instructions as well as a modified fpu capable of some simd functionality the 750fx ( code-named sahara ) came in 2002 and increased frequency up to 900 & nbsp ; mhz , the bus speed to 166 & nbsp ; mhz and the on-die l2 cache to 512 kib it also featured a number of improvements to the memory subsystem : an enhanced and faster ( 200 & nbsp ; mhz ) 60x bus controller , a wider l2 cache bus , and the ability to lock parts of the l2 cache 750fx has 39 million transistors , a die size of 35 & nbsp ; mm 2 and consumes less than 4 w at 800 & nbsp ; mhz at typical loads the 750gx has 44 million transistors , a die size of 52 & nbsp ; mm 2 and consumes less than 9 & nbsp ; w at 1 & nbsp ; ghz at typical loads it would be the most powerful and featured version to date with up to 4mb of off die l3 cache , a 400mhz ddr front side bus and the same implementation of altivec used in the powerpc 970 the 750cl is an evolved 750cxe , with speeds ranging from 400 & nbsp ; mhz to 1 & nbsp ; ghz with a system bus up to 240 & nbsp ; mhz , l2 cache prefetch features and graphics related instructions have been added to improve performance it draws up to 2.7 w at 600 & nbsp ; mhz , 9.8 w at 1 & nbsp ; ghz

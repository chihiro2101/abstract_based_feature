the etymology of the name geat ( old english , from a proto-germanic gautaz , plural gautōz ) is similar , although not identical , to that of goths and gutar ( gutô , plural gutaniz ) ) the names could also allude to watercourses in the land where they were living , an interpretation of both names of götaland and gotland according to the etymology sentences in their respective articles in nationalencyklopedin see also nationalencyklopedin , the article '' göta älv '' ( in swedish ) thus , gēatas is the old english form of old norse gautar and modern swedish götar the geats and the jutes are mentioned in beowulf as different tribes , and whereas the geats are called gēatas , the jutes are called ēotena ( genitive ) or ēotenum ( dative ) however , fahlbeck proposed in 1884 that the gēatas of beowulf referred to jutes and he proposed that the jutes originally also were geats like those of southern sweden fahlbeck 's theory was refuted by schück who in 1907 noted that another old english source , the anglo-saxon chronicle , called the jutes īutna , īotum or īutum björkman proposed in 1908 that alfred the great 's translation of jutes as geats was based on a confusion between the west saxon form geotas ( '' jutes '' ) and gēatas ( '' geats '' ) the geats of västergötland were historically an inland people , making an epithet such as weather- or sea- a little strange

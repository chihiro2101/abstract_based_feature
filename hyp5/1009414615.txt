the etymology of the name geat ( old english , from a proto-germanic gautaz , plural gautōz ) is similar , although not identical , to that of goths and gutar ( gutô , plural gutaniz ) they are generally accepted as having originated as heiti for '' men ( of the tribe ) '' , with the literal meaning '' they who pour their seed '' nationalencyklopedin , the article ( in swedish ) about klarälven , which says that klarälven was called gautelfr in records from the 13th century in the 17th century the name göta älv , 'river of the geats ' , replaced the earlier names götälven and gautelfr thus , gēatas is the old english form of old norse gautar and modern swedish götar it is also based on the fact that in beowulf , the gēatas live east of the dani ( across the sea ) and in close contact with the sweon , which fits the historical position of the geats between the danes/daci and the swedes moreover , the old english poem widsith also mentions both geats and jutes , and it calls the latter ȳtum however , fahlbeck proposed in 1884 that the gēatas of beowulf referred to jutes and he proposed that the jutes originally also were geats like those of southern sweden since the 19th century , there has also been a suggestion that beowulf 's people were gutes ( from the island of gotland in sweden )

of both austrian armies on 24 june 1796 , the army of rhin-et-moselle mounted a successful assault crossing of the rhine river in the battle of kehl the swabian circle defenders numbered 7,000 soldiers in eight foot battalions , eight horse squadrons and two artillery batteries in addition , the french captured 850 soldiers , seven guns and two munition wagons ferino still commanded the right wing , but desaix now commanded the left wing while saint-cyr led the center on 30 june , latour 's army of the upper rhine was divided into a left wing under michael von fröhlich , a center led by karl aloys zu fürstenberg and a right wing that latour personally controlled fröhlich 's wing was made up of eight battalions and 12 squadrons of austrians organized in two brigades fürstenberg 's command consisted of 17 battalions , five companies and 10 squadrons , including swabians and bavarians , organized into five brigades with desaix on the left and saint-cyr on the right , moreau pressed north up the east bank of the rhine to the murg river the french thrust severed austrians under fröhlich and french royalists under louis joseph , prince of condé from the remainder of latour 's army by this time , archduke charles arrived from the north with 20,000 reinforcements despite having won the battle on his right flank , charles feared saint-cyr 's advance might cut him off from his supply base at heilbronn so the archduke ordered a retreat to the east the french commander planned to attack pforzheim on 15 july , but by that date charles was retreating farther to the east when charles left the banks of the rhine he left behind 30,000 troops in garrisons at mannheim , philippsburg , mainz , königstein im taunus and ehrenbreitstein fortress on 2 august , moreau 's troops bumped into the austrians at geislingen an der steige and for a week afterward there was constant skirmishing with charles ' rear guard on 13 july in desaix 's left wing , the division of delmas consisted of the 50th and 97th line and 16th light infantry demi-brigades and four squadrons each of the 7th hussar and 10th and 17th dragoon regiments the division of beaupuy was made up of the 10th , 62nd and 103rd line and the 10th light demi-brigades , 4th and 8th chasseurs à cheval and the 6th dragoons a report from 7 august 1796 showed that saint-cyr shuffled the brigades in the center so that duhesme 's division had only one while taponier had the other three in duhesme 's division , dominique vandamme 's brigade was made up of the 17th and 100th line infantry demi-brigades , two squadrons of the 20th chasseurs à cheval and a detachment of the 11th hussars , a total of 5,272 infantry and 292 cavalry laroche directed 5,124 soldiers of the 21st light and 31st line infantry , lecourbe commanded 5,878 men of the 84th and 106th line and lambert controlled 5,888 troops of the 93rd and 109th line archduke charles wished to prevent the army of moreau from joining with his colleague jean-baptiste jourdan and the army of sambre-et-meuse the austrian commander hoped to withdraw to the south bank of the danube but the army of rhin-et-moselle was following too closely by attacking moreau , the archduke hoped to push the french back in order to prevent their two armies from merging and to give his own troops enough room to cross the danube safely before riding off to consult with desaix , the french army commander placed bourcier 's division in support nearby and agreed to have the left wing attack the austrian right flank moreau then returned from his meeting with desaix to inform saint-cyr that the left wing 's attack would be delayed until delmas ' division could be recalled from the extreme left though saint-cyr was in a tight spot , in fact , charles became anxious about moreau 's commitment of the french reserve when charles withdrew to the south bank of the danube , he left moreau free to stay on the north bank and join with jourdan 325-326 napoleon later wrote of moreau , '' one would have said that he was ignorant that a french army existed on his left ''

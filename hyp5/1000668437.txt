80,000 homes are at risk average payouts per claim were 3,733 across all types of claims , with total claims amounting to 660 million over the five years examined in urban areas with natural subsurface ( karst ) drainage there are no surface streams for the increased stormwater from impervious surfaces such as roofs , parking lots , and streets to runoff into iwm offers several techniques , including stormwater harvest ( to reduce the amount of water that can cause flooding ) , infiltration ( to restore the natural recharge of groundwater ) , biofiltration or bioretention ( e.g to address the nationwide problem of stormwater pollution , congress broadened the cwa definition of '' point source '' in 1987 to include industrial stormwater discharges and municipal separate storm sewer systems ( '' ms4 '' ) it is not uncommon for state agencies to revise their requirements and impose them upon counties and cities ; daily fines ranging as high as 25,000 can be imposed for failure to modify their local stormwater permitting for construction sites , for instance related programs are conducted by the natural resources conservation service ( nrcs ) in the u.s ( during a rain storm , it may take only 15 minutes for contaminated runoff in grand rapids , michigan to reach the grand river a specific example of an early stormwater runoff system design is found in the archaeological recovery at minoan phaistos on crete

additionally , conveyances such as ditches and storm sewers quickly transport runoff away from commercial and residential areas into nearby water bodies this greatly increases the volume of water in waterways and the discharge of those waterways , leading to erosion and flooding because the water is flushed out of the watershed during the storm event , little infiltrates the soil , replenishes groundwater , or supplies stream baseflow in dry weather during this phase , polluted water entering storm drains in areas with high proportions of impervious surfaces is typically more concentrated compared to the remainder of the storm consequently , these high concentrations of urban runoff result in high levels of pollutants discharged from storm sewers to surface waters alex maestre and robert pitt ; center for watershed protection ( 2005 ) '' the national stormwater quality database , version 1.1 : a compilation and analysis of npdes stormwater monitoring information such pollutants include trash , sediment , nutrients , bacteria , pesticides , metals , and petroleum byproducts while there is some attenuation of these pollutants before entering receiving waters , polluted runoff results in large enough quantities of pollutants to impair receiving waters '' results of the nationwide urban runoff program : volume 1 – final report '' , water planning division . stormwater runoff as a source of pollution in addition to the pollutants carried in surface runoff , urban runoff is being recognized as a cause of pollution in its own right in natural catchments ( watersheds ) surface runoff entering waterways is a relatively rare event , occurring only a few times each year and generally after larger storm events modern drainage systems , which collect runoff from impervious surfaces ( e.g , roofs and roads ) , ensure that water is efficiently conveyed to waterways through pipe networks , meaning that even small storm events result in increased waterway flows coast , polluted runoff from roads and highways may be the largest source of water pollution for example , about 75 percent of the toxic chemicals getting to seattle , washington 's puget sound are carried by stormwater that runs off paved roads and driveways , rooftops , yards , and other developed land loss of forest canopy , increases in paved area , and shallow and ( or ) muddy detention areas also may cause thermal pollution problems , which can exacerbate chemical stressors on aquatic organisms in receiving waters stormwater is a major cause of urban flooding urban flooding is the inundation of land or property in a built-up environment caused by stormwater overwhelming the capacity of drainage , such as storm sewers where properties are built with basements , urban flooding is the primary cause of basement and sewer backups the prevalence and cost of urban flooding in the uk , urban flooding is estimated to cost £270 million a year ( as of 2007 ) in england and wales ; 80,000 homes are at risk the nine-month repair of the dishman lane collapse cost a million dollars but there remains the potential for future problems in urban areas with natural subsurface ( karst ) drainage there are no surface streams for the increased stormwater from impervious surfaces such as roofs , parking lots , and streets to runoff into managing the quantity and quality of stormwater is termed , '' stormwater management in the united states , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) is charged with regulation stormwater pursuant to the clean water act ( cwa ) agricultural runoff ( except for concentrated animal feeding operations , or '' cafo '' ) is classified as nonpoint source pollution under the cwa other public education campaigns highlight the importance of green infrastructure in slowing down and treating stormwater runoff since humans began living in concentrated village or urban settings , stormwater runoff has been an issue

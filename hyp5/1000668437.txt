additionally , conveyances such as ditches and storm sewers quickly transport runoff away from commercial and residential areas into nearby water bodies this greatly increases the volume of water in waterways and the discharge of those waterways , leading to erosion and flooding because the water is flushed out of the watershed during the storm event , little infiltrates the soil , replenishes groundwater , or supplies stream baseflow in dry weather during this phase , polluted water entering storm drains in areas with high proportions of impervious surfaces is typically more concentrated compared to the remainder of the storm consequently , these high concentrations of urban runoff result in high levels of pollutants discharged from storm sewers to surface waters alex maestre and robert pitt ; center for watershed protection ( 2005 ) '' the national stormwater quality database , version 1.1 : a compilation and analysis of npdes stormwater monitoring information daily human activities result in deposition of pollutants on roads , lawns , roofs , farm fields , and other land surfaces when it rain or there is irrigation , water runs off and ultimately makes its way to a river , lake , or the ocean '' results of the nationwide urban runoff program : volume 1 â€“ final report '' , water planning division . stormwater runoff as a source of pollution in addition to the pollutants carried in surface runoff , urban runoff is being recognized as a cause of pollution in its own right in natural catchments ( watersheds ) surface runoff entering waterways is a relatively rare event , occurring only a few times each year and generally after larger storm events in addition to delivering higher pollutants from the urban catchment , increased stormwater flow can lead to stream erosion , encourage weed invasion , and alter natural flow regimes coast , polluted runoff from roads and highways may be the largest source of water pollution for example , about 75 percent of the toxic chemicals getting to seattle , washington 's puget sound are carried by stormwater that runs off paved roads and driveways , rooftops , yards , and other developed land highway-runoff contaminants of particular interest throughout the united states include deicers , nutrients , metals , industrial/urban-organic chemicals , sediment , and agricultural chemicals from industrial , commercial , residential , agricultural , and highway sources stormwater is a major cause of urban flooding urban flooding is the inundation of land or property in a built-up environment caused by stormwater overwhelming the capacity of drainage , such as storm sewers in areas susceptible to urban flooding , backwater valves and other infrastructure may be installed to mitigate losses , industry experts estimate that wet basements can lower property values by 10 to 25 percent and are cited among the top reasons for not purchasing a home the undisturbed karst drainage system becomes balanced with the climate so it can drain the water produced by most storms in urban areas with natural subsurface ( karst ) drainage there are no surface streams for the increased stormwater from impervious surfaces such as roofs , parking lots , and streets to runoff into when the subsurface water flow becomes great enough to transport soil and rock fragments , the karst openings grow rapidly iwm offers several techniques , including stormwater harvest ( to reduce the amount of water that can cause flooding ) , infiltration ( to restore the natural recharge of groundwater ) , biofiltration or bioretention ( e.g , rain gardens ) , to store and treat runoff and release it at a controlled rate to reduce impact on streams and wetland treatments ( to store and control runoff rates and provide habitat in urban areas ) the most popular is to incorporate land-based solutions to reduce stormwater runoff through the use of retention ponds , bioswales , infiltration trenches , sustainable pavements ( such as permeable paving ) , and others noted above to address the nationwide problem of stormwater pollution , congress broadened the cwa definition of '' point source '' in 1987 to include industrial stormwater discharges and municipal separate storm sewer systems ( '' ms4 '' ) '' outreach campaign on social media sites to educate the public on green infrastructure and other best management practices for stormwater runoff epa stormwater permit program stormwater model usgs stochastic empirical loading and dilution model ( seldm ) stormwater model usepa storm water management model ( swmm ) international stormwater best management practices ( bmp ) database stormwater youtube page

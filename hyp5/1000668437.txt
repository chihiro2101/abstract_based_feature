additionally , conveyances such as ditches and storm sewers quickly transport runoff away from commercial and residential areas into nearby water bodies this greatly increases the volume of water in waterways and the discharge of those waterways , leading to erosion and flooding because the water is flushed out of the watershed during the storm event , little infiltrates the soil , replenishes groundwater , or supplies stream baseflow in dry weather a first flush is the initial runoff of a rainstorm during this phase , polluted water entering storm drains in areas with high proportions of impervious surfaces is typically more concentrated compared to the remainder of the storm consequently , these high concentrations of urban runoff result in high levels of pollutants discharged from storm sewers to surface waters '' the national stormwater quality database , version 1.1 : a compilation and analysis of npdes stormwater monitoring information daily human activities result in deposition of pollutants on roads , lawns , roofs , farm fields , and other land surfaces while there is some attenuation of these pollutants before entering receiving waters , polluted runoff results in large enough quantities of pollutants to impair receiving waters '' results of the nationwide urban runoff program : volume 1 â€“ final report '' , water planning division . stormwater runoff as a source of pollution in addition to the pollutants carried in surface runoff , urban runoff is being recognized as a cause of pollution in its own right in natural catchments ( watersheds ) surface runoff entering waterways is a relatively rare event , occurring only a few times each year and generally after larger storm events before development occurred most rainfall soaked into the ground and contributed to groundwater recharge or was recycled into the atmosphere by vegetation through evapotranspiration , roofs and roads ) , ensure that water is efficiently conveyed to waterways through pipe networks , meaning that even small storm events result in increased waterway flows in addition to delivering higher pollutants from the urban catchment , increased stormwater flow can lead to stream erosion , encourage weed invasion , and alter natural flow regimes coast , polluted runoff from roads and highways may be the largest source of water pollution for example , about 75 percent of the toxic chemicals getting to seattle , washington 's puget sound are carried by stormwater that runs off paved roads and driveways , rooftops , yards , and other developed land '' control of toxic chemicals in puget sound , phase 2 : development of simple numerical models '' , 2008 for class v stormwater injection wells '' underground injection control ( uic ) stormwater drainage wells '' the u.s congress prohibits class v stormwater wells to be authorized by permit or by rule where they endanger drinking water sources stormwater is a major cause of urban flooding urban flooding is the inundation of land or property in a built-up environment caused by stormwater overwhelming the capacity of drainage , such as storm sewers although triggered by single events such as flash flooding or snow melt , urban flooding is a condition , characterized by its repetitive , costly and systemic impacts on communities in areas susceptible to urban flooding , backwater valves and other infrastructure may be installed to mitigate losses chicago : center for neighborhood technology , 2013 an example of an urban flooding control project is the brays bayou greenway framework in houston , texas the development of the modern city often results in increased demands for water supply due to population growth , while at the same time altered runoff predicted by climate change has the potential to increase the volume of stormwater that can contribute to drainage and flooding problems iwm offers several techniques , including stormwater harvest ( to reduce the amount of water that can cause flooding ) , infiltration ( to restore the natural recharge of groundwater ) , biofiltration or bioretention ( e.g the most popular is to incorporate land-based solutions to reduce stormwater runoff through the use of retention ponds , bioswales , infiltration trenches , sustainable pavements ( such as permeable paving ) , and others noted above remain classified as '' impaired , '' meaning that they contain pollutants at levels higher than is considered safe by epa for the intended beneficial uses of the water in addition to implementing the npdes requirements , many states and local governments have enacted their own stormwater management laws and ordinances , and some have published stormwater treatment design manuals

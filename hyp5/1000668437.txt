additionally , conveyances such as ditches and storm sewers quickly transport runoff away from commercial and residential areas into nearby water bodies because the water is flushed out of the watershed during the storm event , little infiltrates the soil , replenishes groundwater , or supplies stream baseflow in dry weather during this phase , polluted water entering storm drains in areas with high proportions of impervious surfaces is typically more concentrated compared to the remainder of the storm consequently , these high concentrations of urban runoff result in high levels of pollutants discharged from storm sewers to surface waters alex maestre and robert pitt ; center for watershed protection ( 2005 ) '' the national stormwater quality database , version 1.1 : a compilation and analysis of npdes stormwater monitoring information daily human activities result in deposition of pollutants on roads , lawns , roofs , farm fields , and other land surfaces while there is some attenuation of these pollutants before entering receiving waters , polluted runoff results in large enough quantities of pollutants to impair receiving waters . stormwater runoff as a source of pollution in addition to the pollutants carried in surface runoff , urban runoff is being recognized as a cause of pollution in its own right in natural catchments ( watersheds ) surface runoff entering waterways is a relatively rare event , occurring only a few times each year and generally after larger storm events in addition to delivering higher pollutants from the urban catchment , increased stormwater flow can lead to stream erosion , encourage weed invasion , and alter natural flow regimes native species often rely on such flow regimes for spawning , juvenile development , and migration coast , polluted runoff from roads and highways may be the largest source of water pollution geological survey ( usgs ) reports “ many of the contaminants normally associated with runoff from the nation 's highways have the potential for biological effects congress prohibits class v stormwater wells to be authorized by permit or by rule where they endanger drinking water sources in areas susceptible to urban flooding , backwater valves and other infrastructure may be installed to mitigate losses where properties are built with basements , urban flooding is the primary cause of basement and sewer backups indoor air quality ( iaq ) scientific findings resource bank ( iaq-sfrb ) , '' health risks or dampness or mold in houses '' sewer backups are often from the sanitary sewer system , which takes on some storm water as a result of infiltration/inflow , industry experts estimate that wet basements can lower property values by 10 to 25 percent and are cited among the top reasons for not purchasing a home according to the federal emergency management agency almost 40 percent of small businesses never reopen their doors following a flooding disaster in the uk , urban flooding is estimated to cost £270 million a year ( as of 2007 ) in england and wales ; 80,000 homes are at risk '' postnote 289 , july 2007 a study of cook county , illinois , identified 177,000 property damage insurance claims made across 96 percent of the county ’ s zip codes over a five-year period from 2007 to 2011 chicago : center for neighborhood technology , 2013 an example of an urban flooding control project is the brays bayou greenway framework in houston , texas however , problems occur when the landscape is altered by urban development instead , the stormwater enters the subsurface drainage system by moving down through the ground when the subsurface water flow becomes great enough to transport soil and rock fragments , the karst openings grow rapidly managing the quantity and quality of stormwater is termed , '' stormwater management in addition to implementing the npdes requirements , many states and local governments have enacted their own stormwater management laws and ordinances , and some have published stormwater treatment design manuals '' outreach campaign on social media sites to educate the public on green infrastructure and other best management practices for stormwater runoff

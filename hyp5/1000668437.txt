additionally , conveyances such as ditches and storm sewers quickly transport runoff away from commercial and residential areas into nearby water bodies because the water is flushed out of the watershed during the storm event , little infiltrates the soil , replenishes groundwater , or supplies stream baseflow in dry weather '' reprinted in the practice of watershed protection a first flush is the initial runoff of a rainstorm during this phase , polluted water entering storm drains in areas with high proportions of impervious surfaces is typically more concentrated compared to the remainder of the storm consequently , these high concentrations of urban runoff result in high levels of pollutants discharged from storm sewers to surface waters '' the national stormwater quality database , version 1.1 : a compilation and analysis of npdes stormwater monitoring information environmental protection agency ( epa ) , washington , dc when it rain or there is irrigation , water runs off and ultimately makes its way to a river , lake , or the ocean while there is some attenuation of these pollutants before entering receiving waters , polluted runoff results in large enough quantities of pollutants to impair receiving waters environmental protection agency , washington , dc '' results of the nationwide urban runoff program : volume 1 – final report '' , water planning division . stormwater runoff as a source of pollution in addition to the pollutants carried in surface runoff , urban runoff is being recognized as a cause of pollution in its own right modern drainage systems , which collect runoff from impervious surfaces ( e.g , roofs and roads ) , ensure that water is efficiently conveyed to waterways through pipe networks , meaning that even small storm events result in increased waterway flows in addition to delivering higher pollutants from the urban catchment , increased stormwater flow can lead to stream erosion , encourage weed invasion , and alter natural flow regimes coast , polluted runoff from roads and highways may be the largest source of water pollution congress prohibits class v stormwater wells to be authorized by permit or by rule where they endanger drinking water sources stormwater is a major cause of urban flooding urban flooding is the inundation of land or property in a built-up environment caused by stormwater overwhelming the capacity of drainage , such as storm sewers in areas susceptible to urban flooding , backwater valves and other infrastructure may be installed to mitigate losses , industry experts estimate that wet basements can lower property values by 10 to 25 percent and are cited among the top reasons for not purchasing a home in the uk , urban flooding is estimated to cost £270 million a year ( as of 2007 ) in england and wales ; 80,000 homes are at risk this is the equivalent of one in six properties in the county making a claim average payouts per claim were 3,733 across all types of claims , with total claims amounting to 660 million over the five years examined when the subsurface water flow becomes great enough to transport soil and rock fragments , the karst openings grow rapidly in addition to implementing the npdes requirements , many states and local governments have enacted their own stormwater management laws and ordinances , and some have published stormwater treatment design manuals other public education campaigns highlight the importance of green infrastructure in slowing down and treating stormwater runoff '' outreach campaign on social media sites to educate the public on green infrastructure and other best management practices for stormwater runoff

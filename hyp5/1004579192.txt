the file format allows for a comment containing up to 65,535 ( 2 16 −1 ) bytes of data to occur at the end of the file after the central directory this allows arbitrary data to occur in the file both before and after the zip archive data , and for the archive to still be read by a zip application a side-effect of this is that it is possible to author a file that is both a working zip archive and another format , provided that the other format tolerates arbitrary data at its end , beginning , or middle self-extracting archives ( sfx ) , of the form supported by winzip , take advantage of this , in that they are executable files that conform to the pkzip appnote.txt specification , and can be read by compliant zip tools or libraries such an empty zip file contains only an end of central directory record ( eocd ) : 0x50,0x4b,0x05,0x06,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00 the maximum size for both the archive file and the individual files inside it is 4,294,967,295 bytes ( 2 32 −1 bytes , or 4 gib minus 1 byte ) for standard zip winzip technical consultant kevin kearney and stuffit product manager mathew covington accused pkware of withholding ses , but pkzip chief technology officer jim peterson claimed that certificate-based encryption was still incomplete in another controversial move , pkware applied for a patent on describing a method for combining zip and strong encryption to create a secure file the free software project 7-zip also supports aes , but not ses in zip files ( as does its posix port p7zip ) zip libraries for various programming environments ; licenses used include proprietary and free software the info-zip windows tools also support ntfs filesystem permissions , and will make an attempt to translate from ntfs permissions to unix permissions or vice versa when extracting files the theoretical maximum compression factor for a raw deflate stream is about 1032 to one , but by exploiting the zip format in unintended ways , zip archives with compression ratios of billions to one can be constructed

the file format allows for a comment containing up to 65,535 ( 2 16 −1 ) bytes of data to occur at the end of the file after the central directory this allows arbitrary data to occur in the file both before and after the zip archive data , and for the archive to still be read by a zip application a side-effect of this is that it is possible to author a file that is both a working zip archive and another format , provided that the other format tolerates arbitrary data at its end , beginning , or middle self-extracting archives ( sfx ) , of the form supported by winzip , take advantage of this , in that they are executable files that conform to the pkzip appnote.txt specification , and can be read by compliant zip tools or libraries such an empty zip file contains only an end of central directory record ( eocd ) : 0x50,0x4b,0x05,0x06,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00 the maximum size for both the archive file and the individual files inside it is 4,294,967,295 bytes ( 2 32 −1 bytes , or 4 gib minus 1 byte ) for standard zip file format includes an extra field facility within file headers , which can be used to store extra data not defined by existing zip specifications , and which allow compliant archivers that do not recognize the fields to safely skip them in a later version of winzip beta , it was able to support ses-based zip files the free software project 7-zip also supports aes , but not ses in zip files ( as does its posix port p7zip ) in contrast , strong encryption specification stores the compression method in the basic file header segment of local header and central directory , unless central directory encryption is used to mask/encrypt metadata zip format adds support for unix filesystem features , such as user and group ids , file permissions , and support for symbolic links zip compression in explorer since the microsoft plus ! pack was released for windows 98

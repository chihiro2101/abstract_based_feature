visual techniques such as smoke signals , beacon , hydraulic telegraphs , ship flags and semaphore lines were the earliest forms of optical communication 645-651 hydraulic telegraph semaphores date back to the 4th century bce greece distress flares are still used by mariners in emergencies , while lighthouses and navigation lights are used to communicate navigation hazards when a signaler tilts the mirror to reflect sunlight , the distant observer sees flashes of light that can be used to transmit a prearranged signaling code aviator often use visual approach slope indicator ( vasi ) projected light systems to land safely , especially at night military aircraft landing on an aircraft carrier use a similar system to land correctly on a carrier deck as well , airport control towers still use aldis lamps to transmit instructions to aircraft whose radios have failed semaphore lines were a precursor of the electrical telegraph these systems were popular in the late 18th to early 19th century but could not compete with the electrical telegraph , and went completely out of service by 1880 flag semaphore are the system for conveying information at a distance by means of visual signals with hand-held flags , rods , disks , paddles , or occasionally bare or gloved hands semaphores were adopted and widely used ( with hand-held flags replacing the mechanical arms of semaphore line ) in the maritime world in the 19th century signal lamps ( such as aldis lamps ) , are visual signaling devices for optical communication ( typically using morse code ) aviation light signals are used in the case of a nordo , an aircraft not equipped with a radio , or in the case of a hearing-impaired pilot air traffic controllers have long used signal light guns to direct such aircraft the light gun 's lamp has a focused bright beam capable of emitting three different colors : red , white and green these colors may be flashing or steady , and provide different instructions to aircraft in flight or on the ground ( for example , '' cleared to land '' or '' cleared for takeoff '' ) the heliograph was a simple but effective instrument for instantaneous optical communication over long distances during the late 19th and early 20th century optical fiber is the most common type of channel for optical communications more generally , transmission of unguided optical signals is known as optical wireless communications ( owc ) fiber tapping interconnect bottleneck jun-ichi nishizawa an inventor of optical communication

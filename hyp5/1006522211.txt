visual techniques such as smoke signals , beacon , hydraulic telegraphs , ship flags and semaphore lines were the earliest forms of optical communication wire at war - signals communication in the south african war 1899â€“1902 when a signaler tilts the mirror to reflect sunlight , the distant observer sees flashes of light that can be used to transmit a prearranged signaling code navy ships often use signal lamps and morse code in a similar way aviator often use visual approach slope indicator ( vasi ) projected light systems to land safely , especially at night military aircraft landing on an aircraft carrier use a similar system to land correctly on a carrier deck each relay station would also require its complement of skilled operator-observers to convey messages back and forth across the line the first operational optical semaphore line arrived in 1792 , created by the french engineer claude chappe and his brothers , who succeeded in covering france with a network of 556 stations stretching a total distance of semaphores were adopted and widely used ( with hand-held flags replacing the mechanical arms of semaphore line ) in the maritime world in the 19th century the newer flag semaphore system uses two short poles with square flags , which a signaler holds in different positions to convey letters of the alphabet and numbers signal lamps ( such as aldis lamps ) , are visual signaling devices for optical communication ( typically using morse code ) modern signal lamps are a focused lamp which can produce a pulse of light the lamps are usually equipped with some form of optical sight , and are most commonly deployed on naval vessels and also used in airport control towers with coded aviation light signals aviation light signals are used in the case of a nordo , an aircraft not equipped with a radio , or in the case of a hearing-impaired pilot air traffic controllers have long used signal light guns to direct such aircraft infrared light , rather than visible light is used more commonly , because optical fibers transmit infrared wavelengths with less attenuation and dispersion on june 21 , 1880 , bell 's assistant transmitted a wireless voice telephone message of considerable distance , from the roof of the franklin school to the window of bell 's laboratory , some 213 meters ( about 700 & nbsp ; ft ) away examples include medium-range visible light communication and short-distance irda , using infrared leds fiber tapping interconnect bottleneck jun-ichi nishizawa an inventor of optical communication modulating retro-reflector oecc ( optoelectronics and communications conference ) optical interconnect opto-isolator parallel optical interface

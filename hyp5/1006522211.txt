visual techniques such as smoke signals , beacon , hydraulic telegraphs , ship flags and semaphore lines were the earliest forms of optical communication burns , 2004 telegraph vol 10 , encyclopædia britannica , 6th edition , 1824 pp 645-651 hydraulic telegraph semaphores date back to the 4th century bce greece distress flares are still used by mariners in emergencies , while lighthouses and navigation lights are used to communicate navigation hazards wire at war - signals communication in the south african war 1899–1902 when a signaler tilts the mirror to reflect sunlight , the distant observer sees flashes of light that can be used to transmit a prearranged signaling code as well , airport control towers still use aldis lamps to transmit instructions to aircraft whose radios have failed the first operational optical semaphore line arrived in 1792 , created by the french engineer claude chappe and his brothers , who succeeded in covering france with a network of 556 stations stretching a total distance of the flags are colored differently based on whether the signals are sent by sea or by land at sea , the flags are colored red and yellow ( the oscar flags ) , while on land , they are white and blue ( the papa flags ) signal lamps ( such as aldis lamps ) , are visual signaling devices for optical communication ( typically using morse code ) modern signal lamps are a focused lamp which can produce a pulse of light in large versions this pulse is achieved by opening and closing shutters mounted in front of the lamp , either via a manually operated pressure switch or , in later versions , automatically the lamps are usually equipped with some form of optical sight , and are most commonly deployed on naval vessels and also used in airport control towers with coded aviation light signals only 12 simple standardized instructions are directed at aircraft using signal light guns as the system is not utilized with morse code optical fiber is the most common type of channel for optical communications the transmitters in optical fiber links are generally light-emitting diodes ( leds ) or laser diodes infrared light , rather than visible light is used more commonly , because optical fibers transmit infrared wavelengths with less attenuation and dispersion more generally , transmission of unguided optical signals is known as optical wireless communications ( owc ) modulating retro-reflector oecc ( optoelectronics and communications conference ) optical interconnect opto-isolator parallel optical interface

visual techniques such as smoke signals , beacon , hydraulic telegraphs , ship flags and semaphore lines were the earliest forms of optical communication 645-651 hydraulic telegraph semaphores date back to the 4th century bce greece distress flares are still used by mariners in emergencies , while lighthouses and navigation lights are used to communicate navigation hazards when a signaler tilts the mirror to reflect sunlight , the distant observer sees flashes of light that can be used to transmit a prearranged signaling code navy ships often use signal lamps and morse code in a similar way military aircraft landing on an aircraft carrier use a similar system to land correctly on a carrier deck the coloured light system communicates the aircraft 's height relative to a standard landing glideslope as well , airport control towers still use aldis lamps to transmit instructions to aircraft whose radios have failed a semaphore line , also called a 'semaphore line ' , 'optical telegraph ' , 'shutter telegraph chain ' , 'chappe telegraph ' , or 'napoleonic semaphore ' , is a system used for conveying information by means of visual signals , using towers with pivoting arms or shutters , also known as blades or paddles the maximum distance that a pair of semaphore telegraph stations can bridge is limited by geography , weather and the availability of light ; thus , in practical use , most optical telegraphs used lines of relay stations to bridge longer distances the first operational optical semaphore line arrived in 1792 , created by the french engineer claude chappe and his brothers , who succeeded in covering france with a network of 556 stations stretching a total distance of they are still used during underway replenishment and are acceptable for emergency communication in daylight or , using lighted wands instead of flags , at night signal lamps ( such as aldis lamps ) , are visual signaling devices for optical communication ( typically using morse code ) modern signal lamps are a focused lamp which can produce a pulse of light air traffic controllers have long used signal light guns to direct such aircraft the light gun 's lamp has a focused bright beam capable of emitting three different colors : red , white and green only 12 simple standardized instructions are directed at aircraft using signal light guns as the system is not utilized with morse code a heliograph helios , meaning '' sun '' , and graphein , meaning '' write '' ) is a wireless solar telegraph that signals by flashes of sunlight ( generally using morse code ) reflected by a mirror it was invented jointly by alexander graham bell and his assistant charles sumner tainter on february 19 , 1880 , at bell 's 1325 ' l ' street laboratory in washington , d.c more generally , transmission of unguided optical signals is known as optical wireless communications ( owc )

visual techniques such as smoke signals , beacon , hydraulic telegraphs , ship flags and semaphore lines were the earliest forms of optical communication 645-651 hydraulic telegraph semaphores date back to the 4th century bce greece distress flares are still used by mariners in emergencies , while lighthouses and navigation lights are used to communicate navigation hazards wire at war - signals communication in the south african war 1899â€“1902 when a signaler tilts the mirror to reflect sunlight , the distant observer sees flashes of light that can be used to transmit a prearranged signaling code navy ships often use signal lamps and morse code in a similar way aviator often use visual approach slope indicator ( vasi ) projected light systems to land safely , especially at night military aircraft landing on an aircraft carrier use a similar system to land correctly on a carrier deck the maximum distance that a pair of semaphore telegraph stations can bridge is limited by geography , weather and the availability of light ; thus , in practical use , most optical telegraphs used lines of relay stations to bridge longer distances the first operational optical semaphore line arrived in 1792 , created by the french engineer claude chappe and his brothers , who succeeded in covering france with a network of 556 stations stretching a total distance of these systems were popular in the late 18th to early 19th century but could not compete with the electrical telegraph , and went completely out of service by 1880 information is encoded by the position of the flags , objects or arms ; it is read when they are in a fixed position semaphores were adopted and widely used ( with hand-held flags replacing the mechanical arms of semaphore line ) in the maritime world in the 19th century they are still used during underway replenishment and are acceptable for emergency communication in daylight or , using lighted wands instead of flags , at night signal lamps ( such as aldis lamps ) , are visual signaling devices for optical communication ( typically using morse code ) the lamps are usually equipped with some form of optical sight , and are most commonly deployed on naval vessels and also used in airport control towers with coded aviation light signals only 12 simple standardized instructions are directed at aircraft using signal light guns as the system is not utilized with morse code the signal encoding is typically simple intensity modulation , although historically optical phase and frequency modulation have been demonstrated in the lab more generally , transmission of unguided optical signals is known as optical wireless communications ( owc ) examples include medium-range visible light communication and short-distance irda , using infrared leds

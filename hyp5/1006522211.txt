visual techniques such as smoke signals , beacon , hydraulic telegraphs , ship flags and semaphore lines were the earliest forms of optical communication burns , 2004 telegraph vol 10 , encyclopædia britannica , 6th edition , 1824 pp 645-651 hydraulic telegraph semaphores date back to the 4th century bce greece distress flares are still used by mariners in emergencies , while lighthouses and navigation lights are used to communicate navigation hazards wire at war - signals communication in the south african war 1899–1902 navy ships often use signal lamps and morse code in a similar way the coloured light system communicates the aircraft 's height relative to a standard landing glideslope they were far faster than post riders for conveying a message over long distances , but far more expensive and less private than the electrical telegraph lines which would later replace them the maximum distance that a pair of semaphore telegraph stations can bridge is limited by geography , weather and the availability of light ; thus , in practical use , most optical telegraphs used lines of relay stations to bridge longer distances each relay station would also require its complement of skilled operator-observers to convey messages back and forth across the line the first operational optical semaphore line arrived in 1792 , created by the french engineer claude chappe and his brothers , who succeeded in covering france with a network of 556 stations stretching a total distance of signal lamps ( such as aldis lamps ) , are visual signaling devices for optical communication ( typically using morse code ) modern signal lamps are a focused lamp which can produce a pulse of light the light gun 's lamp has a focused bright beam capable of emitting three different colors : red , white and green a heliograph helios , meaning '' sun '' , and graphein , meaning '' write '' ) is a wireless solar telegraph that signals by flashes of sunlight ( generally using morse code ) reflected by a mirror the heliograph was a simple but effective instrument for instantaneous optical communication over long distances during the late 19th and early 20th century infrared light , rather than visible light is used more commonly , because optical fibers transmit infrared wavelengths with less attenuation and dispersion on june 21 , 1880 , bell 's assistant transmitted a wireless voice telephone message of considerable distance , from the roof of the franklin school to the window of bell 's laboratory , some 213 meters ( about 700 & nbsp ; ft ) away the photophone was a precursor to the fiber-optic communication systems which achieved popular worldwide usage starting in the 1980s more generally , transmission of unguided optical signals is known as optical wireless communications ( owc )

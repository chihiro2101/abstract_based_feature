president bill clinton announced his invitation to israeli prime minister ehud barak and yasser arafat on 5 july 2000 , to come to camp david , maryland , in order to continue their negotiations on the middle east peace process there was a hopeful precedent in the 1978 camp david accords where president jimmy carter was able to broker a peace agreement between egypt , represented by president anwar sadat , and israel represented by prime minister menachem begin however , the interim process put in place under oslo had fulfilled neither israeli nor palestinian expectations on 11 july , the camp david 2000 summit convened , although the palestinians considered the summit premature akram hanieh , the camp david papers articles , published in al-ayyam in seven installments between 29 july and 10 august 2000 2 , fall 2003 , '' visions in collision : what happened at camp david and taba ? '' 7 , 15-19 the talks ultimately failed to reach agreement on the final status issues : territory jerusalem and the temple mount refugees and palestinian right of return security arrangements settlements the palestinian negotiators indicated they wanted full palestinian sovereignty over the entire west bank and the gaza strip , although they would consider a one-to-one land swap with israel their historic position was that palestinians had already made a territorial compromise with israel by accepting israel 's right to 78 % of '' historic palestine '' , and accepting their state on the remaining 22 % of such land oren yiftachel , ethnocracy : land and identity politics in israel/palestine , university of pennsylvania press 1006 p.75 they maintained that resolution 242 calls for full israeli withdrawal from these territories , which were captured in the six-day war , as part of a final peace settlement in the 1993 oslo accords the palestinian negotiators accepted the green line borders ( 1949 armistice lines ) for the west bank but the israelis rejected this proposal and disputed the palestinian interpretation of resolution 242 israel wanted to annex the numerous settlement blocks on the palestinian side of the green line , and were concerned that a complete return to the 1967 borders was dangerous to israel 's security in 10â€“25 years , the palestinian state would expand to a maximum of 92 % of the west bank ( 91 percent of the west bank and 1 percent from a land swap ) wright states that all others would be dismantled , with the exception of kiryat arba ( adjacent to the holy city of hebron ) , which would be an israeli enclave inside the palestinian state , and would be linked to israel by a bypass road in return , israel would allow the palestinians to use a highway in the negev to connect the west bank with gaza wright states that in the israeli proposal , the west bank and gaza strip would be linked by an elevated highway and an elevated railroad running through the negev , ensuring safe and free passage for palestinians these would be under the sovereignty of israel , and israel reserved the right to close them to passage in case of emergency israel would retain around 9 % in the west bank in exchange for 1 % of land within the green line robert malley and hussein agha , camp david : the tragedy of errors ( part 4 ) additional grounds of rejection was that the israeli proposal planned to annex areas which would lead to a cantonization of the west bank into three blocs , which the palestinian delegation likened to south african bantustans , a loaded word that was disputed by the israeli and american negotiators a separate and smaller bloc would contain jericho the palestinian authority would receive pockets of east jerusalem which would be surrounded entirely by annexed lands in the west bank the jewish quarter and western wall should be placed under israeli authority , not israeli sovereignty a passage linking northern jerusalem to islamic and christian holy sites would be annexed by the palestinian state the israeli team proposed annexing to israeli jerusalem settlements within the west bank beyond the green line , such as ma'ale adumim , givat ze'ev , and gush etzion israel proposed that the palestinians merge certain outer arab villages and small cities that had been annexed to jerusalem just after 1967 ( such as abu dis , al-eizariya , 'anata , a-ram , and eastern sawahre ) to create the city of al-quds , which would serve as the capital of palestine the historically important arab neighborhoods such as sheikh jarrah , silwan and at-tur would remain under israeli sovereignty , while palestinians would only have civilian autonomy the palestinians would exercise civil and administrative autonomy in the outer arab neighborhoods israeli neighborhoods within east jerusalem would remain under israeli sovereignty foundation for middle east peace ( fmep ) , principles of camp david 's '' american plan '' palestinians objected to the lack of sovereignty and to the right of israel to keep jewish neighborhoods that it built over the green line in east jerusalem , which the palestinians claimed block the contiguity of the arab neighborhoods in east jerusalem since that time , the palestinians have demanded full implementation of the right of return , meaning that each refugee would be granted the option of returning to his or her home , with property restored , and receive compensation israelis asserted that allowing a right of return to israel proper , rather than to the newly created palestinian state , would mean an influx of palestinians that would fundamentally alter the demographics of israel , jeopardizing israel 's jewish character and its existence as a whole at camp david , the palestinians maintained their traditional demand that the right of return be implemented they demanded that israel recognize the right of all refugees who so wished to settle in israel , but to address israel 's demographic concerns , they promised that the right of return would be implemented via a mechanism agreed upon by both sides , which would try to channel a majority of refugees away from the option of returning to israel secretary of state madeleine albright , some of the palestinian negotiators were willing to privately discuss a limit on the number of refugees who would be allowed to return to israel 618 palestinians who chose to return to israel would do so gradually , with israel absorbing 150,000 refugees every year the israeli negotiators denied that israel was responsible for the refugee problem , and were concerned that any right of return would pose a threat to israel 's jewish character in the israeli proposal , a maximum of 100,000 refugees would be allowed to return to israel on the basis of humanitarian considerations or family reunification all other people classified as palestinian refugees would be settled in their present place of inhabitance , the palestinian state , or third-party countries the israeli negotiators proposed that israel be allowed to set up radar stations inside the palestinian state , and be allowed to use its airspace arafat was also accused of scuttling the talks by nabil amr , a former minister in the palestinian authority in 2006 , shlomo ben-ami stated on democracy now ! that '' camp

president bill clinton announced his invitation to israeli prime minister ehud barak and yasser arafat on 5 july 2000 , to come to camp david , maryland , in order to continue their negotiations on the middle east peace process there was a hopeful precedent in the 1978 camp david accords where president jimmy carter was able to broker a peace agreement between egypt , represented by president anwar sadat , and israel represented by prime minister menachem begin however , the interim process put in place under oslo had fulfilled neither israeli nor palestinian expectations on 11 july , the camp david 2000 summit convened , although the palestinians considered the summit premature amnon kapeliouk , a summit clouded by suspicion ; haaretz , 23 november 2001 at its conclusion , a trilateral statement was issued defining the agreed principles to guide future negotiations as no agreement was reached and there is no official written record of the proposals , some ambiguity remains over details of the positions of the parties on specific issues the palestinian negotiators indicated they wanted full palestinian sovereignty over the entire west bank and the gaza strip , although they would consider a one-to-one land swap with israel their historic position was that palestinians had already made a territorial compromise with israel by accepting israel 's right to 78 % of '' historic palestine '' , and accepting their state on the remaining 22 % of such land in the 1993 oslo accords the palestinian negotiators accepted the green line borders ( 1949 armistice lines ) for the west bank but the israelis rejected this proposal and disputed the palestinian interpretation of resolution 242 israel wanted to annex the numerous settlement blocks on the palestinian side of the green line , and were concerned that a complete return to the 1967 borders was dangerous to israel 's security from the palestinian perspective this equated to an offer of a palestinian state on a maximum of 86 % of the west bank according to robert wright , israel would only keep the settlements with large populations the west bank would be split in the middle by an israeli-controlled road from jerusalem to the dead sea , with free passage for palestinians , although israel reserved the right to close the road to passage in case of emergency israel would retain around 9 % in the west bank in exchange for 1 % of land within the green line the land that would be conceded included symbolic and cultural territories such as the al-aqsa mosque , whereas the israeli land conceded was unspecified additional to territorial concessions , palestinian airspace would be controlled by israel under barak 's offer decoding the conflict between israel and the palestinians , charles river editors , chapter 17 settlement blocs , bypassed roads and annexed lands would create barriers between nablus and jenin with ramallah further , the border between west bank and jordan would additionally be under israeli control the palestinian authority would receive pockets of east jerusalem which would be surrounded entirely by annexed lands in the west bank a particularly virulent territorial dispute revolved around the final status of jerusalem www.waronsacredgrounds.org barak instructed his delegates to treat the dispute as '' the central issue that will decide the destiny of the negotiations '' whereas arafat admonished his delegation to '' not budge on this one thing : the haram ( the temple mount ) is more precious to me than everything else the palestinians demanded complete sovereignty over east jerusalem and its holy sites , in particular , the al-aqsa mosque and the dome of the rock , which are located on the temple mount ( haram al-sharif ) , a site holy in both islam and judaism , and the dismantling of all israeli neighborhoods built over the green line the palestinian position , according to mahmoud abbas , at that time arafat 's chief negotiator , was that : '' all of east jerusalem should be returned to palestinian sovereignty israeli negotiators also proposed that the palestinians be granted administration of , but not sovereignty over , the muslim and christian quarters of the old city , with the jewish and armenian quarters remaining in israeli hands palestinians would be granted administrative control over all islamic and christian holy sites , and would be allowed to raise the palestinian flag over them a passage linking northern jerusalem to islamic and christian holy sites would be annexed by the palestinian state the israeli team proposed annexing to israeli jerusalem settlements within the west bank beyond the green line , such as ma'ale adumim , givat ze'ev , and gush etzion the holy places in the old city would enjoy independent religious administration foundation for middle east peace ( fmep ) , principles of camp david 's '' american plan '' due to the first arab-israeli war , a significant number of palestinian arabs fled or were expelled from their homes inside what is now israel since that time , the palestinians have demanded full implementation of the right of return , meaning that each refugee would be granted the option of returning to his or her home , with property restored , and receive compensation israelis asserted that allowing a right of return to israel proper , rather than to the newly created palestinian state , would mean an influx of palestinians that would fundamentally alter the demographics of israel , jeopardizing israel 's jewish character and its existence as a whole at camp david , the palestinians maintained their traditional demand that the right of return be implemented the israeli negotiators denied that israel was responsible for the refugee problem , and were concerned that any right of return would pose a threat to israel 's jewish character '' actual proposal offered at camp david '' israel also demanded that the palestinian state be demilitarized with the exception of its paramilitary security forces , that it would not make alliances without israeli approval or allow the introduction of foreign forces west of the jordan river , and that it dismantle terrorist groups gilead sher ( 2006 ) , pp israel also wanted water resources in the west bank to be shared by both sides and remain under israeli management from 18 to 23 december they held negotiations , followed by clinton 's presentation of his '' parameters '' , in a last attempt to achieve peace in the middle east before his second term ended in january 2001 spokesman on mideast peace prospects ( both sides accept clinton 's parameters with reservations ) ari shavit , continuation of eyes wide shut ( interview with ehud barak ) most of the israeli and american criticism for the failure of the 2000 camp david summit was leveled at arafat '' the failure to come to an agreement was widely attributed to yasser arafat , as he walked away from the table without making a concrete counter-offer and because arafat did little to quell the al-aqsa intifada that began shortly after the summit kenneth levin summarized the failure of the 2000 camp david summit in this manner : '' despite the dimensions of the israeli offer and intense pressure from president clinton , arafat demurred in 2001 robert malley , present at the summit , noted three '' myths '' that had arisen regarding the failure of the negotiations in 2006 , shlomo ben-ami stated on democracy now ! that '' camp david was not the missed opportunity for the palestinians , and if i were a palestinian i would have rejected camp david , as well

pedestrian crossings already existed more than 2000 years ago , as can be seen in the ruins of pompeii blocks raised on the road allowed pedestrians to cross the street without having to step onto the road itself which doubled up as pompeii 's drainage and sewage disposal system the first pedestrian crossing signal was erected in bridge street , westminster , london , in december 1868 it was the idea of john peake knight , a railway engineer , who thought that it would provide a means to safely allow pedestrians to cross this busy thoroughfare the signal consisted of a semaphore arm ( manufactured by saxby and farmer , who were railway signaling makers ) , which was raised and lowered manually by a police constable who would rotate a handle on the side of the pole however , in january 1869 , the gas used to illuminate the lights at the top leaked and caused an explosion , injuring the police operator according to zegeer , '' pedestrians have a right to cross roads safely and , therefore , planners and engineers have a professional responsibility to plan , design , and install safe crossing facilities some countries have specific criteria to provide pedestrian facilities ; for example , they provide warrants , depending on local conditions , usually prioritized as follows : a ) do nothing in most places , the pedestrian does not need specific facilities , as in low car flow streets , the pedestrians can cross ( without priority ) at any location a continuous ( usually raised ) central reservation promotes safe pedestrian crossing in all the area , and reduce vehicle speed and head-on crash used to control vehicle-pedestrian conflicts , not in intersections , and provided with pedestrians buttons if the road is wide , ( two or more traffic lines per traffic direction ) and a central reservation exists or can be provided , traffic signals can be installed in a not aligned pair this design permits to provide staggered green time for pedestrians ( one side can be green while the other is red ) , the pedestrian needs to wait in the central reservation for the second crossing , improving the possibility to coordinate vehicle traffic between intersection , with a reduction of stops , fuel consumption , and reduced car emissions in some countries , is provision is obligatory in all traffic signals in some countries , including the us , '' unmarked crosswalks '' are presumed to occur at intersections even if a crossing is n't marked , except at locations where pedestrian crossing is expressly prohibited the simplest marked crossings may just consist of some markings on the road surface '' in the uk these are often called zebra crossings , referring to the alternate white and black stripes painted on the road surface if the pedestrian has priority over vehicular traffic when using the crossing , then they have an incentive to use the crossing instead of crossing the road at other places '' special markings are often made on the road surface , both to direct pedestrians and to prevent motorists from stopping vehicles in the way of foot traffic some crossings have pedestrian traffic signals that allow pedestrians and road traffic to use the crossing alternately in many cities , some or most signals are equipped with countdown timers to give notice to both drivers and pedestrians the time remaining on the crossing signal in places where there is very high pedestrian traffic , embedded pavement flashing-light systems are used to signal traffic of pedestrian presence , or pedestrian scramble ( also known as barnes dances ) may be used , which stop vehicular traffic in all directions at the same time footbridges or pedestrian tunnels may be used in lieu of crosswalks at very busy intersections as well as at locations where limited-access roads and controlled-access highways must be crossed they can also be beneficial in locations where the sidewalk or pedestrian path naturally ascends or descends to a different level than the intersection itself , and the natural '' desire line '' leads to a footbridge or tunnel , respectively additionally , ramps , stairs , or elevators present additional obstacles , and pedestrians tend to use an at-grade pedestrian crossing instead , sometimes jaywalking to avoid these obstacles pedestrian refuges or small islands in the middle of a street may be added when a street is very wide , as these crossings can be too long for some individuals to cross in one cycle these pedestrian refuges may consist of building new concrete traffic islands in the middle of the road ; extending an existing island or median strip to the crosswalk to provide a refuge ; or simply cutting through the existing island or median strip where the median is already continuous another relatively widespread variation is the curb extension ( also known as a bulb-out ) , which narrows the width of the street and is used in combination with crosswalk markings road marking machine are special equipment professionally used to paint zebra lines on the intersections or other busy road sections the marking shoe of a pedestrian cross striping machine , which determines marking lines ' width , is much wider than on other marking machines the painter first pulls a guiding line straight and fix the two ends on the ground the thermoplastic paint in powder form is then melted into a molten liquid state for painting other crossings worldwide also feature some of roadsworth 's work , including a crosswalk in montreal where the zebra stripes are shaped like bullets , as well as '' conveyor belt '' crosswalk in winston-salem , north carolina seattle had 40 crosswalks with unique designs , including the rainbow flag in capitol hill and the pan-african flag in the central district marked crosswalks are usually placed at traffic intersections or crossroads , but are occasionally used at mid-block locations where pedestrian generators are present such as at transit stops , schools , retail , or housing destinations in the united states , these '' mid-block crossings '' may include additional regulatory signage such as '' ped xing '' ( for '' pedestrian crossing '' ) , flashing yellow beacons , stop or yield signs , or by actuated or automatic signals in the united states , crossing laws vary from state to state and sometimes at the local level see here ( discussing the uniform vehicle code and stating that '' a crosswalk at an intersection is defined as the extension of the sidewalk or the shoulder across the intersection , regardless of whether it is marked or not to gain the right-of-way in some parts of canada , however , the pedestrian holds out his hand in a position much like that used to handshake , and steps off the curb the province of ontario enacted a law in 2016 that mandates that drivers and bicyclists come to a complete stop at pedestrian '' crossovers '' —ladder-style crosswalks that are sometimes designated with overhead signs or lights—as well as crosswalks with crossing guard these particular colors are used in north america ( excluding quebec ) to provide conspicuity against the backdrop of red , yellow , and green traffic lights the upraised hand or '' do n't walk '' signals begin to flash during the pedestrian clearance interval when the transition to '' do n't walk '' is imminent in intersections with '' leading pedestrian intervals , '' the upraised hand or '' do n't walk '' sign will continue flashing as the vehicular lights turn red and the other crossing ( s ) in the intersection display a walking man or '' walk '' sign the vehicular traffic is then stopped in all directions for a short period of time before cross traffic is allowed to proceed the 2009 mutcd states that the flashing walking man or '' walk '' signals do not have meaning the puffin also uses standard uk traffic signal sequence call buttons are installed at traffic lights with a dedicated pedestrian signal , and are used to bring up the pedestrian '' walk '' indication in locations where they function correctly a study in toronto found similar results to the florida study , determining that countdown timers may actually cause more crashes than standard hand/man signals other countries also use unusual '' walk '' and '' do n't walk '' pedestrian indicators bicycle and pedestrian statistics federal highway administration ( us ) the design of pedestrian crossings - department for transport ( united kingdom ) photos of pedestrian signals from various countries investigating improvements to pedestrian crossings fhwa.dot.gov

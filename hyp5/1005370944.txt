pedestrian crossings already existed more than 2000 years ago , as can be seen in the ruins of pompeii the first pedestrian crossing signal was erected in bridge street , westminster , london , in december 1868 it was the idea of john peake knight , a railway engineer , who thought that it would provide a means to safely allow pedestrians to cross this busy thoroughfare the semaphore arms were augmented by gas illuminated lights at the top ( green and red ) to increase visibility of the signal at night however , in january 1869 , the gas used to illuminate the lights at the top leaked and caused an explosion , injuring the police operator no further work was done on signalled pedestrian crossings until fifty years later in most places , the pedestrian does not need specific facilities , as in low car flow streets , the pedestrians can cross ( without priority ) at any location b ) providing central islands in the road a continuous ( usually raised ) central reservation promotes safe pedestrian crossing in all the area , and reduce vehicle speed and head-on crash d ) zebra crossing e ) traffic signals ( pelican in the u.k used to control vehicle-pedestrian conflicts , not in intersections , and provided with pedestrians buttons in this way , the vehicle signal turns red only if a pedestrian is trying to cross if the road is wide , ( two or more traffic lines per traffic direction ) and a central reservation exists or can be provided , traffic signals can be installed in a not aligned pair h ) pedestrian signal in the intersection this facility is added in an intersection with a traffic signal , giving a clear orientation to a pedestrian when it is possible to cross in some countries , including the us , '' unmarked crosswalks '' are presumed to occur at intersections even if a crossing is n't marked , except at locations where pedestrian crossing is expressly prohibited if the pedestrian has priority over vehicular traffic when using the crossing , then they have an incentive to use the crossing instead of crossing the road at other places in some countries , pedestrians may not have priority , but may be committing an offence if they cross the road elsewhere , or '' jaywalk there are many varieties of signal and marking layouts around the world and even within single countries in the united states , there are many inconsistencies , although the variations are usually minor some crossings have pedestrian traffic signals that allow pedestrians and road traffic to use the crossing alternately on some traffic signals , pressing a call button is required to trigger the signal in many cities , some or most signals are equipped with countdown timers to give notice to both drivers and pedestrians the time remaining on the crossing signal however , pedestrian bridges are ineffective in most locations ; due to their expense , they are typically spaced far apart known as a pedestrian scramble , this type of vehicle all-way stop allows pedestrians to cross safely in any direction , including diagonally pedestrian refuges or small islands in the middle of a street may be added when a street is very wide , as these crossings can be too long for some individuals to cross in one cycle another relatively widespread variation is the curb extension ( also known as a bulb-out ) , which narrows the width of the street and is used in combination with crosswalk markings road marking machine are special equipment professionally used to paint zebra lines on the intersections or other busy road sections the marking shoe of a pedestrian cross striping machine , which determines marking lines ' width , is much wider than on other marking machines a smaller marking shoe with wheels may be used to perform the road striping some crosswalks include unique designs , many of which take the form of artwork these works of art may serve many different purposes , such as attracting tourism or catching drivers ' attention other crossings worldwide also feature some of roadsworth 's work , including a crosswalk in montreal where the zebra stripes are shaped like bullets , as well as '' conveyor belt '' crosswalk in winston-salem , north carolina for instance , chengdu had a red-and-white zebra crossing with hearts painted on it , reflecting its location near a junction of two rivers a pedestrian scramble in the chinatown section of oakland , california , is painted with red-and-yellow colors to signify the colors of the flag of china see here ( discussing the uniform vehicle code and stating that '' a crosswalk at an intersection is defined as the extension of the sidewalk or the shoulder across the intersection , regardless of whether it is marked or not to gain the right-of-way in some parts of canada , however , the pedestrian holds out his hand in a position much like that used to handshake , and steps off the curb these particular colors are used in north america ( excluding quebec ) to provide conspicuity against the backdrop of red , yellow , and green traffic lights on pedestrian signals displaying text , '' do n't walk '' is spelled without an apostrophe so that it fits easily on the sign modern pedestrian signals can be incandescent , neon , fiber-optic , or led , with the latter three displays typically utilizing less energy in intersections with '' leading pedestrian intervals , '' the upraised hand or '' do n't walk '' sign will continue flashing as the vehicular lights turn red and the other crossing ( s ) in the intersection display a walking man or '' walk '' sign however , in some states ( such as utah ) , if the driver is in a school zone with the lights flashing , the driver must wait until the entire crosswalk is clear before he may proceed in the united kingdom and certain parts of the commonwealth of nations , animal names are often used to distinguish several types of such crossings a puffin crossing is signalised ; however , unlike a pelican crossing which is a timed crossing , the puffin has sensors to detect people still on the crossing the puffin also uses standard uk traffic signal sequence in those countries , the '' pedestrian crossing sign '' is on a blue or black ground , with a white or yellow triangle where the symbol is displayed in black or dark blue other countries also use unusual '' walk '' and '' do n't walk '' pedestrian indicators research undertaken in new zealand showed that a zebra crossing without other safety features on average increases pedestrian crashes by 28 % compared to a location without crossings bicycle and pedestrian statistics federal highway administration ( us ) the design of pedestrian crossings - department for transport ( united kingdom ) photos of pedestrian signals from various countries investigating improvements to pedestrian crossings fhwa.dot.gov

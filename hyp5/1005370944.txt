pedestrian crossings already existed more than 2000 years ago , as can be seen in the ruins of pompeii blocks raised on the road allowed pedestrians to cross the street without having to step onto the road itself which doubled up as pompeii 's drainage and sewage disposal system the first pedestrian crossing signal was erected in bridge street , westminster , london , in december 1868 it was the idea of john peake knight , a railway engineer , who thought that it would provide a means to safely allow pedestrians to cross this busy thoroughfare the semaphore arms were augmented by gas illuminated lights at the top ( green and red ) to increase visibility of the signal at night however , in january 1869 , the gas used to illuminate the lights at the top leaked and caused an explosion , injuring the police operator no further work was done on signalled pedestrian crossings until fifty years later while the streets and roads are for all , of necessity the pedestrians , and the feeblest of these , should receive the supreme consideration according to zegeer , '' pedestrians have a right to cross roads safely and , therefore , planners and engineers have a professional responsibility to plan , design , and install safe crossing facilities in most places , the pedestrian does not need specific facilities , as in low car flow streets , the pedestrians can cross ( without priority ) at any location provides the pedestrian with a safe place to wait at the middle of the road and advance as conditions permit a continuous ( usually raised ) central reservation promotes safe pedestrian crossing in all the area , and reduce vehicle speed and head-on crash e ) traffic signals ( pelican in the u.k used to control vehicle-pedestrian conflicts , not in intersections , and provided with pedestrians buttons in this way , the vehicle signal turns red only if a pedestrian is trying to cross if the road is wide , ( two or more traffic lines per traffic direction ) and a central reservation exists or can be provided , traffic signals can be installed in a not aligned pair this facility is added in an intersection with a traffic signal , giving a clear orientation to a pedestrian when it is possible to cross i ) pedestrian overpass or underpass this facility eliminates the conflict between vehicular traffic and pedestrian , but need to be supported by some form of physical restriction preventing pedestrians from crossing at level , as they perceived the additional effort to climb the overpass in some countries , including the us , '' unmarked crosswalks '' are presumed to occur at intersections even if a crossing is n't marked , except at locations where pedestrian crossing is expressly prohibited the simplest marked crossings may just consist of some markings on the road surface in some countries , pedestrians may not have priority , but may be committing an offence if they cross the road elsewhere , or '' jaywalk '' special markings are often made on the road surface , both to direct pedestrians and to prevent motorists from stopping vehicles in the way of foot traffic some crossings have pedestrian traffic signals that allow pedestrians and road traffic to use the crossing alternately audible or tactile signals may also be included to assist people who have poor sight in many cities , some or most signals are equipped with countdown timers to give notice to both drivers and pedestrians the time remaining on the crossing signal they can also be beneficial in locations where the sidewalk or pedestrian path naturally ascends or descends to a different level than the intersection itself , and the natural '' desire line '' leads to a footbridge or tunnel , respectively additionally , ramps , stairs , or elevators present additional obstacles , and pedestrians tend to use an at-grade pedestrian crossing instead , sometimes jaywalking to avoid these obstacles known as a pedestrian scramble , this type of vehicle all-way stop allows pedestrians to cross safely in any direction , including diagonally road marking machine are special equipment professionally used to paint zebra lines on the intersections or other busy road sections because of the characteristics of zebra crossings , parallel stripes that are wide but not long , the striping machine is often a small hand-guided road marking machine , which can easily be made to change direction in tbilisi , some tbilisi academy of arts students and government officials jointly created a crossing that is designed to look like it is in 3d in curitiba , a crosswalk with its bars irregularly painted like a barcode served as an advertisement for a nearby shopping center , but was later painted over a pedestrian scramble in the chinatown section of oakland , california , is painted with red-and-yellow colors to signify the colors of the flag of china marked crosswalks are usually placed at traffic intersections or crossroads , but are occasionally used at mid-block locations where pedestrian generators are present such as at transit stops , schools , retail , or housing destinations in the united states , these '' mid-block crossings '' may include additional regulatory signage such as '' ped xing '' ( for '' pedestrian crossing '' ) , flashing yellow beacons , stop or yield signs , or by actuated or automatic signals all states require vehicles to yield to a pedestrian who has entered a marked crosswalk see here ( discussing the uniform vehicle code and stating that '' a crosswalk at an intersection is defined as the extension of the sidewalk or the shoulder across the intersection , regardless of whether it is marked or not these particular colors are used in north america ( excluding quebec ) to provide conspicuity against the backdrop of red , yellow , and green traffic lights modern pedestrian signals can be incandescent , neon , fiber-optic , or led , with the latter three displays typically utilizing less energy the upraised hand or '' do n't walk '' signals begin to flash during the pedestrian clearance interval when the transition to '' do n't walk '' is imminent the vehicular traffic is then stopped in all directions for a short period of time before cross traffic is allowed to proceed in some cities in the us , other methods of pedestrian detection are being or have been tested , including infrared and microwave technology , as well as weight sensors built in at curbside subsequent studies found that the efficacy of these sensors varied based on pedestrian traffic at the location where they were installed the other types of crossing use coloured pictogram lights , depending on the intended users of the crossing this will be a man , a bicycle or a horse in spain , the united kingdom , germany and other european countries , 90 % of pedestrian fatalities occur outside of pedestrian crossings the highest rate is in the uk , which has fewer crossings than neighbouring european countries pedestrian countdown signals are also used elsewhere around the world , such as in buenos aires , india , mexico , taiwan , and the united arab emirates other countries also use unusual '' walk '' and '' do n't walk '' pedestrian indicators the safety of unsignalled pedestrian or zebra crossings is somewhat contested in traffic engineering circles

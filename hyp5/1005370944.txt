pedestrian crossings already existed more than 2000 years ago , as can be seen in the ruins of pompeii blocks raised on the road allowed pedestrians to cross the street without having to step onto the road itself which doubled up as pompeii 's drainage and sewage disposal system the spaces between the blocks allowed horse-drawn carts to pass along the road the first pedestrian crossing signal was erected in bridge street , westminster , london , in december 1868 the signal consisted of a semaphore arm ( manufactured by saxby and farmer , who were railway signaling makers ) , which was raised and lowered manually by a police constable who would rotate a handle on the side of the pole the semaphore arms were augmented by gas illuminated lights at the top ( green and red ) to increase visibility of the signal at night a reader of the times wrote to the editor in 1911 : '' could you do something to help the pedestrian to recover the old margin of safety on our common streets and roads ? it is heartrending to read of the fearful deaths taking place according to zegeer , '' pedestrians have a right to cross roads safely and , therefore , planners and engineers have a professional responsibility to plan , design , and install safe crossing facilities in most places , the pedestrian does not need specific facilities , as in low car flow streets , the pedestrians can cross ( without priority ) at any location b ) providing central islands in the road a continuous ( usually raised ) central reservation promotes safe pedestrian crossing in all the area , and reduce vehicle speed and head-on crash provides a crossing in a low pedestrians flow area , if the pedestrian flow is high ( as outside a school , train or bus terminal ) the vehicle traffic will be severally affected by a significant number of pedestrians using the crossing , making necessary to provide traffic signals in this way , the vehicle signal turns red only if a pedestrian is trying to cross if the road is wide , ( two or more traffic lines per traffic direction ) and a central reservation exists or can be provided , traffic signals can be installed in a not aligned pair this facility is added in an intersection with a traffic signal , giving a clear orientation to a pedestrian when it is possible to cross this facility eliminates the conflict between vehicular traffic and pedestrian , but need to be supported by some form of physical restriction preventing pedestrians from crossing at level , as they perceived the additional effort to climb the overpass in some countries , including the us , '' unmarked crosswalks '' are presumed to occur at intersections even if a crossing is n't marked , except at locations where pedestrian crossing is expressly prohibited the simplest marked crossings may just consist of some markings on the road surface if the pedestrian has priority over vehicular traffic when using the crossing , then they have an incentive to use the crossing instead of crossing the road at other places in some countries , pedestrians may not have priority , but may be committing an offence if they cross the road elsewhere , or '' jaywalk '' special markings are often made on the road surface , both to direct pedestrians and to prevent motorists from stopping vehicles in the way of foot traffic some crossings have pedestrian traffic signals that allow pedestrians and road traffic to use the crossing alternately on some traffic signals , pressing a call button is required to trigger the signal however , pedestrian bridges are ineffective in most locations ; due to their expense , they are typically spaced far apart known as a pedestrian scramble , this type of vehicle all-way stop allows pedestrians to cross safely in any direction , including diagonally pedestrian refuges or small islands in the middle of a street may be added when a street is very wide , as these crossings can be too long for some individuals to cross in one cycle another relatively widespread variation is the curb extension ( also known as a bulb-out ) , which narrows the width of the street and is used in combination with crosswalk markings they can also be used to slow down cars , potentially creating a safer crossing for pedestrians road marking machine are special equipment professionally used to paint zebra lines on the intersections or other busy road sections a pedestrian scramble in the chinatown section of oakland , california , is painted with red-and-yellow colors to signify the colors of the flag of china marked crosswalks are usually placed at traffic intersections or crossroads , but are occasionally used at mid-block locations where pedestrian generators are present such as at transit stops , schools , retail , or housing destinations in the united states , these '' mid-block crossings '' may include additional regulatory signage such as '' ped xing '' ( for '' pedestrian crossing '' ) , flashing yellow beacons , stop or yield signs , or by actuated or automatic signals legally speaking , in most states crosswalks exist at all intersections meeting at approximately right angles , whether they are marked or not on pedestrian signals displaying text , '' do n't walk '' is spelled without an apostrophe so that it fits easily on the sign in intersections with '' leading pedestrian intervals , '' the upraised hand or '' do n't walk '' sign will continue flashing as the vehicular lights turn red and the other crossing ( s ) in the intersection display a walking man or '' walk '' sign the vehicular traffic is then stopped in all directions for a short period of time before cross traffic is allowed to proceed the 2009 mutcd states that the flashing walking man or '' walk '' signals do not have meaning the '' flashing walk '' indication was formerly used to delineate '' watch out for turning vehicles '' and is still in use in washington , d.c a 2000 study of these detectors in los angeles , phoenix , and rochester found that the infrared and microwave technologies both helped reduce conflicts between pedestrians and turning vehicles , as well as pedestrians starting during the '' do n't walk '' phase on fully actuated signals , or semi-actuated traffic signals , pressing the button to cross a smaller side street will cause an '' instant walk signal '' during this red-plus-yellow indication , the intersection is closed to vehicular traffic and pedestrians are given an '' exclusive pedestrian interval '' , or a pedestrian scramble phase , in which they can cross any leg of the intersection , usually in whatever direction they choose a zebra crossing consists of wide longitudinal stripes on road ( perpendicular to the crossing route ) , with flashing amber belisha beacons either side of the road pedestrians may cross at any time , while drivers must give way to pedestrians on the crossing a toucan crossing is used by bicycles as well as pedestrians , while a pegasus crossing is used by horse riders - hence having the button to operate the crossing higher up zebra crossings are the only specific pedestrian crossing point that does not use light signals to control traffic movement like some other countries , a flashing red sequence is used prior to steady red to clear pedestrians in neighboring cambridge , a button press is always required if a button is available , though the city prefers to build signals where no button is present and the pedestrian cycle always happens between short car cycles in some areas , the signal timing technique of a leading pedestrian interval ( lpi ) allows pedestrians exclusive access to a crosswalk , typically 3â€“7 seconds , before vehicular traffic is permitted however , if combined with ( placed on top of ) a speed table , zebra crossings were found to reduce pedestrian crashes by 80 % footpath road surface marking stile the greenwalking traffic light

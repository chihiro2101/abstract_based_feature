pedestrian crossings already existed more than 2000 years ago , as can be seen in the ruins of pompeii blocks raised on the road allowed pedestrians to cross the street without having to step onto the road itself which doubled up as pompeii 's drainage and sewage disposal system it was the idea of john peake knight , a railway engineer , who thought that it would provide a means to safely allow pedestrians to cross this busy thoroughfare no further work was done on signalled pedestrian crossings until fifty years later in the early 20th century , car traffic increased dramatically while the streets and roads are for all , of necessity the pedestrians , and the feeblest of these , should receive the supreme consideration according to zegeer , '' pedestrians have a right to cross roads safely and , therefore , planners and engineers have a professional responsibility to plan , design , and install safe crossing facilities in most places , the pedestrian does not need specific facilities , as in low car flow streets , the pedestrians can cross ( without priority ) at any location provides the pedestrian with a safe place to wait at the middle of the road and advance as conditions permit a continuous ( usually raised ) central reservation promotes safe pedestrian crossing in all the area , and reduce vehicle speed and head-on crash provides a crossing in a low pedestrians flow area , if the pedestrian flow is high ( as outside a school , train or bus terminal ) the vehicle traffic will be severally affected by a significant number of pedestrians using the crossing , making necessary to provide traffic signals e ) traffic signals ( pelican in the u.k used to control vehicle-pedestrian conflicts , not in intersections , and provided with pedestrians buttons this facility is added in an intersection with a traffic signal , giving a clear orientation to a pedestrian when it is possible to cross in some countries , including the us , '' unmarked crosswalks '' are presumed to occur at intersections even if a crossing is n't marked , except at locations where pedestrian crossing is expressly prohibited the simplest marked crossings may just consist of some markings on the road surface '' in the uk these are often called zebra crossings , referring to the alternate white and black stripes painted on the road surface if the pedestrian has priority over vehicular traffic when using the crossing , then they have an incentive to use the crossing instead of crossing the road at other places in some countries , pedestrians may not have priority , but may be committing an offence if they cross the road elsewhere , or '' jaywalk '' special markings are often made on the road surface , both to direct pedestrians and to prevent motorists from stopping vehicles in the way of foot traffic there are many varieties of signal and marking layouts around the world and even within single countries in the united states , there are many inconsistencies , although the variations are usually minor some crossings have pedestrian traffic signals that allow pedestrians and road traffic to use the crossing alternately on some traffic signals , pressing a call button is required to trigger the signal in places where there is very high pedestrian traffic , embedded pavement flashing-light systems are used to signal traffic of pedestrian presence , or pedestrian scramble ( also known as barnes dances ) may be used , which stop vehicular traffic in all directions at the same time footbridges or pedestrian tunnels may be used in lieu of crosswalks at very busy intersections as well as at locations where limited-access roads and controlled-access highways must be crossed however , pedestrian bridges are ineffective in most locations ; due to their expense , they are typically spaced far apart additionally , ramps , stairs , or elevators present additional obstacles , and pedestrians tend to use an at-grade pedestrian crossing instead , sometimes jaywalking to avoid these obstacles known as a pedestrian scramble , this type of vehicle all-way stop allows pedestrians to cross safely in any direction , including diagonally pedestrian refuges or small islands in the middle of a street may be added when a street is very wide , as these crossings can be too long for some individuals to cross in one cycle road marking machine are special equipment professionally used to paint zebra lines on the intersections or other busy road sections other crossings worldwide also feature some of roadsworth 's work , including a crosswalk in montreal where the zebra stripes are shaped like bullets , as well as '' conveyor belt '' crosswalk in winston-salem , north carolina in lompoc , california , several artists were commissioned to create an artwork as part of its '' creative crossings '' competition colored crosswalks might have themes that reflect the immediate area in curitiba , a crosswalk with its bars irregularly painted like a barcode served as an advertisement for a nearby shopping center , but was later painted over the united states federal highway administration prohibits crosswalk art due to concerns about safety and visibility , but u.s all states require vehicles to yield to a pedestrian who has entered a marked crosswalk at crossings controlled by signals , the most common variety is arranged like this : at each end of a crosswalk , the poles which hold the traffic lights also have white '' walk '' and portland orange '' do n't walk '' signs as of the 2000 mutcd , modern signals are mandated to use pictograms of an orange '' upraised hand '' and a white '' walking man '' rather than words ; the hand/man display is the mandate as of the 2009 edition on pedestrian signals displaying text , '' do n't walk '' is spelled without an apostrophe so that it fits easily on the sign the upraised hand or '' do n't walk '' signals begin to flash during the pedestrian clearance interval when the transition to '' do n't walk '' is imminent the vehicular traffic is then stopped in all directions for a short period of time before cross traffic is allowed to proceed however , in some states ( such as utah ) , if the driver is in a school zone with the lights flashing , the driver must wait until the entire crosswalk is clear before he may proceed at signalized intersections without separate pedestrian signal heads , the traffic signals may be programmed to turn red in all directions , followed by a steady display of yellow lights simultaneously with the red indications during this red-plus-yellow indication , the intersection is closed to vehicular traffic and pedestrians are given an '' exclusive pedestrian interval '' , or a pedestrian scramble phase , in which they can cross any leg of the intersection , usually in whatever direction they choose a toucan crossing is used by bicycles as well as pedestrians , while a pegasus crossing is used by horse riders - hence having the button to operate the crossing higher up zebra crossings are the only specific pedestrian crossing point that does not use light signals to control traffic movement the countdown is not supposed to be displayed during the pedestrian '' walk '' interval ( '' steady walking person '' phase ) , some municipalities have found that there are instances where pedestrian countdown signals may be less effective than standard hand/man or '' '' / '' '' signals in situations where there is little visibility along the railway , or the footpath is especially busy , there will also be a small set of lights with an explanatory sign bicycle and pedestrian statistics federal highway administration ( us ) the design of pedestrian crossings - department for transport ( united kingdom ) photos of pedestrian signals from various countries investigating improvements to pedestrian crossings fhwa.dot.gov

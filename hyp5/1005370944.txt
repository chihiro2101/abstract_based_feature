pedestrian crossings already existed more than 2000 years ago , as can be seen in the ruins of pompeii blocks raised on the road allowed pedestrians to cross the street without having to step onto the road itself which doubled up as pompeii 's drainage and sewage disposal system the first pedestrian crossing signal was erected in bridge street , westminster , london , in december 1868 it was the idea of john peake knight , a railway engineer , who thought that it would provide a means to safely allow pedestrians to cross this busy thoroughfare the semaphore arms were augmented by gas illuminated lights at the top ( green and red ) to increase visibility of the signal at night while the streets and roads are for all , of necessity the pedestrians , and the feeblest of these , should receive the supreme consideration according to zegeer , '' pedestrians have a right to cross roads safely and , therefore , planners and engineers have a professional responsibility to plan , design , and install safe crossing facilities some countries have specific criteria to provide pedestrian facilities ; for example , they provide warrants , depending on local conditions , usually prioritized as follows : a ) do nothing in most places , the pedestrian does not need specific facilities , as in low car flow streets , the pedestrians can cross ( without priority ) at any location provides the pedestrian with a safe place to wait at the middle of the road and advance as conditions permit in this way , the vehicle signal turns red only if a pedestrian is trying to cross this facility is added in an intersection with a traffic signal , giving a clear orientation to a pedestrian when it is possible to cross this facility eliminates the conflict between vehicular traffic and pedestrian , but need to be supported by some form of physical restriction preventing pedestrians from crossing at level , as they perceived the additional effort to climb the overpass if the pedestrian has priority over vehicular traffic when using the crossing , then they have an incentive to use the crossing instead of crossing the road at other places some crossings have pedestrian traffic signals that allow pedestrians and road traffic to use the crossing alternately on some traffic signals , pressing a call button is required to trigger the signal audible or tactile signals may also be included to assist people who have poor sight in many cities , some or most signals are equipped with countdown timers to give notice to both drivers and pedestrians the time remaining on the crossing signal in places where there is very high pedestrian traffic , embedded pavement flashing-light systems are used to signal traffic of pedestrian presence , or pedestrian scramble ( also known as barnes dances ) may be used , which stop vehicular traffic in all directions at the same time footbridges or pedestrian tunnels may be used in lieu of crosswalks at very busy intersections as well as at locations where limited-access roads and controlled-access highways must be crossed they can also be beneficial in locations where the sidewalk or pedestrian path naturally ascends or descends to a different level than the intersection itself , and the natural '' desire line '' leads to a footbridge or tunnel , respectively however , pedestrian bridges are ineffective in most locations ; due to their expense , they are typically spaced far apart a variation on the bridge concept , often called a skyway or skywalk , is sometimes implemented in regions that experience inclement weather they can also be used to slow down cars , potentially creating a safer crossing for pedestrians road marking machine are special equipment professionally used to paint zebra lines on the intersections or other busy road sections because of the characteristics of zebra crossings , parallel stripes that are wide but not long , the striping machine is often a small hand-guided road marking machine , which can easily be made to change direction the marking shoe of a pedestrian cross striping machine , which determines marking lines ' width , is much wider than on other marking machines as an alternative to thermoplastics , household paint or epoxy can be used to mark crosswalks these works of art may serve many different purposes , such as attracting tourism or catching drivers ' attention sometimes , different cities around the world may have similar art concepts for their crosswalks for crosswalk safety , in the usa there is not much clarity regarding the need for a crosswalk to be marked or unmarked dues to advantages and disadvantages of both approaches , although each city might have its own rules marked crosswalks are usually placed at traffic intersections or crossroads , but are occasionally used at mid-block locations where pedestrian generators are present such as at transit stops , schools , retail , or housing destinations all states require vehicles to yield to a pedestrian who has entered a marked crosswalk the province of ontario enacted a law in 2016 that mandates that drivers and bicyclists come to a complete stop at pedestrian '' crossovers '' —ladder-style crosswalks that are sometimes designated with overhead signs or lights—as well as crosswalks with crossing guard at crossings controlled by signals , the most common variety is arranged like this : at each end of a crosswalk , the poles which hold the traffic lights also have white '' walk '' and portland orange '' do n't walk '' signs the '' flashing walk '' indication was formerly used to delineate '' watch out for turning vehicles '' and is still in use in washington , d.c subsequent studies found that the efficacy of these sensors varied based on pedestrian traffic at the location where they were installed in most states , drivers only have to wait until the pedestrian has finished crossing the half of the crosswalk that the driver is driving on , after which the driver may proceed at signalized intersections without separate pedestrian signal heads , the traffic signals may be programmed to turn red in all directions , followed by a steady display of yellow lights simultaneously with the red indications during this red-plus-yellow indication , the intersection is closed to vehicular traffic and pedestrians are given an '' exclusive pedestrian interval '' , or a pedestrian scramble phase , in which they can cross any leg of the intersection , usually in whatever direction they choose a zebra crossing consists of wide longitudinal stripes on road ( perpendicular to the crossing route ) , with flashing amber belisha beacons either side of the road a pelican crossing is a signalised pedestrian-operated crossing the puffin also uses standard uk traffic signal sequence a toucan crossing is used by bicycles as well as pedestrians , while a pegasus crossing is used by horse riders - hence having the button to operate the crossing higher up zebra crossings are the only specific pedestrian crossing point that does not use light signals to control traffic movement call buttons are installed at traffic lights with a dedicated pedestrian signal , and are used to bring up the pedestrian '' walk '' indication in locations where they function correctly in the majority of locations where call buttons are installed , pushing the button does not light up the pedestrian walk sign immediately other countries also use unusual '' walk '' and '' do n't walk '' pedestrian indicators research undertaken in new zealand showed that a zebra crossing without other safety features on average increases pedestrian crashes by 28 % compared to a location without crossings footpath road surface marking stile the greenwalking traffic light

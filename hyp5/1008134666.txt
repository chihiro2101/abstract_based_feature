federal election nitschke ran in the seat of the northern territory for the australian greens but was unsuccessful after the roti act was nullified nitschke began providing advice to others about how they can end their lives , leading to the formation of exit international in 1997 on 22 may 2002 , crick , in the presence of over 20 friends and family ( but not nitschke ) , took a lethal dose of barbiturates , went quickly to sleep and died within 20 minutes nitschke had encouraged crick to enter palliative care , which she did for a number of days before returning home again in the 2007 australian federal election nitschke ran against the australian politician kevin andrews in the victorian seat of menzies but was unsuccessful nitschke recounts that brayley rebuffed suggestions to seek counselling , and had already obtained the drug nembutal although nitschke was unaware of the investigation at the time , he now believes that brayley , whom he described as a '' serial killer '' , had made a rational decision to commit suicide rather than face long imprisonment nitschke stated that he does not believe he could have changed brayley 's mind , that brayley was not his patient , that brayley was not depressed and did not seek or want nitschke 's advice nitschke said he would appeal the suspension , which he claimed was politically motivated , and that the board '' made it clear that what they really object to is the way i think nitschke said the suspension will not affect his work for exit international and that he had not practised medicine for years nitschke appealed to an mba tribunal in darwin to have his july 2014 suspension from practising medicine overturned nitschke then appealed the tribunal 's decision to the darwin supreme court '' a doctor would constantly need to fear that any interaction with any other individual or community , including an individual who is not and never has been his or her patient , may be in breach of the ( code ) , even if the doctor did nothing in circumstances where there was no other obligation to do something , '' he said nitschke 's lawyer will apply for costs of approximately au 300,000 , which were paid using donations , including 20,000 from swiss euthanasia organisation dignitas these conditions included prohibitions on giving advice or information to the public or patients about euthanasia , or nembutal , or suicide , and forcing him to rescind his endorsement of and involvement with the 'peaceful pill ' handbook and related videos in response nitschke , calling the mba 's actions '' a heavy-handed and clumsy attempt to restrict the free flow of information on end-of-life choice '' , surveyed more than 1,000 members of his advocacy group , exit international , and received strong support for ending his medical registration as a consequence of the mba restrictions and the results of the member survey , nitschke publicly burned his medical practising certificate and announced the end of his medical career , vowing to continue to promote euthanasia nitschke stated that he will remain a doctor and will legitimately use the title '' doctor '' ( he has a phd ) , and will continue to see patients and exit members in clinics that he runs in australia and other countries on 2 may 2009 nitschke was detained for nine hours by british immigration officials at heathrow airport after arriving for a visit to the uk to lecture on voluntary euthanasia and end-of-life choices dame joan bakewell , the british government 's '' voice of older people '' , said that the current british law on assisted suicide was '' a mess '' and that nitschke should have been made more welcome in the uk on 1 august 2014 , after euthanasia advocate max bromson , 66 , who suffered from terminal bone tumor , ended his life with nembutal in a glenelg motel room , surrounded by family members , police carried out a three-hour raid on exit international 's adelaide premises , interrogating nitschke and seizing nitschke 's phones , computers and other items nitschke said he felt violated by the '' heavy-handed and unnecessary '' police actions and confiscations that would cripple exit international 's activities in august 2016 , after exactly two years of investigation , south australian police advised that no charges would be laid against anyone over the death in april 2016 british police , acting on an interpol drug alert , forced entry into the home of a member of nitschke 's organisation , retired professor dr avril henry , aged 81 , who was in failing health worried that the police would return and confiscate her remaining nembutal , she committed suicide four days later pensioners in poor health , some in wheelchairs , were forced to leave their beds and answer police questions in october 2016 new zealand police , in a '' sting '' operation code named '' operation painter '' , set up roadblocks ( checkpoints ) outside an exit international meeting and took down names and addresses of all attendees nitschke said police actions were unprecedented and probably in breach of the bill of rights , which guaranteed freedom of association in july 2009 nitschke said he no longer believed voluntary euthanasia should only be available to the terminally ill , but that elderly people afraid of getting old and incapacitated should also have a choice '' we have too many people who have the best palliative care in the world and they still want to know that they can put an end to things , '' he said in 2010 the victorian institute of forensic medicine released a report into australian deaths caused by the drug nembutal , which nitschke recommends as a euthanasia drug nitschke said exit international would investigate if it could set up its own proxy server or vpn tunnel , so its members had a safe way of accessing its information nitschke was told to provide legal advice outlining how his billboard did not break this law , a request nitschke described as '' ludicrous '' , pointing out that the billboards urge '' political change and in no way could be considered to be in breach of the crimes act '' nitschke began his comedy career at the edinburgh festival fringe in august 2015 with his show dicing with dr death an italian edition – la pillola della quiete was published in online format in 2017 a dutch edition – handboek de vredige pil was

flinders university in laser physics in 1972 rejecting a career in the sciences , he instead travelled to the northern territory to take up work with the aboriginal land rights activist vincent lingiari and the gurindji at wave hill after the hand-back of land by the prime minister , gough whitlam , nitschke became a northern territory parks and wildlife ranger in addition to having long been interested in studying medicine he has suffered from hypochondria most of his adult life and futilely hoped with his medical studies to educate himself out of the problem after graduating nitschke worked as an intern at royal darwin hospital , and then as an after hours general practitioner when the northern territory branch of the australian medical association publicly opposed the proposed northern territory legislation to provide for legal euthanasia , nitschke and a small group of dissenting territory doctors published a contrary opinion in the nt news under the banner doctors for change after the rights of the terminally ill act ( roti act ) came into force on 1 july 1996 , nitschke assisted four terminally ill people to end their lives using the euthanasia device he developed this practice was ceased when the roti act was effectively nullified by the australian parliament 's euthanasia laws act 1997 in the 1996 australian federal election nitschke ran in the seat of the northern territory for the australian greens but was unsuccessful after the roti act was nullified nitschke began providing advice to others about how they can end their lives , leading to the formation of exit international in 1997 on 22 may 2002 , crick , in the presence of over 20 friends and family ( but not nitschke ) , took a lethal dose of barbiturates , went quickly to sleep and died within 20 minutes nitschke had encouraged crick to enter palliative care , which she did for a number of days before returning home again in the 2007 australian federal election nitschke ran against the australian politician kevin andrews in the victorian seat of menzies but was unsuccessful in 2009 nitschke helped to promote dignified departure , a 13-hour , pay-television program on doctor-assisted suicide in hong kong and mainland china organisations opposed to euthanasia , as well as some supporting euthanasia , are critical of nitschke and his methods brayley then committed suicide in may 2014 nitschke stated that he does not believe he could have changed brayley 's mind , that brayley was not his patient , that brayley was not depressed and did not seek or want nitschke 's advice the medical board of australia ( mba ) and beyondblue said nitschke had an obligation to refer the man to a psychologist or psychiatrist ( a view dismissed by the nt supreme court in 2015 ) on 23 july 2014 , as a consequence of the brayley case , the mba voted to use emergency powers to suspend his practitioner 's licence immediately , on the grounds that he presented '' a serious risk to public health and safety '' nitschke said he would appeal the suspension , which he claimed was politically motivated , and that the board '' made it clear that what they really object to is the way i think nitschke said the suspension will not affect his work for exit international and that he had not practised medicine for years on 6 july 2015 the northern territory supreme court upheld nitschke 's appeal , finding the emergency suspension of his licence by the mba should not have been upheld by a review tribunal these conditions included prohibitions on giving advice or information to the public or patients about euthanasia , or nembutal , or suicide , and forcing him to rescind his endorsement of and involvement with the 'peaceful pill ' handbook and related videos in response nitschke , calling the mba 's actions '' a heavy-handed and clumsy attempt to restrict the free flow of information on end-of-life choice '' , surveyed more than 1,000 members of his advocacy group , exit international , and received strong support for ending his medical registration as a consequence of the mba restrictions and the results of the member survey , nitschke publicly burned his medical practising certificate and announced the end of his medical career , vowing to continue to promote euthanasia nitschke stated that he will remain a doctor and will legitimately use the title '' doctor '' ( he has a phd ) , and will continue to see patients and exit members in clinics that he runs in australia and other countries nitschke said it was a matter of free speech and that his detention said something about changes to british society which were '' quite troubling '' dame joan bakewell , the british government 's '' voice of older people '' , said that the current british law on assisted suicide was '' a mess '' and that nitschke should have been made more welcome in the uk on 1 august 2014 , after euthanasia advocate max bromson , 66 , who suffered from terminal bone tumor , ended his life with nembutal in a glenelg motel room , surrounded by family members , police carried out a three-hour raid on exit international 's adelaide premises , interrogating nitschke and seizing nitschke 's phones , computers and other items nitschke said he felt violated by the '' heavy-handed and unnecessary '' police actions and confiscations that would cripple exit international 's activities worried that the police would return and confiscate her remaining nembutal , she committed suicide four days later this coincided with another action by new zealand police in which 76-year old patsy mcgrath , a member of nitschke 's exit group , had her home raided in 2016 and her store-bought helium balloon cylinder confiscated under warrant in july 2009 nitschke said he no longer believed voluntary euthanasia should only be available to the terminally ill , but that elderly people afraid of getting old and incapacitated should also have a choice nitschke expects that a growing number of people importing their own euthanasia drugs , '' really do n't care if the law is changed or not '' in 2010 the victorian institute of forensic medicine released a report into australian deaths caused by the drug nembutal , which nitschke recommends as a euthanasia drug nitschke said the kit was made available by exit international in response to growing demand for something to test the nembutal obtained from mexico , often delivered in the post without labels in an article in december 2017 about the sarco , newsweek referred to nitschke as '' the elon musk of assisted suicide '' nitschke on max dog nitrogen video interview , 2015 exit international abc tv interview with nitschke by andrew denton mademoiselle and the doctor on australian screen

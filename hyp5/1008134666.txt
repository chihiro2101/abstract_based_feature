nitschke was born in 1947 in rural south australia , the son of school teachers harold and gweneth ( gwen ) nitschke rejecting a career in the sciences , he instead travelled to the northern territory to take up work with the aboriginal land rights activist vincent lingiari and the gurindji at wave hill after the hand-back of land by the prime minister , gough whitlam , nitschke became a northern territory parks and wildlife ranger in addition to having long been interested in studying medicine he has suffered from hypochondria most of his adult life and futilely hoped with his medical studies to educate himself out of the problem he graduated from the university of sydney medical school in 1989 after graduating nitschke worked as an intern at royal darwin hospital , and then as an after hours general practitioner when the northern territory branch of the australian medical association publicly opposed the proposed northern territory legislation to provide for legal euthanasia , nitschke and a small group of dissenting territory doctors published a contrary opinion in the nt news under the banner doctors for change after the rights of the terminally ill act ( roti act ) came into force on 1 july 1996 , nitschke assisted four terminally ill people to end their lives using the euthanasia device he developed this practice was ceased when the roti act was effectively nullified by the australian parliament 's euthanasia laws act 1997 after the roti act was nullified nitschke began providing advice to others about how they can end their lives , leading to the formation of exit international in 1997 she had undergone multiple surgeries to treat bowel cancer and was left with multiple dense and inoperable bowel adhesions that left her in constant pain and frequently in the toilet with diarrhoea he also made headlines , even angering some fellow right-to-die advocates , when he presented his plan to launch a '' death ship '' that would have allowed him to circumvent local laws by euthanising people from around the world in international waters in 2009 nitschke helped to promote dignified departure , a 13-hour , pay-television program on doctor-assisted suicide in hong kong and mainland china organisations opposed to euthanasia , as well as some supporting euthanasia , are critical of nitschke and his methods the medical board of australia ( mba ) and beyondblue said nitschke had an obligation to refer the man to a psychologist or psychiatrist ( a view dismissed by the nt supreme court in 2015 ) nitschke said he would appeal the suspension , which he claimed was politically motivated , and that the board '' made it clear that what they really object to is the way i think it 's ideas they object to â€” namely , my belief that people should have a right to suicide , is something they think is contrary to medical practice nitschke said the suspension will not affect his work for exit international and that he had not practised medicine for years nitschke appealed to an mba tribunal in darwin to have his july 2014 suspension from practising medicine overturned on 6 july 2015 the northern territory supreme court upheld nitschke 's appeal , finding the emergency suspension of his licence by the mba should not have been upheld by a review tribunal nitschke said the mba 's erroneous interpretation was '' ludicrous '' and flew in the face of common law in october 2015 the mba lifted nitschke 's suspension but drew up a list of 25 conditions under which nitschke could continue to practise these conditions included prohibitions on giving advice or information to the public or patients about euthanasia , or nembutal , or suicide , and forcing him to rescind his endorsement of and involvement with the 'peaceful pill ' handbook and related videos as a consequence of the mba restrictions and the results of the member survey , nitschke publicly burned his medical practising certificate and announced the end of his medical career , vowing to continue to promote euthanasia nitschke stated that he will remain a doctor and will legitimately use the title '' doctor '' ( he has a phd ) , and will continue to see patients and exit members in clinics that he runs in australia and other countries nitschke states that he and his group are regularly subject to harassment by authorities , including detention and questioning at international airports , and raids on homes and the premises of exit international on 2 may 2009 nitschke was detained for nine hours by british immigration officials at heathrow airport after arriving for a visit to the uk to lecture on voluntary euthanasia and end-of-life choices nitschke said it was a matter of free speech and that his detention said something about changes to british society which were '' quite troubling '' nitschke was told that he and his wife , author fiona stewart , were detained because the workshops may contravene british law dame joan bakewell , the british government 's '' voice of older people '' , said that the current british law on assisted suicide was '' a mess '' and that nitschke should have been made more welcome in the uk nitschke said he felt violated by the '' heavy-handed and unnecessary '' police actions and confiscations that would cripple exit international 's activities in august 2016 , after exactly two years of investigation , south australian police advised that no charges would be laid against anyone over the death in april 2016 british police , acting on an interpol drug alert , forced entry into the home of a member of nitschke 's organisation , retired professor dr avril henry , aged 81 , who was in failing health some of the elderly members of the group were later visited at their homes by police with warrants , and searches were conducted '' he works mainly with older people from whom he gains inspiration , saying : '' you get quite inspired and uplifted by the elderly folk who see this as quite a practical approach '' nitschke responded that the acts of commercials advice constitute interference with the right to free speech in 2009 nitschke made a barbiturate testing kit available , initially launched in the uk , then australia in an article in december 2017 about the sarco , newsweek referred to nitschke as '' the elon musk of assisted suicide

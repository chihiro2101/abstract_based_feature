nitschke was born in 1947 in rural south australia , the son of school teachers harold and gweneth ( gwen ) nitschke rejecting a career in the sciences , he instead travelled to the northern territory to take up work with the aboriginal land rights activist vincent lingiari and the gurindji at wave hill after the hand-back of land by the prime minister , gough whitlam , nitschke became a northern territory parks and wildlife ranger however , after badly injuring his subtalar joint , which effectively finished his career as a ranger , he began studying for a medical degree when the northern territory branch of the australian medical association publicly opposed the proposed northern territory legislation to provide for legal euthanasia , nitschke and a small group of dissenting territory doctors published a contrary opinion in the nt news under the banner doctors for change after the rights of the terminally ill act ( roti act ) came into force on 1 july 1996 , nitschke assisted four terminally ill people to end their lives using the euthanasia device he developed this practice was ceased when the roti act was effectively nullified by the australian parliament 's euthanasia laws act 1997 in the 1996 australian federal election nitschke ran in the seat of the northern territory for the australian greens but was unsuccessful on 22 may 2002 , crick , in the presence of over 20 friends and family ( but not nitschke ) , took a lethal dose of barbiturates , went quickly to sleep and died within 20 minutes nitschke had encouraged crick to enter palliative care , which she did

unsuccessful brayley was facing ongoing questions about the death of his wife , which police were treating as suspected murder nitschke recounts that brayley rebuffed suggestions to seek counselling , and had already obtained the drug nembutal although nitschke was unaware of the investigation at the time , he now believes that brayley , whom he described as a '' serial killer '' , had made a rational decision to commit suicide rather than face long imprisonment the medical board of australia ( mba ) and beyondblue said nitschke had an obligation to refer the man to a psychologist or psychiatrist ( a view dismissed by the nt supreme court in 2015 ) on 23 july 2014 , as a consequence of the brayley case , the mba voted to use emergency powers to suspend his practitioner 's licence immediately , on the grounds that he presented '' a serious risk to public health and safety '' nitschke said he would appeal the suspension , which he claimed was politically motivated , and that the board '' made it clear that what they really object to is the way i think it 's ideas they object to â€” namely , my belief that people should have a right to suicide , is something they think is contrary to medical practice nitschke said the suspension will not affect his work for exit international and that he had not practised medicine for years nitschke appealed to an mba tribunal in darwin to have his july 2014 suspension from practising medicine overturned '' a doctor would constantly need to fear that any interaction with any other individual or community , including an individual who is not and never has been his or her patient , may be in breach of the ( code ) , even if the doctor did nothing in circumstances where there was no other obligation to do something , '' he said nitschke said the mba 's erroneous interpretation was '' ludicrous '' and flew in the face of common law nitschke 's lawyer will apply for costs of approximately au 300,000 , which were paid using donations , including 20,000 from swiss euthanasia organisation dignitas in october 2015 the mba lifted nitschke 's suspension but drew up a list of 25 conditions under which nitschke could continue to practise these conditions included prohibitions on giving advice or information to the public or patients about euthanasia , or nembutal , or suicide , and forcing him to rescind his endorsement of and involvement with the 'peaceful pill ' handbook and related videos as a consequence of the mba restrictions and the results of the member survey , nitschke publicly burned his medical practising certificate and announced the end of his medical career , vowing to continue to promote euthanasia in the wake of this incident , nitschke and his partner , fiona stewart , decided in 2015 to relocate to the more liberal politico-legal environment of holland nitschke states that he and his group are regularly subject to harassment by authorities , including detention and questioning at international airports , and raids on homes and the premises of exit international on 2 may 2009 nitschke was detained for nine hours by british immigration officials at heathrow airport after arriving for a visit to the uk to lecture on voluntary euthanasia and end-of-life choices however , although assisting someone to commit suicide in the uk was illegal , the law did not apply to a person lecturing on the concept of euthanasia , and nitschke was allowed to enter dame joan bakewell , the british government 's '' voice of older people '' , said that the current british law on assisted suicide was '' a mess '' and that nitschke should have been made more welcome in the uk nitschke said he felt violated by the '' heavy-handed and unnecessary '' police actions and confiscations that would cripple exit international 's activities worried that the police would return and confiscate her remaining nembutal , she committed suicide four days later in 2010 the

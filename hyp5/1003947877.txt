humans have managed to construct lighter-than-air vehicles that raise off the ground and fly , due to their buoyancy in air an aerostat is a system that remains aloft primarily through the use of buoyancy to give an aircraft the same overall density as air aerostats include free balloons , airships , and moored balloons an aerostat 's main structural component is its envelope , a lightweight skin that encloses a volume of lifting gas walker 2000 , p aerostats are so named because they use '' aerostatic '' lift , a buoyant force that does not require lateral movement through the surrounding air mass to effect a lifting force by contrast , aerodynes primarily use aerodynamic lift , which requires the lateral movement of at least some part of the aircraft through the surrounding air mass . unpowered flight versus powered flight some things that fly do not generate propulsive thrust through the air , for example , the flying squirrel however most other birds and all powered aircraft need a source of propulsion to climb the only groups of flying and gliding animals are birds , insects , and bats , while many groups have evolved gliding the extinct pterosaurs , an order of reptiles contemporaneous with the dinosaurs , were also very successful flying animals however , there are several flying squirrel which are able to glide from tree to tree using fleshy membranes between their limbs ; some can travel hundreds of meters in this way with very little loss in height flying frogs use greatly enlarged webbed feet for a similar purpose , and there are flying lizards which fold out their mobile ribs into a pair of flat gliding surfaces flying fish can glide using enlarged wing-like fins , and have been observed soaring for hundreds of meters the largest birds , the ostrich and the emu , are earthbound flightless birds , as were the now-extinct dodos and the phorusrhacids , which were the dominant predators of south america in the cenozoic era the non-flying penguins have wings adapted for use under water and use the same wing movements for swimming that most other birds use for flight insect flight makes use of either of two basic aerodynamic models : creating a leading edge vortex , found in most insects , and using clap and fling , found in very small insects such as thrips these machines include aircraft such as airplanes , gliders , helicopters , autogyros , airships , balloons , ornithopters as well as spacecraft supersonic flight is flight faster than the speed of sound hypersonic flight is very high speed flight where the heat generated by the compression of the air due to the motion through the air causes chemical changes to the air hypersonic flight is achieved by reentering spacecraft such as the space shuttle and soyuz some things generate little or no lift and move only or mostly under the action of momentum , gravity , air drag and in some cases thrust this is termed ballistic flight spaceflight is used in space exploration , and also in commercial activities like space tourism and telecommunications satellite additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include space observatory , reconnaissance satellites and other earth observation satellites a spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch , which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of the earth once in space , the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics in 2018 , researchers at massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) managed to fly an aeroplane with no moving parts , powered by an '' ionic wind '' also known as electroaerodynamic thrust many human cultures have built devices that fly , from the earliest projectiles such as stones and spears , '' archytas of tar entum spaceflight , particularly human spaceflight became a reality in the 20th century following theoretical and practical breakthroughs by konstantin tsiolkovsky and robert h because the craft is heavier than air , it must generate lift to overcome its weight some vehicles also use thrust for flight , for example rockets and harrier jump jets any object that has a mass that is less than the mass of an equal volume of air will rise in air - in other words , any object less dense than air will rise to create thrust so as to be able to gain height , and to push through the air to overcome the drag associated with lift all takes energy the techniques used for navigation in the air will depend on whether the aircraft is flying under the visual flight rules ( vfr ) or the instrument flight rules ( ifr ) 'birds in flight and aeroplanes ' by evolutionary biologist and trained engineer john maynard-smith freeview video provided by the vega science trust .

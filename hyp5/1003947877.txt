humans have managed to construct lighter-than-air vehicles that raise off the ground and fly , due to their buoyancy in air an aerostat is a system that remains aloft primarily through the use of buoyancy to give an aircraft the same overall density as air an aerostat 's main structural component is its envelope , a lightweight skin that encloses a volume of lifting gas walker 2000 , p by contrast , aerodynes primarily use aerodynamic lift , which requires the lateral movement of at least some part of the aircraft through the surrounding air mass some things that fly do not generate propulsive thrust through the air , for example , the flying squirrel however most other birds and all powered aircraft need a source of propulsion to climb the only groups of flying and gliding animals are birds , insects , and bats , while many groups have evolved gliding bats are the only mammals capable of sustaining level flight ( see bat flight ) flying frogs use greatly enlarged webbed feet for a similar purpose , and there are flying lizards which fold out their mobile ribs into a pair of flat gliding surfaces chrysopelea also use mobile ribs to flatten their body into an aerodynamic shape , with a back and forth motion much the same as they use on the ground the largest birds , the ostrich and the emu , are earthbound flightless birds , as were the now-extinct dodos and the phorusrhacids , which were the dominant predators of south america in the cenozoic era the non-flying penguins have wings adapted for use under water and use the same wing movements for swimming that most other birds use for flight among living animals that fly , the wandering albatross has the greatest wingspan , up to ; the great bustard has the greatest weight , topping at insect flight makes use of either of two basic aerodynamic models : creating a leading edge vortex , found in most insects , and using clap and fling , found in very small insects such as thrips mechanical flight is the use of a machine to fly these machines include aircraft such as airplanes , gliders , helicopters , autogyros , airships , balloons , ornithopters as well as spacecraft supersonic flight is flight faster than the speed of sound hypersonic flight is very high speed flight where the heat generated by the compression of the air due to the motion through the air causes chemical changes to the air some things generate little or no lift and move only or mostly under the action of momentum , gravity , air drag and in some cases thrust this is termed ballistic flight essentially an extreme form of ballistic flight , spaceflight is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space spaceflight is used in space exploration , and also in commercial activities like space tourism and telecommunications satellite some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely , some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry , and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact in 2018 , researchers at massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) managed to fly an aeroplane with no moving parts , powered by an '' ionic wind '' also known as electroaerodynamic thrust george cayley studied flight scientifically in the first half of the 19th century , and in the second half of the 19th century otto lilienthal made over 200 gliding flights and was also one of the first to understand flight scientifically spaceflight , particularly human spaceflight became a reality in the 20th century following theoretical and practical breakthroughs by konstantin tsiolkovsky and robert h if an object has a lower density than air , then it is buoyant and is able to aerostat without expending energy a heavier than air craft , known as an aerodyne , includes flighted animals and insects , fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft the wind resistance caused by the craft moving through the air is called drag and is overcome by air propulsion except in the case of gliding finally , momentum dominates the flight of ballistic flying objects while common meanings of the word '' lift '' suggest that lift opposes gravity , aerodynamic lift can be in any direction flight dynamics is the science of air and space vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions vehicles that can fly can have different ways to takeoff and land conventional aircraft accelerate along the ground until sufficient lift is generated for takeoff , and reverse the process for landing the techniques used for navigation in the air will depend on whether the aircraft is flying under the visual flight rules ( vfr ) or the instrument flight rules ( ifr ) in the case of aircraft , air traffic is controlled by air traffic control systems

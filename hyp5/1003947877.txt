humans have managed to construct lighter-than-air vehicles that raise off the ground and fly , due to their buoyancy in air an aerostat is a system that remains aloft primarily through the use of buoyancy to give an aircraft the same overall density as air aerostats include free balloons , airships , and moored balloons by contrast , aerodynes primarily use aerodynamic lift , which requires the lateral movement of at least some part of the aircraft through the surrounding air mass . unpowered flight versus powered flight some things that fly do not generate propulsive thrust through the air , for example , the flying squirrel however most other birds and all powered aircraft need a source of propulsion to climb the only groups of flying and gliding animals are birds , insects , and bats , while many groups have evolved gliding bats are the only mammals capable of sustaining level flight ( see bat flight ) chrysopelea also use mobile ribs to flatten their body into an aerodynamic shape , with a back and forth motion much the same as they use on the ground flying fish can glide using enlarged wing-like fins , and have been observed soaring for hundreds of meters the longest recorded flight of a flying fish was 45 seconds the non-flying penguins have wings adapted for use under water and use the same wing movements for swimming that most other birds use for flight most small flightless birds are native to small islands , and lead a lifestyle where flight would offer little advantage another form of mechanical flight is para-sailing , where a parachute-like object is pulled by a boat an aircraft wing is sometimes called an airfoil , which is a device that creates lift when air flows across it supersonic flight is flight faster than the speed of sound hypersonic flight is achieved by reentering spacecraft such as the space shuttle and soyuz some things generate little or no lift and move only or mostly under the action of momentum , gravity , air drag and in some cases thrust essentially an extreme form of ballistic flight , spaceflight is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space spaceflight is used in space exploration , and also in commercial activities like space tourism and telecommunications satellite a spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch , which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of the earth many human cultures have built devices that fly , from the earliest projectiles such as stones and spears , '' archytas of tar entum the sputnik 1 was in 1957 , and yuri gagarin was carried aboard the first manned orbital spaceflight in 1961 a heavier than air craft , known as an aerodyne , includes flighted animals and insects , fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft because the craft is heavier than air , it must generate lift to overcome its weight the wind resistance caused by the craft moving through the air is called drag and is overcome by air propulsion except in the case of gliding some vehicles also use thrust for flight , for example rockets and harrier jump jets finally , momentum dominates the flight of ballistic flying objects a fixed-wing aircraft generates forward thrust when air is pushed in the direction opposite to flight this can be done in several ways including by the spinning blades of a propeller , or a rotating fan pushing air out from the back of a jet engine , or by ejecting hot gases from a rocket engine reverse thrust can be generated to aid braking after landing by reversing the pitch of variable-pitch propeller blades , or using a thrust reversal on a jet engine the beginner 's guide to aeronautics - nasa glenn research center the lift coefficient cl is equal to the lift l divided by the ( density r times half the velocity v squared times the wing area a ) to create thrust so as to be able to gain height , and to push through the air to overcome the drag associated with lift all takes energy the techniques used for navigation in the air will depend on whether the aircraft is flying under the visual flight rules ( vfr ) or the instrument flight rules ( ifr ) aircraft engine controls are also considered as flight controls as they change speed

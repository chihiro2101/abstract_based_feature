humans have managed to construct lighter-than-air vehicles that raise off the ground and fly , due to their buoyancy in air an aerostat is a system that remains aloft primarily through the use of buoyancy to give an aircraft the same overall density as air an aerostat 's main structural component is its envelope , a lightweight skin that encloses a volume of lifting gas walker 2000 , p aerostats are so named because they use '' aerostatic '' lift , a buoyant force that does not require lateral movement through the surrounding air mass to effect a lifting force by contrast , aerodynes primarily use aerodynamic lift , which requires the lateral movement of at least some part of the aircraft through the surrounding air mass . unpowered flight versus powered flight some things that fly do not generate propulsive thrust through the air , for example , the flying squirrel some other things can exploit rising air to climb such as raptors ( when gliding ) and glider ( sailplane ) however most other birds and all powered aircraft need a source of propulsion to climb this is termed powered flight the only groups of flying and gliding animals are birds , insects , and bats , while many groups have evolved gliding the wings of the flying vertebrate groups are all based on the forelimbs , but differ significantly in structure ; those of insects are hypothesized to be highly modified versions of structures that form gills in most other groups of arthropods bats are the only mammals capable of sustaining level flight ( see bat flight ) flying frogs use greatly enlarged webbed feet for a similar purpose , and there are flying lizards which fold out their mobile ribs into a pair of flat gliding surfaces it is thought that this ability was chosen by natural selection because it was an effective means of escape from underwater predators the longest recorded flight of a flying fish was 45 seconds the non-flying penguins have wings adapted for use under water and use the same wing movements for swimming that most other birds use for flight most small flightless birds are native to small islands , and lead a lifestyle where flight would offer little advantage mechanical flight is the use of a machine to fly an aircraft wing is sometimes called an airfoil , which is a device that creates lift when air flows across it this shockwave takes quite a lot of energy to create and this makes supersonic flight generally less efficient than subsonic flight at about 85 % of the speed of sound some things generate little or no lift and move only or mostly under the action of momentum , gravity , air drag and in some cases thrust essentially an extreme form of ballistic flight , spaceflight is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space examples include ballistic missiles , orbital spaceflight , etc spaceflight is used in space exploration , and also in commercial activities like space tourism and telecommunications satellite a spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch , which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of the earth in 2018 , researchers at massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) managed to fly an aeroplane with no moving parts , powered by an '' ionic wind '' also known as electroaerodynamic thrust his work was replicated and extended by the wright brothers who made gliding flights and finally the first controlled and extended , manned powered flights spaceflight , particularly human spaceflight became a reality in the 20th century following theoretical and practical breakthroughs by konstantin tsiolkovsky and robert h a heavier than air craft , known as an aerodyne , includes flighted animals and insects , fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft the wind resistance caused by the craft moving through the air is called drag and is overcome by air propulsion except in the case of gliding a fixed-wing aircraft generates forward thrust when air is pushed in the direction opposite to flight because lift and drag are both aerodynamic forces , the ratio of lift to drag is an indication of the aerodynamic efficiency of the airplane if the thrust-to-weight ratio is greater than the local gravity strength ( expressed in gs ) , then flight can occur without any forward motion or any aerodynamic lift being required different objects and creatures capable of flight vary in the efficiency of their muscles , motors and how well this translates into forward thrust the techniques used for navigation in the air will depend on whether the aircraft is flying under the visual flight rules ( vfr ) or the instrument flight rules ( ifr )

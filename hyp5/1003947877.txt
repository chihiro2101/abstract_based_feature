humans have managed to construct lighter-than-air vehicles that raise off the ground and fly , due to their buoyancy in air an aerostat is a system that remains aloft primarily through the use of buoyancy to give an aircraft the same overall density as air an aerostat 's main structural component is its envelope , a lightweight skin that encloses a volume of lifting gas walker 2000 , p by contrast , aerodynes primarily use aerodynamic lift , which requires the lateral movement of at least some part of the aircraft through the surrounding air mass . unpowered flight versus powered flight some things that fly do not generate propulsive thrust through the air , for example , the flying squirrel the only groups of flying and gliding animals are birds , insects , and bats , while many groups have evolved gliding the wings of the flying vertebrate groups are all based on the forelimbs , but differ significantly in structure ; those of insects are hypothesized to be highly modified versions of structures that form gills in most other groups of arthropods flying frogs use greatly enlarged webbed feet for a similar purpose , and there are flying lizards which fold out their mobile ribs into a pair of flat gliding surfaces it is thought that this ability was chosen by natural selection because it was an effective means of escape from underwater predators the non-flying penguins have wings adapted for use under water and use the same wing movements for swimming that most other birds use for flight most small flightless birds are native to small islands , and lead a lifestyle where flight would offer little advantage among living animals that fly , the wandering albatross has the greatest wingspan , up to ; the great bustard has the greatest weight , topping at insect flight makes use of either of two basic aerodynamic models : creating a leading edge vortex , found in most insects , and using clap and fling , found in very small insects such as thrips these machines include aircraft such as airplanes , gliders , helicopters , autogyros , airships , balloons , ornithopters as well as spacecraft another form of mechanical flight is para-sailing , where a parachute-like object is pulled by a boat in an airplane , lift is created by the wings ; the shape of the wings of the airplane are designed specially for the type of flight desired there are different types of wings : tempered , semi-tempered , sweptback , rectangular and elliptical an aircraft wing is sometimes called an airfoil , which is a device that creates lift when air flows across it some things generate little or no lift and move only or mostly under the action of momentum , gravity , air drag and in some cases thrust essentially an extreme form of ballistic flight , spaceflight is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space a spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch , which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of the earth once in space , the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics in 2018 , researchers at massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) managed to fly an aeroplane with no moving parts , powered by an '' ionic wind '' also known as electroaerodynamic thrust george cayley studied flight scientifically in the first half of the 19th century , and in the second half of the 19th century otto lilienthal made over 200 gliding flights and was also one of the first to understand flight scientifically his work was replicated and extended by the wright brothers who made gliding flights and finally the first controlled and extended , manned powered flights the wind resistance caused by the craft moving through the air is called drag and is overcome by air propulsion except in the case of gliding finally , momentum dominates the flight of ballistic flying objects aerodynamic lift results when the wing causes the surrounding air to be deflected - the air then causes a force on the wing in the opposite direction , in accordance with newton 's third law of motion lift is commonly associated with the wing of an aircraft , although lift is also generated by rotors on rotorcraft ( which are effectively rotating wings , performing the same function without requiring that the aircraft move forward through the air ) while common meanings of the word '' lift '' suggest that lift opposes gravity , aerodynamic lift can be in any direction the lift/drag ratio is determined by dividing the lift coefficient by the drag coefficient , cl/cd any object that has a mass that is less than the mass of an equal volume of air will rise in air - in other words , any object less dense than air will rise to create thrust so as to be able to gain height , and to push through the air to overcome the drag associated with lift all takes energy a guidance system is a device or group of devices used in the navigation of a ship , aircraft , missile , rocket , satellite , or other moving object air safety is a term encompassing the theory , investigation and categorization of flight failures , and the prevention of such failures through regulation , education and training

humans have managed to construct lighter-than-air vehicles that raise off the ground and fly , due to their buoyancy in air an aerostat is a system that remains aloft primarily through the use of buoyancy to give an aircraft the same overall density as air to provide buoyancy , to which other components are attached aerostats are so named because they use '' aerostatic '' lift , a buoyant force that does not require lateral movement through the surrounding air mass to effect a lifting force by contrast , aerodynes primarily use aerodynamic lift , which requires the lateral movement of at least some part of the aircraft through the surrounding air mass . unpowered flight versus powered flight some things that fly do not generate propulsive thrust through the air , for example , the flying squirrel however most other birds and all powered aircraft need a source of propulsion to climb the only groups of flying and gliding animals are birds , insects , and bats , while many groups have evolved gliding the extinct pterosaurs , an order of reptiles contemporaneous with the dinosaurs , were also very successful flying animals bats are the only mammals capable of sustaining level flight ( see bat flight ) however , there are several flying squirrel which are able to glide from tree to tree using fleshy membranes between their limbs ; some can travel hundreds of meters in this way with very little loss in height mechanical flight is the use of a machine to fly these machines include aircraft such as airplanes , gliders , helicopters , autogyros , airships , balloons , ornithopters as well as spacecraft gliders are capable of unpowered flight another form of mechanical flight is para-sailing , where a parachute-like object is pulled by a boat in an airplane , lift is created by the wings ; the shape of the wings of the airplane are designed specially for the type of flight desired there are different types of wings : tempered , semi-tempered , sweptback , rectangular and elliptical an aircraft wing is sometimes called an airfoil , which is a device that creates lift when air flows across it supersonic flight is flight faster than the speed of sound supersonic flight is associated with the formation of shock waves that form a sonic boom that can be heard from the ground , bern , peter hypersonic flight is very high speed flight where the heat generated by the compression of the air due to the motion through the air causes chemical changes to the air hypersonic flight is achieved by reentering spacecraft such as the space shuttle and soyuz essentially an extreme form of ballistic flight , spaceflight is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space spaceflight is used in space exploration , and also in commercial activities like space tourism and telecommunications satellite once in space , the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics spaceflight , particularly human spaceflight became a reality in the 20th century following theoretical and practical breakthroughs by konstantin tsiolkovsky and robert h forces relevant to flight are '' four forces on an aeroplane aerodynamic lift results when the wing causes the surrounding air to be deflected - the air then causes a force on the wing in the opposite direction , in accordance with newton 's third law of motion while common meanings of the word '' lift '' suggest that lift opposes gravity , aerodynamic lift can be in any direction when an aircraft is cruising for example , lift does oppose gravity , but lift occurs at an angle when climbing , descending or banking air pressure acting up against an object in air is greater than the pressure above pushing down therefore , any 1-cubic-meter object in air is buoyed up with a force of 12 newtons if the thrust-to-weight ratio times the lift-to-drag ratio is greater than local gravity then takeoff using aerodynamic lift is possible to create thrust so as to be able to gain height , and to push through the air to overcome the drag associated with lift all takes energy in the case of aircraft , air traffic is controlled by air traffic control systems

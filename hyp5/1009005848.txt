in canada , there are four drug schedules : schedule 1 : requires a prescription for sale and is provided to the public by a licensed pharmacist schedule 2 : does not require a prescription but requires an assessment by a pharmacist prior to sale these drugs are kept in an area of the pharmacy where there is no public access and may also be referred to as '' behind-the-counter '' drugs schedule 3 : does not require a prescription but must be kept in an area under the supervision of a pharmacist these drugs are kept in an area of the retail outlet where self-selection is possible , but a pharmacist must be available to assist in the self-selection of medication if required unscheduled : does not require a prescription and may be sold in any retail outlet all medications other than schedule 1 may be considered an otc drug , as they do not require prescriptions for sale the drugs found in each schedule may vary from province to province in november 2016 , india 's drug consultative committee announced it was embarking on establishing a definition of drugs which could be dispensed without a prescription prior to this , the general assumption was that any drug which did not fall into a prescription schedule could be purchased without a prescription a drug that is uad can also be sold at drugstores , stores where no prescription can be filed and there is only a relatively small selection of popular drugs like painkillers and cough medicine drugs in the av category can be sold at supermarkets , gas stations , etc in the united states , the manufacture and sale of otc substances are regulated by the food and drug administration thus , an otc drug product is allowed to be marketed either ( 1 ) pursuant to an fda monograph or ( 2 ) pursuant to an nda for products that do not fit within a specific monograph there is also the possibility that certain otc drug products are marketed under the grandfathering provisions of the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act , but the fda has never formally acknowledged that any legitimate grandfathered otc drug exists the federal trade commission regulates advertising of otc products , in contrast to prescription drug advertising , which is regulated by the fda the 2020 cares act ( cares act ) includes reforms that modernize the way certain otc drugs are regulated in the united states such drugs are sold without a prescription but are subject to record-keeping rules and quantity and/or age restrictions , and they must be dispensed by a pharmacy general sales list ( gsl ) , available off the shelf with no pharmacy training required to sell ( so they can be sold anywhere , such as supermarkets ) over time , often 3â€“6 years , drugs that prove themselves safe and appropriate as prescription medicines may be switched from prescription to otc

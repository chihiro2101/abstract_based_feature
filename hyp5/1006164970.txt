money creation by commercial banks commercial banks play a role in the process of money creation , especially under the fractional-reserve banking system used throughout the world this is because the loan , when drawn on and spent , mostly finishes up as a deposit in the banking system ( an asset ) , which is counted as part of money supply ( and offsets the loan - which has yet to be repaid ) after putting aside a part of these deposits as mandated bank reserves , the balance is available for the making of further loans by the bank in the money supply statistics , central bank money is mb while the commercial bank money is divided up into the m1-m3 components central banks can influence the money supply by open market operations they can increase the money supply by purchasing government securities , such as government bonds or treasury bills this increases the liquidity in the banking system by converting the illiquid securities of commercial banks into liquid deposits at the central bank in contrast , when the central bank '' tightens '' the money supply , it sells securities on the open market , drawing liquid funds out of the banking system in parallel , it increases or reduces the supply of loanable funds ( money ) and thereby the ability of private banks to issue new money through issuing debt the vast majority of funding sources used by private banks to create loans are not limited by bank reserves some economists argue that the money multiplier is a meaningless concept , because its relevance would require that the money supply be exogeny , i.e if central banks usually target the shortest-term interest rate ( as their policy instrument ) then this leads to the money supply being endogenous between 1995 and 2008 , the value of consumer loans has steadily increased out of proportion to bank reserves its different functions are associated with different empirical measures of the money supply it is a matter of perennial debate as to whether narrower or broader versions of the money supply have a more predictable link to nominal gdp aggregate reserves of depository institutions and the monetary base ( h.3 ) historical h.3 releases money stock measures ( h.6 ) u.s

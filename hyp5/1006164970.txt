commercial banks play a role in the process of money creation , especially under the fractional-reserve banking system used throughout the world in this system , credit is created whenever a bank gives out a new loan this is because the loan , when drawn on and spent , mostly finishes up as a deposit in the banking system ( an asset ) , which is counted as part of money supply ( and offsets the loan - which has yet to be repaid ) after putting aside a part of these deposits as mandated bank reserves , the balance is available for the making of further loans by the bank this process continues multiple times , and is called the multiplier effect in the money supply statistics , central bank money is mb while the commercial bank money is divided up into the m1-m3 components . a reserve requirement is a ratio a bank must maintain between deposit liabilities and reserves . open market operations by central banks central banks can influence the money supply by open market operations the prices of such securities fall as supply is increased , and interest rates rise in parallel , it increases or reduces the supply of loanable funds ( money ) and thereby the ability of private banks to issue new money through issuing debt the simple connection between monetary policy and monetary aggregates such as m1 and m2 changed in the 1970s as the reserve requirements on deposits started to fall with the emergence of money funds , which require no reserves the vast majority of funding sources used by private banks to create loans are not limited by bank reserves some economists argue that the money multiplier is a meaningless concept , because its relevance would require that the money supply be exogeny , i.e if central banks usually target the shortest-term interest rate ( as their policy instrument ) then this leads to the money supply being endogenous between 1995 and 2008 , the value of consumer loans has steadily increased out of proportion to bank reserves article in the new palgrave on money supply by milton friedman do all banks hold reserves , and , if so , where do they hold them ?

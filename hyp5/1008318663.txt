rugby 's position on a hill overlooking the avon , made it an ideal location for a defended dobunni watch settlement during the roman period the roman town of tripontium was established on the watling street roman road around north-east of what is now rugby , this was later abandoned when the romans left britain by the 13th century the name of the town was commonly spelt as rokeby before gradually

having a castle at the location of what is now regent place however , the nature of the 'castle ' is unknown , and it was possibly little more than a fortified manor house in any event the 'castle ' was short lived : it was probably constructed early in the reign of king stephen ( 1135â€“1154 ) during the period known as the anarchy , and demolished in around 1157 on the orders of king henry ii the earthworks for the castle were still clearly visible as late as the 19th century , but have since been built over rugby school was originally intended as a school for local boys , but by the 18th century it had acquired a national reputation and gradually became a mostly fee-paying private school , with most of its pupils coming from outside rugby the growth of rugby was slow , due in part to the nearby markets at dunchurch and hillmorton which were better positioned in terms of road traffic by the time of the first national census in 1801 , rugby had a population of 1,487 with 278 houses this growth was driven by parents who wished to send their boys to rugby school , but were unable to afford the boarding fees and so took up residence in rugby in 1840 the midland counties railway

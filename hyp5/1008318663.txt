early iron age settlement existed in the rugby area : the river avon formed a natural barrier between the dobunni and corieltauvi tribes , and it is likely that defended frontier settlements were set up on each side of the avon valley rugby 's position on a hill overlooking the avon , made it an ideal location for a defended dobunni watch settlement during the roman period the roman town of tripontium was established on the watling street roman road around north-east of what is now rugby , this was later abandoned when the romans left britain by the 13th century the name of the town was commonly spelt as rokeby before gradually evolving into the modern form by the 18th century in 1140 the first mention was made of st andrew 's church which was originally a chapel of the mother church at clifton-upon-dunsmore , until rugby was established as a parish in its own right in 1221 rugby obtained a charter to hold a market in 1255 , and soon developed into a small country market town according to one theory , the stones from the castle were later used to construct the west tower of st andrew 's church , which bears strong resemblance to a castle , and was probably intended for use in a defensive as well as a religious role rugby school was originally intended as a school for local boys , but by the 18th century it had acquired a national reputation and gradually became a mostly fee-paying private school , with most of its pupils coming from outside rugby later , in 1645 , rugby was strongly parliamentarian , and oliver cromwell and two regiments of roundhead soldiers stayed at rugby in april that year , two months before the battle of naseby , some to the east , in nearby northamptonshire the growth of rugby was slow , due in part to the nearby markets at dunchurch and hillmorton which were better positioned in terms of road traffic rugby 's importance and population increased more rapidly during the late 18th and early 19th century due to the growing national reputation of rugby school , which had moved from its original location at a ( now long vanished ) schoolhouse north of st andrew 's church , to its present location south of the town centre by 1750 by the time of the first national census in 1801 , rugby had a population of 1,487 with 278 houses this growth was driven by parents who wished to send their boys to rugby school , but were unable to afford the boarding fees and so took up residence in rugby in 1840 the midland counties railway made a junction with the l & br at rugby , which was followed by a junction with the trent valley railway in 1847 in the later half of the 19th century , rugby also developed some local industries : large-scale cement production began in the town in 1862 when the rugby cement was founded to take advantage of the locally available deposits of blue lias limestone a local board of health was established in rugby in 1848 , to provide the town with necessary infrastructure for its growth , such as paved roads , street lighting , clean drinking water and sewerage , this was converted into an urban district council in 1894 visionofbritain.org in 1974 the municipal borough was merged with the rugby rural district to form the present borough of rugby rugby is most famous for the invention of rugby football , which is played throughout the world in 1845 , three rugby school pupils produced the first written rules of the '' rugby style of game '' hughes later set up a colony in america for the younger sons of the english gentry , who could not inherit under the laws of primogeniture , naming the town rugby whittle is commemorated in rugby by a modern sculpture near the town hall dating from 2005 , made by stephen broadbent in the 19th century , rugby became famous for its once important railway junction which was the setting for charles dickens 's story mugby junction the town centre is mostly victorian and early 20th century , however a few much older buildings survive , along with some more modern developments until the 19th century , rugby 's urban area consisted of only market place , high street , sheep street , church street , north street and what is now lawrence sheriff street these streets still form the core of the town centre most of rugby sits around above sea level on an irregular shaped plateau which is situated between the valleys of the river avon and swift to the north , and the rains brook and river leam to the south the county boundary between warwickshire , northamptonshire and leicestershire to the east of rugby is defined by the a5 road ( the former watling street ) around east of rugby town centre the three counties meet at dow bridge ;

early iron age settlement existed in the rugby area : the river avon formed a natural barrier between the dobunni and corieltauvi tribes , and it is likely that defended frontier settlements were set up on each side of the avon valley rugby 's position on a hill overlooking the avon , made it an ideal location for a defended dobunni watch settlement during the roman period the roman town of tripontium was established on the watling street roman road around north-east of what is now rugby , this was later abandoned when the romans left britain by the 13th century the name of the town was commonly spelt as rokeby before gradually evolving into the modern form by the 18th century in 1140 the first mention was made of st andrew 's church which was originally a chapel of the mother church at clifton-upon-dunsmore , until rugby was established as a parish in its own right in 1221 rugby obtained a charter to hold a market in 1255 , and soon developed into a small country market town in the 12th century rugby was mentioned as having a castle at the location of what is now regent place in any event the 'castle ' was short lived : it was probably constructed early in the reign of king stephen ( 1135–1154 ) during the period known as the anarchy , and demolished in around 1157 on the orders of king henry ii rugby school was founded in 1567 with money left in the will of lawrence sheriff , a locally born man , who moved to london and became grocer to queen elizabeth i rugby school was originally intended as a school for local boys , but by the 18th century it had acquired a national reputation and gradually became a mostly fee-paying private school , with most of its pupils coming from outside rugby the growth of rugby was slow , due in part to the nearby markets at dunchurch and hillmorton which were better positioned in terms of road traffic rugby 's importance and population increased more rapidly during the late 18th and early 19th century due to the growing national reputation of rugby school , which had moved from its original location at a ( now long vanished ) schoolhouse north of st andrew 's church , to its present location south of the town centre by 1750 this growth was driven by parents who wished to send their boys to rugby school , but were unable to afford the boarding fees and so took up residence in rugby in 1840 the midland counties railway made a junction with the l & br at rugby , which was followed by a junction with the trent valley railway in 1847 the railways had a profound effect on the town , as the influx of railway workers and their families rapidly expanded the population in the later half of the 19th century , rugby also developed some local industries : large-scale cement production began in the town in 1862 when the rugby cement was founded to take advantage of the locally available deposits of blue lias limestone visionofbritain.org in 1974 the municipal borough was merged with the rugby rural district

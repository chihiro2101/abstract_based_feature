collins dictionary of the english language , london , 1986 , p.520 the sense is of a feudal estate in land falling-out of the possession by a tenant into the possession of the lord in feudal england , escheat referred to the situation where the tenant of a fee ( or '' fief '' ) died without an heir or committed a felony in the case of such demise of a tenant-in-chief , the fee reverted to the king 's demesne permanently , when it became once again a mere tenantless plot of land , but could be re-created as a fee by enfeoffment to another of the king 's followers where the deceased had been subinfeudated by a tenant-in-chief , the fee reverted temporarily to the crown for year and a day rule by right of seisin after which it escheated to the over-lord who had granted it to the deceased by enfeoffment the monarch thus became the sole '' owner '' of all the land in the kingdom , a position which persists to the present day escheat could also take place if a tenant was outlawed or convicted of a felony , when the king could exercise the ancient right of wasting the criminal 's land for a year and a day , after which the land would revert to the overlord ) since disavowal of a feudal bond was a felony , lords could escheat land from those who refused to perform their feudal services if a person had no heir to receive his lands under his will , or under the laws of intestacy , then any land he owned at death would escheat he is dead ) issued by the king 's chancery , to empanel a jury to hold an '' escheat roll '' to ascertain who the legal heir was , if any , and what was the extent of the land held the term is often now applied to the transfer of the title to a person 's property to the state when the person dies intestate without any other person capable of taking the property as heir the bankruptcy of the original owner means that the freehold is no longer the bankrupt 's legal property , and the disclaimer destroys the freehold estate , so that the land ceases to be owned by anyone and effectively escheats to become land held by the crown in demesne however , usually , in the example given above , the tenants of the flats , or their mortgagees would exercise their rights given by the insolvency act 1986 to have the freehold property transferred to them one consequence of the land registration act 1925 was that only estates in land ( freehold or leasehold ) could be registered land held directly by the crown , known as property in the '' royal demesne '' , is not held under any vestige feudal tenure ( the crown has no historical overlord other than , for brief periods , the papacy ) and there is therefore no estate to register thus , if property has escheated to a state but the original owner subsequently is found , escheatment is revoked and ownership of the property reverts to that original owner

collins dictionary of the english language , london , 1986 , p.520 the sense is of a feudal estate in land falling-out of the possession by a tenant into the possession of the lord in feudal england , escheat referred to the situation where the tenant of a fee ( or '' fief '' ) died without an heir or committed a felony in the case of such demise of a tenant-in-chief , the fee reverted to the king 's demesne permanently , when it became once again a mere tenantless plot of land , but could be re-created as a fee by enfeoffment to another of the king 's followers where the deceased had been subinfeudated by a tenant-in-chief , the fee reverted temporarily to the crown for year and a day rule by right of seisin after which it escheated to the over-lord who had granted it to the deceased by enfeoffment the monarch thus became the sole '' owner '' of all the land in the kingdom , a position which persists to the present day such tenures , even the highest one of '' feudal barony '' , never conferred ownership of land but merely ownership of rights over it , that is to say ownership of an estate in land escheat could also take place if a tenant was outlawed or convicted of a felony , when the king could exercise the ancient right of wasting the criminal 's land for a year and a day , after which the land would revert to the overlord ) since disavowal of a feudal bond was a felony , lords could escheat land from those who refused to perform their feudal services & nbsp ; 355–366 , cambridge university press , 1968 thus , under english common law , there were two main ways an escheat could happen : a person 's lands escheated to the immediate overlord if he was convicted of a felony ( but not treason , in that event the land was forfeited to the crown ) in most common-law jurisdictions , this type of escheat has been abolished outright , for example in the united states under article 3 § 3 of the united states constitution , which states that attainders for treason do not give rise to posthumous forfeiture , or '' corruption of blood '' if a person had no heir to receive his lands under his will , or under the laws of intestacy , then any land he owned at death would escheat most common-law jurisdictions have abolished the concept of feudal land tenure of property , and so the concept of escheat has lost something of its meaning although such escheated property is owned by the crown , it is not part of the crown estate , unless the crown ( through the crown estate commissioners ) 'completes ' the escheat , by taking steps to exert rights as owner land held directly by the crown , known as property in the '' royal demesne '' , is not held under any vestige feudal tenure ( the crown has no historical overlord other than , for brief periods , the papacy ) and there is therefore no estate to register each of the united states has laws regulating escheatment , with holding periods typically ranging around five years

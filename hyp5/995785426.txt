collins dictionary of the english language , london , 1986 , p.520 the sense is of a feudal estate in land falling-out of the possession by a tenant into the possession of the lord in feudal england , escheat referred to the situation where the tenant of a fee ( or '' fief '' ) died without an heir or committed a felony where the deceased had been subinfeudated by a tenant-in-chief , the fee reverted temporarily to the crown for year and a day rule by right of seisin after which it escheated to the over-lord who had granted it to the deceased by enfeoffment from the time of henry iii , the monarchy took particular interest in escheat as a source of revenue at the norman conquest of england , all the land of england was claimed as the personal possession of william the conqueror under allodial title such tenures , even the highest one of '' feudal barony '' , never conferred ownership of land but merely ownership of rights over it , that is to say ownership of an estate in land this was the basic operation of an escheat ( excadere ) , a failure of heirs ) since disavowal of a feudal bond was a felony , lords could escheat land from those who refused to perform their feudal services & nbsp ; 355â€“366 , cambridge university press , 1968 thus , under english common law , there were two main ways an escheat could happen : a person 's lands escheated to the immediate overlord if he was convicted of a felony ( but not treason , in that event the land was forfeited to the crown ) most common-law jurisdictions have abolished the concept of feudal land tenure of property , and so the concept of escheat has lost something of its meaning the term is often now applied to the transfer of the title to a person 's property to the state when the person dies intestate without any other person capable of taking the property as heir usually this means that all the property held by that person is 'vested in ' ( transferred to ) the official receiver or trustee in bankruptcy although such escheated property is owned by the crown , it is not part of the crown estate , unless the crown ( through the crown estate commissioners ) 'completes ' the escheat , by taking steps to exert rights as owner land held directly by the crown , known as property in the '' royal demesne '' , is not held under any vestige feudal tenure ( the crown has no historical overlord other than , for brief periods , the papacy ) and there is therefore no estate to register thus , if property has escheated to a state but the original owner subsequently is found , escheatment is revoked and ownership of the property reverts to that original owner

color television had been studied even before commercial broadcasting became common , but it was not until the late 1940s that the problem was seriously considered at the time , a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red , green and blue signals ( rgb ) , broadcast in succession most experimental systems broadcast entire frames in sequence , with a colored filter ( or '' gel '' ) that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube each frame encoded one color of the picture , and the wheel spun in sync with the signal so the correct gel was in front of the screen when that colored frame was being displayed because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors , all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets ( this is conceptually similar to a dlp based projection display where a single dlp device is used for all three color channels ) rca worked along different lines entirely , using the luminance-chrominance system first introduced by georges valensi in 1938 on a black and white television this extra information would be seen as a slight randomization of the image intensity , but the limited resolution of existing sets made this invisible in practice black and white tvs used a continuous signal and the tube could be coated with an even painting of phosphor with rca 's system , the color was changing continually along the line , which was far too fast for any sort of mechanical filter to follow rca was included in this group ; on 5 february 1940 they demonstrated a system using three conventional tubes combined to form a single image on a plate of glass , but the image was too dim to be useful his design , the telechrome , used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor covered plate in the center of the tube '' the world 's first high definition colour television system '' , baird television a similar project was the geer tube , which used a similar arrangement of guns aimed at the back of a single plate covered with small three-sided phosphor covered pyramids in spite of their best efforts , the wide electron beams simply could not focus tightly enough to hit the individual dots , at least over the entirety of the screen a more practical system would use a single gun at the back of the tube , firing at a single multi-color screen on the front another contender was general electric 's penetron , which used three stacked layers of phosphor and attempted to change the power of the electron beam to write to the correct one until 1968 , every color television sold used the rca shadow mask concept , in the spring of that year sony introduced their first trinitron sets the guns , arranged in a delta pattern at the back of the tube , were aimed to focus on the metal plate and scanned it as normal however , when the beams passed a hole they would continue to the phosphor in front of the plate but the real genius of the idea is that the beams approached the metal plate from different angles after being cut off by the mask , the beams would continue forward at slightly different angles , hitting the screens at slightly different locations to produce an image as bright as the one on a traditional b & w television , the electron guns in this hypothetical shadow mask system would have to be five times more powerful the amount of power deposited on the color screen was so great that thermal loading was a serious problem if you consider the beam when it is sweeping across the middle area of the screen , the beams from the individual guns are each traveling the same distance and meet the holes in the mask at equal angles in the corners of the screen some beams have to travel farther and all of them meet the hole at a different angle than at the middle of the screen during development , rca was not sure that they could make the shadow mask system work what is a shadow mask ?

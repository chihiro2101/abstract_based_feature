at the time , a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red , green and blue signals ( rgb ) , broadcast in succession most experimental systems broadcast entire frames in sequence , with a colored filter ( or '' gel '' ) that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube each frame encoded one color of the picture , and the wheel spun in sync with the signal so the correct gel was in front of the screen when that colored frame was being displayed ( this is conceptually similar to a dlp based projection display where a single dlp device is used for all three color channels ) rca worked along different lines entirely , using the luminance-chrominance system first introduced by georges valensi in 1938 this system did not directly encode or transmit the rgb signals ; instead it combined these colors into one overall brightness figure , called the '' luminance '' the remaining color information was separately encoded into the signal as a high-frequency modulation to produce a composite video signal black and white tvs used a continuous signal and the tube could be coated with an even painting of phosphor john logie baird , who made the first public color television broadcast using a semi-mechanical system on 4 february 1938 , was already making progress on an all-electronic version his design , the telechrome , used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor covered plate in the center of the tube in spite of their best efforts , the wide electron beams simply could not focus tightly enough to hit the individual dots , at least over the entirety of the screen moreover , most of these devices were unwieldy ; the arrangement of the electron guns around the outside of the screen resulted in a very large display with considerable '' dead space '' a more practical system would use a single gun at the back of the tube , firing at a single multi-color screen on the front another contender was general electric 's penetron , which used three stacked layers of phosphor and attempted to change the power of the electron beam to write to the correct one until 1968 , every color television sold used the rca shadow mask concept , in the spring of that year sony introduced their first trinitron sets in 1938 german inventor werner flechsig first patented ( received 1941 , france ) the seemingly simple concept of placing a sheet of metal just behind the front of the tube , and punching small holes in it the holes would be used to focus the beam just before it hit the screen however , when the beams passed a hole they would continue to the phosphor in front of the plate normally the beams from the three guns would each be large enough to light up all three colored dots on the screen the mask helped by mechanically attenuating the beam to a small size just before it hit the screen after being cut off by the mask , the beams would continue forward at slightly different angles , hitting the screens at slightly different locations by painting the colored dots at the correct locations on the screen , and leaving some room between them to avoid interactions , the guns would be guaranteed to hit the right colored spot to produce an image as bright as the one on a traditional b & w television , the electron guns in this hypothetical shadow mask system would have to be five times more powerful furthermore , the geometry required complex systems to keep the three beams properly positioned across the screen during development , rca was not sure that they could make the shadow mask system work bimetal springs may be used in crts used in tvs to compensate for warping that occurs as the electron beam heats the shadow mask , causing thermal expansion the process was used a total of three times , once for each color what is a shadow mask ?

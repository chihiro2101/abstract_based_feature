color television had been studied even before commercial broadcasting became common , but it was not until the late 1940s that the problem was seriously considered at the time , a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red , green and blue signals ( rgb ) , broadcast in succession most experimental systems broadcast entire frames in sequence , with a colored filter ( or '' gel '' ) that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube each frame encoded one color of the picture , and the wheel spun in sync with the signal so the correct gel was in front of the screen when that colored frame was being displayed because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors , all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets ed reitan , '' cbs field sequential color system '' , 24 august 1997 ( this is conceptually similar to a dlp based projection display where a single dlp device is used for all three color channels ) rca worked along different lines entirely , using the luminance-chrominance system first introduced by georges valensi in 1938 this closely matched the black and white signal of existing broadcasts , allowing the picture to be displayed on black and white televisions on a black and white television this extra information would be seen as a slight randomization of the image intensity , but the limited resolution of existing sets made this invisible in practice on color sets the extra information would be detected , filtered out and added to the luminance to re-create the original rgb for display ed reitan , '' rca dot sequential color system '' , 28 august 1997 although rca 's system had enormous benefits , it had not been successfully developed because it was difficult to produce the display tubes black and white tvs used a continuous signal and the tube could be coated with an even painting of phosphor john logie baird , who made the first public color television broadcast using a semi-mechanical system on 4 february 1938 , was already making progress on an all-electronic version '' the world 's first high definition colour television system '' , baird television in spite of their best efforts , the wide electron beams simply could not focus tightly enough to hit the individual dots , at least over the entirety of the screen a more practical system would use a single gun at the back of the tube , firing at a single multi-color screen on the front until 1968 , every color television sold used the rca shadow mask concept , in the spring of that year sony introduced their first trinitron sets the holes would be used to focus the beam just before it hit the screen over a period of only a few months , several prototype color televisions using the system were produced for much of the time during the scan , the beams would hit the back of the plate and be stopped however , when the beams passed a hole they would continue to the phosphor in front of the plate normally the beams from the three guns would each be large enough to light up all three colored dots on the screen to produce an image as bright as the one on a traditional b & w television , the electron guns in this hypothetical shadow mask system would have to be five times more powerful at the time there were very few television sets in use in the united states , so the stakeholder groups quickly settled on the idea of using uhf for a new , incompatible , color format rca had , by this time , produced experimental shadow mask sets that were an enormous leap in quality over any competitors better focusing systems , especially automatic systems that meant the set spent more time closer to perfect focus , allowed the dots to grow larger on the screen

color television had been studied even before commercial broadcasting became common , but it was not until the late 1940s that the problem was seriously considered at the time , a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red , green and blue signals ( rgb ) , broadcast in succession most experimental systems broadcast entire frames in sequence , with a colored filter ( or '' gel '' ) that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube each frame encoded one color of the picture , and the wheel spun in sync with the signal so the correct gel was in front of the screen when that colored frame was being displayed another problem was that the mechanical filter made them flicker unless very high refresh rates were used ( this is conceptually similar to a dlp based projection display where a single dlp device is used for all three color channels this system did not directly encode or transmit the rgb signals ; instead it combined these colors into one overall brightness figure , called the '' luminance '' black and white tvs used a continuous signal and the tube could be coated with an even painting of phosphor focusing the right signal on each of these tiny spots was beyond the capability of electron guns of the era his design , the telechrome , used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor covered plate in the center of the tube a similar project was the geer tube , which used a similar arrangement of guns aimed at the back of a single plate covered with small three-sided phosphor covered pyramids however , all of these projects had problems with colors bleeding from one phosphor to another moreover , most of these devices were unwieldy ; the arrangement of the electron guns around the outside of the screen resulted in a very large display with considerable '' dead space '' a more practical system would use a single gun at the back of the tube , firing at a single multi-color screen on the front another contender was general electric 's penetron , which used three stacked layers of phosphor and attempted to change the power of the electron beam to write to the correct one until 1968 , every color television sold used the rca shadow mask concept , in the spring of that year sony introduced their first trinitron sets in 1938 german inventor werner flechsig first patented ( received 1941 , france ) the seemingly simple concept of placing a sheet of metal just behind the front of the tube , and punching small holes in it the holes would be used to focus the beam just before it hit the screen independently , al schroeder at rca worked on a similar arrangement , but using three electron guns as well the guns , arranged in a delta pattern at the back of the tube , were aimed to focus on the metal plate and scanned it as normal however , when the beams passed a hole they would continue to the phosphor in front of the plate in this way , the plate ensured that the beams were perfectly aligned with the colored phosphor dots normally the beams from the three guns would each be large enough to light up all three colored dots on the screen the spread was a function of the distance between the guns at the back of the tube , and the distance between the mask plate and the screen by painting the colored dots at the correct locations on the screen , and leaving some room between them to avoid interactions , the guns would be guaranteed to hit the right colored spot as the beam swept the mask , the vast majority of its energy was deposited on the mask , not the screen in front of it the porta-color used both of these advances and re-arranged the guns to lie beside each other instead of in a triangle , allowing the dots to be extended vertically into slots that covered much more of the screen surface what is a shadow mask ?

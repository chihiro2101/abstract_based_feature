color television had been studied even before commercial broadcasting became common , but it was not until the late 1940s that the problem was seriously considered at the time , a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red , green and blue signals ( rgb ) , broadcast in succession each frame encoded one color of the picture , and the wheel spun in sync with the signal so the correct gel was in front of the screen when that colored frame was being displayed because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors , all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets although rca 's system had enormous benefits , it had not been successfully developed because it was difficult to produce the display tubes black and white tvs used a continuous signal and the tube could be coated with an even painting of phosphor instead , the phosphor had to be broken down into a discrete pattern of colored spots focusing the right signal on each of these tiny spots was beyond the capability of electron guns of the era a number of major companies continued to work with separate color '' channels '' with various ways to re-combine the image his design , the telechrome , used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor covered plate in the center of the tube '' the world 's first high definition colour television system '' , baird television however , all of these projects had problems with colors bleeding from one phosphor to another in spite of their best efforts , the wide electron beams simply could not focus tightly enough to hit the individual dots , at least over the entirety of the screen moreover , most of these devices were unwieldy ; the arrangement of the electron guns around the outside of the screen resulted in a very large display with considerable '' dead space '' a more practical system would use a single gun at the back of the tube , firing at a single multi-color screen on the front it would be years before any of these systems made their way into production but it was rca 's success with the shadow mask that dampened most of these efforts the holes would be used to focus the beam just before it hit the screen the guns , arranged in a delta pattern at the back of the tube , were aimed to focus on the metal plate and scanned it as normal in this way , the plate ensured that the beams were perfectly aligned with the colored phosphor dots normally the beams from the three guns would each be large enough to light up all three colored dots on the screen but the real genius of the idea is that the beams approached the metal plate from different angles after being cut off by the mask , the beams would continue forward at slightly different angles , hitting the screens at slightly different locations the spread was a function of the distance between the guns at the back of the tube , and the distance between the mask plate and the screen by painting the colored dots at the correct locations on the screen , and leaving some room between them to avoid interactions , the guns would be guaranteed to hit the right colored spot as the beam swept the mask , the vast majority of its energy was deposited on the mask , not the screen in front of it furthermore , the geometry required complex systems to keep the three beams properly positioned across the screen what is a shadow mask ?

color television had been studied even before commercial broadcasting became common , but it was not until the late 1940s that the problem was seriously considered at the time , a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red , green and blue signals ( rgb ) , broadcast in succession most experimental systems broadcast entire frames in sequence , with a colored filter ( or '' gel '' ) that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube each frame encoded one color of the picture , and the wheel spun in sync with the signal so the correct gel was in front of the screen when that colored frame was being displayed because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors , all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets on color sets the extra information would be detected , filtered out and added to the luminance to re-create the original rgb for display ed reitan , '' rca dot sequential color system '' , 28 august 1997 rca was included in this group ; on 5 february 1940 they demonstrated a system using three conventional tubes combined to form a single image on a plate of glass , but the image was too dim to be useful john logie baird , who made the first public color television broadcast using a semi-mechanical system on 4 february 1938 , was already making progress on an all-electronic version his design , the telechrome , used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor covered plate in the center of the tube a similar project was the geer tube , which used a similar arrangement of guns aimed at the back of a single plate covered with small three-sided phosphor covered pyramids in spite of their best efforts , the wide electron beams simply could not focus tightly enough to hit the individual dots , at least over the entirety of the screen moreover , most of these devices were unwieldy ; the arrangement of the electron guns around the outside of the screen resulted in a very large display with considerable '' dead space '' a more practical system would use a single gun at the back of the tube , firing at a single multi-color screen on the front but it was rca 's success with the shadow mask that dampened most of these efforts the holes would be used to focus the beam just before it hit the screen normally the beams from the three guns would each be large enough to light up all three colored dots on the screen the mask helped by mechanically attenuating the beam to a small size just before it hit the screen the spread was a function of the distance between the guns at the back of the tube , and the distance between the mask plate and the screen by painting the colored dots at the correct locations on the screen , and leaving some room between them to avoid interactions , the guns would be guaranteed to hit the right colored spot additionally , the dots on the screen were deliberately separated in order to avoid being hit by the wrong gun , so much of the screen was black the energy the shadow mask absorbs from the electron gun in normal operation causes it to heat up and expand , which leads to blurred or discolored images ( see doming ) furthermore , the geometry required complex systems to keep the three beams properly positioned across the screen however , in the midst of the meetings , rca announced their efforts on compatible color , but too late to influence the proceedings doming problems due to thermal expansion of the shadow mask were solved in several ways the use of rare-earth phosphors produced brighter colors and allowed the strength of the electron beams to be reduced slightly the porta-color used both of these advances and re-arranged the guns to lie beside each other instead of in a triangle , allowing the dots to be extended vertically into slots that covered much more of the screen surface what is a shadow mask ?

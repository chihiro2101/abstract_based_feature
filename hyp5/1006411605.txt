ōkōchi , apparently impressed with tanaka 's energy and ambition , agreed to help the young man start a drafting office in tokyo japan did not have a state qualification for architects at the time ; tanaka would have a role in creating the licensing system for architects later in his career the drafting office only kept tanaka busy for two years : he was drafted into the army in 1939 and sent to manchuria , where he served as an enlisted clerk in the morioka cavalry , reaching the rank of superior private ( jōtōhei ) in march 1940 back in japan , tanaka ended up at the sakamoto civil engineering firm , looking for office space to restart his drafting business in 1942 , tanaka took over the sakamoto company and renamed it tanaka civil engineering and construction industries he soon had two children : a son named masanori tanaka in 1942 ( died 1948 ) , and a daughter named makiko tanaka in 1944 in 1946 , he moved from tokyo to niigata to prepare his first bid for a diet seat : he worked around the election laws of the time by buying buildings throughout the district and placing large '' tanaka '' signs on them tanaka only captured 4 % of the vote in the general election he took his diet seat that year as a member of the new democratic party ( minshuto ) in the diet , he became friends with former prime minister kijūrō shidehara and joined shidehara 's dōshi club yoshida and the dlp dropped most of their ties with tanaka , removed him from his official party posts , and refused to fund his next re-election bid despite this , tanaka announced his candidacy for the 1949 general election , and was released from prison in january after securing bail the tokyo district court found tanaka guilty in 1950 , and tanaka responded by filing an appeal that year 's election was also the first in which he was supported by billionaire capitalist kenji osano , who would remain one of tanaka 's most loyal supporters to the end tanaka 's most important support base , however , was a group called etsuzankai ( 越山会 , literally '' niigata mountain association '' ) during the 1950s , tanaka brought etsuzankai members to his residence in tokyo by bus , met with each of them individually , and then provided them with tours of the diet and imperial palace this practice made etsuzankai the most tightly knit political organization in japanese history , and it also furthered tanaka 's increasingly gangster-like image when nobusuke kishi became prime minister in 1957 , tanaka was given his first cabinet post , minister of posts and telecommunications under ikeda 's cabinet , tanaka became chairman of the policy affairs research council , and eventually minister of finance tanaka 's term as minister of finance saw some of the highest economic growth in japanese history '' despite the scandal , tanaka made a record showing in the 1967 general election , and satō re-appointed him as secretary general , moving fukuda to the post of finance minister in 1971 , satō gave tanaka another important stepping stone to taking over the government : ministry of international trade and industry the tanaka faction supported takeo miki 's '' clean government '' bid to become prime minister , and tanaka once again became a rank-and-file diet member in 1982 , yasuhiro nakasone was elected president of the ldp ( and therefore as prime minister ) amid allegations from opponents that he would be under tanaka 's control nakasone placed six members of the tanaka faction on his 1984 cabinet , including future prime minister noboru takeshita meanwhile , despite nikaido 's efforts , by july 1987 the takeshita faction counted 113 of the 143 tanaka faction members , while only thirteen supported nikaido makiko tanaka , who was not associated with etsuzankai , was elected to her father 's old seat in niigata in the 1993 election and became foreign minister in the koizumi cabinet in 2001

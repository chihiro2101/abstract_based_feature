in the mid-19th century , karl marx presented a schema of stages of historical development , by introducing the notion that human nature was not constant and was not determinative of the nature of the social system ; on the contrary , he made it a principle that human behavior was a function of the social and economic system in which it occurred marx based his theory of economic development on the premise of developing economic systems ; specifically , over the course of history superior economic systems would replace inferior ones the state of the world converged with the state of the evidence to make almost inevitable the development of a more '' modern '' framework for the analysis of substantive economic issues thorstein veblen ( 1898 ) coined the term '' evolutionary economics '' in english the '' veblenian dichotomy '' was a specialized variant of the '' instrumental theory of value '' due to john dewey , with whom veblen was to make contact briefly at the university of chicago alchian 1950 , '' uncertainty , evolution and economic theory , '' journal of political economy , 58 ( 3 ) , pp kenneth boulding was one of the advocates of the evolutionary methods in social science , as is evident from kenneth boulding 's evolutionary perspective more narrowly the works jack downie jack downie ( 1958 ) the competitive process and edith penrose e joseph schumpeter , who lived in the first half of the 20th century , was the author of the book the theory of economic development ( 1911 , transl it is important to note that for the word development he used in his native language , the german word '' entwicklung '' , which can be translated as development or evolution a disruptive technology ) disturbs the normal flow of economic life , because it forces some of the already existing technologies and means of production to lose their positions within the economy one of the major contributions to the emerging field of evolutionary economics has been the publication of an evolutionary theory of economic change by richard nelson and sidney g these authors have focused mostly on the issue of changes in technology and routines , suggesting a framework for their analysis if the change occurs constantly in the economy , then some kind of evolutionary process must be in action , and there has been a proposal that this process is darwinism in nature the change of environment causes the change of competitiveness of different economic entities and systems in recent years , evolutionary models have been used to assist decision making in applied settings and find solutions to problems such as optimal product design and service portfolio diversification oded galor and omer ozak examine the evolution of time preference in the course of human history specifically , they argue that in the early stages of development , risk-tolerant entrepreneurial traits generated an evolutionary advantage , and the rise in the prevalence of this trait amplified the pace of the growth process a different approach is to apply evolutionary psychology principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in rational choice theory

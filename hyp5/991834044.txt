in the mid-19th century , karl marx presented a schema of stages of historical development , by introducing the notion that human nature was not constant and was not determinative of the nature of the social system ; on the contrary , he made it a principle that human behavior was a function of the social and economic system in which it occurred marx based his theory of economic development on the premise of developing economic systems ; specifically , over the course of history superior economic systems would replace inferior ones the state of the world converged with the state of the evidence to make almost inevitable the development of a more '' modern '' framework for the analysis of substantive economic issues thorstein veblen ( 1898 ) coined the term '' evolutionary economics '' in english he began his career in the midst of this period of intellectual ferment , and as a young scholar came into direct contact with some of the leading figures of the various movements that were to shape the style and substance of social sciences into the next century and beyond the '' ceremonial '' was related to the past , and conformed to and supported the tribal legends ; '' instrumental '' was oriented toward the technological imperative to judge value by the ability to control future consequences the '' veblenian dichotomy '' was a specialized variant of the '' instrumental theory of value '' due to john dewey , with whom veblen was to make contact briefly at the university of chicago the ceremonial patterns of activity are not bound to any past , but to one that generated a specific set of advantages and prejudices that underlie the current institutions a seminal article by armen alchian ( 1950 ) argued for adaptive success of firms faced with uncertainty and incomplete information replacing profit maximization as an appropriate modeling assumption kenneth boulding was one of the advocates of the evolutionary methods in social science , as is evident from kenneth boulding 's evolutionary perspective penrose ( 1959 ) the theory of the growth of the firm offer many insights for those thinking about evolution at the level of the firm in an industry one of the major contributions to the emerging field of evolutionary economics has been the publication of an evolutionary theory of economic change by richard nelson and sidney g if the change occurs constantly in the economy , then some kind of evolutionary process must be in action , and there has been a proposal that this process is darwinism in nature the authors introduced the term 'steady change ' to highlight the evolutionary aspect of economic processes and contrast it with the concept of 'steady state ' popular in classical economics more recently , nelson , dosi , pyka , malerba , winter and other scholars have been proposing an update of the state-of-art in evolutionary economics economic processes , as part of life processes , are intrinsically evolutionary oded galor and omer moav advanced the hypothesis that evolutionary forces had a significant role in the transition of the world economy from stagnation to growth , highlighting the persistent effects that historical and prehistorical conditions have had on the evolution of the composition of human characteristics during the development process a different approach is to apply evolutionary psychology principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in rational choice theory humans , therefore , may have poor intuitive understanding the benefits of free trade ( causing calls for protectionism ) , the value of capital goods ( making the labor theory of value appealing ) , and may intuitively undervalue the benefits of technological development

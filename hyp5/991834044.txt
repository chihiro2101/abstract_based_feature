marx based his theory of economic development on the premise of developing economic systems ; specifically , over the course of history superior economic systems would replace inferior ones inferior systems were beset by internal contradictions and inefficiency that make them impossible to survive over the long term the state of the world converged with the state of the evidence to make almost inevitable the development of a more '' modern '' framework for the analysis of substantive economic issues thorstein veblen ( 1898 ) coined the term '' evolutionary economics '' in english a seminal article by armen alchian ( 1950 ) argued for adaptive success of firms faced with uncertainty and incomplete information replacing profit maximization as an appropriate modeling assumption alchian 1950 , '' uncertainty , evolution and economic theory , '' journal of political economy , 58 ( 3 ) , pp kenneth boulding was one of the advocates of the evolutionary methods in social science , as is evident from kenneth boulding 's evolutionary perspective penrose ( 1959 ) the theory of the growth of the firm offer many insights for those thinking about evolution at the level of the firm in an industry it is important to note that for the word development he used in his native language , the german word '' entwicklung '' , which can be translated as development or evolution he based his theory on the assumption of usual macroeconomic equilibrium , which is something like '' the normal mode of economic affairs '' a disruptive technology ) disturbs the normal flow of economic life , because it forces some of the already existing technologies and means of production to lose their positions within the economy one of the major contributions to the emerging field of evolutionary economics has been the publication of an evolutionary theory of economic change by richard nelson and sidney g if the change occurs constantly in the economy , then some kind of evolutionary process must be in action , and there has been a proposal that this process is darwinism in nature the authors introduced the term 'steady change ' to highlight the evolutionary aspect of economic processes and contrast it with the concept of 'steady state ' popular in classical economics more recently , nelson , dosi , pyka , malerba , winter and other scholars have been proposing an update of the state-of-art in evolutionary economics from the evolutionary equation that describe life processes , an analytical formula on the main factors of economic processes , such as fixed cost and variable cost , can be derived in recent years , evolutionary models have been used to assist decision making in applied settings and find solutions to problems such as optimal product design and service portfolio diversification a different approach is to apply evolutionary psychology principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in rational choice theory a basic economic concept such as utility may be better explained in terms of a set of biological preferences that maximized evolutionary fitness in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one

in the mid-19th century , karl marx presented a schema of stages of historical development , by introducing the notion that human nature was not constant and was not determinative of the nature of the social system ; on the contrary , he made it a principle that human behavior was a function of the social and economic system in which it occurred marx based his theory of economic development on the premise of developing economic systems ; specifically , over the course of history superior economic systems would replace inferior ones the state of the world converged with the state of the evidence to make almost inevitable the development of a more '' modern '' framework for the analysis of substantive economic issues the '' ceremonial '' was related to the past , and conformed to and supported the tribal legends ; '' instrumental '' was oriented toward the technological imperative to judge value by the ability to control future consequences the '' veblenian dichotomy '' was a specialized variant of the '' instrumental theory of value '' due to john dewey , with whom veblen was to make contact briefly at the university of chicago a seminal article by armen alchian ( 1950 ) argued for adaptive success of firms faced with uncertainty and incomplete information replacing profit maximization as an appropriate modeling assumption alchian 1950 , '' uncertainty , evolution and economic theory , '' journal of political economy , 58 ( 3 ) , pp penrose ( 1959 ) the theory of the growth of the firm offer many insights for those thinking about evolution at the level of the firm in an industry joseph schumpeter , who lived in the first half of the 20th century , was the author of the book the theory of economic development ( 1911 , transl it is important to note that for the word development he used in his native language , the german word '' entwicklung '' , which can be translated as development or evolution one of the major contributions to the emerging field of evolutionary economics has been the publication of an evolutionary theory of economic change by richard nelson and sidney g if the change occurs constantly in the economy , then some kind of evolutionary process must be in action , and there has been a proposal that this process is darwinism in nature steady change their approach can be compared and contrasted with the population ecology or organizational ecology approach in sociology : see douma & schreuder ( 2013 , chapter 11 ) the role of evolutionary forces in the process of economic development over the course of human history has been explored in the past few decades specifically , they argue that in the early stages of development , risk-tolerant entrepreneurial traits generated an evolutionary advantage , and the rise in the prevalence of this trait amplified the pace of the growth process a different approach is to apply evolutionary psychology principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in rational choice theory loss aversion may be explained as being rational when living at subsistence level where a reduction of resources may have meant death and it thus may have been rational to place a greater value on losses than on gains people are sometimes more cooperative and altruistic than predicted by economic theory which may be explained by mechanisms such as reciprocal altruism and group selection for cooperative behavior frequency-dependent selection may explain why people differ in characteristics such as cooperative behavior with cheating becoming an increasingly less successful strategy as the numbers of cheaters increase

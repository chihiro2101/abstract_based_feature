the original operating system was apollo 's own product called aegis , which was later renamed to domain/os the aegis and domain/os system offered advanced features for the time , for example an object oriented filesystem , network transparency , diskless booting , a graphical user interface and , in domain/os , interoperability with bsd , system v and posix the dn300 and later dn330 were designed as integrated units with system and monitor in one unit and fit easily on a desk the atr was generally the best choice , since it was extremely scalable ; whilst the ethernet of the time suffered serious performance loss as extra machines were added to the network , this was not true of atr , which could easily have over a hundred machines on one network the network orientation of the systems , together with the atr functionality , made it easy and practicable to boot and run diskless node using another machine 's os in principle , as many machines could be booted from one host as it could cope with ; in practice , four diskless machines from one host was about the limit provided the correct machine-specific software was installed on the host ( again , very easy ) , any type of machine could be booted from any other ( one complication being that a dn10000 could only be booted from another dn10000 or a 68k-based system which had '' cmpexe '' compound executables installed ) some systems could have the graphics card removed so that they could be used as a servers ; in such a case the keyboard and mouse were automatically ignored , and the system accessed either across the network , or via a dumb terminal plugged into the machine 's serial port right the dn300 and later dn330 were integrated desktop systems not much bigger than the included monitor a typical system could have between 2 & nbsp ; mib and 32 & nbsp ; mib of memory , a 76 & nbsp ; mb , 150 & nbsp ; mb or 330 & nbsp ; mb ( very occasionally 660 & nbsp ; mb ) hard disk , and 32-bit 68020 or 68030 processor running at 12 & nbsp ; mhz to 33 & nbsp ; mhz , depending on model an apollo token ring network card could also be placed in a standard pc and network drivers allowed it to connect to a server running a pc smb ( server message block ) file server they later released the dn2500 series workstation , a cheap alternative to the dn3x00/4x00 series , and later still the hp 9000 series 400 line , which could run either hp 's own flavor of unix , hp-ux , or domain/os

the western blot is extensively used in biochemistry for the qualitative detection of single proteins and protein-modifications ( such as post-translational modifications ) it is used as a general method to identify the presence of a specific single protein within a complex mixture of proteins a semi-quantitative estimation of a protein can be derived from the size and color intensity of a protein band on the blot membrane in addition , applying a dilution series of a purified protein of known concentrations can be used to allow a more precise estimate of protein concentration the western blot is routinely used for verification of protein production after cloning the confirmatory hiv test employs a western blot to detect anti-hiv antibody in a human serum sample the stained bands then indicate the proteins to which the patient 's serum contains antibody an evaluation of the western blot 's ability to detect antibodies against f a western blot can also be used as a confirmatory test for hepatitis b infection and hsv-2 ( herpes type 2 ) infection further applications of the western blot technique include its use by the world anti-doping agency ( wada ) the western blot technique was used during the 2014 fifa world cup in the anti-doping campaign for that event sds-page is generally used for the denaturing electrophoretic separation of proteins this ensures that proteins are separated based on size and prevents proteases ( enzymes that break down proteins ) from degrading samples following electrophoretic separation , the proteins are transferred to a membrane ( typically nitrocellulose or pvdf ) , where they are blocked with milk ( or other blocking agents ) to prevent non-specific antibody binding , and then stained with antibody specific to the target protein lastly , the membrane will be stained with a secondary antibody that recognizes the first antibody staining , which can then be used for detection by a variety of methods the nature of the separation depends on the treatment of the sample and the nature of the gel by far the most common type of gel electrophoresis employs polyacrylamide gels and buffers loaded with sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) smaller proteins migrate faster through this mesh , and the proteins are thus separated according to size ( usually measured in kilodaltons , kda ) protein bands can then be compared to the ladder bands , allowing estimation of the protein 's molecular weight the proteins move from within the gel onto the membrane while maintaining the organization they had within the gel as a result of either transfer process , the proteins are exposed on a thin membrane layer for detection protein binding is based upon hydrophobic interactions , as well as charged interactions between the membrane and protein in order to avoid noise of signal , total protein staining should be performed before blocking of the membrane since the membrane has been chosen for its ability to bind protein and as both antibodies and the target are proteins , steps must be taken to prevent the interactions between the membrane and the antibody used for detection of the target protein the primary antibody are generated when a host species or immune cell culture is exposed to the protein of interest ( or a part thereof ) after rinsing the membrane to remove unbound primary antibody , the membrane is exposed to another antibody known as the secondary antibody this requires a probe antibody which both recognizes the protein of interest and contains a detectable label , probes which are often available for known protein tags chemiluminescent detection methods depend on incubation of the western blot with a substrate that will luminesce when exposed to the reporter on the secondary antibody the use of film for western blot detection is slowly disappearing because of non linearity of the image ( non accurate quantification )

the western blot is extensively used in biochemistry for the qualitative detection of single proteins and protein-modifications ( such as post-translational modifications ) it is used as a general method to identify the presence of a specific single protein within a complex mixture of proteins a semi-quantitative estimation of a protein can be derived from the size and color intensity of a protein band on the blot membrane in addition , applying a dilution series of a purified protein of known concentrations can be used to allow a more precise estimate of protein concentration the western blot is routinely used for verification of protein production after cloning it is also used in medical diagnostics , e.g the confirmatory hiv test employs a western blot to detect anti-hiv antibody in a human serum sample then , the serum to be tested is applied in the primary antibody incubation step ; free antibody is washed away , and a secondary anti-human antibody linked to an enzyme signal is added the stained bands then indicate the proteins to which the patient 's serum contains antibody an evaluation of the western blot 's ability to detect antibodies against f a western blot can also be used as a confirmatory test for hepatitis b infection and hsv-2 ( herpes type 2 ) infection further applications of the western blot technique include its use by the world anti-doping agency ( wada ) recent research utilizing the western blot technique showed an improved detection of epo in blood and urine based on novel velum sar precast horizontal gels optimized for routine analysis sds is generally used as a buffer ( as well as in the gel ) in order to give all proteins present a uniform negative charge , since proteins can be positively , negatively , or neutrally charged following electrophoretic separation , the proteins are transferred to a membrane ( typically nitrocellulose or pvdf ) , where they are blocked with milk ( or other blocking agents ) to prevent non-specific antibody binding , and then stained with antibody specific to the target protein lastly , the membrane will be stained with a secondary antibody that recognizes the first antibody staining , which can then be used for detection by a variety of methods separation of proteins may be by isoelectric point ( pi ) , molecular weight , electric charge , or a combination of these factors smaller proteins migrate faster through this mesh , and the proteins are thus separated according to size ( usually measured in kilodaltons , kda ) the concentration of acrylamide determines the resolution of the gel – the greater the acrylamide concentration , the better the resolution of lower molecular weight proteins proteins are separated according to isoelectric point ( ph at which they have a neutral net charge ) in the first dimension , and according to their molecular weight in the second dimension to make the proteins accessible to antibody detection , they are moved from within the gel onto a membrane made of nitrocellulose ( nc ) or polyvinylidene difluoride ( pvdf ) electroblotting uses an electric current to pull the negatively charged proteins from the gel towards the positively charged anode , and into the pvdf or nc membrane thus , when the antibody is added , it can not bind to the membrane , and therefore the only available binding site is the specific target protein to allow detection of the target protein , the secondary antibody is commonly linked to biotin or a reporter enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase a third alternative is to use a radioactive label rather than an enzyme coupled to the secondary antibody , such as labeling an antibody-binding protein like staphylococcus protein a or streptavidin with a radioactive isotope of iodine this requires a probe antibody which both recognizes the protein of interest and contains a detectable label , probes which are often available for known protein tags the colorimetric detection method depends on incubation of the western blot with a substrate that reacts with the reporter enzyme ( such as peroxidase ) that is bound to the secondary antibody one major difference between nitrocellulose and pvdf membranes relates to the ability of each to support '' stripping '' antibodies off and reusing the membrane for subsequent antibody probes a major advantage of this method is that it often distinguishes between different isoforms of a particular protein – e.g

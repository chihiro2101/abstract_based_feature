the western blot is extensively used in biochemistry for the qualitative detection of single proteins and protein-modifications ( such as post-translational modifications ) it is used as a general method to identify the presence of a specific single protein within a complex mixture of proteins a semi-quantitative estimation of a protein can be derived from the size and color intensity of a protein band on the blot membrane in addition , applying a dilution series of a purified protein of known concentrations can be used to allow a more precise estimate of protein concentration the western blot is routinely used for verification of protein production after cloning the confirmatory hiv test employs a western blot to detect anti-hiv antibody in a human serum sample proteins from known hiv-infected cells are separated and blotted on a membrane as above then , the serum to be tested is applied in the primary antibody incubation step ; free antibody is washed away , and a secondary anti-human antibody linked to an enzyme signal is added an evaluation of the western blot 's ability to detect antibodies against f further applications of the western blot technique include its use by the world anti-doping agency ( wada ) the western blot technique was used during the 2014 fifa world cup in the anti-doping campaign for that event lastly , the membrane will be stained with a secondary antibody that recognizes the first antibody staining , which can then be used for detection by a variety of methods the proteins of the sample are separated using gel electrophoresis separation of proteins may be by isoelectric point ( pi ) , molecular weight , electric charge , or a combination of these factors the lower the acrylamide concentration , the better the resolution of higher molecular weight proteins when voltage is applied along the gel , proteins migrate through it at different speeds dependent on their size it is also possible to use a two-dimensional gel which spreads the proteins from a single sample out in two dimensions to make the proteins accessible to antibody detection , they are moved from within the gel onto a membrane made of nitrocellulose ( nc ) or polyvinylidene difluoride ( pvdf ) in practice this method is not commonly used due to the lengthy procedure time since the membrane has been chosen for its ability to bind protein and as both antibodies and the target are proteins , steps must be taken to prevent the interactions between the membrane and the antibody used for detection of the target protein although non-fat dry milk is preferred due to its availability , an appropriate blocking solution is needed as not all proteins in milk are compatible with all the detection bands during the detection process the membrane is '' probed '' for the protein of interest with a modified antibody which is linked to a reporter enzyme ; when exposed to an appropriate substrate , this enzyme drives a colorimetric reaction and produces a color the primary antibody are generated when a host species or immune cell culture is exposed to the protein of interest ( or a part thereof ) normally , this is part of the immune response , whereas here they are harvested and used as sensitive and specific detection tools that bind the protein directly after rinsing the membrane to remove unbound primary antibody , the membrane is exposed to another antibody known as the secondary antibody the secondary antibody recognises and binds to the species-specific portion of the primary antibody after the unbound probes are washed away , the western blot is ready for detection of the probes that are labeled and bound to the protein of interest ( see western blot normalization ) chemiluminescent detection methods depend on incubation of the western blot with a substrate that will luminesce when exposed to the reporter on the secondary antibody

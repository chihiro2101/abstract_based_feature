the western blot is extensively used in biochemistry for the qualitative detection of single proteins and protein-modifications ( such as post-translational modifications ) it is used as a general method to identify the presence of a specific single protein within a complex mixture of proteins a semi-quantitative estimation of a protein can be derived from the size and color intensity of a protein band on the blot membrane the western blot is routinely used for verification of protein production after cloning the confirmatory hiv test employs a western blot to detect anti-hiv antibody in a human serum sample then , the serum to be tested is applied in the primary antibody incubation step ; free antibody is washed away , and a secondary anti-human antibody linked to an enzyme signal is added an evaluation of the western blot 's ability to detect antibodies against f a western blot can also be used as a confirmatory test for hepatitis b infection and hsv-2 ( herpes type 2 ) infection in veterinary medicine , a western blot is sometimes used to confirm fiv+ status in cats further applications of the western blot technique include its use by the world anti-doping agency ( wada ) the western blot technique was used during the 2014 fifa world cup in the anti-doping campaign for that event recent research utilizing the western blot technique showed an improved detection of epo in blood and urine based on novel velum sar precast horizontal gels optimized for routine analysis sds-page is generally used for the denaturing electrophoretic separation of proteins following electrophoretic separation , the proteins are transferred to a membrane ( typically nitrocellulose or pvdf ) , where they are blocked with milk ( or other blocking agents ) to prevent non-specific antibody binding , and then stained with antibody specific to the target protein lastly , the membrane will be stained with a secondary antibody that recognizes the first antibody staining , which can then be used for detection by a variety of methods the gel electrophoresis step is included in western blot analysis to resolve the issue of the cross-reactivity of antibodies the concentration of acrylamide determines the resolution of the gel â€“ the greater the acrylamide concentration , the better the resolution of lower molecular weight proteins protein bands can then be compared to the ladder bands , allowing estimation of the protein 's molecular weight to make the proteins accessible to antibody detection , they are moved from within the gel onto a membrane made of nitrocellulose ( nc ) or polyvinylidene difluoride ( pvdf ) the most commonly used method for transferring the proteins is called electroblotting electroblotting uses an electric current to pull the negatively charged proteins from the gel towards the positively charged anode , and into the pvdf or nc membrane since the membrane has been chosen for its ability to bind protein and as both antibodies and the target are proteins , steps must be taken to prevent the interactions between the membrane and the antibody used for detection of the target protein thus , when the antibody is added , it can not bind to the membrane , and therefore the only available binding site is the specific target protein the antibody solution is incubated with the membrane for anywhere from 30 minutes to overnight after rinsing the membrane to remove unbound primary antibody , the membrane is exposed to another antibody known as the secondary antibody a third alternative is to use a radioactive label rather than an enzyme coupled to the secondary antibody , such as labeling an antibody-binding protein like staphylococcus protein a or streptavidin with a radioactive isotope of iodine chemiluminescent detection methods depend on incubation of the western blot with a substrate that will luminesce when exposed to the reporter on the secondary antibody newer software allows further data analysis such as molecular weight analysis if appropriate standards are used one major difference between nitrocellulose and pvdf membranes relates to the ability of each to support '' stripping '' antibodies off and reusing the membrane for subsequent antibody probes

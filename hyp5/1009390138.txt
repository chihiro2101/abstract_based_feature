the western blot is extensively used in biochemistry for the qualitative detection of single proteins and protein-modifications ( such as post-translational modifications ) it is used as a general method to identify the presence of a specific single protein within a complex mixture of proteins a semi-quantitative estimation of a protein can be derived from the size and color intensity of a protein band on the blot membrane in addition , applying a dilution series of a purified protein of known concentrations can be used to allow a more precise estimate of protein concentration the western blot is routinely used for verification of protein production after cloning the confirmatory hiv test employs a western blot to detect anti-hiv antibody in a human serum sample proteins from known hiv-infected cells are separated and blotted on a membrane as above then , the serum to be tested is applied in the primary antibody incubation step ; free antibody is washed away , and a secondary anti-human antibody linked to an enzyme signal is added an evaluation of the western blot 's ability to detect antibodies against f in veterinary medicine , a western blot is sometimes used to confirm fiv+ status in cats further applications of the western blot technique include its use by the world anti-doping agency ( wada ) the western blot method is composed of a gel electrophoresis to separate native proteins by 3-d structure or denatured proteins by the length of the polypeptide , followed by an electrophoretic transfer onto a membrane ( mostly pvdf or nitrocellulose ) and an immunostaining procedure to visualize a certain protein on the blot membrane sds is generally used as a buffer ( as well as in the gel ) in order to give all proteins present a uniform negative charge , since proteins can be positively , negatively , or neutrally charged this type of electrophoresis is known as sds-page ( sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ) prior to electrophoresis , protein samples are often boiled to denature the proteins present this ensures that proteins are separated based on size and prevents proteases ( enzymes that break down proteins ) from degrading samples following electrophoretic separation , the proteins are transferred to a membrane ( typically nitrocellulose or pvdf ) , where they are blocked with milk ( or other blocking agents ) to prevent non-specific antibody binding , and then stained with antibody specific to the target protein lastly , the membrane will be stained with a secondary antibody that recognizes the first antibody staining , which can then be used for detection by a variety of methods the proteins of the sample are separated using gel electrophoresis proteins are separated according to isoelectric point ( ph at which they have a neutral net charge ) in the first dimension , and according to their molecular weight in the second dimension to make the proteins accessible to antibody detection , they are moved from within the gel onto a membrane made of nitrocellulose ( nc ) or polyvinylidene difluoride ( pvdf ) the most commonly used method for transferring the proteins is called electroblotting as a result of either transfer process , the proteins are exposed on a thin membrane layer for detection normalization with the so-called '' loading control '' was based on immunostaining of housekeeping proteins in the classical procedure , but is heading toward total protein staining recently , due to multiple benefits since the membrane has been chosen for its ability to bind protein and as both antibodies and the target are proteins , steps must be taken to prevent the interactions between the membrane and the antibody used for detection of the target protein thus , when the antibody is added , it can not bind to the membrane , and therefore the only available binding site is the specific target protein to allow detection of the target protein , the secondary antibody is commonly linked to biotin or a reporter enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) is commonly linked to secondary antibodies to allow the detection of the target protein by chemiluminescence the colorimetric detection method depends on incubation of the western blot with a substrate that reacts with the reporter enzyme ( such as peroxidase ) that is bound to the secondary antibody

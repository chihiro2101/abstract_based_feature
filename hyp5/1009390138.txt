the western blot is extensively used in biochemistry for the qualitative detection of single proteins and protein-modifications ( such as post-translational modifications ) it is used as a general method to identify the presence of a specific single protein within a complex mixture of proteins a semi-quantitative estimation of a protein can be derived from the size and color intensity of a protein band on the blot membrane in addition , applying a dilution series of a purified protein of known concentrations can be used to allow a more precise estimate of protein concentration the western blot is routinely used for verification of protein production after cloning the confirmatory hiv test employs a western blot to detect anti-hiv antibody in a human serum sample proteins from known hiv-infected cells are separated and blotted on a membrane as above prior to electrophoresis , protein samples are often boiled to denature the proteins present lastly , the membrane will be stained with a secondary antibody that recognizes the first antibody staining , which can then be used for detection by a variety of methods the proteins of the sample are separated using gel electrophoresis separation of proteins may be by isoelectric point ( pi ) , molecular weight , electric charge , or a combination of these factors the concentration of acrylamide determines the resolution of the gel â€“ the greater the acrylamide concentration , the better the resolution of lower molecular weight proteins the lower the acrylamide concentration , the better the resolution of higher molecular weight proteins proteins travel only in one dimension along the gel for most blots it is also possible to use a two-dimensional gel which spreads the proteins from a single sample out in two dimensions proteins are separated according to isoelectric point ( ph at which they have a neutral net charge ) in the first dimension , and according to their molecular weight in the second dimension as a result of either transfer process , the proteins are exposed on a thin membrane layer for detection protein binding is based upon hydrophobic interactions , as well as charged interactions between the membrane and protein in order to avoid noise of signal , total protein staining should be performed before blocking of the membrane the protein in the dilute solution attaches to the membrane in all places where the target proteins have not attached for a variety of reasons , this traditionally takes place in a two-step process , although there are now one-step detection methods available for certain applications after rinsing the membrane to remove unbound primary antibody , the membrane is exposed to another antibody known as the secondary antibody the secondary antibody recognises and binds to the species-specific portion of the primary antibody horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) is commonly linked to secondary antibodies to allow the detection of the target protein by chemiluminescence another method of secondary antibody detection utilizes a near-infrared ( nir ) fluorophore-linked antibody this requires a probe antibody which both recognizes the protein of interest and contains a detectable label , probes which are often available for known protein tags chemiluminescent detection methods depend on incubation of the western blot with a substrate that will luminesce when exposed to the reporter on the secondary antibody for example , in the first dimension , polypeptides are separated according to isoelectric point , while in the second dimension , polypeptides are separated according to their molecular weight in principle , this method allows for the separation of all cellular proteins on a single large gel

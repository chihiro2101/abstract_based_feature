gold was born on may 22 , 1920 in vienna , austria to max gold , a wealthy jewish industrialist ( pre-war ) who ran one of austria 's largest mining and metal fabrication companies , and german former actress josefine martin following the economic downfall of the european mining industry in the late 1920s , max gold moved his family to berlin , where he had taken a job as director of a metal trading company . following the start of nazi leader adolf hitler 's anti-jewish campaigns in 1933 , gold and his family left germany because of his father 's heritage it was on the first night of internment , at an army barracks in bury st edmunds , that he met his future collaborator and close friend , hermann bondi after graduating with a pass ( ordinary ) degree in june 1942 , gold worked briefly as an agricultural labourer and lumberjack in northern england before joining bondi and fred hoyle on naval research into radar ground clutter near dunsfold , surrey gold determined how landing craft could use radar to navigate to the appropriate landing spot on d-day and also discovered that the german navy had fitted snorkels to its u-boats , making them operable underwater while still taking in air from above the surface immediately after the war , hoyle and bondi returned to cambridge , while gold stayed with naval research until 1947 pumphrey , a zoologist at the cambridge zoology laboratory who had served as the deputy head of radar naval research during the war , to study the effect of resonance on the human ear in 1948 , gold hypothesized that the ear operates by '' regeneration '' , in that electromechanical action occurs when electrical energy is used to counteract the effects of damping gold began discussing problems in physics with hoyle and bondi again , centering on the issues over redshift and hubble 's law this led the three to all start questioning the big bang theory originally proposed by georges lemaître in 1931 and later advanced by george gamow , which suggested that the universe expanded from an extremely dense and hot state and continues to expand today weart , gold believed that there was reason to think that the creation of matter was '' done all the time and then none of the problems about fleeting moments arise . two papers were published in 1948 discussing the '' steady-state theory '' as an alternative to the big bang : one by gold and bondi , the other by hoyle in their seminal paper , gold and bondi asserted that although the universe is expanding , it nevertheless does not change its look over time ; it has no beginning and no end gold and bondi also stated that the issues with time scale that had plagued other cosmological theories – such as the discrepancy between the age of the universe as calculated by hubble and dating of radioactive decay in terrestrial rocks – were absent for the steady-state theory for most cosmologists , the refutation of the steady-state theory came with the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1965 , which was predicted by the big bang theory . stephen hawking said that the fact that microwave radiation had been found , and that it was thought to be left over from the big bang , was '' the final nail in the coffin of the steady-state theory bondi conceded that the theory had been disproved , but hoyle and gold remained unconvinced for a number of years gold even supported hoyle 's modified steady-state theory , however , by 1998 , he started to express some doubts about the theory , but maintained that despite its faults , the theory helped improve understanding regarding the origin of the universe gold suggested a '' garbage theory '' for the origin of life which was an accidental panspermia ; the theory says that life on earth might have spread from a pile of waste products accidentally dumped on earth long ago by extraterrestrials however , a year later , a distant source was identified and gold announced at an international astronomical union meeting in rome that his theory had been proven . gold left cambridge in 1952 to become the chief assistant to astronomer royal harold spencer jones at the royal greenwich observatory in herstmonceux , sussex , england while there , gold attracted some controversy by suggesting that the interaction between charged particles from the sun with the earth 's magnetic field in creating magnetic storms in the upper atmosphere was an example of a collisionless shock wave . the theory was widely disputed , until american scientists in 1957 discovered that gold 's theory held up to mathematical scrutiny by conducting a simulation using a shock tube . at the time , there was only one other faculty member in the department gold would serve as director of the center for radiophysics and space research until 1981 , establishing cornell as a leading hub of scientific research he also coined the term '' magnetosphere '' in his paper '' motions in the magnetosphere of the earth '' to describe '' the region above the ionosphere in which the magnetic field of the earth has a dominant control over the motions of gas and fast charged particles . in 1960 , gold collaborated again with fred hoyle to show that magnetic energy fueled solar flares and that flares were triggered when opposite magnetic loops interact and release their stored energy gold argued that due to their strong magnetic fields and high rotational speed , pulsars would emit radiation similar to a rotating beacon from the 1950s , gold served as a consultant to nasa and held positions on several national space committees , including the president 's science advisory committee , as the united states tried to develop its space program . gold initially suggested that astronauts would sink into the dust , but upon later analysis of impact craters and electrostatic fields , he determined that the astronauts ' boots would sink only three centimeters into the moon 's surface in any case , nasa sent unmanned surveyors to analyze the conditions on the surface of the moon gold said the findings were consistent with his hypothesis , noting that '' in one area as they walked along , they sank in between five and eight inches '' however , gold received little credit for his correct prediction , and was even criticized for his original prediction of a deep layer of lunar dust gold had also contributed to the apollo program by designing the apollo lunar surface closeup camera ( alscc ) ( a kind of stereo camera ) used on the apollo 11 , 12 , and 14 missions nasa officials warned gold that if he testified his concerns before congress , his research proposals would lose their support from nasa gold engaged in thorough discussion on the matter with fred hoyle , who even included a chapter on '' gold 's pore theory '' in his 1955 book frontiers in astronomy in a 1992 paper , '' the deep , hot biosphere '' published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , gold first suggested that microbial life is widespread in the porosity of the crust of the earth , down to depths of several kilometers , where rising temperatures finally set a limit in short , gold said about the origin of natural hydrocarbons ( petroleum and natural gas ) : hydrocarbons are not biology reworked by geology ( as the traditional view would hold ) , but rather geology reworked by biology . in his foreword to gold 's book the deep hot biosphere , theoretical physicist freeman dyson stated , '' gold 's theories are always original , always important , usually controversial – and usually right

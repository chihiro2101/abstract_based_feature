gold was born on may 22 , 1920 in vienna , austria to max gold , a wealthy jewish industrialist ( pre-war ) who ran one of austria 's largest mining and metal fabrication companies , and german former actress josefine martin gold entered trinity college , cambridge in 1939 and began studying mechanical sciences . in may 1940 , just as hitler was commencing his advance in belgium and france , gold was sent into internment as an enemy alien by the british government gold spent most of his nearly 15 months of internment in a camp in canada , after which he returned to england and reentered cambridge university , where he abandoned his study of mechanical sciences for physics after graduating with a pass ( ordinary ) degree in june 1942 , gold worked briefly as an agricultural labourer and lumberjack in northern england before joining bondi and fred hoyle on naval research into radar ground clutter near dunsfold , surrey the three men would spend their off-duty hours in '' intense and wide-ranging scientific discussion '' on topics such as cosmology , mathematics and astrophysics immediately after the war , hoyle and bondi returned to cambridge , while gold stayed with naval research until 1947 in 1948 , gold hypothesized that the ear operates by '' regeneration '' , in that electromechanical action occurs when electrical energy is used to counteract the effects of damping . although gold won a prize fellowship from trinity college for his thesis on the regeneration and obtained a junior lectureship at the cavendish laboratory , his theory was widely ignored by ear specialists and physiologists , such as future nobel prize winner georg von békésy , who did not believe the cochlea operated under a feedback system . in the 1970s , researchers discovered that gold 's hypothesis had been correct – the ear contained microscopic hair cells that operated on a feedback mechanism to generate resonance this led the three to all start questioning the big bang theory originally proposed by georges lemaître in 1931 and later advanced by george gamow , which suggested that the universe expanded from an extremely dense and hot state and continues to expand today in their seminal paper , gold and bondi asserted that although the universe is expanding , it nevertheless does not change its look over time ; it has no beginning and no end . they estimated that within the expanding universe , hydrogen atoms were being created out of a vacuum at a rate of one atom per cubic meter per 10 9 years gold and bondi also stated that the issues with time scale that had plagued other cosmological theories – such as the discrepancy between the age of the universe as calculated by hubble and dating of radioactive decay in terrestrial rocks – were absent for the steady-state theory . it was not until the 1960s that major problems with the steady-state theory began to emerge , when observations apparently supported the idea that the universe was in fact changing : quasars and radio galaxy were found only at large distances ( therefore existing only in the distant past ) , not in closer galaxies for most cosmologists , the refutation of the steady-state theory came with the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1965 , which was predicted by the big bang theory . stephen hawking said that the fact that microwave radiation had been found , and that it was thought to be left over from the big bang , was '' the final nail in the coffin of the steady-state theory gold even supported hoyle 's modified steady-state theory , however , by 1998 , he started to express some doubts about the theory , but maintained that despite its faults , the theory helped improve understanding regarding the origin of the universe gold suggested a '' garbage theory '' for the origin of life which was an accidental panspermia ; the theory says that life on earth might have spread from a pile of waste products accidentally dumped on earth long ago by extraterrestrials in 1951 , at a meeting of the royal astronomical society , gold proposed that the source of recent radio signals detected from space was outside the milky way galaxy , much to the derision of radio astronomer martin ryle and several mathematical cosmologists ryle would later take gold 's argument as proof of extragalactic evolution , claiming that it invalidated the steady-state theory . the theory was widely disputed , until american scientists in 1957 discovered that gold 's theory held up to mathematical scrutiny by conducting a simulation using a shock tube in 1959 , gold expanded on his previous prediction of a collisionless shock wave , arguing that solar flares would eject material into magnetic clouds to produce a shock front that would result in geomagnetic storms he also coined the term '' magnetosphere '' in his paper '' motions in the magnetosphere of the earth '' to describe '' the region above the ionosphere in which the magnetic field of the earth has a dominant control over the motions of gas and fast charged particles the source – which was termed '' pulsar '' – emitted beams of electromagnetic radiation at a very short and consistent interval however , gold 's theory became widely accepted following the discovery of a pulsar in the crab nebula using the arecibo radio telescope , opening the door for future advancements in solid-state physics and astronomy from the 1950s , gold served as a consultant to nasa and held positions on several national space committees , including the president 's science advisory committee , as the united states tried to develop its space program this led to the dust being jokingly referred to as '' gold dust '' or '' gold 's dust '' . gold initially suggested that astronauts would sink into the dust , but upon later analysis of impact craters and electrostatic fields , he determined that the astronauts ' boots would sink only three centimeters into the moon 's surface gold was ridiculed by fellow scientists , not only for his hypothesis , but for the approach he took in communicating nasa 's concerns to the american public ; in particular , some experts were infuriated with his usage of the term '' moon dust '' in reference to lunar regolith gold said the findings were consistent with his hypothesis , noting that '' in one area as they walked along , they sank in between five and eight inches '' however , gold received little credit for his correct prediction , and was even criticized for his original prediction of a deep layer of lunar dust nasa officials warned gold that if he testified his concerns before congress , his research proposals would lose their support from nasa fletcher , george low wrote that '' gold should realize that being funded by the government and nasa is a privilege , and that it would make little sense for us to fund him as long as his views are what they are now '' in a 1992 paper , '' the deep , hot biosphere '' published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , gold first suggested that microbial life is widespread in the porosity of the crust of the earth , down to depths of several kilometers , where rising temperatures finally set a limit ' '' gold also published a book of the same title , the deep hot biosphere , in 1999 , which expanded on the arguments in his 1992 paper and included speculations on the origin of life and on horizontal gene transfer '' ( dyson also delivered a eulogy at gold 's memorial service , a segment of which pertaining to the deep hot biosphere theory is posted on youtube ) following gold 's death , scientific discoveries amplified and also shifted understanding of the deep hot biosphere into what is now generally called deep biosphere in the journal nature , hermann bondi wrote '' tommy gold will long be remembered as a singular scientist who stepped into any field where he thought an option was being overlooked gold has been derided by geologists , such as harmon craig and john hunt , who are strongly opposed to gold 's abiogenic petroleum theory

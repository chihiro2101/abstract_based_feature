gold was born on may 22 , 1920 in vienna , austria to max gold , a wealthy jewish industrialist ( pre-war ) who ran one of austria 's largest mining and metal fabrication companies , and german former actress josefine martin following the economic downfall of the european mining industry in the late 1920s , max gold moved his family to berlin , where he had taken a job as director of a metal trading company . following the start of nazi leader adolf hitler 's anti-jewish campaigns in 1933 , gold and his family left germany because of his father 's heritage gold entered trinity college , cambridge in 1939 and began studying mechanical sciences it was on the first night of internment , at an army barracks in bury st edmunds , that he met his future collaborator and close friend , hermann bondi gold spent most of his nearly 15 months of internment in a camp in canada , after which he returned to england and reentered cambridge university , where he abandoned his study of mechanical sciences for physics the three men would spend their off-duty hours in '' intense and wide-ranging scientific discussion '' on topics such as cosmology , mathematics and astrophysics . within months , gold was placed in charge of constructing new radar systems immediately after the war , hoyle and bondi returned to cambridge , while gold stayed with naval research until 1947 he then began working at cambridge 's cavendish laboratory to help construct the world 's largest magnetron , a device invented by two british scientists in 1940 that generated intense microwaves for radar . in the 1970s , researchers discovered that gold 's hypothesis had been correct – the ear contained microscopic hair cells that operated on a feedback mechanism to generate resonance this led the three to all start questioning the big bang theory originally proposed by georges lemaître in 1931 and later advanced by george gamow , which suggested that the universe expanded from an extremely dense and hot state and continues to expand today weart , gold believed that there was reason to think that the creation of matter was '' done all the time and then none of the problems about fleeting moments arise . two papers were published in 1948 discussing the '' steady-state theory '' as an alternative to the big bang : one by gold and bondi , the other by hoyle in their seminal paper , gold and bondi asserted that although the universe is expanding , it nevertheless does not change its look over time ; it has no beginning and no end . they proposed the perfect cosmological principle as the underpinning of their theory , which held that the universe is homogeneous and isotropy in space and time on the large scale , they argued that there '' is nothing outstanding about any place in the universe , and that those differences which do exist are only of local significance ; that seen on a large scale the universe is homogeneous gold and bondi also stated that the issues with time scale that had plagued other cosmological theories – such as the discrepancy between the age of the universe as calculated by hubble and dating of radioactive decay in terrestrial rocks – were absent for the steady-state theory . stephen hawking said that the fact that microwave radiation had been found , and that it was thought to be left over from the big bang , was '' the final nail in the coffin of the steady-state theory gold even supported hoyle 's modified steady-state theory , however , by 1998 , he started to express some doubts about the theory , but maintained that despite its faults , the theory helped improve understanding regarding the origin of the universe gold suggested a '' garbage theory '' for the origin of life which was an accidental panspermia ; the theory says that life on earth might have spread from a pile of waste products accidentally dumped on earth long ago by extraterrestrials in 1951 , at a meeting of the royal astronomical society , gold proposed that the source of recent radio signals detected from space was outside the milky way galaxy , much to the derision of radio astronomer martin ryle and several mathematical cosmologists ryle would later take gold 's argument as proof of extragalactic evolution , claiming that it invalidated the steady-state theory while there , gold attracted some controversy by suggesting that the interaction between charged particles from the sun with the earth 's magnetic field in creating magnetic storms in the upper atmosphere was an example of a collisionless shock wave . the theory was widely disputed , until american scientists in 1957 discovered that gold 's theory held up to mathematical scrutiny by conducting a simulation using a shock tube gold resigned from the royal observatory following spencer-jones 's retirement and moved to the united states in 1956 , where he served as professor of astronomy ( 1957–1958 ) and robert wheeler wilson professor of applied astronomy ( 1958–1959 ) at harvard university gold would serve as director of the center for radiophysics and space research until 1981 , establishing cornell as a leading hub of scientific research during his tenure , gold hired famed astronomers carl sagan and frank drake , helped establish the world 's largest radio telescope at the arecibo observatory in puerto rico and the cornell-sydney university astronomy center with harry messel he also coined the term '' magnetosphere '' in his paper '' motions in the magnetosphere of the earth '' to describe '' the region above the ionosphere in which the magnetic field of the earth has a dominant control over the motions of gas and fast charged particles the source – which was termed '' pulsar '' – emitted beams of electromagnetic radiation at a very short and consistent interval from the 1950s , gold served as a consultant to nasa and held positions on several national space committees , including the president 's science advisory committee , as the united states tried to develop its space program . gold initially suggested that astronauts would sink into the dust , but upon later analysis of impact craters and electrostatic fields , he determined that the astronauts ' boots would sink only three centimeters into the moon 's surface gold said the findings were consistent with his hypothesis , noting that '' in one area as they walked along , they sank in between five and eight inches '' however , gold received little credit for his correct prediction , and was even criticized for his original prediction of a deep layer of lunar dust gold had also contributed to the apollo program by designing the apollo lunar surface closeup camera ( alscc ) ( a kind of stereo camera ) used on the apollo 11 , 12 , and 14 missions . gold theorized that since petroleum and its component hydrocarbons were present across the entire universe , there was no reason to believe '' that on earth they must be biological in origin '' gold began testing his theory in 1986 when , with the backing of a group of investors , vattenfall and the gas research institute , he commenced efforts to drill a deep borehole – named gravberg-1 – into the earth near lake siljan in search of abiogenic gas in the mantle it is my belief , based on fifty years of observation of gold as a friend and colleague , that the deep hot biosphere is all of the above : original , important , controversial — and right . astrophysicists geoffrey and margaret burbidge remarked that gold '' was one of the outstanding physicists of his time '' and that his '' versatility was unmatched '' gold has been derided by geologists , such as harmon craig and john hunt , who are strongly opposed to gold 's abiogenic petroleum theory

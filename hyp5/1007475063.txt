gold was born on may 22 , 1920 in vienna , austria to max gold , a wealthy jewish industrialist ( pre-war ) who ran one of austria 's largest mining and metal fabrication companies , and german former actress josefine martin following the economic downfall of the european mining industry in the late 1920s , max gold moved his family to berlin , where he had taken a job as director of a metal trading company . following the start of nazi leader adolf hitler 's anti-jewish campaigns in 1933 , gold and his family left germany because of his father 's heritage gold attended boarding school at the lyceum alpinum zuoz in zuoz , switzerland , where he quickly proved to be a clever , competitive and physically and mentally aggressive individual . gold finished his schooling at zuoz in 1938 , and fled with his family to england after the anschluss in early 1938 gold entered trinity college , cambridge in 1939 and began studying mechanical sciences . in may 1940 , just as hitler was commencing his advance in belgium and france , gold was sent into internment as an enemy alien by the british government gold spent most of his nearly 15 months of internment in a camp in canada , after which he returned to england and reentered cambridge university , where he abandoned his study of mechanical sciences for physics the three men would spend their off-duty hours in '' intense and wide-ranging scientific discussion '' on topics such as cosmology , mathematics and astrophysics gold determined how landing craft could use radar to navigate to the appropriate landing spot on d-day and also discovered that the german navy had fitted snorkels to its u-boats , making them operable underwater while still taking in air from above the surface he then began working at cambridge 's cavendish laboratory to help construct the world 's largest magnetron , a device invented by two british scientists in 1940 that generated intense microwaves for radar pumphrey , a zoologist at the cambridge zoology laboratory who had served as the deputy head of radar naval research during the war , to study the effect of resonance on the human ear in 1948 , gold hypothesized that the ear operates by '' regeneration '' , in that electromechanical action occurs when electrical energy is used to counteract the effects of damping . in the 1970s , researchers discovered that gold 's hypothesis had been correct – the ear contained microscopic hair cells that operated on a feedback mechanism to generate resonance gold began discussing problems in physics with hoyle and bondi again , centering on the issues over redshift and hubble 's law it can be just in a steady state with the expansion taking things apart as fast as new matter comes into being and condenses into new galaxies '' . two papers were published in 1948 discussing the '' steady-state theory '' as an alternative to the big bang : one by gold and bondi , the other by hoyle . this creation of matter would keep the density of the universe constant as it expanded gold suggested a '' garbage theory '' for the origin of life which was an accidental panspermia ; the theory says that life on earth might have spread from a pile of waste products accidentally dumped on earth long ago by extraterrestrials in 1951 , at a meeting of the royal astronomical society , gold proposed that the source of recent radio signals detected from space was outside the milky way galaxy , much to the derision of radio astronomer martin ryle and several mathematical cosmologists however , a year later , a distant source was identified and gold announced at an international astronomical union meeting in rome that his theory had been proven . gold left cambridge in 1952 to become the chief assistant to astronomer royal harold spencer jones at the royal greenwich observatory in herstmonceux , sussex , england gold resigned from the royal observatory following spencer-jones 's retirement and moved to the united states in 1956 , where he served as professor of astronomy ( 1957–1958 ) and robert wheeler wilson professor of applied astronomy ( 1958–1959 ) at harvard university in early 1959 , he accepted an appointment at cornell university , which had offered him the opportunity to set up an interdisciplinary unit for radiophysics and space research , and take charge of the department of astronomy in addition , gold served as assistant vice president for research from 1969–1971 and the john l gold proposed that these objects were rapidly rotating neutron stars gold argued that due to their strong magnetic fields and high rotational speed , pulsars would emit radiation similar to a rotating beacon gold 's conclusion was initially not well received by the scientific community ; in fact , he was refused permission to present his theory at the first international conference on pulsars . anthony tucker of the guardian remarked that gold 's discovery paved the way for stephen hawking 's groundbreaking research into black holes from the 1950s , gold served as a consultant to nasa and held positions on several national space committees , including the president 's science advisory committee , as the united states tried to develop its space program this led to the dust being jokingly referred to as '' gold dust '' or '' gold 's dust '' gold was ridiculed by fellow scientists , not only for his hypothesis , but for the approach he took in communicating nasa 's concerns to the american public ; in particular , some experts were infuriated with his usage of the term '' moon dust '' in reference to lunar regolith . gold recalled the aftermath of his testimony in a 1983 interview with astronomy historian david h gold first became interested in the origins of petroleum in the 1950s , postulating a theory on the abiogenic petroleum origin . in the late 1970s , just as the united states faced another major energy crisis , gold resurrected his work on petroleum gold and soter suggested that these belts may explain the upward migration of gases through the ground , and subsequently , the production of oil and gas fields . critics also dismissed gold 's archaebacteria finding , stating that '' since micro-organisms can not survive at such depth , the bacteria prove that the well has been contaminated from the surface '' '' the 1993 article also features how gold 's thesis expands possibilities for astrobiology research : '' dr . gold did not earn a doctorate , but received an honorary doctor of science degree from cambridge university in 1969 gold has been derided by geologists , such as harmon craig and john hunt , who are strongly opposed to gold 's abiogenic petroleum theory

gold was born on may 22 , 1920 in vienna , austria to max gold , a wealthy jewish industrialist ( pre-war ) who ran one of austria 's largest mining and metal fabrication companies , and german former actress josefine martin following the economic downfall of the european mining industry in the late 1920s , max gold moved his family to berlin , where he had taken a job as director of a metal trading company . following the start of nazi leader adolf hitler 's anti-jewish campaigns in 1933 , gold and his family left germany because of his father 's heritage gold entered trinity college , cambridge in 1939 and began studying mechanical sciences gold spent most of his nearly 15 months of internment in a camp in canada , after which he returned to england and reentered cambridge university , where he abandoned his study of mechanical sciences for physics . within months , gold was placed in charge of constructing new radar systems immediately after the war , hoyle and bondi returned to cambridge , while gold stayed with naval research until 1947 he then began working at cambridge 's cavendish laboratory to help construct the world 's largest magnetron , a device invented by two british scientists in 1940 that generated intense microwaves for radar . in the 1970s , researchers discovered that gold 's hypothesis had been correct – the ear contained microscopic hair cells that operated on a feedback mechanism to generate resonance gold began discussing problems in physics with hoyle and bondi again , centering on the issues over redshift and hubble 's law weart , gold believed that there was reason to think that the creation of matter was '' done all the time and then none of the problems about fleeting moments arise it can be just in a steady state with the expansion taking things apart as fast as new matter comes into being and condenses into new galaxies '' . two papers were published in 1948 discussing the '' steady-state theory '' as an alternative to the big bang : one by gold and bondi , the other by hoyle in their seminal paper , gold and bondi asserted that although the universe is expanding , it nevertheless does not change its look over time ; it has no beginning and no end on the large scale , they argued that there '' is nothing outstanding about any place in the universe , and that those differences which do exist are only of local significance ; that seen on a large scale the universe is homogeneous however , since the universe was not characterized by a lack of evolution , distinguishing features or recognizable direction of time , they postulated that there had to be large-scale motions in the universe . they estimated that within the expanding universe , hydrogen atoms were being created out of a vacuum at a rate of one atom per cubic meter per 10 9 years gold and bondi also stated that the issues with time scale that had plagued other cosmological theories – such as the discrepancy between the age of the universe as calculated by hubble and dating of radioactive decay in terrestrial rocks – were absent for the steady-state theory whereas the big bang theory predicted as much , steady state predicted that such objects would be found everywhere , including close to our own galaxy , since evolution would be more evenly distributed , not observed only at great distances bondi conceded that the theory had been disproved , but hoyle and gold remained unconvinced for a number of years gold even supported hoyle 's modified steady-state theory , however , by 1998 , he started to express some doubts about the theory , but maintained that despite its faults , the theory helped improve understanding regarding the origin of the universe ryle would later take gold 's argument as proof of extragalactic evolution , claiming that it invalidated the steady-state theory . gold left cambridge in 1952 to become the chief assistant to astronomer royal harold spencer jones at the royal greenwich observatory in herstmonceux , sussex , england gold resigned from the royal observatory following spencer-jones 's retirement and moved to the united states in 1956 , where he served as professor of astronomy ( 1957–1958 ) and robert wheeler wilson professor of applied astronomy ( 1958–1959 ) at harvard university gold would serve as director of the center for radiophysics and space research until 1981 , establishing cornell as a leading hub of scientific research he also coined the term '' magnetosphere '' in his paper '' motions in the magnetosphere of the earth '' to describe '' the region above the ionosphere in which the magnetic field of the earth has a dominant control over the motions of gas and fast charged particles . in 1960 , gold collaborated again with fred hoyle to show that magnetic energy fueled solar flares and that flares were triggered when opposite magnetic loops interact and release their stored energy gold proposed that these objects were rapidly rotating neutron stars however , gold 's theory became widely accepted following the discovery of a pulsar in the crab nebula using the arecibo radio telescope , opening the door for future advancements in solid-state physics and astronomy . anthony tucker of the guardian remarked that gold 's discovery paved the way for stephen hawking 's groundbreaking research into black holes from the 1950s , gold served as a consultant to nasa and held positions on several national space committees , including the president 's science advisory committee , as the united states tried to develop its space program this led to the dust being jokingly referred to as '' gold dust '' or '' gold 's dust '' . gold initially suggested that astronauts would sink into the dust , but upon later analysis of impact craters and electrostatic fields , he determined that the astronauts ' boots would sink only three centimeters into the moon 's surface gold was ridiculed by fellow scientists , not only for his hypothesis , but for the approach he took in communicating nasa 's concerns to the american public ; in particular , some experts were infuriated with his usage of the term '' moon dust '' in reference to lunar regolith gold said the findings were consistent with his hypothesis , noting that '' in one area as they walked along , they sank in between five and eight inches '' however , gold received little credit for his correct prediction , and was even criticized for his original prediction of a deep layer of lunar dust nasa officials warned gold that if he testified his concerns before congress , his research proposals would lose their support from nasa '' ( dyson also delivered a eulogy at gold 's memorial service , a segment of which pertaining to the deep hot biosphere theory is posted on youtube in the journal nature , hermann bondi wrote '' tommy gold will long be remembered as a singular scientist who stepped into any field where he thought an option was being overlooked gold has been derided by geologists , such as harmon craig and john hunt , who are strongly opposed to gold 's abiogenic petroleum theory

following the economic downfall of the european mining industry in the late 1920s , max gold moved his family to berlin , where he had taken a job as director of a metal trading company . following the start of nazi leader adolf hitler 's anti-jewish campaigns in 1933 , gold and his family left germany because of his father 's heritage gold entered trinity college , cambridge in 1939 and began studying mechanical sciences . in may 1940 , just as hitler was commencing his advance in belgium and france , gold was sent into internment as an enemy alien by the british government gold spent most of his nearly 15 months of internment in a camp in canada , after which he returned to england and reentered cambridge university , where he abandoned his study of mechanical sciences for physics after graduating with a pass ( ordinary ) degree in june 1942 , gold worked briefly as an agricultural labourer and lumberjack in northern england before joining bondi and fred hoyle on naval research into radar ground clutter near dunsfold , surrey immediately after the war , hoyle and bondi returned to cambridge , while gold stayed with naval research until 1947 in 1948 , gold hypothesized that the ear operates by '' regeneration '' , in that electromechanical action occurs when electrical energy is used to counteract the effects of damping . in the 1970s , researchers discovered that gold 's hypothesis had been correct – the ear contained microscopic hair cells that operated on a feedback mechanism to generate resonance gold began discussing problems in physics with hoyle and bondi again , centering on the issues over redshift and hubble 's law this led the three to all start questioning the big bang theory originally proposed by georges lemaître in 1931 and later advanced by george gamow , which suggested that the universe expanded from an extremely dense and hot state and continues to expand today it can be just in a steady state with the expansion taking things apart as fast as new matter comes into being and condenses into new galaxies '' . two papers were published in 1948 discussing the '' steady-state theory '' as an alternative to the big bang : one by gold and bondi , the other by hoyle in their seminal paper , gold and bondi asserted that although the universe is expanding , it nevertheless does not change its look over time ; it has no beginning and no end for most cosmologists , the refutation of the steady-state theory came with the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1965 , which was predicted by the big bang theory gold even supported hoyle 's modified steady-state theory , however , by 1998 , he started to express some doubts about the theory , but maintained that despite its faults , the theory helped improve understanding regarding the origin of the universe gold suggested a '' garbage theory '' for the origin of life which was an accidental panspermia ; the theory says that life on earth might have spread from a pile of waste products accidentally dumped on earth long ago by extraterrestrials in 1951 , at a meeting of the royal astronomical society , gold proposed that the source of recent radio signals detected from space was outside the milky way galaxy , much to the derision of radio astronomer martin ryle and several mathematical cosmologists ryle would later take gold 's argument as proof of extragalactic evolution , claiming that it invalidated the steady-state theory . gold left cambridge in 1952 to become the chief assistant to astronomer royal harold spencer jones at the royal greenwich observatory in herstmonceux , sussex , england . the theory was widely disputed , until american scientists in 1957 discovered that gold 's theory held up to mathematical scrutiny by conducting a simulation using a shock tube gold resigned from the royal observatory following spencer-jones 's retirement and moved to the united states in 1956 , where he served as professor of astronomy ( 1957–1958 ) and robert wheeler wilson professor of applied astronomy ( 1958–1959 ) at harvard university in early 1959 , he accepted an appointment at cornell university , which had offered him the opportunity to set up an interdisciplinary unit for radiophysics and space research , and take charge of the department of astronomy he also coined the term '' magnetosphere '' in his paper '' motions in the magnetosphere of the earth '' to describe '' the region above the ionosphere in which the magnetic field of the earth has a dominant control over the motions of gas and fast charged particles in 1968 , a cambridge radio astronomy postgraduate student jocelyn bell burnell and her doctoral adviser antony hewish discovered a pulsing radio source with a period of 1.33 seconds gold 's conclusion was initially not well received by the scientific community ; in fact , he was refused permission to present his theory at the first international conference on pulsars however , gold 's theory became widely accepted following the discovery of a pulsar in the crab nebula using the arecibo radio telescope , opening the door for future advancements in solid-state physics and astronomy this led to the dust being jokingly referred to as '' gold dust '' or '' gold 's dust '' gold was ridiculed by fellow scientists , not only for his hypothesis , but for the approach he took in communicating nasa 's concerns to the american public ; in particular , some experts were infuriated with his usage of the term '' moon dust '' in reference to lunar regolith gold first became interested in the origins of petroleum in the 1950s , postulating a theory on the abiogenic petroleum origin gold engaged in thorough discussion on the matter with fred hoyle , who even included a chapter on '' gold 's pore theory '' in his 1955 book frontiers in astronomy in 1977 , a research submarine near the galapagos islands discovered a number of thriving ecosystems down on the ocean floor , living alongside hydrothermal vents gold and soter suggested that these belts may explain the upward migration of gases through the ground , and subsequently , the production of oil and gas fields . gold proposed that fuels were trapped inside the core of the earth in randomized molecular form nearly 4.5 billion years ago from this , gold proposed that the earth may possess a virtually endless supply – suggesting as much as '' at least 500 million years ' worth of gas '' – of fossil fuels thomas gold , an astrophysicist at cornell university known for bold theorizing , has speculated that subterranean life may dot the cosmos , secluded beneath the surfaces of planets and moons and energized by geological processes , with no need for the warming radiation of nearby stars he wrote in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences last year that the solar system might harbor at least 10 deep biospheres ) following gold 's death , scientific discoveries amplified and also shifted understanding of the deep hot biosphere into what is now generally called deep biosphere . in his foreword to gold 's book the deep hot biosphere , theoretical physicist freeman dyson stated , '' gold 's theories are always original , always important , usually controversial – and usually right thomas gold died at the age of 84 from complications due to heart disease , at cayuga medical center in ithaca , new york

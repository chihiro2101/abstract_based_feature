there had been plans before the second world war for a motorway network in the united kingdom the first section of motorway was the preston bypass in lancashire , now part of the m6 motorway , which opened in 1958 the m1 was britain 's first full-length motorway and opened in 1959 the early m1 had no speed limits , crash barriers , or lighting , and had soft shoulders rather than hard the first section of the motorway , between junction 5 ( watford ) and junction 18 ( crick/rugby ) , opened on 2 november 1959 , together with the motorway 's two spurs , the m10 ( from junction 7 to south of st albans originally connecting to the a1 ) and the m45 ( from junction 17 to the a45 and coventry ) the m10 spur motorway connected the m1 to the north orbital road ( a405/a414 , a precursor of the m25 ) where it also met the a5 ( now renumbered here as the a5183 ) and , to the east via the a414 , the a6 , which subsequently became part of the m25 although the whole of the first section opened in 1959 , it was built in two parts , with the northern part ( junctions 10 to 18 ) being built by john laing and the southern part ( the st albans bypass ) being built by tarmac limited diverging from the a5 , the motorway takes a more northerly route through the east midlands , via leicester , loughborough , nottingham to sheffield , where the m18 splits from the m1 at junction 32 to head to doncaster originally , the m1 was planned to end at doncaster but it was decided to make what was going to be the '' leeds and sheffield spur '' into the primary route , with the section to the a1 ( m ) south of doncaster given the separate motorway number m18 from junction 32 , the motorway passes sheffield , rotherham , barnsley and wakefield , reaching the original end of the motorway at ( the original ) junction 44 to the east of leeds there were plans to route the m1 from just south of junction 42 , where it interchanges with the m62 , round the west of leeds to the a1 at dishforth leeds south eastern urban motorway , 1972 in 1972 , an extension of the m1 was opened into central leeds as the leeds south eastern motorway , where it met the leeds south western motorway ( m621 ) coming north-east from the m62 at junction 3 in july 1972 , the then uk minister for transport industries , john peyton , announced that of uk motorway particularly prone to fog would benefit from lighting in a project that '' should be '' completed by 1973 in august 2011 , the highways agency announced that , despite being converted to smart motorway status , the lights will be switched off on stretches of the motorway between junctions 10 ( luton ) and 15 ( northampton ) without affecting road user safety the motorway junctions and their approaches , and a section of the m1 on either side of junction 11 ( north luton ) , would have lighting columns replaced and remain lit when the new section of m1 was completed and opened on 4 february 1999 , the leeds south eastern motorway section of the m1 was re-designated as the m621 , and the junctions were given new numbers : m621 junctions 4 to 7 these flyovers connecting from the a1 were originally both for northbound traffic : the left one as the on-ramp to the m1 , the right one going over the a1/a41 junction beneath to rejoin the a1 northbound in 2006 , plans were published for the widening of from leicester through to leeds ( junctions 21–42 ) to four lanes each way a smart motorway system was installed , making this the first smart motorway scheme on the m1 work to widen the section from nottingham to mansfield ( j25-j28 ) to four lanes each way began in january 2008 and was completed in 2010 , at a cost of £340 & nbsp ; million

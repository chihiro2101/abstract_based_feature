the first section of motorway was the preston bypass in lancashire , now part of the m6 motorway , which opened in 1958 the m1 was britain 's first full-length motorway and opened in 1959 the early m1 had no speed limits , crash barriers , or lighting , and had soft shoulders rather than hard the first section of the motorway , between junction 5 ( watford ) and junction 18 ( crick/rugby ) , opened on 2 november 1959 , together with the motorway 's two spurs , the m10 ( from junction 7 to south of st albans originally connecting to the a1 ) and the m45 ( from junction 17 to the a45 and coventry ) the m1 was officially inaugurated from slip end ( close to luton ) , celebrated by a large concrete slab on the bridge next to the village , with inscription '' london-yorkshire motorway – this slab was sealed by the rt hon harold watkinson m.p it started at the watford bypass ( a41 ) , which runs south-east to meet the a1 at apex corner , and ended on the a5 at crick the m10 spur motorway connected the m1 to the north orbital road ( a405/a414 , a precursor of the m25 ) where it also met the a5 ( now renumbered here as the a5183 ) and , to the east via the a414 , the a6 , which subsequently became part of the m25 although the whole of the first section opened in 1959 , it was built in two parts , with the northern part ( junctions 10 to 18 ) being built by john laing and the southern part ( the st albans bypass ) being built by tarmac limited diverging from the a5 , the motorway takes a more northerly route through the east midlands , via leicester , loughborough , nottingham to sheffield , where the m18 splits from the m1 at junction 32 to head to doncaster originally , the m1 was planned to end at doncaster but it was decided to make what was going to be the '' leeds and sheffield spur '' into the primary route , with the section to the a1 ( m ) south of doncaster given the separate motorway number m18 from junction 32 , the motorway passes sheffield , rotherham , barnsley and wakefield , reaching the original end of the motorway at ( the original ) junction 44 to the east of leeds in 1972 , an extension of the m1 was opened into central leeds as the leeds south eastern motorway , where it met the leeds south western motorway ( m621 ) coming north-east from the m62 at junction 3 the motorway junctions and their approaches , and a section of the m1 on either side of junction 11 ( north luton ) , would have lighting columns replaced and remain lit when the new section of m1 was completed and opened on 4 february 1999 , the leeds south eastern motorway section of the m1 was re-designated as the m621 , and the junctions were given new numbers : m621 junctions 4 to 7 the m1 was extended south towards london from its original starting point at junction 5 , in three stages the second phase continued east to scratchwood ( london gateway services occupies the location of the missing junction 3 from where an unbuilt spur would have connected to the a1 at stirling corner to the north-east ) the m1 then runs south alongside the midland main line towards hendon , where it meets the a1 again at junction 2 via a tightly curved flyover section many later developments , including smart motorway schemes , have been made to the m1 , and these are detailed below here , it is intended to join with a proposed luton northern bypass to form a northern bypass for the wider conurbation a smart motorway system was installed , making this the first smart motorway scheme on the m1 work to widen the section from nottingham to mansfield ( j25-j28 ) to four lanes each way began in january 2008 and was completed in 2010 , at a cost of £340 & nbsp ; million

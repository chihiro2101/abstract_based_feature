there had been plans before the second world war for a motorway network in the united kingdom the first section of motorway was the preston bypass in lancashire , now part of the m6 motorway , which opened in 1958 the first section of the motorway , between junction 5 ( watford ) and junction 18 ( crick/rugby ) , opened on 2 november 1959 , together with the motorway 's two spurs , the m10 ( from junction 7 to south of st albans originally connecting to the a1 ) and the m45 ( from junction 17 to the a45 and coventry ) the m1 was officially inaugurated from slip end ( close to luton ) , celebrated by a large concrete slab on the bridge next to the village , with inscription '' london-yorkshire motorway – this slab was sealed by the rt hon harold watkinson m.p although the whole of the first section opened in 1959 , it was built in two parts , with the northern part ( junctions 10 to 18 ) being built by john laing and the southern part ( the st albans bypass ) being built by tarmac limited diverging from the a5 , the motorway takes a more northerly route through the east midlands , via leicester , loughborough , nottingham to sheffield , where the m18 splits from the m1 at junction 32 to head to doncaster originally , the m1 was planned to end at doncaster but it was decided to make what was going to be the '' leeds and sheffield spur '' into the primary route , with the section to the a1 ( m ) south of doncaster given the separate motorway number m18 from junction 32 , the motorway passes sheffield , rotherham , barnsley and wakefield , reaching the original end of the motorway at ( the original ) junction 44 to the east of leeds in 1972 , an extension of the m1 was opened into central leeds as the leeds south eastern motorway , where it met the leeds south western motorway ( m621 ) coming north-east from the m62 at junction 3 in july 1972 , the then uk minister for transport industries , john peyton , announced that of uk motorway particularly prone to fog would benefit from lighting in a project that '' should be '' completed by 1973 the motorway junctions and their approaches , and a section of the m1 on either side of junction 11 ( north luton ) , would have lighting columns replaced and remain lit when the new section of m1 was completed and opened on 4 february 1999 , the leeds south eastern motorway section of the m1 was re-designated as the m621 , and the junctions were given new numbers : m621 junctions 4 to 7 the first stage , opened in 1966 , took the motorway south-east , parallel to the a41 , to meet the a5 at junction 4 south of elstree before the completion of junction 2 , southbound traffic left the motorway via a slip road which passed around the back of the now disused homebase and under the a41/a1 mill hill bypass , and looped round to join it at fiveways interchange the northbound slip road from the a1 is now partially used as the entrance way to a retail park and was once carried by bridge , but no longer reaches the northbound carriageway , because it is cut off by the motorway continuing south the layout of the staples corner junction was originally built in accordance with those plans , although most of the london ringways plan had been cancelled by 1973 on its completion , the m1 acted as a fast link road between london and birmingham via the m6 the a5-m1 link ( dunstable northern bypass ) is a two-lane dual carriageway running east from the a5 north of dunstable joining the m1 at a new junction 11a south of chalton work to introduce dynamic hard shoulder running on approximately of motorway between luton and milton keynes ( j10-13 ) was completed in december 2012 , at a total cost of £327 & nbsp ; million modifications were made to junctions 11 and 12 , to allow for four lanes running through each junction , and the a421 road from junction 13 to the bedford southern bypass was also upgraded to two lanes each way during this period the road was fully re-opened early on 21 april 2011 with a 50 & nbsp ; mph speed limit in force whilst repair work continued to an elevated section

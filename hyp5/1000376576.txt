pyrrole is a colorless volatile liquid that darkens readily upon exposure to air , and is usually purified by distillation immediately before use pyrrole is a 5-membered aromatic heterocycle , like furan and thiophene pyrrole is weakly basic , with a conjugate acid pk a of −3.8 substitution of pyrrole with alkyl substituents provides a more basic molecule—for example , tetramethylpyrrole has a conjugate acid pk a of +3.7 pyrrole is also weakly acidic at the n–h position , with a pk a of 16.5 pyrrole itself is not naturally occurring , but many of its derivatives are found in a variety of cofactors and natural products the syntheses of pyrrole-containing haemin , synthesized by hans fischer was recognized by the nobel prize several syntheses of the pyrrole ring have been described the hantzsch pyrrole synthesis is the reaction of β-ketoesters ( 1 ) with ammonia ( or primary amines ) and α-haloketones ( 2 ) to give substituted pyrroles ( 3 ) in the paal–knorr pyrrole synthesis , a 1,4-dicarbonyl compound reacts with ammonia or a primary amine to form a substituted pyrrole the van leusen reaction can be used to form pyrroles , by reaction of tosylmethyl isocyanide ( tosmic ) with an enone in the presence of base , in a michael addition the barton–zard synthesis proceeds in a manner similar to the van leusen synthesis addition of hydrochloric acid leads to ring closure and loss of ammonia to form the pyrrole pyrroles bearing multiple substituents are obtained from the reaction of münchnones and alkynes pyrroles can be prepared by silver-catalyzed cyclization of alkynes with isonitriles , where r 2 is an electron-withdrawing group , and r 1 is an alkane , aryl group , or ester examples of disubstituted alkynes have also been seen to form the desired pyrrole in considerable yield one synthetic route to pyrrole involves the decarboxylation of ammonium mucate , the ammonium salt of mucic acid . proline can be used as precursor of aromatic pyrroles in secondary natural products , as in prodigiosins as is typical for electrophilic additions to pyrroles , halogenation generally occurs at the 2-position , but can also occur at the 3-position by silation of the nitrogen n-metalated pyrrole can react with electrophiles at the n or c positions , depending on the coordinating metal pyrroles are also found in several drugs , including atorvastatin , ketorolac , and sunitinib

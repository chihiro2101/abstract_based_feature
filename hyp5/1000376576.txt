pyrrole is a colorless volatile liquid that darkens readily upon exposure to air , and is usually purified by distillation immediately before use pyrrole is a 5-membered aromatic heterocycle , like furan and thiophene unlike furan and thiophene , it has a dipole in which the positive end lies on the side of the heteroatom , with a dipole moment of 1.58 & nbsp ; d pyrrole is also weakly acidic at the n–h position , with a pk a of 16.5 see especially pages 67–68 , where runge names the compound pyrrol ( fire oil ) or rothöl ( red oil ) pyrrole itself is not naturally occurring , but many of its derivatives are found in a variety of cofactors and natural products common naturally produced molecules containing pyrroles include vitamin b12 , bile pigments like bilirubin and biliverdin , and the porphyrins of heme , chlorophyll , chlorins , bacteriochlorins , and porphyrinogens several syntheses of the pyrrole ring have been described the hantzsch pyrrole synthesis is the reaction of β-ketoesters ( 1 ) with ammonia ( or primary amines ) and α-haloketones ( 2 ) to give substituted pyrroles ( 3 ) in the paal–knorr pyrrole synthesis , a 1,4-dicarbonyl compound reacts with ammonia or a primary amine to form a substituted pyrrole the van leusen reaction can be used to form pyrroles , by reaction of tosylmethyl isocyanide ( tosmic ) with an enone in the presence of base , in a michael addition a 5-endo cyclization then forms the 5-membered ring , which reacts to eliminate the tosyl group pyrroles bearing multiple substituents are obtained from the reaction of münchnones and alkynes the de novo biosynthesis of pyrrole rings begins with aminolevulinic acid ( ala ) , which is synthesized from glycine and succinyl-coa ala dehydratase catalyzes the condensation of two ala molecules via a knorr-type ring synthesis to form porphobilinogen ( pbg ) glutamate-5-semialdehyde is first formed by glutamate 5-kinase ( atp-dependent ) and glutamate-5-semialdehyde dehydrogenase ( which requires nadh or nadph ) . proline can be used as precursor of aromatic pyrroles in secondary natural products , as in prodigiosins in contrast , substituted pyrroles ( including protected pyrroles ) have been used in a broad range of transformations n-metalated pyrrole can react with electrophiles at the n or c positions , depending on the coordinating metal more ionic nitrogen–metal bonds ( such as with li , na , and k ) and more solvating solvents lead to n-alkylation pyrroles are also found in several drugs , including atorvastatin , ketorolac , and sunitinib

pyrrole is weakly basic , with a conjugate acid pk a of −3.8 substitution of pyrrole with alkyl substituents provides a more basic molecule—for example , tetramethylpyrrole has a conjugate acid pk a of +3.7 pyrrole is also weakly acidic at the n–h position , with a pk a of 16.5 as a hydrogen bonding lewis acid it is classified as a hsab and the ecw model lists its acid parameters as e a 1.38 and c a 0.68 its name comes from the greek pyrrhos , “ reddish , fiery ” ) , from the reaction used to detect it—the red color that it imparts to wood when moistened with hydrochloric acid pyrrole itself is not naturally occurring , but many of its derivatives are found in a variety of cofactors and natural products 200px pyrrole can also be formed by catalytic dehydrogenation of pyrrolidine several syntheses of the pyrrole ring have been described the hantzsch pyrrole synthesis is the reaction of β-ketoesters ( 1 ) with ammonia ( or primary amines ) and α-haloketones ( 2 ) to give substituted pyrroles ( 3 ) the knorr pyrrole synthesis involves the reaction of an α-amino ketone or an α-amino-β-ketoester with an activated methylene compound in the paal–knorr pyrrole synthesis , a 1,4-dicarbonyl compound reacts with ammonia or a primary amine to form a substituted pyrrole the van leusen reaction can be used to form pyrroles , by reaction of tosylmethyl isocyanide ( tosmic ) with an enone in the presence of base , in a michael addition the starting materials in the piloty–robinson pyrrole synthesis , named for gertrude and robert robinson and oskar piloty , are two equivalents of an aldehyde and hydrazine the de novo biosynthesis of pyrrole rings begins with aminolevulinic acid ( ala ) , which is synthesized from glycine and succinyl-coa due to its aromaticity , pyrrole is difficult to hydrogenate , does not easily react as a diene in diels–alder reactions , and does not undergo usual olefin reactions under acidic conditions , pyrroles polymerize easily , and thus many electrophile reagents that are used in benzene chemistry are not applicable to pyrroles . reaction of pyrrole with electrophiles acylation with acid anhydrides and acid chlorides can occur without a catalyst ; alternatively , a lewis acid may be used diels-alder cyclizations can occur with the pyrrole acting as a diene , especially in the presence of an electron-withdrawing group on the nitrogen with dichlorocarbene , a dichlorocyclopropane intermediate is formed , which breaks down to form 3-chloropyridine ( the ciamician–dennstedt rearrangement ) synthesis of pyrroles ( overview of recent methods ) substitution reaction mechanisms of nitrogen-containing heteroaromatics

pyrrole is a colorless volatile liquid that darkens readily upon exposure to air , and is usually purified by distillation immediately before use pyrrole is a 5-membered aromatic heterocycle , like furan and thiophene pyrrole is weakly basic , with a conjugate acid pk a of −3.8 substitution of pyrrole with alkyl substituents provides a more basic molecule—for example , tetramethylpyrrole has a conjugate acid pk a of +3.7 pyrrole is also weakly acidic at the n–h position , with a pk a of 16.5 pyrrole itself is not naturally occurring , but many of its derivatives are found in a variety of cofactors and natural products common naturally produced molecules containing pyrroles include vitamin b12 , bile pigments like bilirubin and biliverdin , and the porphyrins of heme , chlorophyll , chlorins , bacteriochlorins , and porphyrinogens pyrrole is prepared industrially by treatment of furan with ammonia in the presence of solid acid catalysts , like silica and alumina several syntheses of the pyrrole ring have been described the hantzsch pyrrole synthesis is the reaction of β-ketoesters ( 1 ) with ammonia ( or primary amines ) and α-haloketones ( 2 ) to give substituted pyrroles ( 3 ) the knorr pyrrole synthesis involves the reaction of an α-amino ketone or an α-amino-β-ketoester with an activated methylene compound in the paal–knorr pyrrole synthesis , a 1,4-dicarbonyl compound reacts with ammonia or a primary amine to form a substituted pyrrole a 5-endo cyclization then forms the 5-membered ring , which reacts to eliminate the tosyl group addition of hydrochloric acid leads to ring closure and loss of ammonia to form the pyrrole the reaction mechanism involves 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition followed by loss of carbon dioxide by a retro-diels–alder process examples of disubstituted alkynes have also been seen to form the desired pyrrole in considerable yield the de novo biosynthesis of pyrrole rings begins with aminolevulinic acid ( ala ) , which is synthesized from glycine and succinyl-coa in contrast , substituted pyrroles ( including protected pyrroles ) have been used in a broad range of transformations . reaction of pyrrole with electrophiles diels-alder cyclizations can occur with the pyrrole acting as a diene , especially in the presence of an electron-withdrawing group on the nitrogen pyrroles are also found in several drugs , including atorvastatin , ketorolac , and sunitinib

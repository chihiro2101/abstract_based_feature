pyrrole is a colorless volatile liquid that darkens readily upon exposure to air , and is usually purified by distillation immediately before use pyrrole is weakly basic , with a conjugate acid pk a of −3.8 substitution of pyrrole with alkyl substituents provides a more basic molecule—for example , tetramethylpyrrole has a conjugate acid pk a of +3.7 pyrrole is also weakly acidic at the n–h position , with a pk a of 16.5 as a hydrogen bonding lewis acid it is classified as a hsab and the ecw model lists its acid parameters as e a 1.38 and c a 0.68 pyrrole itself is not naturally occurring , but many of its derivatives are found in a variety of cofactors and natural products common naturally produced molecules containing pyrroles include vitamin b12 , bile pigments like bilirubin and biliverdin , and the porphyrins of heme , chlorophyll , chlorins , bacteriochlorins , and porphyrinogens pyrrole is prepared industrially by treatment of furan with ammonia in the presence of solid acid catalysts , like silica and alumina several syntheses of the pyrrole ring have been described the hantzsch pyrrole synthesis is the reaction of β-ketoesters ( 1 ) with ammonia ( or primary amines ) and α-haloketones ( 2 ) to give substituted pyrroles ( 3 ) the knorr pyrrole synthesis involves the reaction of an α-amino ketone or an α-amino-β-ketoester with an activated methylene compound in the paal–knorr pyrrole synthesis , a 1,4-dicarbonyl compound reacts with ammonia or a primary amine to form a substituted pyrrole a 5-endo cyclization then forms the 5-membered ring , which reacts to eliminate the tosyl group the last step is tautomerization to the pyrrole addition of hydrochloric acid leads to ring closure and loss of ammonia to form the pyrrole ala dehydratase catalyzes the condensation of two ala molecules via a knorr-type ring synthesis to form porphobilinogen ( pbg ) . proline can be used as precursor of aromatic pyrroles in secondary natural products , as in prodigiosins this fragment is then able to react with the masked carbanion formed from the plp mediated decarboxylation of l-serine , which cyclizes in a dehydration reaction to yield the second pyrrole ring acylation with acid anhydrides and acid chlorides can occur without a catalyst ; alternatively , a lewis acid may be used for example , birch reduction of pyrrole esters and amides produced pyrrolines , with the regioselectivity depending on the position of the electron-withdrawing group synthesis of pyrroles ( overview of recent methods ) substitution reaction mechanisms of nitrogen-containing heteroaromatics

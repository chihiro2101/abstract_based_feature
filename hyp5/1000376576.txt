pyrrole is a colorless volatile liquid that darkens readily upon exposure to air , and is usually purified by distillation immediately before use pyrrole is a 5-membered aromatic heterocycle , like furan and thiophene pyrrole is weakly basic , with a conjugate acid pk a of −3.8 substitution of pyrrole with alkyl substituents provides a more basic molecule—for example , tetramethylpyrrole has a conjugate acid pk a of +3.7 pyrrole is also weakly acidic at the n–h position , with a pk a of 16.5 pyrrole was first detected by f pyrrole itself is not naturally occurring , but many of its derivatives are found in a variety of cofactors and natural products pyrrole is a constituent of tobacco smoke and may contribute to its toxic effects 200px pyrrole can also be formed by catalytic dehydrogenation of pyrrolidine the hantzsch pyrrole synthesis is the reaction of β-ketoesters ( 1 ) with ammonia ( or primary amines ) and α-haloketones ( 2 ) to give substituted pyrroles ( 3 ) the knorr pyrrole synthesis involves the reaction of an α-amino ketone or an α-amino-β-ketoester with an activated methylene compound the method involves the reaction of an α-aminoketone ( 1 ) and a compound containing a methylene group α to ( bonded to the next carbon to ) a carbonyl group ( 2 ) in the paal–knorr pyrrole synthesis , a 1,4-dicarbonyl compound reacts with ammonia or a primary amine to form a substituted pyrrole the reaction mechanism involves 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition followed by loss of carbon dioxide by a retro-diels–alder process one synthetic route to pyrrole involves the decarboxylation of ammonium mucate , the ammonium salt of mucic acid ala dehydratase catalyzes the condensation of two ala molecules via a knorr-type ring synthesis to form porphobilinogen ( pbg ) this later reacts to form , for example , the macrocycles heme and chlorophyll . proline can be used as precursor of aromatic pyrroles in secondary natural products , as in prodigiosins reaction of deprotonated pyrrole for example , birch reduction of pyrrole esters and amides produced pyrrolines , with the regioselectivity depending on the position of the electron-withdrawing group pyrroles with n-substitution can undergo cycloaddition reactions such as 4+2- , 2+2- , and 2+1-cyclizations

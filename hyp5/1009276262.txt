pliny 's descriptions likely refer to the flowering heads of an earlier cultivated variety of brassica oleracea , but comes close to describing modern cauliflower in the middle ages early forms of cauliflower were associated with the island of cyprus , with the 12th- and 13th-century arab botanists ibn al-'awwam and ibn al-baitar claiming its origin to be cyprus this association continued into western europe , where cauliflowers were sometimes known as cyprus colewort , and there was extensive trade in western europe in cauliflower seeds from cyprus , under the french lusignan rulers of the island , until well into the 16th century the word '' cauliflower '' derives from the italian cavolfiore , meaning '' cabbage flower '' the ultimate origin of the name is from the latin words caulis ( cabbage ) and flōs ( flower ) long periods of sun exposure in hot summer weather may cause cauliflower heads to discolor with a red-purple hue in soil that is loose , well-drained and fertile , field seedlings are shallow-planted and thinned by ample space – about 12 plants per the most important disorders affecting cauliflower quality are a hollow stem , stunted head growth or buttoning , ricing , browning and leaf-tip burn many species of blowflies , including calliphora vomitoria , are known pollinators of cauliflower ; white : white cauliflower is the most common color of cauliflower , having a contrasting white head ( also called '' curd '' ) surrounded by green leaves it is available in the normal curd ( head ) shape and with a fractal spiral curd called romanesco broccoli : in great britain and southern italy , a broccoli with tiny flower buds is sold as a vegetable under the name '' purple cauliflower '' ; it is not the same as standard cauliflower with a purple head when cooking , the outer leaves and thick stalks are typically removed , leaving only the florets ( the edible '' curd '' or '' head '' ) cauliflower rice is made by pulsing cauliflower florets followed by cooking the result in oil one of the fractal properties of cauliflower is that every branch , or '' module '' , is similar to the entire cauliflower

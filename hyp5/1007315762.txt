about 380,000 years later the universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called recombination epoch when this happened , matter and energy became decoupled , allowing photons to travel freely through the continually expanding space matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars , galaxy and other astronomical objects , leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space the present day shape of the universe has been determined from measurements of the cosmic microwave background using satellites like the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe these observations indicate that the spatial geometry of the observable universe is '' flat '' , meaning that photons on parallel paths at one point remain parallel as they travel through space to the limit of the observable universe , except for local gravity the flat universe , combined with the measured mass density of the universe and the accelerating hubble 's law , indicates that space has a non-zero vacuum energy , which is called dark energy outer space is the closest known approximation to a perfect vacuum the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter , as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter by comparison , the air humans breathe contains about 10 25 molecules per cubic meter the low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered : the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 10 23 & nbsp ; km , or 10 & nbsp ; billion light years atmospheres have no clearly delineated upper boundary : the density of atmospheric gas gradually decreases with distance from the object until it becomes indistinguishable from outer space the earth 's atmospheric pressure drops to about pa at of altitude , compared to 100,000 pa for the international union of pure and applied chemistry ( iupac ) definition of standard pressure the thermosphere in this range has large gradients of pressure , temperature and composition , and varies greatly due to space weather the temperature of outer space is measured in terms of the kinetic activity of the gas , as it is on earth ) the current black body temperature of the background radiation is about the gas temperatures in outer space can vary widely for example , the temperature in the boomerang nebula is 1 & nbsp ; k , while the solar corona reaches temperatures over 1.2–2.6 & nbsp ; million & nbsp ; k magnetic fields have been detected in the space around just about every class of celestial object star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale dynamos , creating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5–10 & nbsp ; μg the davis–greenstein effect causes elongated cosmic dust to align themselves with a galaxy 's magnetic field , resulting in weak optical polarization these particles have energies ranging from about 10 6 & nbsp ; ev up to an extreme 10 20 & nbsp ; ev of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays despite the harsh environment , several life forms have been found that can withstand extreme space conditions for extended periods the panspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world even at relatively low altitudes in the earth 's atmosphere , conditions are hostile to the human body hence , at this altitude , human survival requires a pressure suit , or a pressurized capsule blood and other body fluids boil when the pressure drops below 6.3 & nbsp ; kpa , and this condition is called ebullism the steam may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation , but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture most space suits use around 30–39 & nbsp ; kpa of pure oxygen , about the same as on the earth 's surface this can cause nausea and vomiting , vertigo , headaches , lethargy , and overall malaise the duration of space sickness varies , but it typically lasts for 1–3 days , after which the body adjusts to the new environment longer-term exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton , or spaceflight osteopenia space is a partial vacuum : its different regions are defined by the various atmospheres and '' winds '' that dominate within them , and extend to the point at which those winds give way to those beyond geospace extends from earth 's atmosphere to the outer reaches of earth 's magnetic field , whereupon it gives way to the solar wind of interplanetary space interstellar space then continues to the edges of the galaxy , where it fades into the intergalactic void geospace is the region of outer space near earth , including the upper atmosphere and magnetosphere the variable space-weather conditions of geospace are affected by the behavior of the sun and the solar wind ; the subject of geospace is interlinked with heliophysics—the study of the sun and its impact on the planets of the solar system the day-side magnetopause is compressed by solar-wind pressure—the subsolar distance from the center of the earth is typically 10 earth radii for roughly four days of each month , the lunar surface is shielded from the solar wind as the moon passes through the magnetotail these plasmas form a medium from which storm-like disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the earth 's upper atmosphere magnetic storms can also be a hazard to astronauts , even in low earth orbit this extends into translunar space to a distance of roughly 1 % of the mean distance from earth to the sun , or deep space is defined by the united states government and others as any region beyond cislunar space the itu-r ( including satellites ) defines the beginning of deep space at about 5 times that distance interplanetary space extends out to the astropause where the influence of the galactic environment starts to dominate over the magnetic field and particle flux from the sun the heliopause in turn deflects away low-energy galactic cosmic rays , with this modulation effect peaking during solar maximum the volume of interplanetary space is a nearly total vacuum , with a mean free path of about one astronomical unit at the orbital distance of the earth interplanetary space contains the magnetic field generated by the sun these are shaped by the influence of the solar wind into the approximation of a teardrop shape , with the long tail extending outward behind the planet these magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources , creating belts of charged particles such as the van allen radiation belts the contents of interstellar space are called the interstellar medium a number of molecules exist in interstellar space , as can tiny 0.1 & nbsp ; μm dust particles it covers the legal use of outer space by nation states , and includes in its definition of outer space the moon and other celestial bodies four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the un 's committee on the peaceful uses of outer space english philosopher william gilbert arrived at a similar conclusion , arguing that the stars are visible to us only because they are surrounded by a thin aether or a void using the estimated radiation of the background stars , he concluded that space must be heated to a temperature of 5–6 & nbsp ; k they remain a fundamental tool for the exploration of outer space , as well as for observation of the earth

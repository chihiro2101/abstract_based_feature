according to the big bang theory , the very early universe was an extremely hot and dense state about age of the universe which rapidly expanded when this happened , matter and energy became decoupled , allowing photons to travel freely through the continually expanding space matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars , galaxy and other astronomical objects , leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space as light has a finite velocity , this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable universe the present day shape of the universe has been determined from measurements of the cosmic microwave background using satellites like the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe the flat universe , combined with the measured mass density of the universe and the accelerating hubble 's law , indicates that space has a non-zero vacuum energy , which is called dark energy the atoms account for only 4.6 % of the total energy density , or a density of one proton per four cubic meters the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter , as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter stars , planets , and moons retain their atmospheres by gravitational attraction atmospheres have no clearly delineated upper boundary : the density of atmospheric gas gradually decreases with distance from the object until it becomes indistinguishable from outer space the thermosphere in this range has large gradients of pressure , temperature and composition , and varies greatly due to space weather the temperature of outer space is measured in terms of the kinetic activity of the gas , as it is on earth the radiation of outer space has a different temperature than the kinetic temperature of the gas , meaning that the gas and radiation are not in thermodynamic equilibrium ) the current black body temperature of the background radiation is about the gas temperatures in outer space can vary widely in the high energy range , the flux of electrons is only about 1 % of that of protons cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a health threat to space travelers despite the harsh environment , several life forms have been found that can withstand extreme space conditions for extended periods the panspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world the altitude where atmospheric pressure matches the vapor pressure of water at the human body temperature is called the armstrong line , named after american physician harry g at or above the armstrong line , fluids in the throat and lungs boil away hence , at this altitude , human survival requires a pressure suit , or a pressurized capsule blood and other body fluids boil when the pressure drops below 6.3 & nbsp ; kpa , and this condition is called ebullism ebullism is slowed by the pressure containment of blood vessels , so some blood remains liquid the crew altitude protection suit ( caps ) , a fitted elastic garment designed in the 1960s for astronauts , prevents ebullism at pressures as low as 2 kpa most space suits use around 30–39 & nbsp ; kpa of pure oxygen , about the same as on the earth 's surface the duration of space sickness varies , but it typically lasts for 1–3 days , after which the body adjusts to the new environment on a round-trip mars mission lasting three years , a large fraction of the cells in an astronaut 's body would be traversed and potentially damaged by high energy nuclei the energy of such particles is significantly diminished by the shielding provided by the walls of a spacecraft and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers.the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew geospace extends from earth 's atmosphere to the outer reaches of earth 's magnetic field , whereupon it gives way to the solar wind of interplanetary space interplanetary space extends to the heliopause , whereupon the solar wind gives way to the winds of the interstellar medium interstellar space then continues to the edges of the galaxy , where it fades into the intergalactic void geospace is the region of outer space near earth , including the upper atmosphere and magnetosphere the van allen radiation belts lie within the geospace for roughly four days of each month , the lunar surface is shielded from the solar wind as the moon passes through the magnetotail magnetic storms can also be a hazard to astronauts , even in low earth orbit although it meets the definition of outer space , the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the kármán line is still sufficient to produce significant drag on satellites the region outside earth 's atmosphere and extending out to just beyond the moon 's orbit , including the lagrange points , is sometimes referred to as cislunar space the region where earth 's gravity remains dominant against gravitational perturbations from the sun is called the hill sphere deep space is defined by the united states government and others as any region beyond cislunar space the itu-r ( including satellites ) defines the beginning of deep space at about 5 times that distance interplanetary space is defined by the solar wind , a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the sun that creates a very tenuous atmosphere ( the heliosphere ) for billions of kilometers into space this wind has a particle density of 5–10 protons/cm 3 and is moving at a velocity of interplanetary space extends out to the astropause where the influence of the galactic environment starts to dominate over the magnetic field and particle flux from the sun this space is not completely empty , and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays , which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles there are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as jupiter , saturn , mercury and the earth that have their own magnetic fields the density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably : the average is around 10 6 particles per m 3 , but cold molecular clouds can hold 10 8 –10 12 per m 3 a number of molecules exist in interstellar space , as can tiny 0.1 & nbsp ; μm dust particles energetic cosmic rays penetrate the cold , dense clouds and ionize hydrogen and helium , resulting , for example , in the trihydrogen cation this volume nearly coincides with a region of space known as the local bubble , which is characterized by a lack of dense , cold clouds the local bubble contains dozens of warm interstellar clouds with temperatures of up to 7,000 & nbsp ; k and radii of 0.5–5 & nbsp ; pc instead , these authors argue that a subsonic bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium the modern concept of outer space is based on the big bang cosmology , first proposed in 1931 by the belgian physicist georges lemaître using the estimated radiation of the background stars , he concluded that space must be heated to a temperature of 5–6 & nbsp ; k for most of human history , space was explored by observations made from the earth 's surface—initially with the unaided eye and then with the telescope in august 2012 , voyager 1 became the first man-made object to leave the solar system and enter interstellar space

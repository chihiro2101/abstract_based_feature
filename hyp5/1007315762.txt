the size of the whole universe is unknown , and it might be infinite in extent when this happened , matter and energy became decoupled , allowing photons to travel freely through the continually expanding space matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars , galaxy and other astronomical objects , leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space the present day shape of the universe has been determined from measurements of the cosmic microwave background using satellites like the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe the flat universe , combined with the measured mass density of the universe and the accelerating hubble 's law , indicates that space has a non-zero vacuum energy , which is called dark energy the atoms account for only 4.6 % of the total energy density , or a density of one proton per four cubic meters outer space is the closest known approximation to a perfect vacuum the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter , as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter the low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered : the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 10 23 & nbsp ; km , or 10 & nbsp ; billion light years in spite of this , extinction , which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas , is an important factor in galactic and intergalactic astronomy atmospheres have no clearly delineated upper boundary : the density of atmospheric gas gradually decreases with distance from the object until it becomes indistinguishable from outer space the earth 's atmospheric pressure drops to about pa at of altitude , compared to 100,000 pa for the international union of pure and applied chemistry ( iupac ) definition of standard pressure above this altitude , isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to radiation pressure from the sun and the dynamic pressure of the solar wind the thermosphere in this range has large gradients of pressure , temperature and composition , and varies greatly due to space weather the temperature of outer space is measured in terms of the kinetic activity of the gas , as it is on earth the radiation of outer space has a different temperature than the kinetic temperature of the gas , meaning that the gas and radiation are not in thermodynamic equilibrium all of the observable universe is filled with photons that were created during the big bang , which is known as the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) the davis–greenstein effect causes elongated cosmic dust to align themselves with a galaxy 's magnetic field , resulting in weak optical polarization these particles have energies ranging from about 10 6 & nbsp ; ev up to an extreme 10 20 & nbsp ; ev of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays the peak flux of cosmic rays occurs at energies of about 10 9 & nbsp ; ev , with approximately 87 % protons , 12 % helium nuclei and 1 % heavier nuclei in the high energy range , the flux of electrons is only about 1 % of that of protons cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a health threat to space travelers despite the harsh environment , several life forms have been found that can withstand extreme space conditions for extended periods the panspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world a conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early in the history of the solar system , with potentially microorganism-bearing rocks being exchanged between venus , earth , and mars out in space , sudden exposure of an unprotected human to very low pressure , such as during a rapid decompression , can cause pulmonary barotrauma—a rupture of the lungs , due to the large pressure differential between inside and outside the chest ebullism is slowed by the pressure containment of blood vessels , so some blood remains liquid swelling and ebullism can be reduced by containment in a pressure suit most space suits use around 30–39 & nbsp ; kpa of pure oxygen , about the same as on the earth 's surface this pressure is high enough to prevent ebullism , but evaporation of nitrogen dissolved in the blood could still cause decompression sickness and air embolism if not managed lesser symptoms include loss of body mass , nasal congestion , sleep disturbance , and puffiness of the face during long-duration space travel , radiation can pose an acute health hazard space is a partial vacuum : its different regions are defined by the various atmospheres and '' winds '' that dominate within them , and extend to the point at which those winds give way to those beyond geospace extends from earth 's atmosphere to the outer reaches of earth 's magnetic field , whereupon it gives way to the solar wind of interplanetary space interstellar space then continues to the edges of the galaxy , where it fades into the intergalactic void geospace is the region of outer space near earth , including the upper atmosphere and magnetosphere the outer boundary of geospace is the magnetopause , which forms an interface between the earth 's magnetosphere and the solar wind the day-side magnetopause is compressed by solar-wind pressure—the subsolar distance from the center of the earth is typically 10 earth radii geospace is populated by electrically charged particles at very low densities , the motions of which are controlled by the earth 's magnetic field earth 's gravity keeps the moon in orbit at an average distance of deep space is defined by the united states government and others as any region beyond cislunar space interplanetary space is defined by the solar wind , a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the sun that creates a very tenuous atmosphere ( the heliosphere ) for billions of kilometers into space this wind has a particle density of 5–10 protons/cm 3 and is moving at a velocity of interplanetary space extends out to the astropause where the influence of the galactic environment starts to dominate over the magnetic field and particle flux from the sun the distance and strength of the heliopause varies depending on the activity level of the solar wind this space is not completely empty , and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays , which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles there are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as jupiter , saturn , mercury and the earth that have their own magnetic fields interstellar space is the physical space within a galaxy beyond the influence each star has upon the encompassed plasma the local interstellar medium is a region of space within 100 & nbsp ; parsecs ( pc ) of the sun , which is of interest both for its proximity and for its interaction with the solar system ) this volume contains about 10 4 –10 5 stars and the local interstellar gas counterbalances the astrospheres that surround these stars , with the volume of each sphere varying depending on the local density of the interstellar medium intergalactic space is the physical space between galaxies the outer space treaty provides the basic framework for international space law the earliest known estimate of the temperature of outer space was by the swiss physicist charles é german physicist erich regener used the total measured energy of cosmic rays to estimate an intergalactic temperature of 2.8 & nbsp ; k in 1933 they remain a fundamental tool for the exploration of outer space , as well as for observation of the earth like asteroid mining , space manufacturing would require a large financial investment with little prospect of immediate return

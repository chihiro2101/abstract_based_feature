when this happened , matter and energy became decoupled , allowing photons to travel freely through the continually expanding space the present day shape of the universe has been determined from measurements of the cosmic microwave background using satellites like the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe the flat universe , combined with the measured mass density of the universe and the accelerating hubble 's law , indicates that space has a non-zero vacuum energy , which is called dark energy outer space is the closest known approximation to a perfect vacuum the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter , as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter by comparison , the air humans breathe contains about 10 25 molecules per cubic meter the low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered : the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 10 23 & nbsp ; km , or 10 & nbsp ; billion light years above this altitude , isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to radiation pressure from the sun and the dynamic pressure of the solar wind the thermosphere in this range has large gradients of pressure , temperature and composition , and varies greatly due to space weather the temperature of outer space is measured in terms of the kinetic activity of the gas , as it is on earth the radiation of outer space has a different temperature than the kinetic temperature of the gas , meaning that the gas and radiation are not in thermodynamic equilibrium for example , the temperature in the boomerang nebula is 1 & nbsp ; k , while the solar corona reaches temperatures over 1.2–2.6 & nbsp ; million & nbsp ; k magnetic fields have been detected in the space around just about every class of celestial object star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale dynamos , creating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5–10 & nbsp ; μg this has been used to show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies outside a protective atmosphere and magnetic field , there are few obstacles to the passage through space of energetic subatomic particles known as cosmic rays these particles have energies ranging from about 10 6 & nbsp ; ev up to an extreme 10 20 & nbsp ; ev of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays the peak flux of cosmic rays occurs at energies of about 10 9 & nbsp ; ev , with approximately 87 % protons , 12 % helium nuclei and 1 % heavier nuclei in the high energy range , the flux of electrons is only about 1 % of that of protons cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a health threat to space travelers despite the harsh environment , several life forms have been found that can withstand extreme space conditions for extended periods even at relatively low altitudes in the earth 's atmosphere , conditions are hostile to the human body at or above the armstrong line , fluids in the throat and lungs boil away as a consequence of rapid decompression , oxygen dissolved in the blood empties into the lungs to try to equalize the partial pressure gradient blood and other body fluids boil when the pressure drops below 6.3 & nbsp ; kpa , and this condition is called ebullism most space suits use around 30–39 & nbsp ; kpa of pure oxygen , about the same as on the earth 's surface space is a partial vacuum : its different regions are defined by the various atmospheres and '' winds '' that dominate within them , and extend to the point at which those winds give way to those beyond interplanetary space extends to the heliopause , whereupon the solar wind gives way to the winds of the interstellar medium geospace is the region of outer space near earth , including the upper atmosphere and magnetosphere the variable space-weather conditions of geospace are affected by the behavior of the sun and the solar wind ; the subject of geospace is interlinked with heliophysics—the study of the sun and its impact on the planets of the solar system the day-side magnetopause is compressed by solar-wind pressure—the subsolar distance from the center of the earth is typically 10 earth radii geomagnetic storms can disturb two regions of geospace , the radiation belts and the ionosphere although it meets the definition of outer space , the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the kármán line is still sufficient to produce significant drag on satellites earth 's gravity keeps the moon in orbit at an average distance of deep space is defined by the united states government and others as any region beyond cislunar space the itu-r ( including satellites ) defines the beginning of deep space at about 5 times that distance interplanetary space is defined by the solar wind , a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the sun that creates a very tenuous atmosphere ( the heliosphere ) for billions of kilometers into space the distance and strength of the heliopause varies depending on the activity level of the solar wind the volume of interplanetary space is a nearly total vacuum , with a mean free path of about one astronomical unit at the orbital distance of the earth planets without magnetic fields , such as mars , have their atmospheres gradually eroded by the solar wind interstellar space is the physical space within a galaxy beyond the influence each star has upon the encompassed plasma the contents of interstellar space are called the interstellar medium approximately 70 % of the mass of the interstellar medium consists of lone hydrogen atoms ; most of the remainder consists of helium atoms the density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably : the average is around 10 6 particles per m 3 , but cold molecular clouds can hold 10 8 –10 12 per m 3 large regions of higher density matter known as molecular clouds allow chemical reactions to occur , including the formation of organic polyatomic species this volume nearly coincides with a region of space known as the local bubble , which is characterized by a lack of dense , cold clouds ) this volume contains about 10 4 –10 5 stars and the local interstellar gas counterbalances the astrospheres that surround these stars , with the volume of each sphere varying depending on the local density of the interstellar medium the local bubble contains dozens of warm interstellar clouds with temperatures of up to 7,000 & nbsp ; k and radii of 0.5–5 & nbsp ; pc when stars are moving at sufficiently high peculiar velocities , their astrospheres can generate bow shocks as they collide with the interstellar medium in 2012 , data from interstellar boundary explorer and nasa 's voyager probes showed that the sun 's bow shock does not exist instead , these authors argue that a subsonic bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium it covers the legal use of outer space by nation states , and includes in its definition of outer space the moon and other celestial bodies this status as a common heritage of mankind has been used , though not without opposition , to enforce the right to access and shared use of outer space for all nations equally , particularly non-spacefaring nations four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the un 's committee on the peaceful uses of outer space the earliest known estimate of the temperature of outer space was by the swiss physicist charles é the shorter term space is older , first used to mean the region beyond earth 's sky in john milton 's paradise lost in 1667

when this happened , matter and energy became decoupled , allowing photons to travel freely through the continually expanding space matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars , galaxy and other astronomical objects , leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space the flat universe , combined with the measured mass density of the universe and the accelerating hubble 's law , indicates that space has a non-zero vacuum energy , which is called dark energy the atoms account for only 4.6 % of the total energy density , or a density of one proton per four cubic meters the density of the universe is clearly not uniform ; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies , such as planets , stars , and black holes—to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density , at least in terms of visible matter outer space is the closest known approximation to a perfect vacuum the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter , as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter the low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered : the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 10 23 & nbsp ; km , or 10 & nbsp ; billion light years in spite of this , extinction , which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas , is an important factor in galactic and intergalactic astronomy atmospheres have no clearly delineated upper boundary : the density of atmospheric gas gradually decreases with distance from the object until it becomes indistinguishable from outer space the earth 's atmospheric pressure drops to about pa at of altitude , compared to 100,000 pa for the international union of pure and applied chemistry ( iupac ) definition of standard pressure above this altitude , isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to radiation pressure from the sun and the dynamic pressure of the solar wind the thermosphere in this range has large gradients of pressure , temperature and composition , and varies greatly due to space weather the temperature of outer space is measured in terms of the kinetic activity of the gas , as it is on earth the radiation of outer space has a different temperature than the kinetic temperature of the gas , meaning that the gas and radiation are not in thermodynamic equilibrium ( there is quite likely a correspondingly large number of neutrinos called the cosmic neutrino background ) the current black body temperature of the background radiation is about the gas temperatures in outer space can vary widely star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale dynamos , creating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5–10 & nbsp ; μg the davis–greenstein effect causes elongated cosmic dust to align themselves with a galaxy 's magnetic field , resulting in weak optical polarization this has been used to show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies outside a protective atmosphere and magnetic field , there are few obstacles to the passage through space of energetic subatomic particles known as cosmic rays cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a health threat to space travelers despite the harsh environment , several life forms have been found that can withstand extreme space conditions for extended periods species of lichen carried on the esa biopan facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007 seeds of arabidopsis thaliana and nicotiana tabacum germinated after being exposed to space for 1.5 years even at relatively low altitudes in the earth 's atmosphere , conditions are hostile to the human body out in space , sudden exposure of an unprotected human to very low pressure , such as during a rapid decompression , can cause pulmonary barotrauma—a rupture of the lungs , due to the large pressure differential between inside and outside the chest the steam may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation , but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture most space suits use around 30–39 & nbsp ; kpa of pure oxygen , about the same as on the earth 's surface humans evolved for life in earth gravity , and exposure to weightlessness has been shown to have deleterious effects on human health initially , more than 50 % of astronauts experience space motion sickness the duration of space sickness varies , but it typically lasts for 1–3 days , after which the body adjusts to the new environment lesser symptoms include loss of body mass , nasal congestion , sleep disturbance , and puffiness of the face interstellar space then continues to the edges of the galaxy , where it fades into the intergalactic void geospace is the region of outer space near earth , including the upper atmosphere and magnetosphere the outer boundary of geospace is the magnetopause , which forms an interface between the earth 's magnetosphere and the solar wind the day-side magnetopause is compressed by solar-wind pressure—the subsolar distance from the center of the earth is typically 10 earth radii on the night side , the solar wind stretches the magnetosphere to form a magnetotail that sometimes extends out to more than 100–200 earth radii geospace is populated by electrically charged particles at very low densities , the motions of which are controlled by the earth 's magnetic field these plasmas form a medium from which storm-like disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the earth 's upper atmosphere this region contains material left over from previous crewed and uncrewed launches that are a potential hazard to spacecraft earth 's gravity keeps the moon in orbit at an average distance of the region where earth 's gravity remains dominant against gravitational perturbations from the sun is called the hill sphere this extends into translunar space to a distance of roughly 1 % of the mean distance from earth to the sun , or the itu-r ( including satellites ) defines the beginning of deep space at about 5 times that distance the volume of interplanetary space is a nearly total vacuum , with a mean free path of about one astronomical unit at the orbital distance of the earth this space is not completely empty , and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays , which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles a cloud of interplanetary dust is visible at night as a faint band called the zodiacal light there are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as jupiter , saturn , mercury and the earth that have their own magnetic fields these magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources , creating belts of charged particles such as the van allen radiation belts planets without magnetic fields , such as mars , have their atmospheres gradually eroded by the solar wind since 1958 , outer space has been the subject of multiple united nations resolutions the first humans to escape low-earth orbit were frank borman , jim lovell and william anders in 1968 on board the u.s they remain a fundamental tool for the exploration of outer space , as well as for observation of the earth with these new rockets the cost to send materials into space remains prohibitively high for many industries

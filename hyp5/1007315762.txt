according to the big bang theory , the very early universe was an extremely hot and dense state about age of the universe which rapidly expanded about 380,000 years later the universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called recombination epoch when this happened , matter and energy became decoupled , allowing photons to travel freely through the continually expanding space matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars , galaxy and other astronomical objects , leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space as light has a finite velocity , this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable universe the present day shape of the universe has been determined from measurements of the cosmic microwave background using satellites like the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe these observations indicate that the spatial geometry of the observable universe is '' flat '' , meaning that photons on parallel paths at one point remain parallel as they travel through space to the limit of the observable universe , except for local gravity the flat universe , combined with the measured mass density of the universe and the accelerating hubble 's law , indicates that space has a non-zero vacuum energy , which is called dark energy the atoms account for only 4.6 % of the total energy density , or a density of one proton per four cubic meters outer space is the closest known approximation to a perfect vacuum the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter , as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter the low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered : the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 10 23 & nbsp ; km , or 10 & nbsp ; billion light years in spite of this , extinction , which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas , is an important factor in galactic and intergalactic astronomy atmospheres have no clearly delineated upper boundary : the density of atmospheric gas gradually decreases with distance from the object until it becomes indistinguishable from outer space the earth 's atmospheric pressure drops to about pa at of altitude , compared to 100,000 pa for the international union of pure and applied chemistry ( iupac ) definition of standard pressure above this altitude , isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to radiation pressure from the sun and the dynamic pressure of the solar wind the temperature of outer space is measured in terms of the kinetic activity of the gas , as it is on earth the radiation of outer space has a different temperature than the kinetic temperature of the gas , meaning that the gas and radiation are not in thermodynamic equilibrium ( there is quite likely a correspondingly large number of neutrinos called the cosmic neutrino background the gas temperatures in outer space can vary widely for example , the temperature in the boomerang nebula is 1 & nbsp ; k , while the solar corona reaches temperatures over 1.2–2.6 & nbsp ; million & nbsp ; k magnetic fields have been detected in the space around just about every class of celestial object this has been used to show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies non-thermal radio sources have been detected even among the most distant , high-z sources , indicating the presence of magnetic fields cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a health threat to space travelers according to astronauts , like don pettit , space has a burned/metallic odor that clings to their suits and equipment , similar to the scent of an arc welding torch despite the harsh environment , several life forms have been found that can withstand extreme space conditions for extended periods species of lichen carried on the esa biopan facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007 a conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early in the history of the solar system , with potentially microorganism-bearing rocks being exchanged between venus , earth , and mars even at relatively low altitudes in the earth 's atmosphere , conditions are hostile to the human body hence , at this altitude , human survival requires a pressure suit , or a pressurized capsule as a consequence of rapid decompression , oxygen dissolved in the blood empties into the lungs to try to equalize the partial pressure gradient most space suits use around 30–39 & nbsp ; kpa of pure oxygen , about the same as on the earth 's surface during long-duration space travel , radiation can pose an acute health hazard space is a partial vacuum : its different regions are defined by the various atmospheres and '' winds '' that dominate within them , and extend to the point at which those winds give way to those beyond geospace extends from earth 's atmosphere to the outer reaches of earth 's magnetic field , whereupon it gives way to the solar wind of interplanetary space interplanetary space extends to the heliopause , whereupon the solar wind gives way to the winds of the interstellar medium geospace is the region of outer space near earth , including the upper atmosphere and magnetosphere the outer boundary of geospace is the magnetopause , which forms an interface between the earth 's magnetosphere and the solar wind the day-side magnetopause is compressed by solar-wind pressure—the subsolar distance from the center of the earth is typically 10 earth radii geospace is populated by electrically charged particles at very low densities , the motions of which are controlled by the earth 's magnetic field magnetic storms can also be a hazard to astronauts , even in low earth orbit this extends into translunar space to a distance of roughly 1 % of the mean distance from earth to the sun , or deep space is defined by the united states government and others as any region beyond cislunar space the itu-r ( including satellites ) defines the beginning of deep space at about 5 times that distance interplanetary space is defined by the solar wind , a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the sun that creates a very tenuous atmosphere ( the heliosphere ) for billions of kilometers into space the distance and strength of the heliopause varies depending on the activity level of the solar wind this space is not completely empty , and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays , which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles there is also gas , plasma and dust , small meteors , and several dozen types of organic molecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy interplanetary space contains the magnetic field generated by the sun interstellar space is the physical space within a galaxy beyond the influence each star has upon the encompassed plasma the treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states to explore and is not subject to claims of national sovereignty , calling outer space the '' province of all mankind '' the earliest known estimate of the temperature of outer space was by the swiss physicist charles é the first humans to escape low-earth orbit were frank borman , jim lovell and william anders in 1968 on board the u.s since that time , uncrewed spacecraft have successfully examined each of the solar system 's planets , as well their moons and many minor planets and comets an important factor in the total expense is the high cost of placing mass into earth orbit : – per kg , according to a 2006 estimate ( allowing for inflation since then )

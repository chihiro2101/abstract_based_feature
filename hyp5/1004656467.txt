the exact circumstances of the origin of the urantia book are unknown the book and its publishers do not name a human author instead , it is written as if directly presented by numerous celestial beings appointed to the task of providing an '' epochal '' religious revelation sadler and his wife lena sadler , physicians in chicago and well known in the community , are said to have been approached by a neighbor who was concerned because she would occasionally find her husband in a deep sleep and breathing abnormally the sadlers came to observe the episodes , and over time , the individual produced verbal communications that claimed to be from '' student visitor '' spiritual beings he wrote in an appendix that there were two cases that he had not explained to his satisfaction : the other exception has to do with a rather peculiar case of psychic phenomena , one which i find myself unable to classify this man is utterly unconscious , wholly oblivious to what takes place , and , unless told about it subsequently , never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities psychoanalysis , hypnosis , intensive comparison , fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought , to the way in which he has been taught , and to his entire philosophy '' sadler presented this development to the group , and they generated hundreds of questions without full seriousness , but their claim is that it resulted in the appearance of answers in the form of fully written papers they became more impressed with the quality of the answers and continued to ask questions , until all papers now collected together as the urantia book were obtained the group was known as the forum , and was formalized as a closed group of 30 members in 1925 who pledged not to discuss the material with others is noted to have composed the table of contents that is published with the book the sadlers and others involved , now all deceased , claimed that the papers of the book were physically materialized from 1925 until 1935 in a way that was not understood even by them , with the first two parts being completed in 1934 and the third and fourth in 1935 after the last of part iv was obtained in 1935 , an additional period of time supposedly took place where requests for clarifications resulted in revisions at one point wrote a draft introduction and were told that they could not add their introduction '' the communications purportedly continued for another two decades while members of the forum studied the book in depth , and according to sadler and others , permission to publish it was given to them in 1955 martin gardner states that an explanation concerning the origin of the book more plausible than celestial beings is that the contact commission , particularly william sadler , was responsible gardner 's conclusion is that a man named wilfred kellogg was the sleeping subject and authored the work from his subconscious mind , with william sadler subsequently editing and authoring parts brad gooch believes sadler wrote the book , possibly with help from others on the contact commission a statistical analysis using the mosteller and wallace methods of stylometry indicates at least nine authors were involved , and by comparatively analyzing the book against the mind at mischief , does not indicate authorship or extensive editing by sadler , without ruling out the possibility of limited edits in 1995 , maaherra won a summary judgment declaring the urantia foundation 's copyright renewal invalid four years later , in 1999 , harry mcmullan iii and the michael foundation published a book , jesus–a new revelation , which included verbatim 76 of the 196 papers included in the urantia book mcmullan and the michael foundation subsequently sought a legal declaration that the urantia foundation 's us copyright in the urantia book was either invalid or , alternatively , that the copyright had not been infringed upon court held that , since the conduit had died prior to 1983 , only the conduit 's heirs would have been eligible to renew the copyright in 1983 and , since they had not done so , the urantia foundation 's copyright on the book had expired and the book had therefore passed into the public domain topics include adam and eve , melchizedek , essays on the concept of the thought adjuster , '' religion in human experience , '' and '' personality survival according to the urantia book , god is the creator and upholder of all reality—an omniscient , omnipresent , omnipotent , infinity , and eternal spirit personality '' while stating that the concept of one god in three persons is difficult to fully understand , the book says that the idea : '' the three personalities of paradise deity are , in all universe reality reactions and in all creature relations , as one in addition , three persons of deity are described who are '' experiential , '' or incomplete and in the process of actualizing : god the supreme ; god the ultimate ; and god the absolute the persons of god the ultimate and god the absolute are considered to be remote from the possibility of comprehension and are covered on a limited basis god is described as the father of each individual , and through the direct gift of a fragment of his eternal spirit , called a thought adjuster , is said to be able to guide the individual toward an increased understanding of him the adjuster then serves noncoercively as a divine partner in the mind of the individual for the rest of life , and to the extent that a person consents with their free will to want to find god , it leads the person toward more mature , spiritualized thinking a person 's thought adjuster is described as distinct from either the soul or the conscience the soul is in essence an embryonic spiritual development , one parental factor being the divine adjuster and the other being the human will '' the book is strongly fideism and teaches that neither science nor logic will ever be able to prove or disprove the existence of god , arguing that faith is necessary to become conscious of god 's presence in human experience , the thought adjuster persistently embracing sin is considered the same as rejecting the leadings of the adjuster , rejecting the will of god constant selfishness and sinful choosing lead eventually to iniquity and full identification with unrighteousness , and since unrighteousness is unreal , it results in the eventual annihilation of the individual 's identity '' the concepts of hell and reincarnation are not taught the book says that a person ultimately is destined to fuse with his or her divine fragment and become one inseparable entity with it as the final goal of faith the hebrew prophet elijah being taken to heaven without death in '' chariots of fire '' is said to be a rare example in recorded history of a person who translated instead of experiencing death after a person fuses with his or her fragment of god , '' then will begin your real life , the ascending life , to which your present mortal state is but the vestibule '' a person continues as an ascending citizen in the universe and travels through numerous worlds on a long pilgrimage of growth and learning that eventually leads to god and residence on paradise the word '' universe '' in the book is used to denote a number of different scales of organization beyond the seven superuniverses , uninhabited '' outer space levels '' are described the term '' master universe '' refers to what in modern usage would be the total universe—all existing matter and space taken as a whole the emergence of humans is presented as having occurred about a million years ago from a branch of superior primates originating from a lemur ancestor the first humans are said to have been male and female twins called andon and fonta , born '' 993,419 years prior to 1934 the claim of revelation in the urantia book has been criticized for various reasons the authors of the urantia book assert that this harmony is evidence of the intelligent design of the universe while some in the movement believed him , others including the urantia foundation concluded grimsley 's messages were spurious , former friends eventually began to shun him , and in later years he is said to have lived in obscurity it was called the urantia book

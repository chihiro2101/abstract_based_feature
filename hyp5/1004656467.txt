the exact circumstances of the origin of the urantia book are unknown the book and its publishers do not name a human author instead , it is written as if directly presented by numerous celestial beings appointed to the task of providing an '' epochal '' religious revelation the sadlers came to observe the episodes , and over time , the individual produced verbal communications that claimed to be from '' student visitor '' spiritual beings this changed sometime in early 1925 with a '' voluminous handwritten document , '' which from then on became the regular method of purported communication in 1929 , he published a book called the mind at mischief , in which he explained the fraudulent methods of mediums and how self-deception leads to psychic claims i was brought in contact with it , in the summer of 1911 , and i have had it under my observation more or less ever since , having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions , many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes psychoanalysis , hypnosis , intensive comparison , fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought , to the way in which he has been taught , and to his entire philosophy in 1923 , a group of sadler 's friends , former patients , and colleagues began meeting for sunday philosophical and religious discussions , but became interested in the strange communications when sadler mentioned the case at their fourth meeting and read samples at their request shortly afterwards , a communication reportedly was received about which this group would be allowed to devise questions and that answers would be given by celestial beings through the '' contact personality they became more impressed with the quality of the answers and continued to ask questions , until all papers now collected together as the urantia book were obtained the group was known as the forum , and was formalized as a closed group of 30 members in 1925 who pledged not to discuss the material with others over time , some participants left and others joined , leading to a total membership of 486 people over the years from diverse backgrounds and a mix of interest levels a smaller group of five individuals called the contact commission , including the sadlers , was responsible for gathering the questions from the forum , acting as the custodians of the handwritten manuscripts that were presented as answers , and arranging for proofreading and typing of the material the sadlers and others involved , now all deceased , claimed that the papers of the book were physically materialized from 1925 until 1935 in a way that was not understood even by them , with the first two parts being completed in 1934 and the third and fourth in 1935 after the last of part iv was obtained in 1935 , an additional period of time supposedly took place where requests for clarifications resulted in revisions '' the communications purportedly continued for another two decades while members of the forum studied the book in depth , and according to sadler and others , permission to publish it was given to them in 1955 the individual is claimed to have been kept anonymous in order to prevent undesirable future veneration or reverence for him a statistical analysis using the mosteller and wallace methods of stylometry indicates at least nine authors were involved , and by comparatively analyzing the book against the mind at mischief , does not indicate authorship or extensive editing by sadler , without ruling out the possibility of limited edits in 1991 , after having compiled an index of the urantia book and distributed free copies via computer disk and printouts , kristen maaherra was sued by the urantia foundation for violating their copyright on the book upon appeal , the judgment was reversed and awarded to the urantia foundation four years later , in 1999 , harry mcmullan iii and the michael foundation published a book , jesus–a new revelation , which included verbatim 76 of the 196 papers included in the urantia book mcmullan and the michael foundation subsequently sought a legal declaration that the urantia foundation 's us copyright in the urantia book was either invalid or , alternatively , that the copyright had not been infringed upon urantia foundation 's copyright was held to have expired in 1983 because the book was deemed to have been neither a composite work nor a commissioned work for hire court held that , since the conduit had died prior to 1983 , only the conduit 's heirs would have been eligible to renew the copyright in 1983 and , since they had not done so , the urantia foundation 's copyright on the book had expired and the book had therefore passed into the public domain '' the face which the infinite turns toward all universe personalities is the face of a father , the universal father of love '' god , according to the book , is one deity who functions on a range of different levels of reality , both personal and impersonal these persons are referred to by additional titles in the book , primarily as the '' universal father , '' '' eternal son , '' and '' infinite spirit '' the father , son , and spirit are considered '' existential '' persons of deity , those in existence from the eternal past to the eternal future the persons of god the ultimate and god the absolute are considered to be remote from the possibility of comprehension and are covered on a limited basis many types of celestial beings are enumerated in the book , and one of particular note is a joint '' offspring '' of the universal father and eternal son called a '' creator son '' a divine creator son is considered the highest personification of the universal father and eternal son that is possible for people to know and : '' '' jesus of nazareth is identified as a creator son who incarnated on earth , and the central theme of the book 's section recounting his life and teachings is that the religion he preached is the highest known to the world the book says : '' but you yourself are mostly unconscious of this inner ministry '' the book is strongly fideism and teaches that neither science nor logic will ever be able to prove or disprove the existence of god , arguing that faith is necessary to become conscious of god 's presence in human experience , the thought adjuster constant selfishness and sinful choosing lead eventually to iniquity and full identification with unrighteousness , and since unrighteousness is unreal , it results in the eventual annihilation of the individual 's identity after a person fuses with his or her fragment of god , '' then will begin your real life , the ascending life , to which your present mortal state is but the vestibule '' a person continues as an ascending citizen in the universe and travels through numerous worlds on a long pilgrimage of growth and learning that eventually leads to god and residence on paradise '' the book regards human life on earth as a '' short and intense test , '' and the afterlife as a continuation of training that begins in material life the book describes that at the center of the cosmos is the stationary isle of paradise—the dwelling place of god—with paradise being surrounded by '' havona , '' an eternal universe containing a billion perfect worlds , around which seven incomplete and evolutionary '' superuniverses '' circle the term '' master universe '' refers to what in modern usage would be the total universe—all existing matter and space taken as a whole urantia is said to be located in a remote local universe named '' nebadon , '' which itself is part of superuniverse number seven , '' orvonton the first humans are said to have been male and female twins called andon and fonta , born '' 993,419 years prior to 1934 progress is said to follow a divine plan that includes periodic gifts of revelation and ministry by heavenly teachers , which eventually will lead to an ideal world status of '' light and life '' in the far distant future more than one third of the content of the urantia book is devoted to a narrative of the life and teachings of jesus , and the judeo-christian tradition is given an importance exceeding any other the following are attributed to him in both texts : he was both human and divine , the son of god incarnate who was born to mary , whose husband was joseph part iv of the book is written as a biography of jesus ' life , and some feel it is a rich narrative with well-developed characters , high attention to detail , woven sub-plots , and realistic dialogue because the book is said to have been written by the revelators by 1935 while then was not being published until 1955 , discoveries from science during the two intervening decades are often declared to be prophetic by believers , while skeptics point out that edits could have been made to the book up to its 1955 publication urantia foundation advocated a '' slow growth '' policy in the past and had not significantly marketed the book jimi carried this book with him everywhere -- along with his bob dylan songbook -- and told friends he had learned much from its pages urantia foundation , the original publisher of the urantia book , holds a united states trademark on the concentric circles , and placed a depiction of the circles on the cover of the urantia book

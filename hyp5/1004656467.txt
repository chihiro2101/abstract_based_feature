the exact circumstances of the origin of the urantia book are unknown the book and its publishers do not name a human author instead , it is written as if directly presented by numerous celestial beings appointed to the task of providing an '' epochal '' religious revelation in 1929 , he published a book called the mind at mischief , in which he explained the fraudulent methods of mediums and how self-deception leads to psychic claims in 1923 , a group of sadler 's friends , former patients , and colleagues began meeting for sunday philosophical and religious discussions , but became interested in the strange communications when sadler mentioned the case at their fourth meeting and read samples at their request '' sadler presented this development to the group , and they generated hundreds of questions without full seriousness , but their claim is that it resulted in the appearance of answers in the form of fully written papers they became more impressed with the quality of the answers and continued to ask questions , until all papers now collected together as the urantia book were obtained is noted to have composed the table of contents that is published with the book the sadlers and others involved , now all deceased , claimed that the papers of the book were physically materialized from 1925 until 1935 in a way that was not understood even by them , with the first two parts being completed in 1934 and the third and fourth in 1935 the last forum gathering was in 1942 '' the communications purportedly continued for another two decades while members of the forum studied the book in depth , and according to sadler and others , permission to publish it was given to them in 1955 the urantia foundation was formed in 1950 as a tax-exempt educational society in illinois , and through privately raised funds , the book was published on october 12 , 1955 martin gardner states that an explanation concerning the origin of the book more plausible than celestial beings is that the contact commission , particularly william sadler , was responsible in 1991 , after having compiled an index of the urantia book and distributed free copies via computer disk and printouts , kristen maaherra was sued by the urantia foundation for violating their copyright on the book in 1995 , maaherra won a summary judgment declaring the urantia foundation 's copyright renewal invalid four years later , in 1999 , harry mcmullan iii and the michael foundation published a book , jesus–a new revelation , which included verbatim 76 of the 196 papers included in the urantia book mcmullan and the michael foundation subsequently sought a legal declaration that the urantia foundation 's us copyright in the urantia book was either invalid or , alternatively , that the copyright had not been infringed upon urantia foundation 's copyright was held to have expired in 1983 because the book was deemed to have been neither a composite work nor a commissioned work for hire court held that , since the conduit had died prior to 1983 , only the conduit 's heirs would have been eligible to renew the copyright in 1983 and , since they had not done so , the urantia foundation 's copyright on the book had expired and the book had therefore passed into the public domain part iii , '' the history of urantia , '' compiles a broad history of the earth , presenting a purported explanation of the origin , evolution , and destiny of the world and its inhabitants topics include adam and eve , melchizedek , essays on the concept of the thought adjuster , '' religion in human experience , '' and '' personality survival '' the face which the infinite turns toward all universe personalities is the face of a father , the universal father of love these persons are referred to by additional titles in the book , primarily as the '' universal father , '' '' eternal son , '' and '' infinite spirit in addition , three persons of deity are described who are '' experiential , '' or incomplete and in the process of actualizing : god the supreme ; god the ultimate ; and god the absolute of these three , god the supreme , or '' the supreme being , '' is given the most explanation , as the person of deity evolving in time and space to unify finite reality and the infinite the persons of god the ultimate and god the absolute are considered to be remote from the possibility of comprehension and are covered on a limited basis many types of celestial beings are enumerated in the book , and one of particular note is a joint '' offspring '' of the universal father and eternal son called a '' creator son '' jesus of nazareth is identified as a creator son who incarnated on earth , and the central theme of the book 's section recounting his life and teachings is that the religion he preached is the highest known to the world the thought adjuster is a central teaching of the book and is also referred to as a '' mystery monitor '' and '' indwelling presence , '' as well as a '' divine spark the book says : '' but you yourself are mostly unconscious of this inner ministry '' the book says that : '' uniting with the adjuster fragment is the '' reward of the ages , '' the moment when a human personality has successfully and unalterably won eternal life , described as typically taking place in the afterlife , but also a possibility during earthly life the result during human life is a '' fusion flash , '' with the material body consumed in a fiery light and the soul '' translated '' to the afterlife the hebrew prophet elijah being taken to heaven without death in '' chariots of fire '' is said to be a rare example in recorded history of a person who translated instead of experiencing death '' the book regards human life on earth as a '' short and intense test , '' and the afterlife as a continuation of training that begins in material life the book describes that at the center of the cosmos is the stationary isle of paradise—the dwelling place of god—with paradise being surrounded by '' havona , '' an eternal universe containing a billion perfect worlds , around which seven incomplete and evolutionary '' superuniverses '' circle the word '' universe '' in the book is used to denote a number of different scales of organization '' the physical size of a local universe is not directly stated , but each is said to have up to 10 million inhabited worlds although there is the ideal and divine plan of progression , it is said to be fostered and administered by various orders of celestial beings who are not always perfect urantia is said to be a markedly '' confused and disordered '' planet that is '' greatly retarded in all phases of intellectual progress and spiritual attainment '' compared to more typical inhabited worlds , due to an unusually severe history of rebellion and default by its spiritual supervisors more than one third of the content of the urantia book is devoted to a narrative of the life and teachings of jesus , and the judeo-christian tradition is given an importance exceeding any other he performed many of the miracles described in the bible , such as the resurrection of lazarus , the turning of water into wine , the feeding of the five thousand , and numerous healings of the blind , diseased , and infirm for instance , two basic adventist beliefs that distinguish it from mainline christianity are the doctrines of soul sleeping and annihilationism , both of which the urantia book also supports the book 's claimed supernatural origin has been compared to similar claims of the book of mormon , science and health , the quran , and the bible , with belief in it not being seen as necessarily a greater leap in reason the urantia book is noted for its high level of internal consistency and an advanced writing style skeptic martin gardner , in a book otherwise highly critical of the urantia book , writes that it is '' highly imaginative '' and that the '' cosmology outrivals in fantasy the cosmology of any science-fiction work known to me '' gooch says that for nonbelievers , the book is a mixture of being '' fascinating , inspiring , compelling , haunting , entertaining , annoying , incomprehensible , and always wordy according to the book 's descriptions , the universe is hundreds of billions of years old and periodically expands and contracts — '' respires '' — at 2-billion-year intervals the urantia book states in its foreword that more than one thousand '' human concepts representing the highest and most advanced planetary knowledge of spiritual values and universe meanings '' were selected in preparing the papers '' asked by gardner what he thought of these plagiarisms , sprunger responded in a letter by saying that if humans wrote the book the plagiarisms would indeed be disturbing but not if it was written by supermortals since the book was determined to be in the public domain in 2001 , other organizations , such as the urantia book fellowship under the publishing name uversa press , have also published the book urantia foundation , the original publisher of the urantia book , holds a united states trademark on the concentric circles , and placed a depiction of the circles on the cover of the urantia book

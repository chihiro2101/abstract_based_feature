the exact circumstances of the origin of the urantia book are unknown instead , it is written as if directly presented by numerous celestial beings appointed to the task of providing an '' epochal '' religious revelation sadler and his wife lena sadler , physicians in chicago and well known in the community , are said to have been approached by a neighbor who was concerned because she would occasionally find her husband in a deep sleep and breathing abnormally the individual was never identified publicly but has been described as '' a hard-boiled business man , member of the board of trade and stock exchange he wrote in an appendix that there were two cases that he had not explained to his satisfaction : the other exception has to do with a rather peculiar case of psychic phenomena , one which i find myself unable to classify this man is utterly unconscious , wholly oblivious to what takes place , and , unless told about it subsequently , never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities psychoanalysis , hypnosis , intensive comparison , fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought , to the way in which he has been taught , and to his entire philosophy in 1923 , a group of sadler 's friends , former patients , and colleagues began meeting for sunday philosophical and religious discussions , but became interested in the strange communications when sadler mentioned the case at their fourth meeting and read samples at their request shortly afterwards , a communication reportedly was received about which this group would be allowed to devise questions and that answers would be given by celestial beings through the '' contact personality '' sadler presented this development to the group , and they generated hundreds of questions without full seriousness , but their claim is that it resulted in the appearance of answers in the form of fully written papers they became more impressed with the quality of the answers and continued to ask questions , until all papers now collected together as the urantia book were obtained the group was known as the forum , and was formalized as a closed group of 30 members in 1925 who pledged not to discuss the material with others a smaller group of five individuals called the contact commission , including the sadlers , was responsible for gathering the questions from the forum , acting as the custodians of the handwritten manuscripts that were presented as answers , and arranging for proofreading and typing of the material is noted to have composed the table of contents that is published with the book after the last of part iv was obtained in 1935 , an additional period of time supposedly took place where requests for clarifications resulted in revisions '' the communications purportedly continued for another two decades while members of the forum studied the book in depth , and according to sadler and others , permission to publish it was given to them in 1955 only the members of the contact commission witnessed the activities of the '' sleeping subject '' , and only they knew his identity martin gardner states that an explanation concerning the origin of the book more plausible than celestial beings is that the contact commission , particularly william sadler , was responsible gardner 's conclusion is that a man named wilfred kellogg was the sleeping subject and authored the work from his subconscious mind , with william sadler subsequently editing and authoring parts brad gooch believes sadler wrote the book , possibly with help from others on the contact commission in 1991 , after having compiled an index of the urantia book and distributed free copies via computer disk and printouts , kristen maaherra was sued by the urantia foundation for violating their copyright on the book four years later , in 1999 , harry mcmullan iii and the michael foundation published a book , jesus–a new revelation , which included verbatim 76 of the 196 papers included in the urantia book urantia foundation 's copyright was held to have expired in 1983 because the book was deemed to have been neither a composite work nor a commissioned work for hire court held that , since the conduit had died prior to 1983 , only the conduit 's heirs would have been eligible to renew the copyright in 1983 and , since they had not done so , the urantia foundation 's copyright on the book had expired and the book had therefore passed into the public domain part iii , '' the history of urantia , '' compiles a broad history of the earth , presenting a purported explanation of the origin , evolution , and destiny of the world and its inhabitants '' part iv , '' the life and teachings of jesus , '' is the largest part at 775 pages , and is often noted as the most accessible and most impressive , narrating a detailed biography of jesus that includes his childhood , teenage years , family life , and public ministry , as well as the events that led to his crucifixion , death , and resurrection according to the urantia book , god is the creator and upholder of all reality—an omniscient , omnipresent , omnipotent , infinity , and eternal spirit personality these persons are referred to by additional titles in the book , primarily as the '' universal father , '' '' eternal son , '' and '' infinite spirit '' while stating that the concept of one god in three persons is difficult to fully understand , the book says that the idea : '' the three personalities of paradise deity are , in all universe reality reactions and in all creature relations , as one '' the father , son , and spirit are considered '' existential '' persons of deity , those in existence from the eternal past to the eternal future of these three , god the supreme , or '' the supreme being , '' is given the most explanation , as the person of deity evolving in time and space to unify finite reality and the infinite many types of celestial beings are enumerated in the book , and one of particular note is a joint '' offspring '' of the universal father and eternal son called a '' creator son '' a divine creator son is considered the highest personification of the universal father and eternal son that is possible for people to know and : '' the soul is in essence an embryonic spiritual development , one parental factor being the divine adjuster and the other being the human will you are quite incapable of distinguishing the product of your own material intellect from that of the conjoint activities of your soul and the adjuster the book says that a person ultimately is destined to fuse with his or her divine fragment and become one inseparable entity with it as the final goal of faith after a person fuses with his or her fragment of god , '' then will begin your real life , the ascending life , to which your present mortal state is but the vestibule '' the book regards human life on earth as a '' short and intense test , '' and the afterlife as a continuation of training that begins in material life the book describes that at the center of the cosmos is the stationary isle of paradise—the dwelling place of god—with paradise being surrounded by '' havona , '' an eternal universe containing a billion perfect worlds , around which seven incomplete and evolutionary '' superuniverses '' circle '' the physical size of a local universe is not directly stated , but each is said to have up to 10 million inhabited worlds progress is said to follow a divine plan that includes periodic gifts of revelation and ministry by heavenly teachers , which eventually will lead to an ideal world status of '' light and life '' in the far distant future although there is the ideal and divine plan of progression , it is said to be fostered and administered by various orders of celestial beings who are not always perfect urantia is said to be a markedly '' confused and disordered '' planet that is '' greatly retarded in all phases of intellectual progress and spiritual attainment '' compared to more typical inhabited worlds , due to an unusually severe history of rebellion and default by its spiritual supervisors more than one third of the content of the urantia book is devoted to a narrative of the life and teachings of jesus , and the judeo-christian tradition is given an importance exceeding any other the book 's teachings claim to be a clarification and expansion of christian belief however , numerous differences are noted between its teachings and commonly accepted christian doctrines sadler also wrote eugenics works that contain similar arguments to some ideas presented in the urantia book for instance , gardner and block note that paper 85 appears to have been taken from the first eight chapters of origin and evolution of religion by edward washburn hopkins , published by yale university press in 1923 since the book was determined to be in the public domain in 2001 , other organizations , such as the urantia book fellowship under the publishing name uversa press , have also published the book urantia foundation , the original publisher of the urantia book , holds a united states trademark on the concentric circles , and placed a depiction of the circles on the cover of the urantia book

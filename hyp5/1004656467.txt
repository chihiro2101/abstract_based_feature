the exact circumstances of the origin of the urantia book are unknown the book and its publishers do not name a human author instead , it is written as if directly presented by numerous celestial beings appointed to the task of providing an '' epochal '' religious revelation the sadlers came to observe the episodes , and over time , the individual produced verbal communications that claimed to be from '' student visitor '' spiritual beings '' the sadlers were both respected physicians , and william sadler was a sometime debunker of paranormal claims he wrote in an appendix that there were two cases that he had not explained to his satisfaction : the other exception has to do with a rather peculiar case of psychic phenomena , one which i find myself unable to classify i was brought in contact with it , in the summer of 1911 , and i have had it under my observation more or less ever since , having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions , many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes psychoanalysis , hypnosis , intensive comparison , fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind shortly afterwards , a communication reportedly was received about which this group would be allowed to devise questions and that answers would be given by celestial beings through the '' contact personality '' sadler presented this development to the group , and they generated hundreds of questions without full seriousness , but their claim is that it resulted in the appearance of answers in the form of fully written papers they became more impressed with the quality of the answers and continued to ask questions , until all papers now collected together as the urantia book were obtained the group was known as the forum , and was formalized as a closed group of 30 members in 1925 who pledged not to discuss the material with others is noted to have composed the table of contents that is published with the book the sadlers and others involved , now all deceased , claimed that the papers of the book were physically materialized from 1925 until 1935 in a way that was not understood even by them , with the first two parts being completed in 1934 and the third and fourth in 1935 after the last of part iv was obtained in 1935 , an additional period of time supposedly took place where requests for clarifications resulted in revisions '' the communications purportedly continued for another two decades while members of the forum studied the book in depth , and according to sadler and others , permission to publish it was given to them in 1955 the urantia foundation was formed in 1950 as a tax-exempt educational society in illinois , and through privately raised funds , the book was published on october 12 , 1955 the individual is claimed to have been kept anonymous in order to prevent undesirable future veneration or reverence for him in 1991 , after having compiled an index of the urantia book and distributed free copies via computer disk and printouts , kristen maaherra was sued by the urantia foundation for violating their copyright on the book in 1995 , maaherra won a summary judgment declaring the urantia foundation 's copyright renewal invalid upon appeal , the judgment was reversed and awarded to the urantia foundation four years later , in 1999 , harry mcmullan iii and the michael foundation published a book , jesus–a new revelation , which included verbatim 76 of the 196 papers included in the urantia book urantia foundation 's copyright was held to have expired in 1983 because the book was deemed to have been neither a composite work nor a commissioned work for hire part iii , '' the history of urantia , '' compiles a broad history of the earth , presenting a purported explanation of the origin , evolution , and destiny of the world and its inhabitants topics include adam and eve , melchizedek , essays on the concept of the thought adjuster , '' religion in human experience , '' and '' personality survival according to the urantia book , god is the creator and upholder of all reality—an omniscient , omnipresent , omnipotent , infinity , and eternal spirit personality '' god , according to the book , is one deity who functions on a range of different levels of reality , both personal and impersonal god is taught to exist in a trinity of three perfectly individualized persons who are co-equal : god the father , god the son , and god the spirit these persons are referred to by additional titles in the book , primarily as the '' universal father , '' '' eternal son , '' and '' infinite spirit '' while stating that the concept of one god in three persons is difficult to fully understand , the book says that the idea : '' the three personalities of paradise deity are , in all universe reality reactions and in all creature relations , as one '' the father , son , and spirit are considered '' existential '' persons of deity , those in existence from the eternal past to the eternal future of these three , god the supreme , or '' the supreme being , '' is given the most explanation , as the person of deity evolving in time and space to unify finite reality and the infinite many types of celestial beings are enumerated in the book , and one of particular note is a joint '' offspring '' of the universal father and eternal son called a '' creator son '' a divine creator son is considered the highest personification of the universal father and eternal son that is possible for people to know and : '' '' jesus of nazareth is identified as a creator son who incarnated on earth , and the central theme of the book 's section recounting his life and teachings is that the religion he preached is the highest known to the world '' the idea is compared within the book to the hindu atman and the ancient egyptian ka uniting with the adjuster fragment is the '' reward of the ages , '' the moment when a human personality has successfully and unalterably won eternal life , described as typically taking place in the afterlife , but also a possibility during earthly life the result during human life is a '' fusion flash , '' with the material body consumed in a fiery light and the soul '' translated '' to the afterlife '' the book regards human life on earth as a '' short and intense test , '' and the afterlife as a continuation of training that begins in material life the term '' master universe '' refers to what in modern usage would be the total universe—all existing matter and space taken as a whole '' the urantia book teaches not only biological evolution , but that human society and spiritual understandings evolve by slow progression , subject both to periods of rapid improvement and the possibility of retrogression more than one third of the content of the urantia book is devoted to a narrative of the life and teachings of jesus , and the judeo-christian tradition is given an importance exceeding any other jesus is considered the human incarnation of '' michael of nebadon , '' one of more than 700,000 '' paradise sons '' of god , or '' creator sons gardner notes similarities between seventh-day adventism and the teachings of the urantia book , and sees this as evidence that william sadler and wilfred kellogg had a role in editing or writing the book , since they both were one-time believers in adventism for instance , two basic adventist beliefs that distinguish it from mainline christianity are the doctrines of soul sleeping and annihilationism , both of which the urantia book also supports comparisons with facets of various world religions are incorporated in the book , including buddhism , islam , taoism , judaism , hinduism , shinto , and confucianism because the book is said to have been written by the revelators by 1935 while then was not being published until 1955 , discoveries from science during the two intervening decades are often declared to be prophetic by believers , while skeptics point out that edits could have been made to the book up to its 1955 publication readers sometimes join study groups after reading on their own for years or decades , others join them soon after developing an interest in the book , while '' for most , worship remains as individual as the act of reading the movement inspired by the urantia book has not developed clergy or institutions such as churches , or temples it was called the urantia book urantia foundation , the original publisher of the urantia book , holds a united states trademark on the concentric circles , and placed a depiction of the circles on the cover of the urantia book

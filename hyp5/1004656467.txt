instead , it is written as if directly presented by numerous celestial beings appointed to the task of providing an '' epochal '' religious revelation sadler and his wife lena sadler , physicians in chicago and well known in the community , are said to have been approached by a neighbor who was concerned because she would occasionally find her husband in a deep sleep and breathing abnormally '' the sadlers were both respected physicians , and william sadler was a sometime debunker of paranormal claims he wrote in an appendix that there were two cases that he had not explained to his satisfaction : the other exception has to do with a rather peculiar case of psychic phenomena , one which i find myself unable to classify i was brought in contact with it , in the summer of 1911 , and i have had it under my observation more or less ever since , having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions , many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes psychoanalysis , hypnosis , intensive comparison , fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought , to the way in which he has been taught , and to his entire philosophy '' sadler presented this development to the group , and they generated hundreds of questions without full seriousness , but their claim is that it resulted in the appearance of answers in the form of fully written papers they became more impressed with the quality of the answers and continued to ask questions , until all papers now collected together as the urantia book were obtained the sadlers and others involved , now all deceased , claimed that the papers of the book were physically materialized from 1925 until 1935 in a way that was not understood even by them , with the first two parts being completed in 1934 and the third and fourth in 1935 '' the communications purportedly continued for another two decades while members of the forum studied the book in depth , and according to sadler and others , permission to publish it was given to them in 1955 martin gardner states that an explanation concerning the origin of the book more plausible than celestial beings is that the contact commission , particularly william sadler , was responsible brad gooch believes sadler wrote the book , possibly with help from others on the contact commission in 1991 , after having compiled an index of the urantia book and distributed free copies via computer disk and printouts , kristen maaherra was sued by the urantia foundation for violating their copyright on the book upon appeal , the judgment was reversed and awarded to the urantia foundation four years later , in 1999 , harry mcmullan iii and the michael foundation published a book , jesus–a new revelation , which included verbatim 76 of the 196 papers included in the urantia book mcmullan and the michael foundation subsequently sought a legal declaration that the urantia foundation 's us copyright in the urantia book was either invalid or , alternatively , that the copyright had not been infringed upon it presents narratives on the inhabitants of local universes and their work as it is coordinated with a scheme of spiritual ascension and progression of different orders of beings , including humans , angels , and others part iii , '' the history of urantia , '' compiles a broad history of the earth , presenting a purported explanation of the origin , evolution , and destiny of the world and its inhabitants topics include adam and eve , melchizedek , essays on the concept of the thought adjuster , '' religion in human experience , '' and '' personality survival according to the urantia book , god is the creator and upholder of all reality—an omniscient , omnipresent , omnipotent , infinity , and eternal spirit personality the most fundamental teaching about god in the book is that he is a father '' god , according to the book , is one deity who functions on a range of different levels of reality , both personal and impersonal these persons are referred to by additional titles in the book , primarily as the '' universal father , '' '' eternal son , '' and '' infinite spirit '' while stating that the concept of one god in three persons is difficult to fully understand , the book says that the idea : '' the persons of god the ultimate and god the absolute are considered to be remote from the possibility of comprehension and are covered on a limited basis '' jesus of nazareth is identified as a creator son who incarnated on earth , and the central theme of the book 's section recounting his life and teachings is that the religion he preached is the highest known to the world the final paper states : the thought adjuster is a central teaching of the book and is also referred to as a '' mystery monitor '' and '' indwelling presence , '' as well as a '' divine spark a person 's thought adjuster is described as distinct from either the soul or the conscience in the urantia book ' s teachings , the degree to which a human mind chooses to accept its adjuster 's guidance becomes the degree to which a person 's soul '' grows '' and becomes a reality that can then survive death the soul is in essence an embryonic spiritual development , one parental factor being the divine adjuster and the other being the human will '' the book is strongly fideism and teaches that neither science nor logic will ever be able to prove or disprove the existence of god , arguing that faith is necessary to become conscious of god 's presence in human experience , the thought adjuster the book says that a person ultimately is destined to fuse with his or her divine fragment and become one inseparable entity with it as the final goal of faith uniting with the adjuster fragment is the '' reward of the ages , '' the moment when a human personality has successfully and unalterably won eternal life , described as typically taking place in the afterlife , but also a possibility during earthly life after a person fuses with his or her fragment of god , '' then will begin your real life , the ascending life , to which your present mortal state is but the vestibule the '' religion of jesus '' is considered to be practiced by way of loving god the father , thereby learning to love each person the way jesus loves people ; that is , recognizing the '' fatherhood of god and its correlated truth , the brotherhood of man , '' resulting in unselfish service to others urantia is said to be located in a remote local universe named '' nebadon , '' which itself is part of superuniverse number seven , '' orvonton urantia is said to be a markedly '' confused and disordered '' planet that is '' greatly retarded in all phases of intellectual progress and spiritual attainment '' compared to more typical inhabited worlds , due to an unusually severe history of rebellion and default by its spiritual supervisors more than one third of the content of the urantia book is devoted to a narrative of the life and teachings of jesus , and the judeo-christian tradition is given an importance exceeding any other the book 's teachings claim to be a clarification and expansion of christian belief however , numerous differences are noted between its teachings and commonly accepted christian doctrines the crucifixion is taught to be an outcome of the fears of religious leaders of the day , who regarded his teachings as a threat to their positions of authority lewis notes that from the perspective of the book being a '' revelation , '' it could be claimed the '' celestial beings '' simply found areas of adventist belief to be accurate and therefore presented and expanded on them '' the stance of the book is that there '' is not a urantia religion that could not profitably study and assimilate the best of the truths contained in every other faith the urantia book has been enjoyed by some as a form of science fiction , historical fiction or fantasy part iv of the book is written as a biography of jesus ' life , and some feel it is a rich narrative with well-developed characters , high attention to detail , woven sub-plots , and realistic dialogue '' mcmenamin also states , '' of course i am being selective here in my choice of quotations , and there are reams of scientifically untenable material in the urantia book '' disagreements over the legal ownership of the book , its interpretation , and the reception of new revelations have led to some splintering , though these disagreements appear to have been settled to the satisfaction of most adherents delevin ) , and niánn emerson chase ( born nancy emerson chase ) , study the urantia book and the cosmic family volumes ( which are the continuation of the fifth epochal revelation ) urantia foundation , the original publisher of the urantia book , holds a united states trademark on the concentric circles , and placed a depiction of the circles on the cover of the urantia book the circles are also used to indicate other organizations affiliated with urantia foundation .

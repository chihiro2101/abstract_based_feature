a social group exhibits some degree of social cohesion and is more than a simple collection or aggregate of individuals , such as people waiting at a bus stop , or people waiting in a line characteristics shared by members of a group may include interests , values , representations , ethnic or social background , and kinship ties kinship ties being a social bond based on common ancestry , marriage , or adoption in a similar vein , some researchers consider the defining characteristic of a group as social interaction according to dunbar 's number , on average , people can not maintain stable social relationships with more than 150 individuals it succeeds in providing the researcher with the tools required to answer three important questions : '' how is a group formed ? '' '' how does a group function ? '' '' how does one describe those social interactions that occur on the way to forming a group ? '' the attention of those who use , participate in , or study groups has focused on functioning groups , on larger organizations , or on the decisions made in these organizations some of the earliest efforts to understand these social units have been the extensive descriptions of urban street gangs in the 1920s and 1930s , continuing through the 1950s , which understood them to be largely reactions to the established authority the primary goal of gang members was to defend gang territory , and to define and maintain the dominance structure within the gang however , these studies and the continued interest have not improved the capacity to influence gang behavior or to reduce gang related violence the relevant literature on ethology , such as work on territory and dominance , has been available since the 1950s of course , while this is true , it is equally likely that the study of the social ( group ) behaviors of other animals might shed light on the evolutionary roots of social behavior in people but these social behaviors and interactions between human individuals play a special role in the study of groups : they are necessarily prior to the formation of groups coming to understand territorial and dominance behaviors may thus help to clarify the development , functioning , and productivity of groups explicitly contrasted against a social cohesion based definition for social groups is the social identity approach , which draws on insights made in social identity theory an integrative theory of intergroup conflict while the roots of this approach to social groups had its foundations in social identity theory , more concerted exploration of these ideas occurred later in the form of self-categorization theory in his text , group dynamics , forsyth ( 2010 ) discuses several common characteristics of groups that can help to define them research by bales ( cite , 1950 , 1999 ) determine that there are two main types of interactions ; relationship interactions and task interactions for example , a sports team would have a relatively high level of interdependence as compared to a group of people watching a movie at the movie theater also , interdependence may be mutual ( flowing back and forth between members ) or more linear/unilateral for example , some group members may be more dependent on their boss than the boss is on each of the individuals roles involve the expected performance and conduct of people within the group depending on their status or position within the group norms are the ideas adopted by the group pertaining to acceptable and unacceptable conduct by members group structure is a very important part of a group if people fail to meet their expectations within to groups , and fulfil their roles , they may not accept the group , or be accepted by other group members when people speak of groups , they speak of the group as a whole , or an entity , rather than speaking of it in terms of individuals such groups may act as the principal source of socialization for individuals as primary groups may shape an individual ’ s attitudes , values , and social orientation primary groups are small , long-term groups three sub-groups of primary groups are : litwak , eugene , and iván szelényi '' primary group structures and their functions : kin , neighbors , and friends , social categories of which one is not a member ) to become ingroup members ( i.e those with negative or 'mixed ' experiences with previous groups will likely be more deliberate in their assessment of potential groups to join , and with which groups they choose to join initiation is also important for recruitment because it can mitigate any cognitive dissonance in potential group members as described above , these may or may not develop into groups for a functioning group to attempt to add new members in a casual way is a certain prescription for failure , loss of efficiency , or disorganization the number of functioning members in a group can be reasonably flexible between five and ten , and a long-standing cohesive group may be able to tolerate a few hangers on weakening of the common purpose once a group is well established can be attributed to : adding new members ; unsettled conflicts of identities ( i.e

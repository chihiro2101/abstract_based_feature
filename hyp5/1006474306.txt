a social group exhibits some degree of social cohesion and is more than a simple collection or aggregate of individuals , such as people waiting at a bus stop , or people waiting in a line characteristics shared by members of a group may include interests , values , representations , ethnic or social background , and kinship ties kinship ties being a social bond based on common ancestry , marriage , or adoption in a similar vein , some researchers consider the defining characteristic of a group as social interaction according to dunbar 's number , on average , people can not maintain stable social relationships with more than 150 individuals social psychologist muzafer sherif proposed to define a social unit as a number of individuals interacting with each other with respect to : muzafer sherif , and carolyn sherif , an outline of social psychology ( rev roles established status ( social rank , dominance ) relationships accepted norms and values with reference to matters relevant to the group development of accepted sanctions ( praise and punishment ) if and when norms were respected or violated this definition is long and complex , but it is also precise it succeeds in providing the researcher with the tools required to answer three important questions : '' how is a group formed ? '' '' how does a group function ? '' '' how does one describe those social interactions that occur on the way to forming a group ? '' the attention of those who use , participate in , or study groups has focused on functioning groups , on larger organizations , or on the decisions made in these organizations much less attention has been paid to the more ubiquitous and universal social behaviors that do not clearly demonstrate one or more of the five necessary elements described by sherif some of the earliest efforts to understand these social units have been the extensive descriptions of urban street gangs in the 1920s and 1930s , continuing through the 1950s , which understood them to be largely reactions to the established authority the primary goal of gang members was to defend gang territory , and to define and maintain the dominance structure within the gang there remains in the popular media and urban law enforcement agencies an avid interest in gangs , reflected in daily headlines which emphasize the criminal aspects of gang behavior indeed , vast literature on organization , property , law enforcement , ownership , religion , warfare , values , conflict resolution , authority , rights , and families have grown and evolved without any reference to any analogous social behaviors in animals of course , while this is true , it is equally likely that the study of the social ( group ) behaviors of other animals might shed light on the evolutionary roots of social behavior in people but these social behaviors and interactions between human individuals play a special role in the study of groups : they are necessarily prior to the formation of groups an adequately functioning individual identity is necessary before an individual can function in a division of labor ( role ) , and hence , within a cohesive group coming to understand territorial and dominance behaviors may thus help to clarify the development , functioning , and productivity of groups explicitly contrasted against a social cohesion based definition for social groups is the social identity approach , which draws on insights made in social identity theory monterey , ca : brooks/cole here , rather than defining a social group based on expressions of cohesive social relationships between individuals , the social identity model assumes that '' psychological group membership has primarily a perceptual or cognitive basis '' it posits that the necessary and sufficient condition for individuals to act as group members is '' awareness of a common category membership '' and that a social group can be '' usefully conceptualized as a number of individuals who have internalized the same social category membership as a component of their self concept european journal of social psychology , 2 , 149–78 , also problematic for the social cohesion account is recent research showing that seemingly meaningless categorization can be an antecedent of perceptions of interdependence with fellow category members this group component varies greatly , including verbal or non-verbal communication , social loafing , networking , forming bonds , etc ” task interactions : “ actions performed by group members that pertain to the group ’ s projects , tasks , and goals the circumplex model of group tasks by joseph mcgrath organizes group related tasks and goals groups may focus on several of these goals , or one area at a time “ the state of being dependent , to some degree , on other people , as when one ’ s outcomes , actions , thoughts , feelings , and experiences are determined in whole or part by others for example , a sports team would have a relatively high level of interdependence as compared to a group of people watching a movie at the movie theater roles involve the expected performance and conduct of people within the group depending on their status or position within the group if people fail to meet their expectations within to groups , and fulfil their roles , they may not accept the group , or be accepted by other group members the social groups people are involved with in the workplace directly affect their health niklas steffens '' social identification contributes to both psychological and physiological health , but the health benefits are stronger for psychological health '' the social relationship of marriage is the most studied of all , the marital history over the course of one 's life can form differing health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease , chronic conditions , mobility limitations , self-rated health , and depressive symptoms social connectedness also plays a large part in overcoming mental afflictions such as drug , alcohol , or substance abuse if a group is highly cohesive , it will likely engage in processes that contribute to cohesion levels , especially when recruiting new members , who can add to a group 's cohesion , or destabilize it productive group cooperation requires that both dominance order and territorial arrangements ( identity , self-concept ) be settled with respect to the common goal and within the particular group the key concept is that the value and success of a group is obtained by each member maintaining a distinct , functioning identity in the minds of each of the members

a social group exhibits some degree of social cohesion and is more than a simple collection or aggregate of individuals , such as people waiting at a bus stop , or people waiting in a line characteristics shared by members of a group may include interests , values , representations , ethnic or social background , and kinship ties kinship ties being a social bond based on common ancestry , marriage , or adoption in a similar vein , some researchers consider the defining characteristic of a group as social interaction according to dunbar 's number , on average , people can not maintain stable social relationships with more than 150 individuals it succeeds in providing the researcher with the tools required to answer three important questions : '' how is a group formed ? '' '' how does a group function ? '' '' how does one describe those social interactions that occur on the way to forming a group ? '' much less attention has been paid to the more ubiquitous and universal social behaviors that do not clearly demonstrate one or more of the five necessary elements described by sherif some of the earliest efforts to understand these social units have been the extensive descriptions of urban street gangs in the 1920s and 1930s , continuing through the 1950s , which understood them to be largely reactions to the established authority the primary goal of gang members was to defend gang territory , and to define and maintain the dominance structure within the gang this disconnect may be the result of the belief that social behavior in humankind is radically different from the social behavior in animals because of the human capacity for language use and rationality of course , while this is true , it is equally likely that the study of the social ( group ) behaviors of other animals might shed light on the evolutionary roots of social behavior in people but these social behaviors and interactions between human individuals play a special role in the study of groups : they are necessarily prior to the formation of groups the psychological internalization of territorial and dominance experiences in conscious and unconscious memory are established through the formation of social identity , personal identity , body concept , or self-concept coming to understand territorial and dominance behaviors may thus help to clarify the development , functioning , and productivity of groups explicitly contrasted against a social cohesion based definition for social groups is the social identity approach , which draws on insights made in social identity theory ) , the social psychology of intergroup relations '' it posits that the necessary and sufficient condition for individuals to act as group members is '' awareness of a common category membership '' and that a social group can be '' usefully conceptualized as a number of individuals who have internalized the same social category membership as a component of their self concept '' social categorization and intergroup behaviour '' european journal of social psychology , 2 , 149–78 , also problematic for the social cohesion account is recent research showing that seemingly meaningless categorization can be an antecedent of perceptions of interdependence with fellow category members while the roots of this approach to social groups had its foundations in social identity theory , more concerted exploration of these ideas occurred later in the form of self-categorization theory ” task interactions : “ actions performed by group members that pertain to the group ’ s projects , tasks , and goals for example , a sports team would have a relatively high level of interdependence as compared to a group of people watching a movie at the movie theater also , interdependence may be mutual ( flowing back and forth between members ) or more linear/unilateral roles involve the expected performance and conduct of people within the group depending on their status or position within the group group structure is a very important part of a group when viewed holistically , a group is greater than the sum of its individual parts when people speak of groups , they speak of the group as a whole , or an entity , rather than speaking of it in terms of individuals there are four main types of groups : 1 ) primary groups , 2 ) social groups , 3 ) collectives , and 4 ) categories such groups may act as the principal source of socialization for individuals as primary groups may shape an individual ’ s attitudes , values , and social orientation , social categories of which one is not a member ) to become ingroup members ( i.e categories consist of individuals that are similar to one another in a certain way , and members of this group can be permanent ingroup members or temporary ingroup members niklas steffens '' social identification contributes to both psychological and physiological health , but the health benefits are stronger for psychological health '' the social relationships people have can be linked to different health conditions productive group cooperation requires that both dominance order and territorial arrangements ( identity , self-concept ) be settled with respect to the common goal and within the particular group not all larger social structures require the cohesion that may be found in the small group the number of functioning members in a group can be reasonably flexible between five and ten , and a long-standing cohesive group may be able to tolerate a few hangers on the loss of the leader tends to dissolve all dominance relationships , as well as weakening dedication to common purpose , differentiation of roles , and maintenance of norms

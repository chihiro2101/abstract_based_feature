a social group exhibits some degree of social cohesion and is more than a simple collection or aggregate of individuals , such as people waiting at a bus stop , or people waiting in a line characteristics shared by members of a group may include interests , values , representations , ethnic or social background , and kinship ties in a similar vein , some researchers consider the defining characteristic of a group as social interaction social psychologist muzafer sherif proposed to define a social unit as a number of individuals interacting with each other with respect to : muzafer sherif , and carolyn sherif , an outline of social psychology ( rev it succeeds in providing the researcher with the tools required to answer three important questions : '' how is a group formed ? '' '' how does a group function ? '' '' how does one describe those social interactions that occur on the way to forming a group ? '' much less attention has been paid to the more ubiquitous and universal social behaviors that do not clearly demonstrate one or more of the five necessary elements described by sherif some of the earliest efforts to understand these social units have been the extensive descriptions of urban street gangs in the 1920s and 1930s , continuing through the 1950s , which understood them to be largely reactions to the established authority the relevant literature on ethology , such as work on territory and dominance , has been available since the 1950s indeed , vast literature on organization , property , law enforcement , ownership , religion , warfare , values , conflict resolution , authority , rights , and families have grown and evolved without any reference to any analogous social behaviors in animals this disconnect may be the result of the belief that social behavior in humankind is radically different from the social behavior in animals because of the human capacity for language use and rationality of course , while this is true , it is equally likely that the study of the social ( group ) behaviors of other animals might shed light on the evolutionary roots of social behavior in people but these social behaviors and interactions between human individuals play a special role in the study of groups : they are necessarily prior to the formation of groups an adequately functioning individual identity is necessary before an individual can function in a division of labor ( role ) , and hence , within a cohesive group explicitly contrasted against a social cohesion based definition for social groups is the social identity approach , which draws on insights made in social identity theory ) , the social psychology of intergroup relations monterey , ca : brooks/cole here , rather than defining a social group based on expressions of cohesive social relationships between individuals , the social identity model assumes that '' psychological group membership has primarily a perceptual or cognitive basis '' it posits that the necessary and sufficient condition for individuals to act as group members is '' awareness of a common category membership '' and that a social group can be '' usefully conceptualized as a number of individuals who have internalized the same social category membership as a component of their self concept for example , it has been shown that the mere act of allocating individuals to explicitly random categories is sufficient to lead individuals to act in an ingroup favouring fashion ( even where no individual self-interest is possible ) in his text , group dynamics , forsyth ( 2010 ) discuses several common characteristics of groups that can help to define them ” task interactions : “ actions performed by group members that pertain to the group ’ s projects , tasks , and goals groups may focus on several of these goals , or one area at a time the model divides group goals into four main types , which are further sub-categorized generating : coming up with ideas and plans to reach goals planning tasks creativity tasks choosing : selecting a solution for example , a sports team would have a relatively high level of interdependence as compared to a group of people watching a movie at the movie theater for example , some group members may be more dependent on their boss than the boss is on each of the individuals roles involve the expected performance and conduct of people within the group depending on their status or position within the group if people fail to meet their expectations within to groups , and fulfil their roles , they may not accept the group , or be accepted by other group members ” several factors play a part in this image of unity , including group cohesiveness , and entitativity ( appearance of cohesion by outsiders ) there are four main types of groups : 1 ) primary groups , 2 ) social groups , 3 ) collectives , and 4 ) categories social groups are also small groups but are of moderate duration in this type of group , it is possible for outgroup members ( i.e , social categories of which one is not a member ) to become ingroup members ( i.e categories consist of individuals that are similar to one another in a certain way , and members of this group can be permanent ingroup members or temporary ingroup members this group is generally the largest type of group social groups tend to form based on certain principles of attraction , that draw individuals to affiliate with each other , eventually forming a group in all groups , formal and informal initiations add to a group 's cohesion and strengthens the bond between the individual and group by demonstrating the exclusiveness of group membership as well as the recruit 's dedication to the group the number of functioning members in a group can be reasonably flexible between five and ten , and a long-standing cohesive group may be able to tolerate a few hangers on the most common symptoms of a troubled group are loss of efficiency , diminished participation , or weakening of purpose , as well as an increase in verbal aggression

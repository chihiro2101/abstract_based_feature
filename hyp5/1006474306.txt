a social group exhibits some degree of social cohesion and is more than a simple collection or aggregate of individuals , such as people waiting at a bus stop , or people waiting in a line characteristics shared by members of a group may include interests , values , representations , ethnic or social background , and kinship ties kinship ties being a social bond based on common ancestry , marriage , or adoption in a similar vein , some researchers consider the defining characteristic of a group as social interaction social psychologist muzafer sherif proposed to define a social unit as a number of individuals interacting with each other with respect to : muzafer sherif , and carolyn sherif , an outline of social psychology ( rev roles established status ( social rank , dominance ) relationships accepted norms and values with reference to matters relevant to the group development of accepted sanctions ( praise and punishment ) if and when norms were respected or violated this definition is long and complex , but it is also precise it succeeds in providing the researcher with the tools required to answer three important questions : '' how is a group formed ? '' '' how does a group function ? '' '' how does one describe those social interactions that occur on the way to forming a group ? '' the attention of those who use , participate in , or study groups has focused on functioning groups , on larger organizations , or on the decisions made in these organizations much less attention has been paid to the more ubiquitous and universal social behaviors that do not clearly demonstrate one or more of the five necessary elements described by sherif the primary goal of gang members was to defend gang territory , and to define and maintain the dominance structure within the gang however , these studies and the continued interest have not improved the capacity to influence gang behavior or to reduce gang related violence indeed , vast literature on organization , property , law enforcement , ownership , religion , warfare , values , conflict resolution , authority , rights , and families have grown and evolved without any reference to any analogous social behaviors in animals of course , while this is true , it is equally likely that the study of the social ( group ) behaviors of other animals might shed light on the evolutionary roots of social behavior in people the psychological internalization of territorial and dominance experiences in conscious and unconscious memory are established through the formation of social identity , personal identity , body concept , or self-concept coming to understand territorial and dominance behaviors may thus help to clarify the development , functioning , and productivity of groups explicitly contrasted against a social cohesion based definition for social groups is the social identity approach , which draws on insights made in social identity theory ) , the social psychology of intergroup relations monterey , ca : brooks/cole here , rather than defining a social group based on expressions of cohesive social relationships between individuals , the social identity model assumes that '' psychological group membership has primarily a perceptual or cognitive basis '' it posits that the necessary and sufficient condition for individuals to act as group members is '' awareness of a common category membership '' and that a social group can be '' usefully conceptualized as a number of individuals who have internalized the same social category membership as a component of their self concept '' stated otherwise , while the social cohesion approach expects group members to ask '' who am i attracted to ? '' , the social identity perspective expects group members to simply ask '' who am i ? '' empirical support for the social identity perspective on groups was initially drawn from work using the minimal group paradigm '' social categorization and intergroup behaviour '' while the roots of this approach to social groups had its foundations in social identity theory , more concerted exploration of these ideas occurred later in the form of self-categorization theory ( 1987 ) rediscovering the social group : a self-categorization theory in his text , group dynamics , forsyth ( 2010 ) discuses several common characteristics of groups that can help to define them relationship interactions : “ actions performed by group members that relate to or influence the emotional and interpersonal bonds within the group , including both positive actions ( social support , consideration ) and negative actions ( criticism , conflict ) ” task interactions : “ actions performed by group members that pertain to the group ’ s projects , tasks , and goals the circumplex model of group tasks by joseph mcgrath organizes group related tasks and goals for example , a sports team would have a relatively high level of interdependence as compared to a group of people watching a movie at the movie theater also , interdependence may be mutual ( flowing back and forth between members ) or more linear/unilateral if people fail to meet their expectations within to groups , and fulfil their roles , they may not accept the group , or be accepted by other group members ” several factors play a part in this image of unity , including group cohesiveness , and entitativity ( appearance of cohesion by outsiders ) such groups may act as the principal source of socialization for individuals as primary groups may shape an individual ’ s attitudes , values , and social orientation social groups are also small groups but are of moderate duration in all groups , formal and informal initiations add to a group 's cohesion and strengthens the bond between the individual and group by demonstrating the exclusiveness of group membership as well as the recruit 's dedication to the group productive group cooperation requires that both dominance order and territorial arrangements ( identity , self-concept ) be settled with respect to the common goal and within the particular group weakening of the common purpose once a group is well established can be attributed to : adding new members ; unsettled conflicts of identities ( i.e , territorial problems in individuals ) ; weakening of a settled dominance-order ; and weakening or failure of the leader to tend to the group

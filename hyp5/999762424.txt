a polyseme is a word or phrase with different , but related senses since the test for polysemy is the vague concept of the relatedness , judgments of polysemy can be difficult to make because applying pre-existing words to new situations is a natural process of language change , looking at words ' etymology is helpful in determining polysemy but not the only solution ; as words become lost in etymology , what once was a useful distinction of meaning may no longer be so some apparently unrelated words share a common historical origin , however , so etymology is not an infallible test for polysemy , and dictionary writers also often defer to speakers ' intuitions to judge polysemy in cases where it contradicts etymology for example , the verb '' to get '' can mean '' procure '' ( i 'll get the drinks ) , '' become '' ( she got scared ) , '' understand '' ( i get it ) etc in linear or vertical polysemy , one sense of a word is a subset of the other if the two senses of the same word do not seem to fit , yet seem related , then it is likely that they are polysemous the fact that this test again depends on speakers ' judgments about relatedness , however , means that this test for polysemy is not infallible , but is rather merely a helpful conceptual aid lexicography define polysemes within a single dictionary lemma , numbering different meanings , while homonyms are treated in separate lemmata semantic shift can separate a polysemous word into separate homonyms for example , check as in '' bank check '' ( or cheque ) , check in chess , and check meaning '' verification '' are considered homonyms , while they originated as a single word derived from chess in the 14th century psycholinguistic experiments have shown that homonyms and polysemes are represented differently within people 's mental lexicon : while the different meanings of homonyms ( which are semantically unrelated ) tend to interfere or compete with each other during comprehension , this does not usually occur for the polysemes that have semantically related meanings the effects of homonymy and polysemy on lexical access : an meg study the relatedness-of-meaning effect for ambiguous words in lexical-decision tasks : when does relatedness matter ? canadian journal of experimental psychology , 64 , 180-196 the idea of signifying practice—texts not as communicating or expressing a pre-existing meaning but as 'positioning subjects ' within a process of semiosis—changes the whole basis of creating social meaning '' these are rules that describe how words , in one lexical context , can then be used , in a different form , in a related context another clarification of polysemy is the idea of predicate transfer —the reassignment of a property to an object that would not otherwise inherently have that property

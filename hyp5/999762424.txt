a polyseme is a word or phrase with different , but related senses since the test for polysemy is the vague concept of the relatedness , judgments of polysemy can be difficult to make because applying pre-existing words to new situations is a natural process of language change , looking at words ' etymology is helpful in determining polysemy but not the only solution ; as words become lost in etymology , what once was a useful distinction of meaning may no longer be so some apparently unrelated words share a common historical origin , however , so etymology is not an infallible test for polysemy , and dictionary writers also often defer to speakers ' intuitions to judge polysemy in cases where it contradicts etymology in linear or vertical polysemy , one sense of a word is a subset of the other if the two senses of the same word do not seem to fit , yet seem related , then it is likely that they are polysemous the fact that this test again depends on speakers ' judgments about relatedness , however , means that this test for polysemy is not infallible , but is rather merely a helpful conceptual aid lexicography define polysemes within a single dictionary lemma , numbering different meanings , while homonyms are treated in separate lemmata semantic shift can separate a polysemous word into separate homonyms disambiguating the ambiguity advantage effect in word recognition : an advantage for polysemous but not homonymous words polysemy means that , '' each text is seen to generate a potentially infinite range of meanings , '' making , according to richard middleton , middleton , richard ( 1990/2002 ) sometimes only one of those meanings is intended , depending on context , and sometimes multiple meanings are intended at the same time boy ) : ( as a verb ) to operate or constitute a vehicle or machine ( to man a ship ) this example shows the specific polysemy where the same word is used at different levels of a taxonomy a river bank is typically visually shelf-like in its flatness , and it collects deposits which a financial bank also does these are rules that describe how words , in one lexical context , can then be used , in a different form , in a related context a crude example of such a rule is the pastoral idea of '' verbizing one 's nouns '' : that certain nouns , used in certain contexts , can be converted into a verb , conveying a related meaning thus , the expression '' i am parked out back '' conveys the meaning of '' parked '' from '' car '' to the property of '' i possess a car ''

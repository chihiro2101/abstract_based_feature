a polyseme is a word or phrase with different , but related senses since the test for polysemy is the vague concept of the relatedness , judgments of polysemy can be difficult to make some apparently unrelated words share a common historical origin , however , so etymology is not an infallible test for polysemy , and dictionary writers also often defer to speakers ' intuitions to judge polysemy in cases where it contradicts etymology for example , the verb '' to get '' can mean '' procure '' ( i 'll get the drinks ) , '' become '' ( she got scared ) , '' understand '' ( i get it ) etc in linear or vertical polysemy , one sense of a word is a subset of the other if the two senses of the same word do not seem to fit , yet seem related , then it is likely that they are polysemous the fact that this test again depends on speakers ' judgments about relatedness , however , means that this test for polysemy is not infallible , but is rather merely a helpful conceptual aid lexicography define polysemes within a single dictionary lemma , numbering different meanings , while homonyms are treated in separate lemmata for example , check as in '' bank check '' ( or cheque ) , check in chess , and check meaning '' verification '' are considered homonyms , while they originated as a single word derived from chess in the 14th century disambiguating the ambiguity advantage effect in word recognition : an advantage for polysemous but not homonymous words the effects of homonymy and polysemy on lexical access : an meg study the relatedness-of-meaning effect for ambiguous words in lexical-decision tasks : when does relatedness matter ? canadian journal of experimental psychology , 64 , 180-196 polysemy means that , '' each text is seen to generate a potentially infinite range of meanings , '' making , according to richard middleton , middleton , richard ( 1990/2002 ) but originally they were polysemous since italian loaned the word from a germanic language a river bank is typically visually shelf-like in its flatness , and it collects deposits which a financial bank also does these are rules that describe how words , in one lexical context , can then be used , in a different form , in a related context thus , the expression '' i am parked out back '' conveys the meaning of '' parked '' from '' car '' to the property of '' i possess a car ''

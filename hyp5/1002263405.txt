thomas townsend brown was born into a wealthy construction family in zanesville , ohio in 1905 his wealthy parents indulged their son 's interests , buying him his own experimental equipment he started what would be a lifelong series of experiments with electrical phenomena and began to investigate what he thought was an electro-gravity phenomenon while still in high school for two years in 1922 and 1923 thomas brown attended doane academy , a preparatory school associated with granville , ohio 's denison university , graduating in june 1923 in september 1928 thomas townsend brown married josephine beale , daughter of the zanesville , ohio resident clifford beale in 1933 brown lost his job at the naval research lab due to depression era budget cutbacks so he joined the u.s also in 1937 thomas brown re-enlisted in the us navy in 1938 brown was promoted to lieutenant and in 1939 was assigned for a few months as a material engineer for the navy 's flying boats being built at the glenn l radford 's interest in brown 's ideas on gravitor devices , although the work was looked on more as a curiosity than any type of workable device in research testing for the société nationale des constructions aéronautiques du sud-ouest ( sncaso ) , brown demonstrated what he thought was an antigravity effect in a vacuum with his device in 1958 brown worked as a research and development consultant for agnew bahnson 's whitehall rand project , an anti-gravity venture at the bahnson company of winston-salem , north carolina thomas townsend brown died on october 22 , 1985 in 1921 while experimenting in the lab his parents had set up for him while he was still in high school , brown discovered an unusual effect while experimenting with a coolidge tube , a type of x-ray vacuum tube with two asymmetrical electrodes brown spent the rest of his life working in his spare time and sometimes in funded projects trying to prove his ideas on electricity 's effect on gravity townsend brown , 2005-2006-2007-2008 - tanglewood books , chapter 64 : flying saucer pipe dreams ( online excerpts ) at some point it also gained the moniker '' biefeld–brown effect '' , probably coined by brown to claim biefeld as his mentor and co-experimenter townsend brown , 2005-2006-2007-2008 - tanglewood books , chapter 12 : the “ biefeld-brown ” effect ( online excerpts ) '' townsend brown himself wrote ( in 1977 ) : the basic biefeld-brown effect is quite simple chapter 10 of the book was titled '' the force fields of townsend brown '' , retelling of brown 's early work and claiming he was involved in the experiment and implying brown 's electrogravitics was the propulsion being used by ufos

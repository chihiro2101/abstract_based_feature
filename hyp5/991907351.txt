neoclassical location theory , following in the tradition of alfred weber , tend to focus on industrial location and use quantitative methods since the 1970s , two broad reactions against neoclassical approaches have significantly changed the discipline : marxist political economy , growing out of the work of david harvey ; and the new economic geography which takes into account social , cultural , and institutional factors in the spatial economy economists such as paul krugman and jeffrey sachs have also analyzed many traits related to economic geography krugman called his application of spatial thinking to international trade theory the '' new economic geography '' , which directly competes with an approach within the discipline of geography that is also called '' new economic geography '' the new palgrave dictionary of economics , 2nd edition : : '' new economic geography '' by anthony j world war ii contributed to the popularization of geographical knowledge generally , and post-war economic recovery and development contributed to the growth of economic geography as a discipline well-known economic geographers of this period include william garrison , brian berry , waldo tobler , peter haggett and william bunge historical economic geography examines the history and development of spatial economic structure using historical data , it examines how centers of population and economic activity shift , what patterns of regional specialization and localization evolve over time and what factors explain these changes more specifically , evolutionary economic geography uses concepts and ideas from evolutionary economics to understand the evolution of cities , regions , and other economic systems behavioral economic geography examines the cognitive processes underlying spatial reasoning , locational decision making , and behavior of firms and individuals economic geography is sometimes approached as a branch of human geography that focuses on regional systems of human economic activity an alternative description of different approaches to the study of human economic activity can be organized around spatiotemporal analysis , analysis of production/consumption of economic items , and analysis of economic flow allowing parameters of space-time and item to vary , a geographer may also examine material flow , commodity flow , population flow and information flow from different parts of the economic activity system geography of industry geography of international trade geography of resources geography of transport and communication geography of finance these areas of study may overlap with other geography new economic geography 2 ( neg2 ) also seeks to explain the apparently paradoxical emergence of industrial clusters in a contemporary context , however , it emphasizes relational , social , and contextual aspects of economic behaviour , particularly the importance of tacit knowledge however , the focus on the firm as the main entity of significance hinders the discussion of new economic geography in short , the focus on the firm in new economic geographies is undertheorized in neg1 and undercontextualized in neg2 , which limits the discussion of its impact on spatial economic development

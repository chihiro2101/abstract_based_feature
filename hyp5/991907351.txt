neoclassical location theory , following in the tradition of alfred weber , tend to focus on industrial location and use quantitative methods since the 1970s , two broad reactions against neoclassical approaches have significantly changed the discipline : marxist political economy , growing out of the work of david harvey ; and the new economic geography which takes into account social , cultural , and institutional factors in the spatial economy economists such as paul krugman and jeffrey sachs have also analyzed many traits related to economic geography krugman called his application of spatial thinking to international trade theory the '' new economic geography '' , which directly competes with an approach within the discipline of geography that is also called '' new economic geography '' as cartography developed , geographers illuminated many aspects used today in the field ; maps created by different european powers described the resources likely to be found in american , african , and asian territories well-known economic geographers of this period include william garrison , brian berry , waldo tobler , peter haggett and william bunge it deals with economic regionalization as well as local economic growth historical economic geography examines the history and development of spatial economic structure evolutionary economic geography adopts an evolutionary approach to economic geography more specifically , evolutionary economic geography uses concepts and ideas from evolutionary economics to understand the evolution of cities , regions , and other economic systems critical economic geography is an approach taken from the point of view of contemporary critical geography and its philosophy economic geography is sometimes approached as a branch of human geography that focuses on regional systems of human economic activity through analysis of flow and production , industrial areas , rural and urban residential areas , transportation site , commercial service facilities and finance and other economic centers are linked together in an economic activity system geography of industry geography of international trade geography of resources geography of transport and communication geography of finance these areas of study may overlap with other geography the economist approach , according to some economic geographers , has the main drawback of homogenizing the economic world in ways economic geographers try to avoid the new economic geographies consist of primarily service-based sectors of the economy that use innovative technology , such as industries where people rely on computers and the internet new economic geography 2 ( neg2 ) also seeks to explain the apparently paradoxical emergence of industrial clusters in a contemporary context , however , it emphasizes relational , social , and contextual aspects of economic behaviour , particularly the importance of tacit knowledge however , the focus on the firm as the main entity of significance hinders the discussion of new economic geography

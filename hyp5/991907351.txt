neoclassical location theory , following in the tradition of alfred weber , tend to focus on industrial location and use quantitative methods since the 1970s , two broad reactions against neoclassical approaches have significantly changed the discipline : marxist political economy , growing out of the work of david harvey ; and the new economic geography which takes into account social , cultural , and institutional factors in the spatial economy economists such as paul krugman and jeffrey sachs have also analyzed many traits related to economic geography krugman called his application of spatial thinking to international trade theory the '' new economic geography '' , which directly competes with an approach within the discipline of geography that is also called '' new economic geography '' the new palgrave dictionary of economics , 2nd edition : : '' new economic geography '' by anthony j : '' spatial economics '' by gilles duranton well-known economic geographers of this period include william garrison , brian berry , waldo tobler , peter haggett and william bunge contemporary economic geographers tend to specialize in areas such as location theory and spatial analysis ( with the help of geographic information systems ) , market research , geography of transportation , real estate price evaluation , regional and global development , planning , internet geography , innovation , social networks as economic geography is a very broad discipline , with economic geographers using many different methodologies in the study of economic phenomena in the world some distinct approaches to study have evolved over time : theoretical economic geography focuses on building theories about spatial arrangement and distribution of economic activities historical economic geography examines the history and development of spatial economic structure critical economic geography is an approach taken from the point of view of contemporary critical geography and its philosophy behavioral economic geography examines the cognitive processes underlying spatial reasoning , locational decision making , and behavior of firms and individuals economic geography is sometimes approached as a branch of human geography that focuses on regional systems of human economic activity an alternative description of different approaches to the study of human economic activity can be organized around spatiotemporal analysis , analysis of production/consumption of economic items , and analysis of economic flow geography of industry geography of international trade geography of resources geography of transport and communication geography of finance these areas of study may overlap with other geography the economist approach , according to some economic geographers , has the main drawback of homogenizing the economic world in ways economic geographers try to avoid new economic geography 2 ( neg2 ) also seeks to explain the apparently paradoxical emergence of industrial clusters in a contemporary context , however , it emphasizes relational , social , and contextual aspects of economic behaviour , particularly the importance of tacit knowledge in short , the focus on the firm in new economic geographies is undertheorized in neg1 and undercontextualized in neg2 , which limits the discussion of its impact on spatial economic development

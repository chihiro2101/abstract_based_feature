as shown , a pinhole '' lens '' is simply a small aperture that blocks most rays of light , ideally selecting one ray to the object for each point on the image sensor pinhole lenses have a few severe limitations : a pinhole camera with a large aperture is blurry because each pixel is essentially the shadow of the aperture stop , so its size is no smaller than the size of the aperture ( third image ) this allows the pinhole to be opened up significantly ( fourth image ) because a thin convex lens bends light rays in proportion to their distance to the axis of the lens , with rays striking the center of the lens passing straight through the geometry is almost the same as with a simple pinhole lens , but rather than being illuminated by single rays of light , each image point is illuminated by a focused pencil ( optics ) the virtual image of the aperture as seen from the world is known as the lens 's entrance pupil ; ideally , all rays of light leaving a point on the object that enter the entrance pupil will be focused to the same point on the image sensor/film ( provided the object point is in the field of view ) if one were inside the camera , one would see the lens acting as a projector the virtual image of the aperture from inside the camera is the lens 's exit pupil image : telephoto.jpg thumb the zoom lens assembly of the canon elph a camera lens may be made from a number of elements : from one , as in the box brownie 's meniscus lens , to over 20 in the more complex zooms the lens usually is focused by adjusting the distance from the lens assembly to the image plane , or by moving elements of the lens assembly to improve performance , some lenses have a cam system that adjusts the distance between the groups as the lens is focused manufacturers call this different things : nikon calls it crc ( close range correction ) ; canon calls it a floating system ; and hasselblad and mamiya call it fle ( floating lens element ) plastics allow the manufacturing of strongly aspheric lens which are difficult or impossible to manufacture in glass , and which simplify or improve lens manufacturing and performance some cameras with leaf shutters in the lens omit the aperture , and the shutter does double duty the two fundamental parameters of an optical lens are the focal length and the maximum aperture the camera equation , or g , is the ratio of the radiance reaching the camera sensor to the irradiance on the focal plane of the camera lens the maximum usable aperture of a lens is specified as the focal ratio or f-number , defined as the lens 's focal length divided by the effective aperture ( or entrance pupil ) , a dimensionless number for a given film or sensor size , specified by the length of the diagonal , a lens may be classified as a : normal lens : angle of view of the diagonal about 50Â° and a focal length approximately equal to the image diagonal the most common type of long-focus lens is the telephoto lens , a design that uses special optical configurations to make the lens shorter than its focal length the lenses attach to the camera using a lens mount , which contains mechanical linkages and often also electrical contacts between the lens and camera body guy 2012 , page 53 a few older manual focus lens mount designs , such as the leica m39 lens mount for rangefinders , m42 lens mount for early slrs , and the pentax k mount are found across multiple brands , but this is not common today a macro lens used in macro or '' close-up '' photography ( not to be confused with the compositional term close up ) is any lens that produces an image on the focal plane ( i.e shift lens allow the lens to be raised or lowered relative to the film of sensor plane to correct or exaggerate perspective distortion infrared lenses ultraviolet lenses swivel lenses rotate while attached to a camera body to give unique perspectives and camera angles anti-fogging treatment of optical surfaces large format lens lens ( optics ) lens hood lens cover lenses for slr and dslr cameras teleconverter teleside converter william taylor ( inventor ) optical train

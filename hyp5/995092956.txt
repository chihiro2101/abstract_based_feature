as shown , a pinhole '' lens '' is simply a small aperture that blocks most rays of light , ideally selecting one ray to the object for each point on the image sensor pinhole lenses have a few severe limitations : a pinhole camera with a large aperture is blurry because each pixel is essentially the shadow of the aperture stop , so its size is no smaller than the size of the aperture ( third image ) practical lenses can be thought of as an answer to the question : '' how can a pinhole lens be modified to admit more light and give a smaller spot size ? '' a first step is to put a simple convex lens at the pinhole with a focal length equal to the distance to the film plane ( assuming the camera will take pictures of distant objects if the object is at a distance , one can assume the light rays will arrive perpendicular to the plane of the lens , and thus converge at the focal point this allows the pinhole to be opened up significantly ( fourth image ) because a thin convex lens bends light rays in proportion to their distance to the axis of the lens , with rays striking the center of the lens passing straight through the geometry is almost the same as with a simple pinhole lens , but rather than being illuminated by single rays of light , each image point is illuminated by a focused pencil ( optics ) the virtual image of the aperture as seen from the world is known as the lens 's entrance pupil ; ideally , all rays of light leaving a point on the object that enter the entrance pupil will be focused to the same point on the image sensor/film ( provided the object point is in the field of view ) the virtual image of the aperture from inside the camera is the lens 's exit pupil image : telephoto.jpg thumb the zoom lens assembly of the canon elph a camera lens may be made from a number of elements : from one , as in the box brownie 's meniscus lens , to over 20 in the more complex zooms the lens usually is focused by adjusting the distance from the lens assembly to the image plane , or by moving elements of the lens assembly plastics allow the manufacturing of strongly aspheric lens which are difficult or impossible to manufacture in glass , and which simplify or improve lens manufacturing and performance molded plastic lenses have been used for the cheapest disposable cameras for many years , and have acquired a bad reputation : manufacturers of quality optics tend to use euphemisms such as '' optical resin '' a shutter , to regulate the time during which light may pass , may be incorporated within the lens assembly ( for better quality imagery ) , within the camera , or even , rarely , in front of the lens aperture and focal length the lens ' focal length determines the magnification of the image projected onto the image plane , and the aperture the light intensity of that image for a given photographic system the focal length determines the angle of view , short focal lengths giving a wider field of view than longer focal length lenses the maximum usable aperture of a lens is specified as the focal ratio or f-number , defined as the lens 's focal length divided by the effective aperture ( or entrance pupil ) , a dimensionless number for a given film or sensor size , specified by the length of the diagonal , a lens may be classified as a : normal lens : angle of view of the diagonal about 50° and a focal length approximately equal to the image diagonal wide-angle lens : angle of view wider than 60° and focal length shorter than normal long-focus lens : any lens with a focal length longer than the diagonal measure of the film or sensor the complexity of a lens — the number of elements and their degree of asphericity — depends upon the angle of view , the maximum aperture , and intended price point , among other variables the lenses attach to the camera using a lens mount , which contains mechanical linkages and often also electrical contacts between the lens and camera body zoom lenses are widely used for small-format cameras of all types : still and cine cameras with fixed or interchangeable lenses anti-fogging treatment of optical surfaces large format lens lens ( optics ) lens hood lens cover lenses for slr and dslr cameras teleconverter teleside converter william taylor ( inventor ) optical train

as shown , a pinhole '' lens '' is simply a small aperture that blocks most rays of light , ideally selecting one ray to the object for each point on the image sensor pinhole lenses have a few severe limitations : a pinhole camera with a large aperture is blurry because each pixel is essentially the shadow of the aperture stop , so its size is no smaller than the size of the aperture ( third image ) practical lenses can be thought of as an answer to the question : '' how can a pinhole lens be modified to admit more light and give a smaller spot size ? '' this allows the pinhole to be opened up significantly ( fourth image ) because a thin convex lens bends light rays in proportion to their distance to the axis of the lens , with rays striking the center of the lens passing straight through if one were inside the camera , one would see the lens acting as a projector the virtual image of the aperture from inside the camera is the lens 's exit pupil in this simple case , the aperture , entrance pupil , and exit pupil are all in the same place because the only optical element is in the plane of the aperture , but in general these three will be in different places practical photographic lenses include more lens elements image : telephoto.jpg thumb the zoom lens assembly of the canon elph a camera lens may be made from a number of elements : from one , as in the box brownie 's meniscus lens , to over 20 in the more complex zooms the lens usually is focused by adjusting the distance from the lens assembly to the image plane , or by moving elements of the lens assembly glass is the most common material used to construct lens elements , due to its good optical properties and resistance to scratching plastics allow the manufacturing of strongly aspheric lens which are difficult or impossible to manufacture in glass , and which simplify or improve lens manufacturing and performance lens resolution is ultimately limited by diffraction , and very few photographic lenses approach this resolution the two fundamental parameters of an optical lens are the focal length and the maximum aperture the lens ' focal length determines the magnification of the image projected onto the image plane , and the aperture the light intensity of that image for a given photographic system the focal length determines the angle of view , short focal lengths giving a wider field of view than longer focal length lenses the camera equation , or g , is the ratio of the radiance reaching the camera sensor to the irradiance on the focal plane of the camera lens the maximum usable aperture of a lens is specified as the focal ratio or f-number , defined as the lens 's focal length divided by the effective aperture ( or entrance pupil ) , a dimensionless number for a given film or sensor size , specified by the length of the diagonal , a lens may be classified as a : normal lens : angle of view of the diagonal about 50Â° and a focal length approximately equal to the image diagonal the most common type of long-focus lens is the telephoto lens , a design that uses special optical configurations to make the lens shorter than its focal length a long-focus lens of small aperture can be of very simple construction to attain comparable image quality : a doublet ( two elements ) will often suffice there is no universal standard for lens mounts , and each major camera maker typically uses its own proprietary design , incompatible with other makers there is no official standard to define a macro lens , usually a prime lens , but a 1:1 ratio is , typically , considered '' true '' macro zoom lenses are widely used for small-format cameras of all types : still and cine cameras with fixed or interchangeable lenses

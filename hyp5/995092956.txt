as shown , a pinhole '' lens '' is simply a small aperture that blocks most rays of light , ideally selecting one ray to the object for each point on the image sensor pinhole lenses have a few severe limitations : a pinhole camera with a large aperture is blurry because each pixel is essentially the shadow of the aperture stop , so its size is no smaller than the size of the aperture ( third image ) a first step is to put a simple convex lens at the pinhole with a focal length equal to the distance to the film plane ( assuming the camera will take pictures of distant objects if the object is at a distance , one can assume the light rays will arrive perpendicular to the plane of the lens , and thus converge at the focal point this allows the pinhole to be opened up significantly ( fourth image ) because a thin convex lens bends light rays in proportion to their distance to the axis of the lens , with rays striking the center of the lens passing straight through the virtual image of the aperture as seen from the world is known as the lens 's entrance pupil ; ideally , all rays of light leaving a point on the object that enter the entrance pupil will be focused to the same point on the image sensor/film ( provided the object point is in the field of view ) the virtual image of the aperture from inside the camera is the lens 's exit pupil in this simple case , the aperture , entrance pupil , and exit pupil are all in the same place because the only optical element is in the plane of the aperture , but in general these three will be in different places practical photographic lenses include more lens elements the additional elements allow lens designers to reduce various aberrations , but the principle of operation remains the same : pencil beam are collected at the entrance pupil and focused down from the exit pupil onto the image plane image : telephoto.jpg thumb the zoom lens assembly of the canon elph a camera lens may be made from a number of elements : from one , as in the box brownie 's meniscus lens , to over 20 in the more complex zooms glass is the most common material used to construct lens elements , due to its good optical properties and resistance to scratching other materials are also used , such as quartz glass , fluorite , plastics like acrylic ( plexiglass ) , and even germanium and meteorite plastics allow the manufacturing of strongly aspheric lens which are difficult or impossible to manufacture in glass , and which simplify or improve lens manufacturing and performance however many modern , high performance ( and high priced ) lenses from popular manufacturers include molded or hybrid aspherical elements , so it is not true that all lenses with plastic elements are of low photographic quality lens resolution is ultimately limited by diffraction , and very few photographic lenses approach this resolution a shutter , to regulate the time during which light may pass , may be incorporated within the lens assembly ( for better quality imagery ) , within the camera , or even , rarely , in front of the lens the two fundamental parameters of an optical lens are the focal length and the maximum aperture the lens ' focal length determines the magnification of the image projected onto the image plane , and the aperture the light intensity of that image the camera equation , or g , is the ratio of the radiance reaching the camera sensor to the irradiance on the focal plane of the camera lens the most common type of long-focus lens is the telephoto lens , a design that uses special optical configurations to make the lens shorter than its focal length photographs can be taken of a person stretching out a hand with a wideangle , a normal lens , and a telephoto , which contain exactly the same image size by changing the distance from the subject an extreme wideangle lens of large aperture must be of very complex construction to correct for optical aberrations , which are worse at the edge of the field and when the edge of a large lens is used for image-forming shift lens allow the lens to be raised or lowered relative to the film of sensor plane to correct or exaggerate perspective distortion anti-fogging treatment of optical surfaces large format lens lens ( optics ) lens hood lens cover lenses for slr and dslr cameras teleconverter teleside converter william taylor ( inventor ) optical train

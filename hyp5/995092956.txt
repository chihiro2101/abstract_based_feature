as shown , a pinhole '' lens '' is simply a small aperture that blocks most rays of light , ideally selecting one ray to the object for each point on the image sensor pinhole lenses have a few severe limitations : a pinhole camera with a large aperture is blurry because each pixel is essentially the shadow of the aperture stop , so its size is no smaller than the size of the aperture ( third image ) practical lenses can be thought of as an answer to the question : '' how can a pinhole lens be modified to admit more light and give a smaller spot size ? '' this allows the pinhole to be opened up significantly ( fourth image ) because a thin convex lens bends light rays in proportion to their distance to the axis of the lens , with rays striking the center of the lens passing straight through the geometry is almost the same as with a simple pinhole lens , but rather than being illuminated by single rays of light , each image point is illuminated by a focused pencil ( optics ) the virtual image of the aperture as seen from the world is known as the lens 's entrance pupil ; ideally , all rays of light leaving a point on the object that enter the entrance pupil will be focused to the same point on the image sensor/film ( provided the object point is in the field of view ) if one were inside the camera , one would see the lens acting as a projector the virtual image of the aperture from inside the camera is the lens 's exit pupil in this simple case , the aperture , entrance pupil , and exit pupil are all in the same place because the only optical element is in the plane of the aperture , but in general these three will be in different places practical photographic lenses include more lens elements image : telephoto.jpg thumb the zoom lens assembly of the canon elph a camera lens may be made from a number of elements : from one , as in the box brownie 's meniscus lens , to over 20 in the more complex zooms the lens usually is focused by adjusting the distance from the lens assembly to the image plane , or by moving elements of the lens assembly to improve performance , some lenses have a cam system that adjusts the distance between the groups as the lens is focused glass is the most common material used to construct lens elements , due to its good optical properties and resistance to scratching lens resolution is ultimately limited by diffraction , and very few photographic lenses approach this resolution the lens ' focal length determines the magnification of the image projected onto the image plane , and the aperture the light intensity of that image for a given photographic system the focal length determines the angle of view , short focal lengths giving a wider field of view than longer focal length lenses the maximum usable aperture of a lens is specified as the focal ratio or f-number , defined as the lens 's focal length divided by the effective aperture ( or entrance pupil ) , a dimensionless number the most common type of long-focus lens is the telephoto lens , a design that uses special optical configurations to make the lens shorter than its focal length the lenses attach to the camera using a lens mount , which contains mechanical linkages and often also electrical contacts between the lens and camera body guy 2012 , page 53 a few older manual focus lens mount designs , such as the leica m39 lens mount for rangefinders , m42 lens mount for early slrs , and the pentax k mount are found across multiple brands , but this is not common today there is no official standard to define a macro lens , usually a prime lens , but a 1:1 ratio is , typically , considered '' true '' macro zoom lenses are widely used for small-format cameras of all types : still and cine cameras with fixed or interchangeable lenses anti-fogging treatment of optical surfaces large format lens lens ( optics ) lens hood lens cover lenses for slr and dslr cameras teleconverter teleside converter william taylor ( inventor ) optical train

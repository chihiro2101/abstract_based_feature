while some pet rats retain the agouti coloring of the wild brown rat ( three tones on the same hair ) , others have solid colors ( a single color on each hair ) , a trait derived from rats with black coats eye color is considered a subset of coloring , and coat color definitions often include standards for the eyes , as many genes which control eye color will also affect the coat color or vice versa the american fancy rat and mouse association ( afrma ) lists black , pink , ruby , and odd-eyed ( two differently-colored eyes ) as possible eye colors , depending on the variety of rat shown color names can vary for more vaguely defined varieties , like lilac and fawn , while the interpretations of standards can fluctuate between ( and even within ) different countries or clubs fancy rats can appear in any combination of colors and markings the markings are typically in reference to the patterns and ratios of colored hair versus white hair two extremes would be a self ( completely solid , non-white color ) and a himalayan ( completely white except blending into colored areas at the nose and feet , called points , as in a himalayan cat 's markings ) however , many domestic rats are not closely bred to any color standard ; many of those found in pet shops will have mismarkings from a formal breeding perspective , which are defined as variations in markings that are not recognized as conforming to a breed standard published by a rat fancier organisation two of the most prominent and standardized physical changes applied to rats through selective breeding are the development of the manx rat and dumbo rat the most common type is the normal or standard , which is allowed variance in coarseness between the sexes ; males have a coarse , thick , rough coat , while females ' coats are softer and finer other standardized coats include : rex , in which all the hairs are curly , even the whiskers ; velveteen , a softer variation of the rex ; satin or silky coat , which is extra-soft and fine , with a sheen ; and harley , characterized by wispy long straight hairs remaining coat types are not defined by the hair itself , but rather by the lack of it , such as hairless rats hairless rats are a coat variety characterized by varying levels of hair loss for example , the importation of foreign rodents is prohibited in australia , and so various coat types , colors , and varieties have been bred separately from foreign lines , or are just not obtainable within that country ( for example , hairless and dumbo rats do not exist in australia ) norvegicus are more prone to specific health risks and diseases than their wild counterparts , but they are also far less likely to succumb to certain illnesses that are prevalent in the wild they may also more easily avoid vectors like cockroaches , beetles , and fleas which are essential for the spread of endemic typhus and intestinal parasites like the rat tapeworm however , it has been determined that a pet rat 's initial exposure to salmonella , along with many other zoonotic rat diseases , typically indicates exposure to wild rodent populations , either from an infestation in the owner 's home , or from the pet 's contaminated food , water , or bedding this is a rare disease among domesticated rats and is most often found in rats from large chain pet stores who breed their stock of rats in masses ( usually with the intention of being snake food rather than pets ) or from breeders who fail to take good care of their rats in the 1996 point-and-click adventure game phantasmagoria : a puzzle of flesh , the protagonist curtis craig owns a pet rat named blob , which is seen various times in the game and is even involved in one of the many puzzles that the player must decipher

while some pet rats retain the agouti coloring of the wild brown rat ( three tones on the same hair ) , others have solid colors ( a single color on each hair ) , a trait derived from rats with black coats black-based colors include black , beige , blue , and chocolate eye color is considered a subset of coloring , and coat color definitions often include standards for the eyes , as many genes which control eye color will also affect the coat color or vice versa color names can vary for more vaguely defined varieties , like lilac and fawn , while the interpretations of standards can fluctuate between ( and even within ) different countries or clubs two extremes would be a self ( completely solid , non-white color ) and a himalayan ( completely white except blending into colored areas at the nose and feet , called points , as in a himalayan cat 's markings ) markings have a strict standard , with detailed terminology , for showing in fancy rat pet shows however , many domestic rats are not closely bred to any color standard ; many of those found in pet shops will have mismarkings from a formal breeding perspective , which are defined as variations in markings that are not recognized as conforming to a breed standard published by a rat fancier organisation other marking varieties include spotted or dalmatian ( named for the spotted dalmatian dog ) , essex , masked , himalayan ( typically a gradient of color along the body , darkest at the base of the tail and nose as in siamese cats ) , and down under or downunder ( an australian variety which has a solid color stripe on the belly or a color marking there that corresponds to the markings on the top ) the dumbo rat , whose origins are in the united states , is characterized by having large , low , round ears on the sides of its head caused by a recessive mutation , and was named for its resemblance to the fictional character dumbo the flying elephant breeding manx rats does raise some ethical and health concerns however , as rats use their tails for both balance and thermoregulation the most common type is the normal or standard , which is allowed variance in coarseness between the sexes ; males have a coarse , thick , rough coat , while females ' coats are softer and finer remaining coat types are not defined by the hair itself , but rather by the lack of it , such as hairless rats one additional subset of semi-hairless rats , patchwork rex , constantly lose their hair and regrow it in different '' patches '' several times throughout their life hairless rats may be prone to more health problems than their standard- or rex-coated counterparts , including a reduced tolerance for cold , kidney and liver failure , skin conditions , and shortened life span on one hand , breeding rats to '' conform '' to a specific standard or to develop a new one is a large part of history while living indoors decreases the risk of contracting certain diseases , living in close quarters with other rats , being unable to always seek proper protection from environmental factors ( e.g dietary changes are among the main suggestions for improved health and longevity in fancy rats , such suggestions included are feeding rat-friendly superfoods in moderation to reduce the risk of cancers , heart disease and stroke however , it has been determined that a pet rat 's initial exposure to salmonella , along with many other zoonotic rat diseases , typically indicates exposure to wild rodent populations , either from an infestation in the owner 's home , or from the pet 's contaminated food , water , or bedding this is a rare disease among domesticated rats and is most often found in rats from large chain pet stores who breed their stock of rats in masses ( usually with the intention of being snake food rather than pets ) or from breeders who fail to take good care of their rats

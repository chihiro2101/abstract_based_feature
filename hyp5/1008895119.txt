while some pet rats retain the agouti coloring of the wild brown rat ( three tones on the same hair ) , others have solid colors ( a single color on each hair ) , a trait derived from rats with black coats eye color is considered a subset of coloring , and coat color definitions often include standards for the eyes , as many genes which control eye color will also affect the coat color or vice versa the american fancy rat and mouse association ( afrma ) lists black , pink , ruby , and odd-eyed ( two differently-colored eyes ) as possible eye colors , depending on the variety of rat shown ruby refers to eyes which at a glance appear black , but which are on closer observation a deep , dark red color names can vary for more vaguely defined varieties , like lilac and fawn , while the interpretations of standards can fluctuate between ( and even within ) different countries or clubs fancy rats can appear in any combination of colors and markings markings have a strict standard , with detailed terminology , for showing in fancy rat pet shows irish or english irish â€“ in england , the irish is standardized by the nfrs as an equilateral triangle of white with a side that begins at the chest , or between the front legs , and where the point ends mid-length in the united states and elsewhere , clubs like the afrma distinguish this marking as the english irish and allow for another standardized irish in which the rat may have white of an even or symmetrical nature anywhere along its underside two of the most prominent and standardized physical changes applied to rats through selective breeding are the development of the manx rat and dumbo rat the manx rat is tailless due to a genetic mutation , and was named for the manx cat which shares this feature , though not necessarily due to the same mutation breeding manx rats does raise some ethical and health concerns however , as rats use their tails for both balance and thermoregulation there is a relatively small variety of coats in relation to the number of colors and markings , and not all are internationally standardized the most common type is the normal or standard , which is allowed variance in coarseness between the sexes ; males have a coarse , thick , rough coat , while females ' coats are softer and finer hairless rats are a coat variety characterized by varying levels of hair loss unlike a double rex , this type of hairless rat is incapable of growing hairs on any part of the body on one hand , breeding rats to '' conform '' to a specific standard or to develop a new one is a large part of history in other areas , like the canadian province of alberta , which is considered rat-free , the ownership of domestic fancy rats outside of schools , laboratories , and zoos is illegal it may appear like dried blood , but is a mucus-like substance which is released at times of stress or if the rat has a respiratory infection

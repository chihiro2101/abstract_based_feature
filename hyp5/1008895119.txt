while some pet rats retain the agouti coloring of the wild brown rat ( three tones on the same hair ) , others have solid colors ( a single color on each hair ) , a trait derived from rats with black coats eye color is considered a subset of coloring , and coat color definitions often include standards for the eyes , as many genes which control eye color will also affect the coat color or vice versa the american fancy rat and mouse association ( afrma ) lists black , pink , ruby , and odd-eyed ( two differently-colored eyes ) as possible eye colors , depending on the variety of rat shown color names can vary for more vaguely defined varieties , like lilac and fawn , while the interpretations of standards can fluctuate between ( and even within ) different countries or clubs further dividing the varieties of fancy rats are the many different markings fancy rats can appear in any combination of colors and markings two extremes would be a self ( completely solid , non-white color ) and a himalayan ( completely white except blending into colored areas at the nose and feet , called points , as in a himalayan cat 's markings ) markings have a strict standard , with detailed terminology , for showing in fancy rat pet shows however , many domestic rats are not closely bred to any color standard ; many of those found in pet shops will have mismarkings from a formal breeding perspective , which are defined as variations in markings that are not recognized as conforming to a breed standard published by a rat fancier organisation two of the most prominent and standardized physical changes applied to rats through selective breeding are the development of the manx rat and dumbo rat breeding manx rats does raise some ethical and health concerns however , as rats use their tails for both balance and thermoregulation other standardized coats include : rex , in which all the hairs are curly , even the whiskers ; velveteen , a softer variation of the rex ; satin or silky coat , which is extra-soft and fine , with a sheen ; and harley , characterized by wispy long straight hairs remaining coat types are not defined by the hair itself , but rather by the lack of it , such as hairless rats hairless rats are a coat variety characterized by varying levels of hair loss hairless rats may be prone to more health problems than their standard- or rex-coated counterparts , including a reduced tolerance for cold , kidney and liver failure , skin conditions , and shortened life span tailless rats have greater risk of hyperthermia , poor bowel and bladder control , falling from heights , and can be at risk for life-threatening deformities in the pelvic region , like hind leg paralysis and megacolon norvegicus are more prone to specific health risks and diseases than their wild counterparts , but they are also far less likely to succumb to certain illnesses that are prevalent in the wild they may also more easily avoid vectors like cockroaches , beetles , and fleas which are essential for the spread of endemic typhus and intestinal parasites like the rat tapeworm however , it has been determined that a pet rat 's initial exposure to salmonella , along with many other zoonotic rat diseases , typically indicates exposure to wild rodent populations , either from an infestation in the owner 's home , or from the pet 's contaminated food , water , or bedding

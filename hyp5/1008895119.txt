while some pet rats retain the agouti coloring of the wild brown rat ( three tones on the same hair ) , others have solid colors ( a single color on each hair ) , a trait derived from rats with black coats eye color is considered a subset of coloring , and coat color definitions often include standards for the eyes , as many genes which control eye color will also affect the coat color or vice versa the american fancy rat and mouse association ( afrma ) lists black , pink , ruby , and odd-eyed ( two differently-colored eyes ) as possible eye colors , depending on the variety of rat shown color names can vary for more vaguely defined varieties , like lilac and fawn , while the interpretations of standards can fluctuate between ( and even within ) different countries or clubs fancy rats can appear in any combination of colors and markings markings have a strict standard , with detailed terminology , for showing in fancy rat pet shows irish or english irish – in england , the irish is standardized by the nfrs as an equilateral triangle of white with a side that begins at the chest , or between the front legs , and where the point ends mid-length in the united states and elsewhere , clubs like the afrma distinguish this marking as the english irish and allow for another standardized irish in which the rat may have white of an even or symmetrical nature anywhere along its underside two of the most prominent and standardized physical changes applied to rats through selective breeding are the development of the manx rat and dumbo rat the most common type is the normal or standard , which is allowed variance in coarseness between the sexes ; males have a coarse , thick , rough coat , while females ' coats are softer and finer hairless rats are a coat variety characterized by varying levels of hair loss unlike a double rex , this type of hairless rat is incapable of growing hairs on any part of the body one additional subset of semi-hairless rats , patchwork rex , constantly lose their hair and regrow it in different '' patches '' several times throughout their life on one hand , breeding rats to '' conform '' to a specific standard or to develop a new one is a large part of history on the other hand , the process results in many rats who do not '' conform '' , and are then either given away , sold as food , or killed—the latter referred to as culling similarly , hairless rats are less protected from scratches and the cold without their coat for example , the importation of foreign rodents is prohibited in australia , and so various coat types , colors , and varieties have been bred separately from foreign lines , or are just not obtainable within that country ( for example , hairless and dumbo rats do not exist in australia ) this disease is fairly unnoticeable in the rat , but is characterized by the swelling of the site of the bite or scratch where it was contracted , a fever , vomiting and body aches pet rats are unofficially allowed at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry in the harry potter series , but are not generally seen as desirable pets

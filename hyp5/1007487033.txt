in rogue , the player assumes the typical role of an adventurer of early fantasy role-playing games the game starts at the uppermost level of an unmapped dungeon with myriad monsters and treasures in the original text-based versions , all aspects of the game , including the dungeon , the player character , and monsters , are represented by letters and symbols within the ascii character set later ports of rogue apply extended ascii to the text user interface or replace it with graphical tiles unlike most adventure games of the time of the original design , the dungeon layout and the placement of objects within are random dungeon the concept of rogue originated with michael toy and glenn wichman toy took interest in the text-based star trek game ( 1971 ) , which represented space combat through characters on screen , and required players to make strategic decisions each turn toy took to learn programming and recreate this game on other computer systems that he could access , including the processor technology sol-20 and the atari 400 adventure , considered the first text-based adventure game , challenged the player to explore a cave system through descriptions given by the computer and commands issued by the player toy soon met wichman , another student at ucsc who was also writing his own adventure game wichman chose ucsc specifically to study on game design as to become a board game developer , and this led him into the computer sciences to get the opportunity to play and develop games one element of the bsd distribution at this point included the curses programming library by ken arnold curses enabled a programmer to place characters at any point on a terminal , effectively allowing for '' graphical '' interfaces wichman came up with the name rogue , based on the idea that unlike the party-based systems of dungeons & dragons , the player 's character was going at this alone wichman learned the language from toy as they went along while providing significant input on the design of game the first two major aspects of the game developed was the method of displaying the dungeon on screen to the player , and how to generate the dungeon in a random manner for the dungeon , they found initial attempts at purely random generation to be weak , in some cases having a stairway ending up in a room inaccessible to players upon meeting toy , lane proposed the idea of porting rogue to the ibm pc as a commercial product , which toy agreed lane took advantage of the more graphical code page 437 character set on pc to expand the number of symbols to represent the dungeon , such as using a happy-face â˜º for the player-character wichman was initially cautious due to the fact that his credit for rogue in the pc version had been cast as a '' contribution '' equal to the ucsc playtesters rather than as equal to toy , arnold , or lane besides the competition from more graphically-interesting games , wichman attributed the failure to the fact that the commercial version of rogue was essentially the same game previously offered for free via bsd and did not pose a new challenge none of toy , wichman , arnold , or lane profited greatly from rogue , though they became renowned in the industry for their participation on the game compute ! favorably reviewed epyx 's amiga version as improving on the text-based original , stating that '' the game will give you many hours of gaming fun '' however , as neither toy , wichman , nor arnold released the source code of the game , these efforts generally required the programmers to craft the core game elements from scratch to mimic rogue michael toy , glenn wichman , and ken arnold panel at the 2016 roguelike celebration

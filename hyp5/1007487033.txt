in rogue , the player assumes the typical role of an adventurer of early fantasy role-playing games the game starts at the uppermost level of an unmapped dungeon with myriad monsters and treasures in the original text-based versions , all aspects of the game , including the dungeon , the player character , and monsters , are represented by letters and symbols within the ascii character set later ports of rogue apply extended ascii to the text user interface or replace it with graphical tiles unlike most adventure games of the time of the original design , the dungeon layout and the placement of objects within are random dungeon the concept of rogue originated with michael toy and glenn wichman toy took to learn programming and recreate this game on other computer systems that he could access , including the processor technology sol-20 and the atari 400 toy subsequently enrolled in computer science at the university of california , santa cruz ( ucsc ) in the late 1970s adventure , considered the first text-based adventure game , challenged the player to explore a cave system through descriptions given by the computer and commands issued by the player toy was impressed by the game and started writing his own toy soon met wichman , another student at ucsc who was also writing his own adventure game the two became friends , shared an apartment , and challenged each other with their own adventure game creations of the two , toy was more proficient at coding , while wichman had a better sense of the design of these games toy and wichman soon found that most adventure games suffered from a lack of replayability , in that the game did not change on separate playthroughs as toy was more proficient at programming , he led the development of the game in the c language which generally produced fast effective code once they could have their character move about these randomly created dungeons , they then added equipment , magic items , and monsters they changed this so that the save file was erased upon reloading the game , thus making a character 's death effectively permanent toy took the rogue code with him to continue its development wichman , still enrolled at ucsc , continued to help develop rogue for a time , such as adding armor elements , but the logistics of working over the distance made it difficult for him to keep up , and he let toy fully take over development he had ideas for how to fix it , but at this point toy and wichman had opted not to release the code in addition to helping to improve the interface and rendering of the game , arnold helped to improve the procedural generation aspects of the game upon meeting toy , lane proposed the idea of porting rogue to the ibm pc as a commercial product , which toy agreed none of toy , wichman , arnold , or lane profited greatly from rogue , though they became renowned in the industry for their participation on the game however , as neither toy , wichman , nor arnold released the source code of the game , these efforts generally required the programmers to craft the core game elements from scratch to mimic rogue toy , wichman , and arnold reunited onstage for the first time in 30 years in an event called '' roguelike celebration '' at san francisco in 2016

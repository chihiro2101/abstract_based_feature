in the original text-based versions , all aspects of the game , including the dungeon , the player character , and monsters , are represented by letters and symbols within the ascii character set other game actions also use single keystrokes—q to quaff a potion , w to wield a weapon , e to eat some food , etc unlike most adventure games of the time of the original design , the dungeon layout and the placement of objects within are random dungeon the concept of rogue originated with michael toy and glenn wichman toy took to learn programming and recreate this game on other computer systems that he could access , including the processor technology sol-20 and the atari 400 toy subsequently enrolled in computer science at the university of california , santa cruz ( ucsc ) in the late 1970s one game that intrigued him was colossal cave adventure ( also known as adventure ) ( 1976 ) by william crowther and don woods adventure , considered the first text-based adventure game , challenged the player to explore a cave system through descriptions given by the computer and commands issued by the player toy soon met wichman , another student at ucsc who was also writing his own adventure game after crafting a few games using curses to learn the library , they came up with the idea of an adventure game in the flavor of dungeons & dragons but to address their concerns with the static nature of adventure games , wanted to include elements that would change every time the game was played the two came up with a narrative , that of an adventurer setting out to explore and find treasures in the dungeons of doom , specifically the amulet of yendor ( the name '' rodney '' spelled backwards , which they envisioned as renowned wizard in the games narration ) as toy was more proficient at programming , he led the development of the game in the c language which generally produced fast effective code the first two major aspects of the game developed was the method of displaying the dungeon on screen to the player , and how to generate the dungeon in a random manner they found a solution through procedural generation , where each level would start on the idea of a 3x3 tic tac toe grid , with each room of various size occupying one space in this grid , and then creating the hallways to connect the rooms once they could have their character move about these randomly created dungeons , they then added equipment , magic items , and monsters with magic items , they wanted the effects of these items to be a mystery on each run through , and thus would initially present the items to the player only by a descriptor such as by color , and only later in the game give the true name of the item once the player experimented or used another means to identify the item they changed this so that the save file was erased upon reloading the game , thus making a character 's death effectively permanent they subsequently added a scoreboard feature that let players rank their progress with others , rewarding players with more points for surviving as deep as possible into the dungeons and making the amulet of yendor a lucrative goal around 1982 , toy 's attention to rogue and computer games caused him to suffer poor academic performance , and he was kicked out of the school , shortly finding employment at university of california , berkeley ( ucb ) in their computer lab wichman , still enrolled at ucsc , continued to help develop rogue for a time , such as adding armor elements , but the logistics of working over the distance made it difficult for him to keep up , and he let toy fully take over development though impressed with the game , he expressed frustration at the inefficient means the game updated the screen via his curses library over a modem line rogue source was eventually added under a bsd licenses within 4.3 bsd in 1986 , putting it into the open source rogue is shown in '' /usr/games '' file:4.3 bsd uwisc vax emulation rogue manual.png 4.3 bsd displaying the man page for rogue however , as neither toy , wichman , nor arnold released the source code of the game , these efforts generally required the programmers to craft the core game elements from scratch to mimic rogue the gameplay mechanics of rogue were influential in the creation of torneko no daibōken : fushigi no dungeon , the very first game in the mystery dungeon series by chunsoft

in rogue , the player assumes the typical role of an adventurer of early fantasy role-playing games the game starts at the uppermost level of an unmapped dungeon with myriad monsters and treasures the goal is to fight one 's way to the bottom level , retrieve the amulet of yendor ( '' rodney '' spelled backwards ) , then ascend to the surface in the original text-based versions , all aspects of the game , including the dungeon , the player character , and monsters , are represented by letters and symbols within the ascii character set later ports of rogue apply extended ascii to the text user interface or replace it with graphical tiles the concept of rogue originated with michael toy and glenn wichman toy took interest in the text-based star trek game ( 1971 ) , which represented space combat through characters on screen , and required players to make strategic decisions each turn toy took to learn programming and recreate this game on other computer systems that he could access , including the processor technology sol-20 and the atari 400 working first on ucsc 's pdp-11 and then its vax-11 , toy began exploring what games were available over arpanet , the predecessor of the current internet adventure , considered the first text-based adventure game , challenged the player to explore a cave system through descriptions given by the computer and commands issued by the player toy soon met wichman , another student at ucsc who was also writing his own adventure game wichman had created his own variations on traditional role-playing games such as dungeons & dragons while growing up wichman chose ucsc specifically to study on game design as to become a board game developer , and this led him into the computer sciences to get the opportunity to play and develop games toy and wichman soon found that most adventure games suffered from a lack of replayability , in that the game did not change on separate playthroughs one element of the bsd distribution at this point included the curses programming library by ken arnold wichman came up with the name rogue , based on the idea that unlike the party-based systems of dungeons & dragons , the player 's character was going at this alone wichman learned the language from toy as they went along while providing significant input on the design of game the first two major aspects of the game developed was the method of displaying the dungeon on screen to the player , and how to generate the dungeon in a random manner toy took the rogue code with him to continue its development prior to toy 's arrival at ucb , ken arnold had gotten to play rogue , which had been distributed as an executable across many of the uc campuses though toy 's source code was necessary for the porting , lane had to redevelop many of the routines for the game 's interface wichman was initially cautious due to the fact that his credit for rogue in the pc version had been cast as a '' contribution '' equal to the ucsc playtesters rather than as equal to toy , arnold , or lane none of toy , wichman , arnold , or lane profited greatly from rogue , though they became renowned in the industry for their participation on the game because of rogues popularity at colleges in the early 1980s , other users sought to expand or create similar games to rogue however , as neither toy , wichman , nor arnold released the source code of the game , these efforts generally required the programmers to craft the core game elements from scratch to mimic rogue

charles booth , a pioneering investigator of poverty in london at the turn of the 20th century , popularised the idea of a poverty line , a concept originally conceived by the london school board booth set the line at 10 & nbsp ; ( 50p ) to 20 shillings & nbsp ; ( £1 ) per week , which he considered to be the minimum amount necessary for a family of four or five people to subsist on he considered this amount to set his poverty line and concluded that 27.84 % of the total population of york lived below this poverty line rowntree distinguished between primary poverty , those lacking in income and secondary poverty , those who had enough income , but spent it elsewhere ( 1901:295–96 ) . absolute poverty and the international poverty line the term '' absolute poverty '' is also sometimes used as a synonym for extreme poverty absolute poverty is the absence of enough resources to secure basic life necessities to assist in measuring this , the world bank has a daily per capita international poverty line ( ipl ) , a global absolute minimum , of 1.90 a day as of october 2015 in 2008 , the world bank came out with a figure ( revised largely due to inflation ) of 1.25 a day at 2005 purchasing-power parity ( ppp ) using a single monetary poverty threshold is problematic when applied worldwide , due to the difficulty of comparing prices between countries absolute poverty : when necessity displaces desire revised , working papers 20170005 , new york university abu dhabi , department of social science , revised jun 2017 the poverty line is then defined as the amount of income required to satisfy those needs the 'basic needs ' approach was introduced by the international labour organization 's world employment conference in 1976 it influenced the programmes and policies of major multilateral and bilateral development agencies , and was the precursor to the human development approach many modern lists emphasize the minimum level of consumption of 'basic needs ' of not just food , water , and shelter , but also sanitation , education , and health care sanitation facilities : toilets or latrines must be accessible in or near the home shelter : homes must have fewer than four people living in each room access to services : this item is undefined by gordon , but normally is used to indicate the complete panoply of education , health , legal , social , and financial ( credit ) services some considered it to be '' a recipe for perpetuating economic backwardness '' and for giving the impression '' that poverty elimination is all too easy '' in the development discourse , the basic needs model focuses on the measurement of what is believed to be an eradicable level of poverty relative poverty means low income relative to others in a country : for example , below 60 % of the median income of people in that country relative poverty measurements unlike absolute poverty measurements take the social economic environment of the people observed into consideration a person can be poor in a relative terms but not in absolute terms as the person might be able to meet her/his basic needs , but is not able however to enjoy the same standards of living that other people in the same economy are enjoying relative poverty is thus a form of social exclusion that can for example affect peoples access to decent housing , education or job opportunities '' '' relative poverty reflects better the cost of social inclusion and equality of opportunity in a specific time and space for example , if everyone in a country 's income doubled , it would not reduce the amount of 'relative poverty ' at all '' in 1964 , in a joint committee economic president 's report in the united states , republicans endorsed the concept of relative poverty : '' no objective definition of poverty exists '' in 1965 , rose friedman argued for the use of relative poverty claiming that the definition of poverty changes with general living standards can be said to be in poverty when they lack the resources to obtain the types of diet , participate in the activities and have the living conditions and amenities which are customary , or are at least widely encouraged or approved , in the societies to which they belong ( page 31 ) '' relative poverty measures are used as official poverty rates by the european union , unicef and the oedc the main poverty line used in the oecd and the european union is based on '' economic distance '' , a level of income set at 60 % of the median household income the distinguishing feature between a living income and the poverty line is the concept of decency , wherein people thrive , not only survive as india is one of the fastest-growing economies in 2018 , poverty is on the decline in the country , with close to 44 indians escaping extreme poverty every minute , as per the world poverty clock living below the poverty threshold can have a major impact on a child ’ s education in the past years and into the present government , the use of the poverty threshold has consequences for such programs like medicaid and the children 's health insurance program as many as one in three impoverished people were not poor at birth ; rather , they descended into poverty over the course of their life studies measuring the differences between income before and after taxes and government transfers , have found that without social support programs , poverty would be roughly 30 % to 40 % higher than the official poverty line indicates

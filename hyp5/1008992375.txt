the poverty threshold was first developed by mollie orshansky between 1963-1964 she attributed the poverty threshold as a measure of income inadequacy by taking the cost of food plan per family of three or four and multiplying it by a factor of three.in 1969 the inter agency poverty level review committee adjusted the threshold for only price changes charles booth , a pioneering investigator of poverty in london at the turn of the 20th century , popularised the idea of a poverty line , a concept originally conceived by the london school board booth set the line at 10 & nbsp ; ( 50p ) to 20 shillings & nbsp ; ( £1 ) per week , which he considered to be the minimum amount necessary for a family of four or five people to subsist on he considered this amount to set his poverty line and concluded that 27.84 % of the total population of york lived below this poverty line 298 this result corresponded with that from charles booth 's study of poverty in london and so challenged the view , commonly held at the time , that abject poverty was a problem particular to london and was not widespread in the rest of britain rowntree distinguished between primary poverty , those lacking in income and secondary poverty , those who had enough income , but spent it elsewhere ( 1901:295–96 ) . absolute poverty and the international poverty line the term '' absolute poverty '' is also sometimes used as a synonym for extreme poverty absolute poverty is the absence of enough resources to secure basic life necessities to assist in measuring this , the world bank has a daily per capita international poverty line ( ipl ) , a global absolute minimum , of 1.90 a day as of october 2015 the new ipl replaces the 1.25 per day figure , which used 2005 data ravallion , martin ; chen shaohua & sangraula , prem dollar a day the world bank economic review , 23 , 2 , 2009 , pp using a single monetary poverty threshold is problematic when applied worldwide , due to the difficulty of comparing prices between countries it attempts to define the absolute minimum resources necessary for long-term physical well-being , usually in terms of consumption goods the poverty line is then defined as the amount of income required to satisfy those needs '' perhaps the high point of the wep was the world employment conference of 1976 , which proposed the satisfaction of basic human needs as the overriding objective of national and international development policy '' david gordon 's paper , '' indicators of poverty and hunger '' , for the united nations , further defines absolute poverty as the absence of any two of the following eight basic needs : food : body mass index must be above 16 safe drinking water : water must not come solely from rivers and ponds , and must be available nearby ( fewer than 15 minutes ' walk each way ) relative poverty means low income relative to others in a country : for example , below 60 % of the median income of people in that country the threshold for relative poverty is considered to be at 50 % of a country ’ s median equivalised disposable income after social transfers thus , it can vary greatly from country to country even after adjusting for purchasing power standards ( pps ) for practical purposes , the problem of poverty in the industrialized nations today is a problem of relative poverty ( page 9 ) '' however , some have argued that as relative poverty is merely a measure of inequality , using the term 'poverty ' for it is misleading in 1776 , adam smith argued that poverty is the inability to afford '' not only the commodities which are indispensably necessary for the support of life , but whatever the custom of the country renders it indecent for creditable people , even of the lowest order , to be without '' in 1958 , john kenneth galbraith argued , '' people are poverty stricken when their income , even if adequate for survival , falls markedly behind that of their community '' in 1965 , rose friedman argued for the use of relative poverty claiming that the definition of poverty changes with general living standards can be said to be in poverty when they lack the resources to obtain the types of diet , participate in the activities and have the living conditions and amenities which are customary , or are at least widely encouraged or approved , in the societies to which they belong ( page 31 ) whelan of the economic and social research institute ( esri ) in ireland explained that '' poverty has to be seen in terms of the standard of living of the society in question a measure of relative poverty defines '' poverty '' as being below some relative poverty threshold living income refers to the income needed to afford a decent standard of living in the place you live the distinguishing feature between a living income and the poverty line is the concept of decency , wherein people thrive , not only survive '' like the poverty line calculation , using a single global monetary calculation for living income is problematic when applied worldwide the world bank notes that poverty and standard of living can be measured by social perception as well , and found that in 2015 , roughly one third of the world ’ s population was considered poor in relation to their particular society as india is one of the fastest-growing economies in 2018 , poverty is on the decline in the country , with close to 44 indians escaping extreme poverty every minute , as per the world poverty clock federal poverty levels have direct effects on individual ’ s healthcare studies measuring the differences between income before and after taxes and government transfers , have found that without social support programs , poverty would be roughly 30 % to 40 % higher than the official poverty line indicates

the poverty threshold was first developed by mollie orshansky between 1963-1964 she attributed the poverty threshold as a measure of income inadequacy by taking the cost of food plan per family of three or four and multiplying it by a factor of three.in 1969 the inter agency poverty level review committee adjusted the threshold for only price changes charles booth , a pioneering investigator of poverty in london at the turn of the 20th century , popularised the idea of a poverty line , a concept originally conceived by the london school board booth set the line at 10 & nbsp ; ( 50p ) to 20 shillings & nbsp ; ( £1 ) per week , which he considered to be the minimum amount necessary for a family of four or five people to subsist on he considered this amount to set his poverty line and concluded that 27.84 % of the total population of york lived below this poverty line 298 this result corresponded with that from charles booth 's study of poverty in london and so challenged the view , commonly held at the time , that abject poverty was a problem particular to london and was not widespread in the rest of britain rowntree distinguished between primary poverty , those lacking in income and secondary poverty , those who had enough income , but spent it elsewhere ( 1901:295–96 ) . absolute poverty and the international poverty line the term '' absolute poverty '' is also sometimes used as a synonym for extreme poverty to assist in measuring this , the world bank has a daily per capita international poverty line ( ipl ) , a global absolute minimum , of 1.90 a day as of october 2015 absolute poverty : when necessity displaces desire revised , working papers 20170005 , new york university abu dhabi , department of social science , revised jun 2017 the poverty line is then defined as the amount of income required to satisfy those needs the basic needs approach to development was endorsed by governments and workers ' and employers ' organizations from all over the world many modern lists emphasize the minimum level of consumption of 'basic needs ' of not just food , water , and shelter , but also sanitation , education , and health care in 1978 , ghai investigated the literature that criticized the basic needs approach some considered it to be '' a recipe for perpetuating economic backwardness '' and for giving the impression '' that poverty elimination is all too easy '' relative poverty means low income relative to others in a country : for example , below 60 % of the median income of people in that country relative poverty measurements unlike absolute poverty measurements take the social economic environment of the people observed into consideration the threshold for relative poverty is considered to be at 50 % of a country ’ s median equivalised disposable income after social transfers relative poverty is thus a form of social exclusion that can for example affect peoples access to decent housing , education or job opportunities '' in 1958 , john kenneth galbraith argued , '' people are poverty stricken when their income , even if adequate for survival , falls markedly behind that of their community '' in 1964 , in a joint committee economic president 's report in the united states , republicans endorsed the concept of relative poverty : '' no objective definition of poverty exists '' in 1965 , rose friedman argued for the use of relative poverty claiming that the definition of poverty changes with general living standards in 1967 , american economist victor fuchs proposed that '' we define as poor any family whose income is less than one-half the median family income '' relative poverty measures are used as official poverty rates by the european union , unicef and the oedc the main poverty line used in the oecd and the european union is based on '' economic distance '' , a level of income set at 60 % of the median household income . relative poverty compared with other standards for example , the statement that '' those individuals who are employed and whose household equivalised disposable income is below 60 % of national median equivalised income are poor '' uses a relative measure to define poverty living income refers to the income needed to afford a decent standard of living in the place you live the distinguishing feature between a living income and the poverty line is the concept of decency , wherein people thrive , not only survive ” they define a living income as : '' the net annual income required for a household in a particular place to afford a decent standard of living for all members of that household '' like the poverty line calculation , using a single global monetary calculation for living income is problematic when applied worldwide india lifted 271 million people out of poverty in a 10-year time period from 2005/06 to 2015/16 women and children find themselves impacted by poverty more often when a part of single mother families in the past years and into the present government , the use of the poverty threshold has consequences for such programs like medicaid and the children 's health insurance program in regards to medicaid , child poverty is decreased by 5.3 % , and hispanic and black poverty by 6.1 % and 4.9 % respectively in particular , a 2017 urban institute study found that 61 % of non-elderly adults earning between 100–200 % of the poverty line reported at least one material hardship , not significantly different from those below the poverty line

rayon is produced by dissolving cellulose followed by the conversion of this solution back to insoluble fibrous cellulose max fremery and johann urban developed a method to produce carbon fibers for use in light bulbs in 1897 industriepark-oberbruch.de production of cuprammonium rayon for textiles started in 1899 in the vereinigte glanzstoff fabriken ag in oberbruch near aachen bemberg ag in 1904 made the artificial silk a product comparable to silk cuprammonium rayon has properties similar to viscose ; however , during its production , the cellulose is combined with copper and ammonia ( schweizer 's reagent ) due to the detrimental environmental effects of this production method , cuprammonium rayon is no longer produced in the united states the process built on the reaction of cellulose with a strong base , followed by treatment of that solution with carbon disulfide to give a xanthate derivative the xanthate is then converted back to a cellulose fiber in a subsequent step the name '' rayon '' was adopted in 1924 , with '' viscose '' being used for the viscous organic liquid used to make both rayon and cellophane the viscose method can use wood as a source of cellulose , whereas other routes to rayon require lignin-free cellulose as a starting material the use of woody sources of cellulose makes viscose cheaper , so it was traditionally used on a larger scale than the other methods rayon was produced only as a filament fiber until the 1930s when methods were developed to utilize '' broken waste rayon '' as staple fiber the physical properties of rayon remained unchanged until the development of high-tenacity rayon in the 1940s further research and development led to high-wet-modulus rayon ( hwm rayon ) in the 1950s substituting cotton fiber in tires and belts , industrial types of rayon developed a totally different set of properties , amongst which tensile strength and elastic modulus were paramount modal is a type of rayon but made from particularly high-quality cellulose ohio state university rayon fact sheet high-tenacity rayon is another modified version of viscose that has almost twice the strength of hwm the lyocell process relies on dissolution of cellulose products in a solvent , n-methylmorpholine n-oxide the process starts with cellulose and involves dry jet-wet spinning '' lyocell '' has become a genericized trademark , used to refer to the lyocell process for making cellulose fibers many early plastics , including celluloid , were made from nitrocellulose cellulose acetate shares many similarities with viscose rayon , and was formerly considered as the same textile rayon is a versatile fiber and is widely claimed to have the same comfort properties as natural fibers , although the drape and slipperiness of rayon textiles are often more like nylon it can imitate the feel and texture of silk , wool , cotton and linen the durability and appearance retention of regular viscose rayons are low , especially when wet ; also , rayon has the lowest elastic recovery of any fiber however , hwm rayon ( high-wet-modulus rayon ) is much stronger and exhibits higher durability and appearance retention hwm rayon can be machine-washed image : rayon_closeup_2.jpg another skirt with a different texture to prepare viscose , pulp is treated with aqueous sodium hydroxide ( typically 16-19 % w/w ) to form '' alkali cellulose '' , which has the approximate formula c 6 h 9 o 4 -ona the alkali cellulose is then treated with carbon disulfide to form sodium cellulose xanthate the thread made from the regenerated cellulose is washed to remove residual acid trade names are used within the rayon industry to label the type of rayon in the product north american rayon corporation of tennessee produced viscose rayon until its closure in the year 2000 for a review of all rayon production methods and markets see '' regenerated cellulose fibres '' ( book â€“ edited by c r woodings ) hardback 2001 , , woodhead publishing ltd what is viscose ? from barnhardt natural fibers viscose fibre

principally , the methods are the cuprammonium method , viscose method , and the lyocell process swiss chemist matthias eduard schweizer ( 1818â€“1860 ) discovered that cellulose dissolves in schweizer 's reagent industriepark-oberbruch.de production of cuprammonium rayon for textiles started in 1899 in the vereinigte glanzstoff fabriken ag in oberbruch near aachen cuprammonium rayon has properties similar to viscose ; however , during its production , the cellulose is combined with copper and ammonia ( schweizer 's reagent ) due to the detrimental environmental effects of this production method , cuprammonium rayon is no longer produced in the united states they named their material '' viscose '' because its production involved the intermediacy of a highly viscous solution the process built on the reaction of cellulose with a strong base , followed by treatment of that solution with carbon disulfide to give a xanthate derivative the xanthate is then converted back to a cellulose fiber in a subsequent step the first commercial viscose rayon was produced by the uk company courtaulds in november 1905 courtaulds formed an american division , american viscose ( later known as avtex fibers ) , to produce their formulation in the united states in 1910 the name '' rayon '' was adopted in 1924 , with '' viscose '' being used for the viscous organic liquid used to make both rayon and cellophane the viscose method can use wood as a source of cellulose , whereas other routes to rayon require lignin-free cellulose as a starting material the use of woody sources of cellulose makes viscose cheaper , so it was traditionally used on a larger scale than the other methods rayon was produced only as a filament fiber until the 1930s when methods were developed to utilize '' broken waste rayon '' as staple fiber the physical properties of rayon remained unchanged until the development of high-tenacity rayon in the 1940s industrial applications of rayon emerged around 1935 modal is a type of rayon but made from particularly high-quality cellulose high wet modulus rayon ( hwm ) is a modified version of viscose that is stronger when wet it also has the ability to be mercerized like cotton ohio state university rayon fact sheet high-tenacity rayon is another modified version of viscose that has almost twice the strength of hwm '' lyocell '' has become a genericized trademark , used to refer to the lyocell process for making cellulose fibers nitrocellulose is a derivative of cellulose that is soluble in organic solvents many early plastics , including celluloid , were made from nitrocellulose cellulose acetate shares many similarities with viscose rayon , and was formerly considered as the same textile rayon is a versatile fiber and is widely claimed to have the same comfort properties as natural fibers , although the drape and slipperiness of rayon textiles are often more like nylon it can imitate the feel and texture of silk , wool , cotton and linen the durability and appearance retention of regular viscose rayons are low , especially when wet ; also , rayon has the lowest elastic recovery of any fiber recommended care for regular viscose rayon is dry-cleaning only image : rayon_closeup_3.jpg a blouse with a texture similar to the second regular rayon has lengthwise lines called striations and its cross-section is an indented circular shape rayon fibers are naturally very bright , but the addition of delustering pigments cuts down on this natural brightness air also affects the ripening process since oxygen causes depolymerization north american rayon corporation of tennessee produced viscose rayon until its closure in the year 2000 nitrocellulose , another form of modified cellulose cellophane ( sheet-extruded viscose rayon ) hilaire de chardonnet ray p what is viscose ? from barnhardt natural fibers viscose fibre

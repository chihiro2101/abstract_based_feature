rayon is produced by dissolving cellulose followed by the conversion of this solution back to insoluble fibrous cellulose principally , the methods are the cuprammonium method , viscose method , and the lyocell process verinigte glanstoff fabriken merged with the nederlandse kunstzijdefabrieken in 1929 to form the algemene kunstzijde unie , akzonobel 's predecessor bemberg ag in 1904 made the artificial silk a product comparable to silk cuprammonium rayon has properties similar to viscose ; however , during its production , the cellulose is combined with copper and ammonia ( schweizer 's reagent ) due to the detrimental environmental effects of this production method , cuprammonium rayon is no longer produced in the united states english chemist charles frederick cross and his collaborators , edward john bevan and clayton beadle , patented their artificial silk in 1894 they named their material '' viscose '' because its production involved the intermediacy of a highly viscous solution the process built on the reaction of cellulose with a strong base , followed by treatment of that solution with carbon disulfide to give a xanthate derivative the xanthate is then converted back to a cellulose fiber in a subsequent step the first commercial viscose rayon was produced by the uk company courtaulds in november 1905 the name '' rayon '' was adopted in 1924 , with '' viscose '' being used for the viscous organic liquid used to make both rayon and cellophane in europe , though , the fabric itself became known as '' viscose '' , which has been ruled an acceptable alternative term for rayon by the us federal trade commission ( ftc ) the use of woody sources of cellulose makes viscose cheaper , so it was traditionally used on a larger scale than the other methods on the other hand , the original viscose process generates large amounts of contaminated wastewater rayon was produced only as a filament fiber until the 1930s when methods were developed to utilize '' broken waste rayon '' as staple fiber further research and development led to high-wet-modulus rayon ( hwm rayon ) in the 1950s research in the uk was centred on the government-funded british rayon research association modal is a type of rayon but made from particularly high-quality cellulose ohio state university rayon fact sheet high-tenacity rayon is another modified version of viscose that has almost twice the strength of hwm the lyocell process relies on dissolution of cellulose products in a solvent , n-methylmorpholine n-oxide the lyocell process is not widely used , because it is relatively expensive the process starts with cellulose and involves dry jet-wet spinning unlike the vicose process , the lycocell process does not use highly-toxic carbon sulfide '' lyocell '' has become a genericized trademark , used to refer to the lyocell process for making cellulose fibers nitrocellulose is a derivative of cellulose that is soluble in organic solvents cellulose acetate shares many similarities with viscose rayon , and was formerly considered as the same textile acetate must be laundered with care either by hand-washing or dry cleaning , and acetate garments disintegrate when heated in a tumble-dryer image : rayon_closeup_2.jpg another skirt with a different texture it is then dissolved and forced through a spinneret to produce filaments which are chemically solidified , resulting in fibers of nearly pure cellulose the spinning of viscose rayon fiber is done using a wet-spinning process north american rayon corporation of tennessee produced viscose rayon until its closure in the year 2000 however , the volatile carbon disulfide is lost before the rayon gets to the consumer ; the rayon itself is basically pure cellulose nitrocellulose , another form of modified cellulose cellophane ( sheet-extruded viscose rayon ) hilaire de chardonnet ray p what is viscose ? from barnhardt natural fibers viscose fibre

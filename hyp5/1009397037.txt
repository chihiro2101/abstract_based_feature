rayon is produced by dissolving cellulose followed by the conversion of this solution back to insoluble fibrous cellulose due to the detrimental environmental effects of this production method , cuprammonium rayon is no longer produced in the united states they named their material '' viscose '' because its production involved the intermediacy of a highly viscous solution the process built on the reaction of cellulose with a strong base , followed by treatment of that solution with carbon disulfide to give a xanthate derivative the xanthate is then converted back to a cellulose fiber in a subsequent step the first commercial viscose rayon was produced by the uk company courtaulds in november 1905 the name '' rayon '' was adopted in 1924 , with '' viscose '' being used for the viscous organic liquid used to make both rayon and cellophane the viscose method can use wood as a source of cellulose , whereas other routes to rayon require lignin-free cellulose as a starting material on the other hand , the original viscose process generates large amounts of contaminated wastewater newer technologies use less water and have improved the quality of the wastewater rayon was produced only as a filament fiber until the 1930s when methods were developed to utilize '' broken waste rayon '' as staple fiber the physical properties of rayon remained unchanged until the development of high-tenacity rayon in the 1940s further research and development led to high-wet-modulus rayon ( hwm rayon ) in the 1950s research in the uk was centred on the government-funded british rayon research association modal is a type of rayon but made from particularly high-quality cellulose the fabric has been known to pill less than cotton due to fiber properties and lower surface friction they are also wearing resistant and strong while maintaining a soft , silky feel rayon â€“ the multi-faceted fiber the lyocell process relies on dissolution of cellulose products in a solvent , n-methylmorpholine n-oxide the process starts with cellulose and involves dry jet-wet spinning unlike the vicose process , the lycocell process does not use highly-toxic carbon sulfide '' lyocell '' has become a genericized trademark , used to refer to the lyocell process for making cellulose fibers related materials are not regenerated cellulose , but esters of cellulose rayon is a versatile fiber and is widely claimed to have the same comfort properties as natural fibers , although the drape and slipperiness of rayon textiles are often more like nylon the fibers are easily dyed in a wide range of colors however , hwm rayon ( high-wet-modulus rayon ) is much stronger and exhibits higher durability and appearance retention recommended care for regular viscose rayon is dry-cleaning only regular rayon has lengthwise lines called striations and its cross-section is an indented circular shape the cross-sections of hwm and cupra rayon are rounder filament rayon yarns vary from 80 to 980 filaments per yarn and vary in size from 40 to 5000 denier the spinning of viscose rayon fiber is done using a wet-spinning process viscose rayon was first produced in coventry england in 1905 by courtaulds north american rayon corporation of tennessee produced viscose rayon until its closure in the year 2000 however , the volatile carbon disulfide is lost before the rayon gets to the consumer ; the rayon itself is basically pure cellulose nitrocellulose , another form of modified cellulose cellophane ( sheet-extruded viscose rayon ) hilaire de chardonnet ray p

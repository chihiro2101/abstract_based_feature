rayon and its variants rayon is produced by dissolving cellulose followed by the conversion of this solution back to insoluble fibrous cellulose principally , the methods are the cuprammonium method , viscose method , and the lyocell process swiss chemist matthias eduard schweizer ( 1818â€“1860 ) discovered that cellulose dissolves in schweizer 's reagent max fremery and johann urban developed a method to produce carbon fibers for use in light bulbs in 1897 industriepark-oberbruch.de production of cuprammonium rayon for textiles started in 1899 in the vereinigte glanzstoff fabriken ag in oberbruch near aachen cuprammonium rayon has properties similar to viscose ; however , during its production , the cellulose is combined with copper and ammonia ( schweizer 's reagent ) they named their material '' viscose '' because its production involved the intermediacy of a highly viscous solution the process built on the reaction of cellulose with a strong base , followed by treatment of that solution with carbon disulfide to give a xanthate derivative the xanthate is then converted back to a cellulose fiber in a subsequent step the first commercial viscose rayon was produced by the uk company courtaulds in november 1905 the name '' rayon '' was adopted in 1924 , with '' viscose '' being used for the viscous organic liquid used to make both rayon and cellophane the viscose method can use wood as a source of cellulose , whereas other routes to rayon require lignin-free cellulose as a starting material the use of woody sources of cellulose makes viscose cheaper , so it was traditionally used on a larger scale than the other methods on the other hand , the original viscose process generates large amounts of contaminated wastewater rayon was produced only as a filament fiber until the 1930s when methods were developed to utilize '' broken waste rayon '' as staple fiber the physical properties of rayon remained unchanged until the development of high-tenacity rayon in the 1940s further research and development led to high-wet-modulus rayon ( hwm rayon ) in the 1950s research in the uk was centred on the government-funded british rayon research association modal is a type of rayon but made from particularly high-quality cellulose modal can be tumble dried without damage due to its increased molecular alignment the lyocell process relies on dissolution of cellulose products in a solvent , n-methylmorpholine n-oxide the process starts with cellulose and involves dry jet-wet spinning unlike the vicose process , the lycocell process does not use highly-toxic carbon sulfide '' lyocell '' has become a genericized trademark , used to refer to the lyocell process for making cellulose fibers related materials are not regenerated cellulose , but esters of cellulose nitrocellulose is a derivative of cellulose that is soluble in organic solvents cellulose acetate shares many similarities with viscose rayon , and was formerly considered as the same textile rayon is a versatile fiber and is widely claimed to have the same comfort properties as natural fibers , although the drape and slipperiness of rayon textiles are often more like nylon it can imitate the feel and texture of silk , wool , cotton and linen staple fibers range from 1.5 to 15 denier and are mechanically or chemically crimped rayon fibers are naturally very bright , but the addition of delustering pigments cuts down on this natural brightness north american rayon corporation of tennessee produced viscose rayon until its closure in the year 2000 nitrocellulose , another form of modified cellulose cellophane ( sheet-extruded viscose rayon ) hilaire de chardonnet ray p what is viscose ? from barnhardt natural fibers viscose fibre

a distinction is made between texts that recur for every mass celebration , ordinary ) , and texts that are sung depending on the occasion , proper ) for example , for the tridentine mass : a ( '' full mass '' ) consists of a musical setting of the five sections of the ordinarium as listed below in the tridentine mass , the kyrie is the first sung prayer of the mass ordinary it is usually ( but not always ) part of any musical setting of the mass in what are presumed to be the oldest versions , the same melody is repeated for the first eight iterations , and a variation used on the final line ( that is , formally , aaa aaa aaa ' ) the kyrie for the requiem mass in the liber usualis has this form later kyries have more elaborate patterns , such as aaa bbb aaa ' , aaa bbb ccc ' , or aba cdc efe ' this encouraged later composers to make tropes out of them , either by adding words to the melisma ( as how a sequence is often considered ) , or extending the melisma as the kyrie is the first item in settings of the mass ordinary and the second in the requiem mass ( the only mass proper set regularly over the centuries ) , nearly all of the thousands of composers over the centuries who have set the ordinaries of the mass to music have included a kyrie movement famously , mozart sets the '' kyrie '' and '' christe '' texts in requiem ( mozart ) as the two subjects of a double fugue hosanna in excelsis is repeated after the benedictus section , often with musical material identical to that used after the sanctus , or very closely related in gregorian chant the sanctus ( with benedictus ) was sung whole at its place in the mass in a requiem mass , the words '' miserere nobis '' are replaced by '' dona eis requiem '' ( grant them rest ) , while '' dona nobis pacem '' is replaced by '' dona eis requiem sempiternam '' ( grant them eternal rest ) there is some additional terminology regarding mass settings indicating whether or not they include all five usual sections of the ordinarium , and whether or not the mass is intended for exceptionally festive occasions missa brevis ( literally : short mass ) may , depending on time and conventions , indicate the setting of a subset of the five ordinary mass parts ( e.g in that sense missa brevis is sometimes used to indicate the counterpart of a missa solemnis la petite messe solennelle de rossini… in le petit journal , 10 april 2014 thus , '' mass for the period of ( advent and ) lent '' indicates a mass composition without music for the gloria michael haydn composed a mass suitable for lent and advent , the missa tempore quadragesimae , in for the modest forces of choir and organ missa senza credo ( '' mass without a credo '' ) indicates a musical setting of the usual parts of the mass ordinary with exception of the credo the sixth and last part of the ordinarium ( either ite , missa est , or , in masses without gloria , benedicamus domino ) is usually not set as part of a mass composition in a tridentine mass that part of the ordinarium is usually spoken , or sung to the gregorian melody provided in the roman missal , although early polyphonic settings for the '' deo gratias '' response ( e.g in guillaume de machaut 's messe de nostre dame ) and for the benedicamus domino ( e.g the proper of the mass is usually not set to music in a mass itself , except in the case of a requiem mass , but may be the subject of motets or other musical compositions some mass compositions even consist entirely of such additions : schubert 's deutsche messe , a set of eight hymns with epilogue , brian newbould in a liturgical mass , there are other sections that may be sung , often in gregorian chant the different portions of the ordinary came into the liturgy at different times , with the kyrie probably being first ( perhaps as early as the 7th century ) and the credo being last ( it did not become part of the roman mass until 1014 ) in the early 14th century , composers began writing polyphonic versions of the sections of the ordinary the non-changing part of the mass , the ordinary , then would have music which was available for performance all the time two manuscripts from the 14th century , the ivrea codex and the apt codex , are the primary sources for polyphonic settings of the ordinary stylistically these settings are similar to both motets and secular music of the time , with a three-voice texture dominated by the highest part the first complete mass we know of whose composer can be identified was the messe de nostre dame ( mass of our lady ) by guillaume de machaut in the 14th century in particular , the song l'homme armé has a long history with composers ; more than 40 separate mass settings exist after the renaissance , the mass tended not to be the central genre for any one composer , yet among the most famous works of the baroque , classical , and romantic periods are settings of the ordinary of the mass he felt that some of the masses composed by the famous post-renaissance composers were too long and often more appropriate for a theatrical rather than a church setting choral settings of the creed , the most substantial movement , are nowadays rarely performed in anglican cathedrals

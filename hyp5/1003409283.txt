form of the mass a distinction is made between texts that recur for every mass celebration , ordinary ) , and texts that are sung depending on the occasion , proper ) a ( '' full mass '' ) consists of a musical setting of the five sections of the ordinarium as listed below in the tridentine mass , the kyrie is the first sung prayer of the mass ordinary it is usually ( but not always ) part of any musical setting of the mass kyrie movements often have a ternary ( aba ) musical structure that reflects the symmetrical structure of the text musical settings exist in styles ranging from gregorian chant to folk the kyrie for the requiem mass in the liber usualis has this form in forms both with and without literal repeats , most kyries in the liber usualis have a closing phrase used in nearly all of the lines of the text this in fact parallels the text , as each line ends with the same word '' eleison '' this encouraged later composers to make tropes out of them , either by adding words to the melisma ( as how a sequence is often considered ) , or extending the melisma famously , mozart sets the '' kyrie '' and '' christe '' texts in requiem ( mozart ) as the two subjects of a double fugue in mass settings ( normally in english ) composed for the church of england 's book of common prayer liturgy , the gloria is commonly the last movement , because it occurs in this position in the text of the service while most hymnal settings keep the second person pronoun , other settings change the second person pronoun to the third person martin luther 's chorale isaiah , mighty in days of old , and felix mendelssohn 's setting of the heilig ! ( german sanctus ) from his deutsche liturgie also use the third person in gregorian chant the sanctus ( with benedictus ) was sung whole at its place in the mass in a requiem mass , the words '' miserere nobis '' are replaced by '' dona eis requiem '' ( grant them rest ) , while '' dona nobis pacem '' is replaced by '' dona eis requiem sempiternam '' ( grant them eternal rest ) masses containing only a setting of the kyrie and the gloria ) , or a mass containing all these parts , but relatively short in duration , or a mass in a setting that is less extended in vocal and orchestral forces than that of a neapolitan mass missa longa ( '' long mass '' ) can indicate the counterpart of missa brevis when the aspect of duration is considered in that sense missa brevis is sometimes used to indicate the counterpart of a missa solemnis the '' brevis et solemnis '' description applies to several of the masses mozart composed in salzburg between 1775 and 1780 , the sparrow mass being considered as its first instance for this composer thus , '' mass for the period of ( advent and ) lent '' indicates a mass composition without music for the gloria michael haydn composed a mass suitable for lent and advent , the missa tempore quadragesimae , in for the modest forces of choir and organ the sixth and last part of the ordinarium ( either ite , missa est , or , in masses without gloria , benedicamus domino ) is usually not set as part of a mass composition some mass compositions , like for instance rossini 's petite messe solennelle , do however contain parts outside the ordinarium some mass compositions even consist entirely of such additions : schubert 's deutsche messe , a set of eight hymns with epilogue , brian newbould the sections of the proper of the mass include the introit , gradual , alleluia or tract ( depending on the time of year ) , offertory and communion ordinarium and proprium sections of a specific liturgical mass are not typically set to music together in the same composition the one major exception to this rule is the mass for the dead , or requiem the different portions of the ordinary came into the liturgy at different times , with the kyrie probably being first ( perhaps as early as the 7th century ) and the credo being last ( it did not become part of the roman mass until 1014 ) the non-changing part of the mass , the ordinary , then would have music which was available for performance all the time stylistically these settings are similar to both motets and secular music of the time , with a three-voice texture dominated by the highest part 196 the missa sine nomine , literally '' mass without a name '' , refers to a mass written on freely composed material sometimes these masses were named for other things , such as palestrina 's famous missa papae marcelli , the mass of pope marcellus , and many times they were canonic masses , as in missa sine nomine ( josquin ) many of mozart 's masses are in missa brevis form , as are some of haydn 's early ones in the 20th century , composers continued to write masses , in an even wider diversity of style , form and function than before with reforms in the anglican liturgy , the movements are now usually sung in the same order that they are in the roman catholic rite

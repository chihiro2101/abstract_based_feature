a distinction is made between texts that recur for every mass celebration , ordinary ) , and texts that are sung depending on the occasion , proper ) a ( '' full mass '' ) consists of a musical setting of the five sections of the ordinarium as listed below in the tridentine mass , the kyrie is the first sung prayer of the mass ordinary it is usually ( but not always ) part of any musical setting of the mass kyrie movements often have a ternary ( aba ) musical structure that reflects the symmetrical structure of the text musical settings exist in styles ranging from gregorian chant to folk later kyries have more elaborate patterns , such as aaa bbb aaa ' , aaa bbb ccc ' , or aba cdc efe ' in forms both with and without literal repeats , most kyries in the liber usualis have a closing phrase used in nearly all of the lines of the text this encouraged later composers to make tropes out of them , either by adding words to the melisma ( as how a sequence is often considered ) , or extending the melisma as the kyrie is the first item in settings of the mass ordinary and the second in the requiem mass ( the only mass proper set regularly over the centuries ) , nearly all of the thousands of composers over the centuries who have set the ordinaries of the mass to music have included a kyrie movement kyrie movements often have a structure that reflects the concision and symmetry of the text in mass settings ( normally in english ) composed for the church of england 's book of common prayer liturgy , the gloria is commonly the last movement , because it occurs in this position in the text of the service the purpose of singing these two texts in latin is to engender a sense of unity in the faithful , all of whom thus sing the prayer of jesus and the shared belief of the universal church in the same language in a requiem mass , the words '' miserere nobis '' are replaced by '' dona eis requiem '' ( grant them rest ) , while '' dona nobis pacem '' is replaced by '' dona eis requiem sempiternam '' ( grant them eternal rest ) masses containing only a setting of the kyrie and the gloria ) , or a mass containing all these parts , but relatively short in duration , or a mass in a setting that is less extended in vocal and orchestral forces than that of a neapolitan mass missa longa ( '' long mass '' ) can indicate the counterpart of missa brevis when the aspect of duration is considered missa solemnis indicates a solemn mass , usually for special festive occasions and with an extended vocal and orchestral setting the '' brevis et solemnis '' description applies to several of the masses mozart composed in salzburg between 1775 and 1780 , the sparrow mass being considered as its first instance for this composer tongue-in-cheek , and not indebted to viennese traditions , gioachino rossini qualified one of his last compositions , a petite messe solennelle thus , '' mass for the period of ( advent and ) lent '' indicates a mass composition without music for the gloria michael haydn composed a mass suitable for lent and advent , the missa tempore quadragesimae , in for the modest forces of choir and organ missa senza credo ( '' mass without a credo '' ) indicates a musical setting of the usual parts of the mass ordinary with exception of the credo the sixth and last part of the ordinarium ( either ite , missa est , or , in masses without gloria , benedicamus domino ) is usually not set as part of a mass composition in a tridentine mass that part of the ordinarium is usually spoken , or sung to the gregorian melody provided in the roman missal , although early polyphonic settings for the '' deo gratias '' response ( e.g the proper of the mass is usually not set to music in a mass itself , except in the case of a requiem mass , but may be the subject of motets or other musical compositions some mass compositions , like for instance rossini 's petite messe solennelle , do however contain parts outside the ordinarium also purely instrumental compositions can be part of a mass celebration , e.g in a liturgical mass , there are other sections that may be sung , often in gregorian chant these sections , the '' proper '' of the mass , change with the day and season according to the church calendar , or according to the special circumstances of the mass ordinarium and proprium sections of a specific liturgical mass are not typically set to music together in the same composition the different portions of the ordinary came into the liturgy at different times , with the kyrie probably being first ( perhaps as early as the 7th century ) and the credo being last ( it did not become part of the roman mass until 1014 ) 196 the missa sine nomine , literally '' mass without a name '' , refers to a mass written on freely composed material many famous and influential masses were composed by josquin des prez , the single most influential composer of the middle renaissance the large scale masses of the first half of the century still have glorias and credos divided into many movements , unlike smaller masses for ordinary churches many of mozart 's masses are in missa brevis form , as are some of haydn 's early ones later masses , especially of haydn , are of symphonic structure , with long sections divided into fewer movements , organized like a symphony , with soloists used as an ensemble rather than as individuals since the texts of the 'benedictus qui venit ' and the 'agnus dei ' do not actually feature in the liturgy of the 1662 book of common prayer , these movements are often missing from some of the earlier anglican settings

form of the mass a distinction is made between texts that recur for every mass celebration , ordinary ) , and texts that are sung depending on the occasion , proper ) a ( '' full mass '' ) consists of a musical setting of the five sections of the ordinarium as listed below in the tridentine mass , the kyrie is the first sung prayer of the mass ordinary these repeats are notated by the roman numerals '' iij '' ( for three times ) or '' ij '' ( for twice ) later kyries have more elaborate patterns , such as aaa bbb aaa ' , aaa bbb ccc ' , or aba cdc efe ' in forms both with and without literal repeats , most kyries in the liber usualis have a closing phrase used in nearly all of the lines of the text as the kyrie is the first item in settings of the mass ordinary and the second in the requiem mass ( the only mass proper set regularly over the centuries ) , nearly all of the thousands of composers over the centuries who have set the ordinaries of the mass to music have included a kyrie movement kyrie movements often have a structure that reflects the concision and symmetry of the text in mass settings ( normally in english ) composed for the church of england 's book of common prayer liturgy , the gloria is commonly the last movement , because it occurs in this position in the text of the service in order one of the newer common worship liturgy , however , it is restored to its earlier place in the service the purpose of singing these two texts in latin is to engender a sense of unity in the faithful , all of whom thus sing the prayer of jesus and the shared belief of the universal church in the same language hosanna in excelsis is repeated after the benedictus section , often with musical material identical to that used after the sanctus , or very closely related there is some additional terminology regarding mass settings indicating whether or not they include all five usual sections of the ordinarium , and whether or not the mass is intended for exceptionally festive occasions missa brevis ( literally : short mass ) may , depending on time and conventions , indicate the setting of a subset of the five ordinary mass parts ( e.g missa longa ( '' long mass '' ) can indicate the counterpart of missa brevis when the aspect of duration is considered missa solemnis indicates a solemn mass , usually for special festive occasions and with an extended vocal and orchestral setting in that sense missa brevis is sometimes used to indicate the counterpart of a missa solemnis mozart described it thus in a letter he wrote in 1776 ( '' the archbishop '' in this quotation refers to colloredo ) : walter senn , nma series i : geistliche gesangwerke , group i ( masses and requiem ) , division i : masses , volume 2 , preface , pp the '' brevis et solemnis '' description applies to several of the masses mozart composed in salzburg between 1775 and 1780 , the sparrow mass being considered as its first instance for this composer tongue-in-cheek , and not indebted to viennese traditions , gioachino rossini qualified one of his last compositions , a petite messe solennelle michael haydn composed a mass suitable for lent and advent , the missa tempore quadragesimae , in for the modest forces of choir and organ missa senza credo ( '' mass without a credo '' ) indicates a musical setting of the usual parts of the mass ordinary with exception of the credo the sixth and last part of the ordinarium ( either ite , missa est , or , in masses without gloria , benedicamus domino ) is usually not set as part of a mass composition the proper of the mass is usually not set to music in a mass itself , except in the case of a requiem mass , but may be the subject of motets or other musical compositions some mass compositions , like for instance rossini 's petite messe solennelle , do however contain parts outside the ordinarium also purely instrumental compositions can be part of a mass celebration , e.g the sections of the proper of the mass include the introit , gradual , alleluia or tract ( depending on the time of year ) , offertory and communion ordinarium and proprium sections of a specific liturgical mass are not typically set to music together in the same composition paraphrase and parody supplanted cantus-firmus as the techniques of choice in the 16th century : palestrina alone wrote 51 parody masses the lutheran michael praetorius composed a mass for double choir in the old style , which he published in 1611 in the collection of church music for the mass in latin , missodia sionia many of mozart 's masses are in missa brevis form , as are some of haydn 's early ones after the renaissance , the mass tended not to be the central genre for any one composer , yet among the most famous works of the baroque , classical , and romantic periods are settings of the ordinary of the mass the revival of choral celebration of holy communion in the anglican church in the late 19th century marked the beginning several liturgical settings of mass texts in english , particularly for choir and organ he felt that some of the masses composed by the famous post-renaissance composers were too long and often more appropriate for a theatrical rather than a church setting masses written for the anglican liturgy since the texts of the 'benedictus qui venit ' and the 'agnus dei ' do not actually feature in the liturgy of the 1662 book of common prayer , these movements are often missing from some of the earlier anglican settings

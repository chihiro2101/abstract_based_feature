a distinction is made between texts that recur for every mass celebration , ordinary ) , and texts that are sung depending on the occasion , proper ) a ( '' full mass '' ) consists of a musical setting of the five sections of the ordinarium as listed below in the tridentine mass , the kyrie is the first sung prayer of the mass ordinary it is usually ( but not always ) part of any musical setting of the mass kyrie movements often have a ternary ( aba ) musical structure that reflects the symmetrical structure of the text in what are presumed to be the oldest versions , the same melody is repeated for the first eight iterations , and a variation used on the final line ( that is , formally , aaa aaa aaa ' ) in some cases , verses interpolate latin text between each '' kyrie '' ( or '' christe '' ) and '' eleison '' as the kyrie is the first item in settings of the mass ordinary and the second in the requiem mass ( the only mass proper set regularly over the centuries ) , nearly all of the thousands of composers over the centuries who have set the ordinaries of the mass to music have included a kyrie movement famously , mozart sets the '' kyrie '' and '' christe '' texts in requiem ( mozart ) as the two subjects of a double fugue in mass settings ( normally in english ) composed for the church of england 's book of common prayer liturgy , the gloria is commonly the last movement , because it occurs in this position in the text of the service while most hymnal settings keep the second person pronoun , other settings change the second person pronoun to the third person in a requiem mass , the words '' miserere nobis '' are replaced by '' dona eis requiem '' ( grant them rest ) , while '' dona nobis pacem '' is replaced by '' dona eis requiem sempiternam '' ( grant them eternal rest ) there is some additional terminology regarding mass settings indicating whether or not they include all five usual sections of the ordinarium , and whether or not the mass is intended for exceptionally festive occasions missa brevis ( literally : short mass ) may , depending on time and conventions , indicate the setting of a subset of the five ordinary mass parts ( e.g masses containing only a setting of the kyrie and the gloria ) , or a mass containing all these parts , but relatively short in duration , or a mass in a setting that is less extended in vocal and orchestral forces than that of a neapolitan mass missa longa ( '' long mass '' ) can indicate the counterpart of missa brevis when the aspect of duration is considered missa solemnis indicates a solemn mass , usually for special festive occasions and with an extended vocal and orchestral setting the missa brevis et solemnis ( short and solemn ) is an exceptional format , for its best known instances tied to the salzburg of archbishop hieronymus colloredo , although earlier examples are extant mozart described it thus in a letter he wrote in 1776 ( '' the archbishop '' in this quotation refers to colloredo ) : walter senn , nma series i : geistliche gesangwerke , group i ( masses and requiem ) , division i : masses , volume 2 , preface , pp the '' brevis et solemnis '' description applies to several of the masses mozart composed in salzburg between 1775 and 1780 , the sparrow mass being considered as its first instance for this composer in this case '' small '' rather refers to the modest forces needed for its performance , and '' solemn '' to its duration , although later commentators would describe the composition as '' neither small nor solemn '' other types of masses with fewer than five of the usual parts of the ordinarium michael haydn composed a mass suitable for lent and advent , the missa tempore quadragesimae , in for the modest forces of choir and organ missa senza credo ( '' mass without a credo '' ) indicates a musical setting of the usual parts of the mass ordinary with exception of the credo the sixth and last part of the ordinarium ( either ite , missa est , or , in masses without gloria , benedicamus domino ) is usually not set as part of a mass composition the proper of the mass is usually not set to music in a mass itself , except in the case of a requiem mass , but may be the subject of motets or other musical compositions a sonata da chiesa , sometimes with a liturgical function , like church sonatas ( mozart ) in a liturgical mass , there are other sections that may be sung , often in gregorian chant the sections of the proper of the mass include the introit , gradual , alleluia or tract ( depending on the time of year ) , offertory and communion the different portions of the ordinary came into the liturgy at different times , with the kyrie probably being first ( perhaps as early as the 7th century ) and the credo being last ( it did not become part of the roman mass until 1014 ) several anonymous complete masses from the 14th century survive , including the tournai mass ; however , discrepancies in style indicate that the movements of these masses were written by several composers and later compiled by scribes into a single set the first complete mass we know of whose composer can be identified was the messe de nostre dame ( mass of our lady ) by guillaume de machaut in the 14th century the earliest complete settings date from the 14th century , with the most famous example being the messe de nostre dame of guillaume de machaut the revival of choral celebration of holy communion in the anglican church in the late 19th century marked the beginning several liturgical settings of mass texts in english , particularly for choir and organ pope pius x initiated many regulations reforming the liturgical music of the mass in the early 20th century some of the rules he put forth include the following : tra le sollecitudini that any mass be composed in an integrated fashion , not by assembling different compositions for different parts these are more often known as 'communion services ' , and differ not only in that they are settings of english words , but also , as mentioned above , in that the gloria usually forms the last movement

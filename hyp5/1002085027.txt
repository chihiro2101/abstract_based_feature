in his history of the peloponnesian war , thucydides ascribes a speech to archidamus ii in which he stresses the importance for sparta of civic education for the spartan virtues of toughness , obedience , cunning , simplicity , and preparedness : and we are wise , because we are educated with too little learning to despise the laws , and with too severe a self-control to disobey them , and are brought up not to be too knowing in useless matters—such as the knowledge which can give a specious criticism of an enemy 's plans in theory , but fails to assail them with equal success in practice—but are taught to consider that the schemes of our enemies are not dissimilar to our own , and that the freaks of chance are not determinable by calculation in practice we always base our preparations against an enemy on the assumption that his plans are good ; indeed , it is right to rest our hopes not on a belief in his blunders , but on the soundness of our provisions french essayist michel de montaigne commended how agesilaus ii , the son of archidamus , followed his father 's approach closely : one asking to this purpose , agesilaus , what he thought most proper for boys to learn ? “ what they ought to do when they come to be men , ” said he rousseau adopts the expression in his diswuys sur tes lettres.—it is no wonder , if such an institution produced so admirable effects plutarch relates a comparison made by simonides between spartan education of citizens and horse husbandry : simonides called sparta '' the tamer of men , '' because by early strictness of education , they , more than any nation , trained the citizens to obedience to the laws , and made them tractable and patient of subjection , as horses that are broken in while colts whence it was that , men say , simonides called sparta '' the tamer of men , '' because by early strictness of education , they , more than any nation , trained the citizens to obedience to the laws , and made them tractable and patient of subjection , as horses that are broken in while colts but agesilaus , whose good fortune it was to be born a younger brother , was consequently bred to all the arts of obedience , and so the better fitted for the government , when it fell to his share ; hence it was that he proved the most popular-tempered of the spartan kings , his early life having added to his natural kingly and commanding qualities the gentle and humane feelings of a citizen.translated by john dryden in order to the good education of their youth ( which , as i said before , he thought the most important and noblest work of a lawgiver ) , he went so far back as to take into consideration their very conception and birth , by regulating their marriages lycurgus was of another mind ; he would not have masters bought out of the market for his young spartans , nor such as should sell their pains ; nor was it lawful , indeed , for the father himself to breed up the children after his own fancy ; but as soon as they were seven years old they were to be enrolled in certain companies and classes , where they all lived under the same order and discipline , doing their exercises and taking their play together of these , he who showed the most conduct and courage was made captain ; they had their eyes always upon him , obeyed his orders , and underwent patiently whatsoever punishment he inflicted ; so that the whole course of their education was one continued exercise of a ready and perfect obedience he also describes how the spartans limited civic education so as to maintain social control over the young : reading and writing they gave them , just enough to serve their turn ; their chief care was to make them good subjects , and to teach them to endure pain and conquer in battle if they had not an answer ready to the question who was a good or who an ill-reputed citizen , they were looked upon as of a dull and careless disposition , and to have little or no sense of virtue and honor ; besides this , they were to give a good reason for what they said , and in as few words and as comprehensive as might be ; he that failed of this , or answered not to the purpose , had his thumb bit by his master it is a thing worthy of very great consideration , that in that excellent , and , in truth , for its perfection , prodigious form of civil regimen set down by lycurgus , though so solicitous of the education of children , as a thing of the greatest concern , and even in the very seat of the muses , he should make so little mention of learning ; as if that generous youth , disdaining all other subjection but that of virtue , ought to be supplied , instead of tutors to read to them arts and sciences , with such masters as should only instruct them in valour , prudence , and justice ; an example that plato has followed in his laws the manner of their discipline was to propound to them questions in judgment upon men and their actions ; and if they commended or condemned this or that person or fact , they were to give a reason for so doing ; by which means they at once sharpened their understanding , and learned what was right and their very songs had a life and spirit in them that inflamed and possessed men 's minds with an enthusiasm and ardor for action ; the style of them was plain and without affectation ; the subject always serious and moral ; most usually , it was in praise of such men as had died in defense of their country , or in derision of those that had been cowards ; the former they declared happy and glorified ; the life of the latter they described as most miserable and abject '' to conclude , lycurgus bred up his citizens in such a way that they neither would nor could live by themselves ; they were to make themselves one with the public good , and , clustering like bees around their commander , be by their zeal and public spirit carried all but out of themselves , and devoted wholly to their country '' the truth is , he took in their case , also , all the care that was possible ; he ordered the maidens to exercise themselves with wrestling , running , throwing the quoit , and casting the dart , to the end that the fruit they conceived might , in strong and healthy bodies , take firmer root and find better growth , and withal that they , with this greater vigor , might be the more able to undergo the pains of child bearing pericles ' funeral oration provides insight into athens ' sharply contrasting form of civic education from sparta , for personal freedom , rather than blind obedience , where he boasts that athens is 'the school of hellas ' , since : in education , where our rivals from their very cradles by a painful discipline seek after manliness , at athens we live exactly as we please , and yet are just as ready to encounter every legitimate danger in the aristophanes comedy the frogs , the character of the playwright aeschylus scolds fellow tragedian euripides for writing scenes pernicious to proper ideals of citizenship : what crimes is he not guilty of ? did he not put up on display pimps and women giving birth in holy shrines and having sex with their own brothers , and then claim that living is no life ? so now , because of him our city here is crammed with bureaucratic types and stupid democratic apes who always cheat our people '' and then , that i did not fall into the ambition of ordinary sophists , either to write tracts concerning the common theorems , or to exhort men unto virtue and the study of philosophy by public orations ; as also that i never by way of ostentation did affect to show myself an active able man , for any kind of bodily exercises for as he that is so bitten , has a continuall torment of thirst , and yet abhorreth water ; and is in such an estate , as if the poyson endeavoured to convert him into a dogge : so when a monarchy is once bitten to the quick , by those democraticall writers , that continually snarle at that estate ; it wanteth nothing more than a strong monarch , which neverthelesse out of a certain tyrannophobia , or feare of being strongly governed , when they have him , they abhorre neither hath learning an influence and operation only upon civil merit and moral virtue , and the arts or temperature of peace and peaceable government ; but likewise it hath no less power and efficacy in enablement towards martial and military virtue and prowess , as may be notably represented in the examples of alexander the great and cæsar the dictator ( mentioned before , but now in fit place to be resumed ) , of whose virtues and acts in war there needs no note or recital , having been the wonders of time in that kind ; but of their affections towards learning and perfections in learning it is pertinent to say somewhat but is it not true also , that much less young men are fit auditors of matters of policy , till they have been thoroughly seasoned in religion and morality ; lest their judgments be corrupted , and made apt to think that there are no true differences of things ? project gutenberg '' this type of education is often alluded to in the deliberative democracy literature as fulfilling the necessary and fundamental social and institutional changes necessary to develop a democracy that involves intensive participation in group decision making , negotiation , and social life of consequence .

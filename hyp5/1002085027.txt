in practice we always base our preparations against an enemy on the assumption that his plans are good ; indeed , it is right to rest our hopes not on a belief in his blunders , but on the soundness of our provisions nor ought we to believe that there is much difference between man and man , but to think that the superiority lies with him who is reared in the severest school french essayist michel de montaigne commended how agesilaus ii , the son of archidamus , followed his father 's approach closely : one asking to this purpose , agesilaus , what he thought most proper for boys to learn ? “ what they ought to do when they come to be men , ” said he one asking to this purpose , agesilaus , what he thought most proper for boys to learn ? “ what they ought to do when they come to be men , ” said he.—plutarch , apothegms of the lacedamonians plutarch relates a comparison made by simonides between spartan education of citizens and horse husbandry : simonides called sparta '' the tamer of men , '' because by early strictness of education , they , more than any nation , trained the citizens to obedience to the laws , and made them tractable and patient of subjection , as horses that are broken in while colts now the succession belonging to agis by law , agesilaus , who in all probability was to be but a private man , was educated according to the usual discipline of the country , hard and severe , and meant to teach young men to obey their superiors whence it was that , men say , simonides called sparta '' the tamer of men , '' because by early strictness of education , they , more than any nation , trained the citizens to obedience to the laws , and made them tractable and patient of subjection , as horses that are broken in while colts according to the roman historian plutarch , the semi-legendary lycurgus of sparta considered education of the citizenry to be his main priority as framer of the spartan constitution in order to the good education of their youth ( which , as i said before , he thought the most important and noblest work of a lawgiver ) , he went so far back as to take into consideration their very conception and birth , by regulating their marriages of these , he who showed the most conduct and courage was made captain ; they had their eyes always upon him , obeyed his orders , and underwent patiently whatsoever punishment he inflicted ; so that the whole course of their education was one continued exercise of a ready and perfect obedience however , the youth were also required to express themselves forcefully and succinctly , plutarch '' as well to think and reflect on matters of civic virtue , including such questions as who is or is not a good citizen of sparta montaigne would later praise this particular technique of education , admiring the way spartan citizens spent their time learning to acquire virtues such as courage and temperance , to the exclusion of studying any other subject the manner of their discipline was to propound to them questions in judgment upon men and their actions ; and if they commended or condemned this or that person or fact , they were to give a reason for so doing ; by which means they at once sharpened their understanding , and learned what was right '' to conclude , lycurgus bred up his citizens in such a way that they neither would nor could live by themselves ; they were to make themselves one with the public good , and , clustering like bees around their commander , be by their zeal and public spirit carried all but out of themselves , and devoted wholly to their country and polycratidas , being sent with some others ambassador to the lieutenants of the king of persia , being asked by them whether they came in a private or in a public character , answered , '' in a public , if we succeed ; if not , in a private character '' ' civic education for toughness and martial prowess was not only within the purview of spartan men : plutarch recounts how lycurgus 'ordered the maidens to exercises themselves with wrestling , running , throwing the quoit , and chasing the dart ' with a view to creating healthy children for the state pericles ' funeral oration provides insight into athens ' sharply contrasting form of civic education from sparta , for personal freedom , rather than blind obedience , where he boasts that athens is 'the school of hellas ' , since : in education , where our rivals from their very cradles by a painful discipline seek after manliness , at athens we live exactly as we please , and yet are just as ready to encounter every legitimate danger in the socratic dialogue crito , crito of alopece learns from socrates the importance in civic education of following expert opinion , rather than majority opinion crito also hears socrates ' argument that a citizen ought to obey his city 's laws partly because it was his city which educated him for citizenship in his treatise leviathan , english philosopher thomas hobbes heavily criticised the emphasis in contemporary civic education on studying athenian democracy and roman republicanism , saying that it wrongly encouraged monarchical subjects to restrain the actions of their monarchs for as he that is so bitten , has a continuall torment of thirst , and yet abhorreth water ; and is in such an estate , as if the poyson endeavoured to convert him into a dogge : so when a monarchy is once bitten to the quick , by those democraticall writers , that continually snarle at that estate ; it wanteth nothing more than a strong monarch , which neverthelesse out of a certain tyrannophobia , or feare of being strongly governed , when they have him , they abhorre however , in his essay the advancement of learning , bacon also argues that civic education should be preceded by religious and moral education , so that those who judge policy will not be under the influence of moral relativism '' this type of education is often alluded to in the deliberative democracy literature as fulfilling the necessary and fundamental social and institutional changes necessary to develop a democracy that involves intensive participation in group decision making , negotiation , and social life of consequence .

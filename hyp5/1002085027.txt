in practice we always base our preparations against an enemy on the assumption that his plans are good ; indeed , it is right to rest our hopes not on a belief in his blunders , but on the soundness of our provisions french essayist michel de montaigne commended how agesilaus ii , the son of archidamus , followed his father 's approach closely : one asking to this purpose , agesilaus , what he thought most proper for boys to learn ? “ what they ought to do when they come to be men , ” said he one asking to this purpose , agesilaus , what he thought most proper for boys to learn ? “ what they ought to do when they come to be men , ” said he.—plutarch , apothegms of the lacedamonians plutarch relates a comparison made by simonides between spartan education of citizens and horse husbandry : simonides called sparta '' the tamer of men , '' because by early strictness of education , they , more than any nation , trained the citizens to obedience to the laws , and made them tractable and patient of subjection , as horses that are broken in while colts now the succession belonging to agis by law , agesilaus , who in all probability was to be but a private man , was educated according to the usual discipline of the country , hard and severe , and meant to teach young men to obey their superiors whence it was that , men say , simonides called sparta '' the tamer of men , '' because by early strictness of education , they , more than any nation , trained the citizens to obedience to the laws , and made them tractable and patient of subjection , as horses that are broken in while colts but agesilaus , whose good fortune it was to be born a younger brother , was consequently bred to all the arts of obedience , and so the better fitted for the government , when it fell to his share ; hence it was that he proved the most popular-tempered of the spartan kings , his early life having added to his natural kingly and commanding qualities the gentle and humane feelings of a citizen.translated by john dryden in order to the good education of their youth ( which , as i said before , he thought the most important and noblest work of a lawgiver ) , he went so far back as to take into consideration their very conception and birth , by regulating their marriages plutarch observes that 'the whole course of spartan education was one of continued exercise of a ready and perfect obedience ' plutarch of these , he who showed the most conduct and courage was made captain ; they had their eyes always upon him , obeyed his orders , and underwent patiently whatsoever punishment he inflicted ; so that the whole course of their education was one continued exercise of a ready and perfect obedience in which 'there scarcely was any time or place without someone present to put them in mind of their duty , and punish them if they had neglected it he also describes how the spartans limited civic education so as to maintain social control over the young : reading and writing they gave them , just enough to serve their turn ; their chief care was to make them good subjects , and to teach them to endure pain and conquer in battle '' as well to think and reflect on matters of civic virtue , including such questions as who is or is not a good citizen of sparta montaigne would later praise this particular technique of education , admiring the way spartan citizens spent their time learning to acquire virtues such as courage and temperance , to the exclusion of studying any other subject the manner of their discipline was to propound to them questions in judgment upon men and their actions ; and if they commended or condemned this or that person or fact , they were to give a reason for so doing ; by which means they at once sharpened their understanding , and learned what was right '' essentially , the spartan ideal of civic education was a process whereby the interest of the citizen becomes totally united with the interest of the polity , in a spirit of perfect patriotism : 'to conclude , lycurgus bred up his citizens in such a way that they neither would nor could live by themselves ; they were to make themselves one with the public good , and , clustering like bees around their commander , be by their zeal and public spirit carried all but out of themselves , and devoted wholly to their country '' to conclude , lycurgus bred up his citizens in such a way that they neither would nor could live by themselves ; they were to make themselves one with the public good , and , clustering like bees around their commander , be by their zeal and public spirit carried all but out of themselves , and devoted wholly to their country '' ' civic education for toughness and martial prowess was not only within the purview of spartan men : plutarch recounts how lycurgus 'ordered the maidens to exercises themselves with wrestling , running , throwing the quoit , and chasing the dart ' with a view to creating healthy children for the state however , english philosopher thomas hobbes believed that the athenians were only taught to think they had personal freedom in order to discourage them from seeking reform and because the athenians were taught , ( to keep them from desire of changing their government , ) that they were freemen , and all that lived under monarchy were slaves ; therefore aristotle puts it down in his politiques , ( lib.6.cap.2 ) '' in democracy , liberty is to be supposed : for 't is commonly held , that no man is free in any other government similarly , plutarch would later speak of the power of the poet thales to , in the words of the english poet john milton , 'prepare and mollify the spartan surliness with his smooth songs and odes , the better to plant among them law and civility' '' from his brother he imbibed a specific ideal for the roman state : he it was also that did put me in the first conceit and desire of an equal commonwealth , administered by justice and equality ; and of a kingdom wherein should be regarded nothing more than the good and welfare of the subjects and as aristotle ; so cicero , and other writers have grounded their civill doctrine , on the opinions of the romans , who were taught to hate monarchy , at first , by them that having deposed their soveraign , shared amongst them the soveraignty of rome ; and afterwards by their successors however , in his essay the advancement of learning , bacon also argues that civic education should be preceded by religious and moral education , so that those who judge policy will not be under the influence of moral relativism

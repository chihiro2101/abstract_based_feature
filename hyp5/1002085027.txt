in his history of the peloponnesian war , thucydides ascribes a speech to archidamus ii in which he stresses the importance for sparta of civic education for the spartan virtues of toughness , obedience , cunning , simplicity , and preparedness : and we are wise , because we are educated with too little learning to despise the laws , and with too severe a self-control to disobey them , and are brought up not to be too knowing in useless matters—such as the knowledge which can give a specious criticism of an enemy 's plans in theory , but fails to assail them with equal success in practice—but are taught to consider that the schemes of our enemies are not dissimilar to our own , and that the freaks of chance are not determinable by calculation the history of the peloponnesian war , book i , chapter iii french essayist michel de montaigne commended how agesilaus ii , the son of archidamus , followed his father 's approach closely : one asking to this purpose , agesilaus , what he thought most proper for boys to learn ? “ what they ought to do when they come to be men , ” said he one asking to this purpose , agesilaus , what he thought most proper for boys to learn ? “ what they ought to do when they come to be men , ” said he.—plutarch , apothegms of the lacedamonians plutarch relates a comparison made by simonides between spartan education of citizens and horse husbandry : simonides called sparta '' the tamer of men , '' because by early strictness of education , they , more than any nation , trained the citizens to obedience to the laws , and made them tractable and patient of subjection , as horses that are broken in while colts now the succession belonging to agis by law , agesilaus , who in all probability was to be but a private man , was educated according to the usual discipline of the country , hard and severe , and meant to teach young men to obey their superiors whence it was that , men say , simonides called sparta '' the tamer of men , '' because by early strictness of education , they , more than any nation , trained the citizens to obedience to the laws , and made them tractable and patient of subjection , as horses that are broken in while colts but agesilaus , whose good fortune it was to be born a younger brother , was consequently bred to all the arts of obedience , and so the better fitted for the government , when it fell to his share ; hence it was that he proved the most popular-tempered of the spartan kings , his early life having added to his natural kingly and commanding qualities the gentle and humane feelings of a citizen.translated by john dryden in order to the good education of their youth ( which , as i said before , he thought the most important and noblest work of a lawgiver ) , he went so far back as to take into consideration their very conception and birth , by regulating their marriages the old men , too , had an eye upon them , coming often to the grounds to hear and see them contend either in wit or strength with one another , and this as seriously and with as much concern as if they were their fathers , their tutors , or their magistrates ; so that there scarcely was any time or place without someone present to put them in mind of their duty , and punish them if they had neglected it he also describes how the spartans limited civic education so as to maintain social control over the young : reading and writing they gave them , just enough to serve their turn ; their chief care was to make them good subjects , and to teach them to endure pain and conquer in battle if they had not an answer ready to the question who was a good or who an ill-reputed citizen , they were looked upon as of a dull and careless disposition , and to have little or no sense of virtue and honor ; besides this , they were to give a good reason for what they said , and in as few words and as comprehensive as might be ; he that failed of this , or answered not to the purpose , had his thumb bit by his master montaigne would later praise this particular technique of education , admiring the way spartan citizens spent their time learning to acquire virtues such as courage and temperance , to the exclusion of studying any other subject the manner of their discipline was to propound to them questions in judgment upon men and their actions ; and if they commended or condemned this or that person or fact , they were to give a reason for so doing ; by which means they at once sharpened their understanding , and learned what was right and their very songs had a life and spirit in them that inflamed and possessed men 's minds with an enthusiasm and ardor for action ; the style of them was plain and without affectation ; the subject always serious and moral ; most usually , it was in praise of such men as had died in defense of their country , or in derision of those that had been cowards ; the former they declared happy and glorified ; the life of the latter they described as most miserable and abject '' essentially , the spartan ideal of civic education was a process whereby the interest of the citizen becomes totally united with the interest of the polity , in a spirit of perfect patriotism : 'to conclude , lycurgus bred up his citizens in such a way that they neither would nor could live by themselves ; they were to make themselves one with the public good , and , clustering like bees around their commander , be by their zeal and public spirit carried all but out of themselves , and devoted wholly to their country '' to conclude , lycurgus bred up his citizens in such a way that they neither would nor could live by themselves ; they were to make themselves one with the public good , and , clustering like bees around their commander , be by their zeal and public spirit carried all but out of themselves , and devoted wholly to their country paedaretus , not being admitted into the list of the three hundred , returned home with a joyful face , well pleased to find that there were in sparta three hundred better men than himself '' ' civic education for toughness and martial prowess was not only within the purview of spartan men : plutarch recounts how lycurgus 'ordered the maidens to exercises themselves with wrestling , running , throwing the quoit , and chasing the dart ' with a view to creating healthy children for the state '' amongst the persons there the most renowned for their learning all their wisdom in state matters was one thales , whom lycurgus , by importunities and assurances of friendship , persuaded to go over to lacedaemon ; where , though by his outward appearance and his own profession he seemed to be no other than a lyric poet , in reality he performed the part of one of the ablest lawgivers in the world that other leading city of greece , lacedaemon , considering that lycurgus their lawgiver was so addicted to elegant learning , as to have been the first that brought out of ionia the scattered works of homer , and sent the poet thales from crete to prepare and mollify the spartan surliness with his smooth songs and odes , the better to plant among them law and civility , it is to be wondered how museless and unbookish they were , minding nought but the feats of war.project gutenberg however , in his essay the advancement of learning , bacon also argues that civic education should be preceded by religious and moral education , so that those who judge policy will not be under the influence of moral relativism but is it not true also , that much less young men are fit auditors of matters of policy , till they have been thoroughly seasoned in religion and morality ; lest their judgments be corrupted , and made apt to think that there are no true differences of things ? project gutenberg in order to achieve these goals schools must allow students the three great freedoms—freedom of choice , freedom of action and freedom to bear the results of action—that constitute personal responsibility

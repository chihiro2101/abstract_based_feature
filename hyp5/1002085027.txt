in practice we always base our preparations against an enemy on the assumption that his plans are good ; indeed , it is right to rest our hopes not on a belief in his blunders , but on the soundness of our provisions french essayist michel de montaigne commended how agesilaus ii , the son of archidamus , followed his father 's approach closely : one asking to this purpose , agesilaus , what he thought most proper for boys to learn ? “ what they ought to do when they come to be men , ” said he one asking to this purpose , agesilaus , what he thought most proper for boys to learn ? “ what they ought to do when they come to be men , ” said he.—plutarch , apothegms of the lacedamonians plutarch relates a comparison made by simonides between spartan education of citizens and horse husbandry : simonides called sparta '' the tamer of men , '' because by early strictness of education , they , more than any nation , trained the citizens to obedience to the laws , and made them tractable and patient of subjection , as horses that are broken in while colts now the succession belonging to agis by law , agesilaus , who in all probability was to be but a private man , was educated according to the usual discipline of the country , hard and severe , and meant to teach young men to obey their superiors whence it was that , men say , simonides called sparta '' the tamer of men , '' because by early strictness of education , they , more than any nation , trained the citizens to obedience to the laws , and made them tractable and patient of subjection , as horses that are broken in while colts but agesilaus , whose good fortune it was to be born a younger brother , was consequently bred to all the arts of obedience , and so the better fitted for the government , when it fell to his share ; hence it was that he proved the most popular-tempered of the spartan kings , his early life having added to his natural kingly and commanding qualities the gentle and humane feelings of a citizen.translated by john dryden according to the roman historian plutarch , the semi-legendary lycurgus of sparta considered education of the citizenry to be his main priority as framer of the spartan constitution in order to the good education of their youth ( which , as i said before , he thought the most important and noblest work of a lawgiver ) , he went so far back as to take into consideration their very conception and birth , by regulating their marriages plutarch observes that 'the whole course of spartan education was one of continued exercise of a ready and perfect obedience ' plutarch lycurgus was of another mind ; he would not have masters bought out of the market for his young spartans , nor such as should sell their pains ; nor was it lawful , indeed , for the father himself to breed up the children after his own fancy ; but as soon as they were seven years old they were to be enrolled in certain companies and classes , where they all lived under the same order and discipline , doing their exercises and taking their play together of these , he who showed the most conduct and courage was made captain ; they had their eyes always upon him , obeyed his orders , and underwent patiently whatsoever punishment he inflicted ; so that the whole course of their education was one continued exercise of a ready and perfect obedience he also describes how the spartans limited civic education so as to maintain social control over the young : reading and writing they gave them , just enough to serve their turn ; their chief care was to make them good subjects , and to teach them to endure pain and conquer in battle '' they taught them , also , to speak with a natural and graceful raillery , and to comprehend much matter of thought in few words if they had not an answer ready to the question who was a good or who an ill-reputed citizen , they were looked upon as of a dull and careless disposition , and to have little or no sense of virtue and honor ; besides this , they were to give a good reason for what they said , and in as few words and as comprehensive as might be ; he that failed of this , or answered not to the purpose , had his thumb bit by his master montaigne would later praise this particular technique of education , admiring the way spartan citizens spent their time learning to acquire virtues such as courage and temperance , to the exclusion of studying any other subject it is a thing worthy of very great consideration , that in that excellent , and , in truth , for its perfection , prodigious form of civil regimen set down by lycurgus , though so solicitous of the education of children , as a thing of the greatest concern , and even in the very seat of the muses , he should make so little mention of learning ; as if that generous youth , disdaining all other subjection but that of virtue , ought to be supplied , instead of tutors to read to them arts and sciences , with such masters as should only instruct them in valour , prudence , and justice ; an example that plato has followed in his laws and their very songs had a life and spirit in them that inflamed and possessed men 's minds with an enthusiasm and ardor for action ; the style of them was plain and without affectation ; the subject always serious and moral ; most usually , it was in praise of such men as had died in defense of their country , or in derision of those that had been cowards ; the former they declared happy and glorified ; the life of the latter they described as most miserable and abject '' to conclude , lycurgus bred up his citizens in such a way that they neither would nor could live by themselves ; they were to make themselves one with the public good , and , clustering like bees around their commander , be by their zeal and public spirit carried all but out of themselves , and devoted wholly to their country and polycratidas , being sent with some others ambassador to the lieutenants of the king of persia , being asked by them whether they came in a private or in a public character , answered , '' in a public , if we succeed ; if not , in a private character similarly , plutarch would later speak of the power of the poet thales to , in the words of the english poet john milton , 'prepare and mollify the spartan surliness with his smooth songs and odes , the better to plant among them law and civility' for as he that is so bitten , has a continuall torment of thirst , and yet abhorreth water ; and is in such an estate , as if the poyson endeavoured to convert him into a dogge : so when a monarchy is once bitten to the quick , by those democraticall writers , that continually snarle at that estate ; it wanteth nothing more than a strong monarch , which neverthelesse out of a certain tyrannophobia , or feare of being strongly governed , when they have him , they abhorre however , in his essay the advancement of learning , bacon also argues that civic education should be preceded by religious and moral education , so that those who judge policy will not be under the influence of moral relativism '' this type of education is often alluded to in the deliberative democracy literature as fulfilling the necessary and fundamental social and institutional changes necessary to develop a democracy that involves intensive participation in group decision making , negotiation , and social life of consequence .

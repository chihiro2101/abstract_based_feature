in his history of the peloponnesian war , thucydides ascribes a speech to archidamus ii in which he stresses the importance for sparta of civic education for the spartan virtues of toughness , obedience , cunning , simplicity , and preparedness : and we are wise , because we are educated with too little learning to despise the laws , and with too severe a self-control to disobey them , and are brought up not to be too knowing in useless matters—such as the knowledge which can give a specious criticism of an enemy 's plans in theory , but fails to assail them with equal success in practice—but are taught to consider that the schemes of our enemies are not dissimilar to our own , and that the freaks of chance are not determinable by calculation in practice we always base our preparations against an enemy on the assumption that his plans are good ; indeed , it is right to rest our hopes not on a belief in his blunders , but on the soundness of our provisions french essayist michel de montaigne commended how agesilaus ii , the son of archidamus , followed his father 's approach closely : one asking to this purpose , agesilaus , what he thought most proper for boys to learn ? “ what they ought to do when they come to be men , ” said he one asking to this purpose , agesilaus , what he thought most proper for boys to learn ? “ what they ought to do when they come to be men , ” said he.—plutarch , apothegms of the lacedamonians plutarch relates a comparison made by simonides between spartan education of citizens and horse husbandry : simonides called sparta '' the tamer of men , '' because by early strictness of education , they , more than any nation , trained the citizens to obedience to the laws , and made them tractable and patient of subjection , as horses that are broken in while colts whence it was that , men say , simonides called sparta '' the tamer of men , '' because by early strictness of education , they , more than any nation , trained the citizens to obedience to the laws , and made them tractable and patient of subjection , as horses that are broken in while colts but agesilaus , whose good fortune it was to be born a younger brother , was consequently bred to all the arts of obedience , and so the better fitted for the government , when it fell to his share ; hence it was that he proved the most popular-tempered of the spartan kings , his early life having added to his natural kingly and commanding qualities the gentle and humane feelings of a citizen.translated by john dryden according to the roman historian plutarch , the semi-legendary lycurgus of sparta considered education of the citizenry to be his main priority as framer of the spartan constitution plutarch observes that 'the whole course of spartan education was one of continued exercise of a ready and perfect obedience ' plutarch lycurgus was of another mind ; he would not have masters bought out of the market for his young spartans , nor such as should sell their pains ; nor was it lawful , indeed , for the father himself to breed up the children after his own fancy ; but as soon as they were seven years old they were to be enrolled in certain companies and classes , where they all lived under the same order and discipline , doing their exercises and taking their play together the old men , too , had an eye upon them , coming often to the grounds to hear and see them contend either in wit or strength with one another , and this as seriously and with as much concern as if they were their fathers , their tutors , or their magistrates ; so that there scarcely was any time or place without someone present to put them in mind of their duty , and punish them if they had neglected it he also describes how the spartans limited civic education so as to maintain social control over the young : reading and writing they gave them , just enough to serve their turn ; their chief care was to make them good subjects , and to teach them to endure pain and conquer in battle for lycurgus , who ordered , as we saw , that a great piece of money should be but of an inconsiderable value , on the contrary would allow no discourse to be current which did not contain in few words a great deal of useful and curious sense ; children in sparta , by a habit of long silence , came to give just and sententious answers ; for , indeed , as loose and incontinent livers are seldom fathers of many children , so loose and incontinent talkers seldom originate many sensible words parallel lives , lycurgus.the iren , or under-master , used to stay a little with them after supper , and one of them he bade to sing a song , to another he put a question which required an advised and deliberate answer ; for example , who was the best man in the city ? what he thought of such an action of such a man ? they used them thus early to pass a right judgment upon persons and things , and to inform themselves of the abilities or defects of their countrymen if they had not an answer ready to the question who was a good or who an ill-reputed citizen , they were looked upon as of a dull and careless disposition , and to have little or no sense of virtue and honor ; besides this , they were to give a good reason for what they said , and in as few words and as comprehensive as might be ; he that failed of this , or answered not to the purpose , had his thumb bit by his master it is a thing worthy of very great consideration , that in that excellent , and , in truth , for its perfection , prodigious form of civil regimen set down by lycurgus , though so solicitous of the education of children , as a thing of the greatest concern , and even in the very seat of the muses , he should make so little mention of learning ; as if that generous youth , disdaining all other subjection but that of virtue , ought to be supplied , instead of tutors to read to them arts and sciences , with such masters as should only instruct them in valour , prudence , and justice ; an example that plato has followed in his laws '' essentially , the spartan ideal of civic education was a process whereby the interest of the citizen becomes totally united with the interest of the polity , in a spirit of perfect patriotism : 'to conclude , lycurgus bred up his citizens in such a way that they neither would nor could live by themselves ; they were to make themselves one with the public good , and , clustering like bees around their commander , be by their zeal and public spirit carried all but out of themselves , and devoted wholly to their country and polycratidas , being sent with some others ambassador to the lieutenants of the king of persia , being asked by them whether they came in a private or in a public character , answered , '' in a public , if we succeed ; if not , in a private character '' ' civic education for toughness and martial prowess was not only within the purview of spartan men : plutarch recounts how lycurgus 'ordered the maidens to exercises themselves with wrestling , running , throwing the quoit , and chasing the dart ' with a view to creating healthy children for the state during his diatribe , he emphasises the importance of poetry to civic education : small children have a teacher helping them , for young men there ’ s the poets—we ’ ve got a solemn duty to say useful things '' here he had the first sight of homer 's works , in the hands , we may suppose , of the posterity of creophylus ; and , having observed that the few loose expressions and actions of ill example which are to be found in his poems were much outweighed by serious lessons of state and rules of morality , he set himself eagerly to transcribe and digest them into order , as thinking they would be of good use in his own country '' from his brother he imbibed a specific ideal for the roman state : he it was also that did put me in the first conceit and desire of an equal commonwealth , administered by justice and equality ; and of a kingdom wherein should be regarded nothing more than the good and welfare of the subjects and by reading of these greek , and latine authors , men from their childhood have gotten a habit ( under a false shew of liberty , ) of favouring tumults , and of licentious controlling the actions of their soveraigns ; and again of controlling those controllers , with the effusion of so much blood ; as i think i may truly say , there was never any thing so deerly bought , as these western parts have bought the learning of the greek and latine tongues however , in his essay the advancement of learning , bacon also argues that civic education should be preceded by religious and moral education , so that those who judge policy will not be under the influence of moral relativism

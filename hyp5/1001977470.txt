during the earliest part of the paleozoic era , the continent that would later become north america straddled the equator the appalachian region was a passive plate margin , not unlike today 's atlantic coastal plain province during the middle ordovician period ( about 458-470 million years ago ) , a change in plate motions set the stage for the first paleozoic mountain building event ( taconic orogeny ) in north america the once quiet appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic plate , the iapetus , collided with and began sinking beneath the north american craton this was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the appalachians by about 300 million years ago ( pennsylvanian period ) africa was approaching the north american craton the massive bulk of pangea was completed near the end of the paleozoic era ( permian period ) when africa ( gondwana ) plowed into the continental agglomeration , with the appalachian-ouachita mountains near the core the appalachian mountains span across five geologic provinces ( as defined by the usgs ) : the appalachian basin , the blue ridge mountains , the piedmont province , the adirondack province , and the new england province the appalachian basin province covers an area of about a complexly thrust faulted and folded terrane ( appalachian fold and thrust belt or eastern overthrust belt ) , formed at the end of the paleozoic by the alleghenian orogeny , characterizes the eastern flank of the basin metamorphic and igneous rocks of the blue ridge thrust belt that bounds the eastern part of the appalachian basin province were thrust westward more than over lower paleozoic sedimentary rocks discovery of oil in 1859 in the drake well , venango county , pennsylvania , marked the beginning of the oil and gas industry in the appalachian basin

during the earliest part of the paleozoic era , the continent that would later become north america straddled the equator during the middle ordovician period ( about 458-470 million years ago ) , a change in plate motions set the stage for the first paleozoic mountain building event ( taconic orogeny ) in north america the once quiet appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic plate , the iapetus , collided with and began sinking beneath the north american craton this was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the appalachians continent collision raised the appalachian-ouachita chain to a lofty mountain range on the scale of the present-day himalaya the ridges of the appalachian mountain core represent erosion-resistant rock that remained after the rock above and beside it was eroded away the appalachian mountains span across five geologic provinces ( as defined by the usgs ) : the appalachian basin , the blue ridge mountains , the piedmont province , the adirondack province , and the new england province the appalachian basin is a foreland basin containing paleozoic sedimentary rocks of early cambrian through early permian age the northern end of the appalachian basin extends offshore into lakes erie and ontario as far as the united statesâ€“canada border metamorphic and igneous rocks of the blue ridge thrust belt that bounds the eastern part of the appalachian basin province were thrust westward more than over lower paleozoic sedimentary rocks the blue ridge , piedmont , adirondack , and new england provinces are collectively known as the crystalline appalachians , because they consist of precambrian and cambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks the uplifted , nearly circular adirondack mountains consist of a core of ancient precambrian rocks that are surrounded by upturned cambrian and ordovician sedimentary rocks .

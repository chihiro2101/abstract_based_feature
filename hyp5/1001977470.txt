during the earliest part of the paleozoic era , the continent that would later become north america straddled the equator the appalachian region was a passive plate margin , not unlike today 's atlantic coastal plain province during the middle ordovician period ( about 458-470 million years ago ) , a change in plate motions set the stage for the first paleozoic mountain building event ( taconic orogeny ) in north america the once quiet appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic plate , the iapetus , collided with and began sinking beneath the north american craton thrust faulting uplifted and warped older sedimentary rock laid down on the passive margin this was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the appalachians pangea began to break up about 220 million years ago , in the early mesozoic era ( late triassic period ) the appalachian basin is a foreland basin containing paleozoic sedimentary rocks of early cambrian through early permian age metamorphic and igneous rocks of the blue ridge thrust belt that bounds the eastern part of the appalachian basin province were thrust westward more than over lower paleozoic sedimentary rocks a second major trend of oil and gas production in the appalachian basin began with the discovery in 1885 of oil and gas in lower silurian clinton sandstone reservoirs in knox county , ohio the blue ridge , piedmont , adirondack , and new england provinces are collectively known as the crystalline appalachians , because they consist of precambrian and cambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks the province is bounded on the north and west by the paleozoic strata of the appalachian basin province and on the south by cretaceous and younger sedimentary rocks of the gulf coastal plain

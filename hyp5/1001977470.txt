the appalachian region was a passive plate margin , not unlike today 's atlantic coastal plain province thick layers of sediment and carbonate rock were deposited on the shallow sea bottom when the region was submerged during the middle ordovician period ( about 458-470 million years ago ) , a change in plate motions set the stage for the first paleozoic mountain building event ( taconic orogeny ) in north america the once quiet appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic plate , the iapetus , collided with and began sinking beneath the north american craton this was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the appalachians mountain building continued periodically throughout the next 250 million years ( caledonian , acadian , ouachita , hercynian , and alleghenian orogenies ) other streams downcut so rapidly that they cut right across the resistant folded rocks of the mountain core , carving canyons across rock layers and geologic structures the appalachian mountains span across five geologic provinces ( as defined by the usgs ) : the appalachian basin , the blue ridge mountains , the piedmont province , the adirondack province , and the new england province the appalachian basin is a foreland basin containing paleozoic sedimentary rocks of early cambrian through early permian age metamorphic and igneous rocks of the blue ridge thrust belt that bounds the eastern part of the appalachian basin province were thrust westward more than over lower paleozoic sedimentary rocks another drilling boom in the appalachian basin occurred in the 1960s in morrow county , ohio , where oil was discovered in the upper cambrian part of the knox dolomite the province is bounded on the north and west by the paleozoic strata of the appalachian basin province and on the south by cretaceous and younger sedimentary rocks of the gulf coastal plain

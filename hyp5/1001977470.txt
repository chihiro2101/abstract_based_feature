the appalachian region was a passive plate margin , not unlike today 's atlantic coastal plain province during the middle ordovician period ( about 458-470 million years ago ) , a change in plate motions set the stage for the first paleozoic mountain building event ( taconic orogeny ) in north america the once quiet appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic plate , the iapetus , collided with and began sinking beneath the north american craton this was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the appalachians the massive bulk of pangea was completed near the end of the paleozoic era ( permian period ) when africa ( gondwana ) plowed into the continental agglomeration , with the appalachian-ouachita mountains near the core the appalachian mountains span across five geologic provinces ( as defined by the usgs ) : the appalachian basin , the blue ridge mountains , the piedmont province , the adirondack province , and the new england province the appalachian basin is a foreland basin containing paleozoic sedimentary rocks of early cambrian through early permian age from north to south , the appalachian basin province crosses new york , pennsylvania , eastern ohio , west virginia , western maryland , eastern kentucky , western virginia , eastern tennessee , northwestern georgia , and northeastern alabama metamorphic and igneous rocks of the blue ridge thrust belt that bounds the eastern part of the appalachian basin province were thrust westward more than over lower paleozoic sedimentary rocks a second major trend of oil and gas production in the appalachian basin began with the discovery in 1885 of oil and gas in lower silurian clinton sandstone reservoirs in knox county , ohio the province is bounded on the north and west by the paleozoic strata of the appalachian basin province and on the south by cretaceous and younger sedimentary rocks of the gulf coastal plain the uplifted , nearly circular adirondack mountains consist of a core of ancient precambrian rocks that are surrounded by upturned cambrian and ordovician sedimentary rocks .

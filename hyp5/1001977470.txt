the appalachian region was a passive plate margin , not unlike today 's atlantic coastal plain province during the middle ordovician period ( about 458-470 million years ago ) , a change in plate motions set the stage for the first paleozoic mountain building event ( taconic orogeny ) in north america the once quiet appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic plate , the iapetus , collided with and began sinking beneath the north american craton as pangea rifted apart a new passive tectonic margin was born and the forces that created the appalachian , ouachita , and marathon mountains were stilled the ridges of the appalachian mountain core represent erosion-resistant rock that remained after the rock above and beside it was eroded away the appalachian mountains span across five geologic provinces ( as defined by the usgs ) : the appalachian basin , the blue ridge mountains , the piedmont province , the adirondack province , and the new england province the appalachian basin is a foreland basin containing paleozoic sedimentary rocks of early cambrian through early permian age metamorphic and igneous rocks of the blue ridge thrust belt that bounds the eastern part of the appalachian basin province were thrust westward more than over lower paleozoic sedimentary rocks coal and associated rocks form a clastic wedge that thickens from north to south , from pennsylvania into southeast west virginia and southwestern virginia by the late 1880s and early 1900s , the trend extended both north and south across east-central ohio and included several counties in western new york where gas was discovered in lower silurian medina group sandstones the province is bounded on the north and west by the paleozoic strata of the appalachian basin province and on the south by cretaceous and younger sedimentary rocks of the gulf coastal plain the uplifted , nearly circular adirondack mountains consist of a core of ancient precambrian rocks that are surrounded by upturned cambrian and ordovician sedimentary rocks .

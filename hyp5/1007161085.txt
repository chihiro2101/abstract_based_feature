charles ammi cutter made the first explicit statement regarding the objectives of a bibliographic system in his rules for a printed dictionary catalog in 1876 to enable a person to find a book of which either ( identifying objective ) the author the title the subject the date of publication 2 to show what the library has ( collocating objective ) by a given author on a given subject in a given kind of literature 3 a catalog helps to serve as an inventory or bookkeeping of the library 's contents if an item is not found in the catalog , the user may continue their search at another library a catalog card is an individual entry in a library catalog containing bibliographic information , including author 's name , book title , and even approximate location it was around 1780 that the first card catalog appeared in vienna the backs of the playing cards contained the bibliographic information for each book and this inventory became known as the '' french cataloging code of 1791 '' very shortly afterward , melvil dewey and other american librarians began to champion the card catalog because of its great expandability the first issue of library journal , the official publication of the american library association , made clear that the most pressing issues facing libraries were the lack of a standardized catalog and an agency to administer a centralized catalog by the end of the nineteenth century , the bigger card won out , mainly to the fact that the card was already the “ postal size ” used for postcards melvil dewey saw well beyond the importance of standardized cards and sought to outfit virtually all facets of library operations he published his findings in the annual report of the library for 1863 and they were adopted by many american libraries catalog cards were ; the harvard college size oclc , major supplier of catalog cards , printed the last one in october 2015 in a physical catalog , the information about each item is on a separate card , which is placed in order in the catalog drawer depending on the type of record traditionally , there are the following types of catalog : author catalog : a formal catalog , sorted alphabetically according to the names of authors , editors , illustrators , etc title catalog : a formal catalog , sorted alphabetically according to the article of the entries dictionary catalog : a catalog in which all entries ( author , title , subject , series ) are interfiled in a single alphabetical order keyword catalog : a subject catalog , sorted alphabetically according to some system of keywords systematic catalog : a subject catalog , sorted according to some systematic subdivision of subjects shelf list catalog : a formal catalog with entries sorted in the same order as bibliographic items are shelved this catalog may also serve as the primary inventory for the library the earliest librarians created rules for how to record the details of the catalog the seventh century bce babylonian library of ashurbanipal was led by the librarian ibnissaru who prescribed a catalog of clay tablets by subject subject catalogs were the rule of the day , and author catalogs were unknown at that time these rules created efficiency through consistency—the catalog librarian knew how to record each item without reinventing the rules each time , and the reader knew what to expect with each visit card for personal filing systems , enabling much more flexibility , and towards the end of the 20th century the online public access catalog was developed ( see below ) the plays of william shakespeare are another frequently cited example of the role played by a uniform title in the library catalog should an english catalog follow this suit ? and should a dutch catalog sort non-dutch words the same way ? ( there are also pseudo-ligatures which sometimes come at the beginning of a word , such as œdipus marc was originally used to automate the creation of physical catalog cards , but its use evolved into direct access to the marc computer files during the search process

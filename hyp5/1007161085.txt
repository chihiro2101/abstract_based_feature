charles ammi cutter made the first explicit statement regarding the objectives of a bibliographic system in his rules for a printed dictionary catalog in 1876 to enable a person to find a book of which either ( identifying objective ) the author the title the subject the date of publication 2 the latest attempt to describe a library catalog 's goals and functions was made in 1998 with functional requirements for bibliographic records ( frbr ) which defines four user tasks : find , identify , select , and obtain a catalog helps to serve as an inventory or bookkeeping of the library 's contents if an item is not found in the catalog , the user may continue their search at another library a catalog card is an individual entry in a library catalog containing bibliographic information , including author 's name , book title , and even approximate location the first cards may have been french playing cards , which in the 1700s were blank on one side the backs of the playing cards contained the bibliographic information for each book and this inventory became known as the '' french cataloging code of 1791 '' in the mid-1800s , natale battezzati , an italian publisher , developed a card system for booksellers in which cards represented authors , titles and subjects in some libraries books were cataloged based on the size of the book while other libraries organized based only on the author 's name the first issue of library journal , the official publication of the american library association , made clear that the most pressing issues facing libraries were the lack of a standardized catalog and an agency to administer a centralized catalog by the end of the nineteenth century , the bigger card won out , mainly to the fact that the card was already the “ postal size ” used for postcards melvil dewey saw well beyond the importance of standardized cards and sought to outfit virtually all facets of library operations each book was assigned a call number which identified the subject and location , with a decimal point dividing different sections of the call number one of the first acts of the newly formed american library association in 1908 was to set standards for the size of the cards used in american libraries , thus making their manufacture and the manufacture of cabinets , uniform in a physical catalog , the information about each item is on a separate card , which is placed in order in the catalog drawer depending on the type of record cutter 's classification system would help the patron find the book they wanted in a quick fashion traditionally , there are the following types of catalog : author catalog : a formal catalog , sorted alphabetically according to the names of authors , editors , illustrators , etc title catalog : a formal catalog , sorted alphabetically according to the article of the entries dictionary catalog : a catalog in which all entries ( author , title , subject , series ) are interfiled in a single alphabetical order keyword catalog : a subject catalog , sorted alphabetically according to some system of keywords mixed alphabetic catalog forms : sometimes , one finds a mixed author / title , or an author / title / keyword catalog systematic catalog : a subject catalog , sorted according to some systematic subdivision of subjects also called a classified catalog shelf list catalog : a formal catalog with entries sorted in the same order as bibliographic items are shelved these rules created efficiency through consistency—the catalog librarian knew how to record each item without reinventing the rules each time , and the reader knew what to expect with each visit there was no universal method , so some books were organized by language or book material , for example , but most scholarly libraries had recognizable categories ( like philosophy , saints , mathematics ) the first library to list titles alphabetically under each subject was the sorbonne library in paris 104–105 1595 : nomenclator of leiden university library appears , the first printed catalog of an institutional library should an english catalog follow this suit ? and should a dutch catalog sort non-dutch words the same way ? ( there are also pseudo-ligatures which sometimes come at the beginning of a word , such as œdipus marc was originally used to automate the creation of physical catalog cards , but its use evolved into direct access to the marc computer files during the search process

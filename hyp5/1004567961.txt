( pavn ) and vc slowly , the arvn began to expand from its counter-insurgency role to become the primary ground defense against the pavn/vc however , the arvn equipment continued to be of lower standards than their american and other allies , even as the u.s the officer corps was still the biggest problem forced to carry the burden left by the americans , the arvn actually started to perform rather well , though with continued american air support in 1972 , the pavn launched the easter offensive , an all-out attack against south vietnam across the vietnamese demilitarized zone and from

on 8 march 1949 , after the élysée accords , the state of vietnam was recognized by france as an independent country ruled by the vietnamese emperor bảo đại , and the vietnamese national army ( vna ) was soon created the vna fought in joint operations with the french union 's french far east expeditionary corps against the viet minh forces led by ho chi minh the vna fought in a wide range of campaigns including the battle of nà sản ( 1952 ) , operation atlas ( 1953 ) and the battle of dien bien phu ( 1954 ) vietnamese national army gallery ( may 1951 – june 1954 ) french defense ministry archives ecpad benefiting from french assistance , the vna quickly became a modern army modeled after the expeditionary corps it included infantry , artillery , signals , armored cavalry , airborne , airforce , navy and a national military academy by 1953 troopers as well as officers were all vietnamese , the latter having been trained in ecoles des cadres such as da lat , including chief of staff general nguyễn văn hinh who was a french union airforce veteran in 1955 , by the order of prime minister diệm , the vna crushed the armed forces of the bình xuyên . army of the republic of vietnam ( arvn ) 1955–75 right on 26 october 1955 , the military was reorganized by the administration of president ngô đình diệm who then formally established the army of the republic of vietnam ( arvn ) on 30 december 1955 the air force was established as a separate service known as the republic of vietnam air force ( rvnaf ) early on , the focus of the army was the guerrilla fighters of the viet cong ( vc ) , formed to oppose the diệm administration the most notorious of these attacks occurred on the night of august 21 , 1963 , during the xá lợi pagoda raids conducted by the special forces , which caused a death toll estimated to range into the hundreds in 1963 diệm was killed in a 1963 south vietnamese coup and encouraged by american officials such as henry cabot lodge , jr during these years , the united states began taking more control of the war against the vc and the role of the arvn became less and less significant although the us was highly critical of the arvn , it continued to be entirely us-armed and funded although the american news media has often portrayed the vietnam war as a primarily american and north vietnamese conflict , the arvn carried the brunt of the fight before and after large-scale american involvement , and participated in many major operations with american troops arvn troops pioneered the use of the m113 armored personnel carrier as an infantry fighting vehicle by fighting mounted rather than as a '' battle taxi '' as originally designed , and the armored cavalry ( acav ) modifications were adopted based on arvn experience one notable arvn unit equipped with m113s , the 3d armored cavalry squadron , used the new tactic so proficiently and with such extraordinary heroism against hostile forces that they earned the united states presidential unit citation ’ memo from secretary of defense mcnamara to president johnson , march 26 , 1964 , foreign relations of the united states vietnam 1964-68 , vol from 1969 to 1971 there were about 22,000 arvn combat deaths per year in 1970 they performed well in the cambodian incursion and were executing three times as many operations as they had during the american-led war period however , the arvn equipment continued to be of lower standards than their american and other allies , even as the u.s forced to carry the burden left by the americans , the arvn actually started to perform rather well , though with continued american air support the assault combined infantry wave assaults , artillery and the first massive use of armored forces by the pavn although the t-54 tanks proved vulnerable to law rockets , the arvn took heavy losses the pavn forces took quảng trị province and some areas along the laos and cambodian borders image : m41 of south vietnamese army.jpg 300px thumb m41 walker bulldog was used by the arvn president nixon dispatched bombers in operation linebacker to provide air support for the arvn when it seemed that south vietnam was about to be lost he gave the order that all deserters would be executed and pulled enough forces together in order to prevent the pavn from taking huế finally , with considerable us air and naval support , as well as hard fighting by the arvn soldiers , the easter offensive was halted arvn forces counter-attacked and succeeded in driving some of the pavn out of south vietnam , though they did retain control of northern quảng trị province near the dmz the same situation happened to the democratic republic of vietnam , since their allies , the soviet union , and china has also cut down military support , forcing them to use obsolete t-34 tanks and su-100 tank destroyers in battle historians have attributed the fall of saigon in 1975 to the cessation of american aid along with the growing disenchantment of the south vietnamese people and the rampant corruption and incompetence of south vietnam political leaders and arvn general staff without the necessary funds and facing a collapse in south vietnamese troop and civilian morale , it was becoming increasingly difficult for the arvn to achieve a victory against the pavn this resolve was strengthened when the new american administration did not think itself bound to this promise nixon made to thieu of a '' severe retaliation '' if hanoi broke the 1973 paris peace accords the fall of huế to pavn forces on 26 march 1975 began an organized rout of the arvn that culminated in the complete disintegration of the south vietnamese government north vietnamese forces took advantage of the growing instability , and with the abandoned equipment of the routing arvn , they mounted heavy attacks on all fronts with collapse all but inevitable , many arvn generals abandoned their troops to fend for themselves and arvn soldiers deserted en masse general le

m48a3 patton tanks , 100 additional m-113a1 acavs ( armored cavalry assault vehicles ) , and over 500 extra aircraft to south vietnam without enough supplies and ammunition , arvn forces were quickly thrown into chaos and defeated by the well-supplied pavn , no longer having to worry about u.s the victorious communists sent over 250,000 arvn soldiers to prison camps wherein they were routinely tortured and murdered some for a period of eleven consecutive years the americans and south vietnamese had laid large minefields during the war , and former arvn soldiers were made to clear them file

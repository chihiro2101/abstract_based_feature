two knots can be added by cutting both knots and joining the pairs of ends the operation is called the knot sum , or sometimes the connected sum or composition of two knots the resulting knot is a sum of the original knots having a preferred direction of travel along the knot , and requiring the arcs of the knots in the sum are oriented consistently with the oriented boundary of the rectangle the knot sum of oriented knots is commutative and associative a prime knot if it is non-trivial and can not be written as the knot sum of two non-trivial knots knot tables generally include only prime knots , and only one entry for a knot and its mirror image ( even if they are different ) the sequence of the number of prime knots of a given crossing number , up to crossing number 16 , is 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 21 , 49 , 165 , 552 , 2176 , 9988 , , , the first knot tables by tait , little , and kirkman used knot diagrams , although tait also used a precursor to the dowker notation the early tables attempted to list all knots of at most 10 crossings , and all alternating knots of 11 crossings this verified the list of knots of at most 11 crossings and a new list of links up to 10 crossings conway 's 1970 paper on knot theory also contains a typographical duplication on its non-alternating 11-crossing knots page and omits 4 examples — 2 previously listed in d see perko ( 1982 ) , primality of certain knots , topology proceedings less famous is the duplicate in his 10 crossing link table : 2.-2.-20.20 is the mirror of 8 -20 : -20 the notation simply organizes knots by their crossing number one writes the crossing number with a subscript to denote its order amongst all knots with that crossing number links are written by the crossing number with a superscript to denote the number of components and a subscript to denote its order within the links with the same number of components and crossings a knot diagram has more than one possible dowker notation , and there is a well-understood ambiguity when reconstructing a knot from a dowker–thistlethwaite notation gauss code , similar to the dowker–thistlethwaite notation , represents a knot with a sequence of integers

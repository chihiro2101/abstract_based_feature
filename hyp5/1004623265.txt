two knots can be added by cutting both knots and joining the pairs of ends the operation is called the knot sum , or sometimes the connected sum or composition of two knots the resulting knot is a sum of the original knots having a preferred direction of travel along the knot , and requiring the arcs of the knots in the sum are oriented consistently with the oriented boundary of the rectangle the knot sum of oriented knots is commutative and associative a prime knot if it is non-trivial and can not be written as the knot sum of two non-trivial knots traditionally , knots have been catalogued in terms of crossing number knot tables generally include only prime knots , and only one entry for a knot and its mirror image ( even if they are different ) the number of nontrivial knots of a given crossing number increases rapidly , making tabulation computationally difficult the sequence of the number of prime knots of a given crossing number , up to crossing number 16 , is 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 21 , 49 , 165 , 552 , 2176 , 9988 , , , different notations have been invented for knots which allow more efficient tabulation the early tables attempted to list all knots of at most 10 crossings , and all alternating knots of 11 crossings this verified the list of knots of at most 11 crossings and a new list of links up to 10 crossings the notation simply organizes knots by their crossing number one writes the crossing number with a subscript to denote its order amongst all knots with that crossing number the dowker–thistlethwaite notation , also called the dowker notation or code , for a knot is a finite sequence of even integers gauss code , similar to the dowker–thistlethwaite notation , represents a knot with a sequence of integers there are a number of introductions to knot theory

two knots can be added by cutting both knots and joining the pairs of ends the operation is called the knot sum , or sometimes the connected sum or composition of two knots find a rectangle in the plane where one pair of opposite sides are arcs along each knot while the rest of the rectangle is disjoint from the knots form a new knot by deleting the first pair of opposite sides and adjoining the other pair of opposite sides the resulting knot is a sum of the original knots having a preferred direction of travel along the knot , and requiring the arcs of the knots in the sum are oriented consistently with the oriented boundary of the rectangle the knot sum of oriented knots is commutative and associative a prime knot if it is non-trivial and can not be written as the knot sum of two non-trivial knots knot tables generally include only prime knots , and only one entry for a knot and its mirror image ( even if they are different ) the number of nontrivial knots of a given crossing number increases rapidly , making tabulation computationally difficult the sequence of the number of prime knots of a given crossing number , up to crossing number 16 , is 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 21 , 49 , 165 , 552 , 2176 , 9988 , , , see perko ( 2016 ) , historical highlights of non-cyclic knot theory , j the notation simply organizes knots by their crossing number one writes the crossing number with a subscript to denote its order amongst all knots with that crossing number this order is arbitrary and so has no special significance ( though in each number of crossings the twist knot comes after the torus knot ) the conway notation for knots and links , named after john horton conway , is based on the theory of tangles gauss code , similar to the dowkerâ€“thistlethwaite notation , represents a knot with a sequence of integers there are a number of introductions to knot theory

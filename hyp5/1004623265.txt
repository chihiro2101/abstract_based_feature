two knots can be added by cutting both knots and joining the pairs of ends the operation is called the knot sum , or sometimes the connected sum or composition of two knots the resulting knot is a sum of the original knots having a preferred direction of travel along the knot , and requiring the arcs of the knots in the sum are oriented consistently with the oriented boundary of the rectangle the knot sum of oriented knots is commutative and associative a prime knot if it is non-trivial and can not be written as the knot sum of two non-trivial knots for oriented knots , this decomposition is also unique knot tables generally include only prime knots , and only one entry for a knot and its mirror image ( even if they are different ) the number of nontrivial knots of a given crossing number increases rapidly , making tabulation computationally difficult the sequence of the number of prime knots of a given crossing number , up to crossing number 16 , is 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 21 , 49 , 165 , 552 , 2176 , 9988 , , , the early tables attempted to list all knots of at most 10 crossings , and all alternating knots of 11 crossings this verified the list of knots of at most 11 crossings and a new list of links up to 10 crossings conway 's 1970 paper on knot theory also contains a typographical duplication on its non-alternating 11-crossing knots page and omits 4 examples — 2 previously listed in d briggs and later extended by dale rolfsen in his knot table ( see image above and list of prime knots ) the notation simply organizes knots by their crossing number a knot diagram has more than one possible dowker notation , and there is a well-understood ambiguity when reconstructing a knot from a dowker–thistlethwaite notation the conway notation for knots and links , named after john horton conway , is based on the theory of tangles gauss code , similar to the dowker–thistlethwaite notation , represents a knot with a sequence of integers

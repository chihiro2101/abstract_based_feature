two knots can be added by cutting both knots and joining the pairs of ends the operation is called the knot sum , or sometimes the connected sum or composition of two knots the resulting knot is a sum of the original knots having a preferred direction of travel along the knot , and requiring the arcs of the knots in the sum are oriented consistently with the oriented boundary of the rectangle the knot sum of oriented knots is commutative and associative a prime knot if it is non-trivial and can not be written as the knot sum of two non-trivial knots traditionally , knots have been catalogued in terms of crossing number knot tables generally include only prime knots , and only one entry for a knot and its mirror image ( even if they are different ) the sequence of the number of prime knots of a given crossing number , up to crossing number 16 , is 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 21 , 49 , 165 , 552 , 2176 , 9988 , , , the early tables attempted to list all knots of at most 10 crossings , and all alternating knots of 11 crossings this verified the list of knots of at most 11 crossings and a new list of links up to 10 crossings this famous error would propagate when dale rolfsen added a knot table in his influential text , based on conway 's work briggs and later extended by dale rolfsen in his knot table ( see image above and list of prime knots ) this order is arbitrary and so has no special significance ( though in each number of crossings the twist knot comes after the torus knot ) links are written by the crossing number with a superscript to denote the number of components and a subscript to denote its order within the links with the same number of components and crossings the conway notation for knots and links , named after john horton conway , is based on the theory of tangles conway 's pioneering paper on the subject lists up to 10-vertex basic polyhedra of which he uses to tabulate links , which have become standard for those links contact geometry legendrian submanifolds and knots knots and graphs list of knot theory topics molecular knot quantum knots quantum topology circuit topology ribbon theory

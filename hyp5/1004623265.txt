two knots can be added by cutting both knots and joining the pairs of ends the operation is called the knot sum , or sometimes the connected sum or composition of two knots find a rectangle in the plane where one pair of opposite sides are arcs along each knot while the rest of the rectangle is disjoint from the knots the resulting knot is a sum of the original knots having a preferred direction of travel along the knot , and requiring the arcs of the knots in the sum are oriented consistently with the oriented boundary of the rectangle the knot sum of oriented knots is commutative and associative a prime knot if it is non-trivial and can not be written as the knot sum of two non-trivial knots traditionally , knots have been catalogued in terms of crossing number knot tables generally include only prime knots , and only one entry for a knot and its mirror image ( even if they are different ) the number of nontrivial knots of a given crossing number increases rapidly , making tabulation computationally difficult the sequence of the number of prime knots of a given crossing number , up to crossing number 16 , is 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 21 , 49 , 165 , 552 , 2176 , 9988 , , , the early tables attempted to list all knots of at most 10 crossings , and all alternating knots of 11 crossings this verified the list of knots of at most 11 crossings and a new list of links up to 10 crossings conway 's 1970 paper on knot theory also contains a typographical duplication on its non-alternating 11-crossing knots page and omits 4 examples — 2 previously listed in d the dowker–thistlethwaite notation , also called the dowker notation or code , for a knot is a finite sequence of even integers the dowker–thistlethwaite notation for this labelling is the sequence : 6 , & minus ; 12 , 2 , 8 , & minus ; 4 , & minus ; 10 the conway notation for knots and links , named after john horton conway , is based on the theory of tangles gauss code , similar to the dowker–thistlethwaite notation , represents a knot with a sequence of integers

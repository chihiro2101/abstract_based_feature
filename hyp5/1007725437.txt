these were membership groups consisting of '' racially pure '' artists supportive of the party , or willing to be compliant goebbels and some others believed that the forceful works of such artists as emil nolde , ernst barlach and erich heckel exemplified the nordic spirit ; as goebbels explained , '' we national socialists are not unmodern ; we are the carrier of a new modernity , not only in politics and in social matters , but also in art and intellectual matters however , a faction led by alfred rosenberg despised the expressionists , and the result was a bitter ideological dispute , which was settled only in september 1934 , when hitler declared that there would be no place for modernist experimentation in the reich for many modernist artists , such as max beckmann , ernst ludwig kirchner , and oskar schlemmer , it was not until june 1937 that they surrendered any hope that their work would be tolerated by the authorities although books by franz kafka could no longer be bought by 1939 , works by ideologically suspect authors such as hermann hesse and hans fallada were widely read mass culture was less stringently regulated than high culture , possibly because the authorities feared the consequences of too heavy-handed interference in popular entertainment thus , until the outbreak of the war , most hollywood films could be screened , including it happened one night , san francisco , and gone with the wind the exhibit , featuring over 650 paintings , sculptures , prints , and books from the collections of 32 german museums , premiered in munich on july 19 , 1937 , and remained on view until november 30 , before traveling to 11 other cities in germany and austria the first room contained works considered demeaning of religion ;

inventory lists indicate that the artworks seized in this second round , combined with those gathered prior to the exhibition , amounted to 16,558 works others were murdered in the action t4 ( see , for example , elfriede lohse-wächtler ) whereas it was forbidden to export '' degenerate art '' to germany , it was still possible to buy and sell artworks of '' degenerate artists '' in occupied france a picasso , a play by jeffrey hatcher based loosely on actual events , is set in paris 1941 and sees picasso being asked to authenticate three works for inclusion in an upcoming exhibition of degenerate art

in the visual arts , such innovations as fauvism , cubism , dada , and surrealism—following symbolism and post-impressionism—were not universally appreciated the majority of people in germany , as elsewhere , did not care for the new art , which many resented as elitist , morally suspect , and too often incomprehensible wilhelm ii , who took an active interest in regulating art in germany , criticized impressionism as '' gutter painting '' kühnel , anita ( 2003 ) and forbade käthe kollwitz from being awarded a medal for her print series a weavers ' revolt when it was displayed in the berlin grand exhibition of the arts in 1898 it was the birthplace of expressionism in painting and sculpture , of the atonal musical compositions of arnold schoenberg , and the jazz-influenced work of paul hindemith and kurt weill their response stemmed partly from a conservative aesthetic taste and partly from their determination to use culture as a propaganda tool on both counts , a painting such as otto dix 's war cripples ( 1920 ) was anathema to them ( in 1937 , it would be displayed in the degenerate art exhibition next to a label accusing dix—himself a volunteer in world war i norbert wolf , uta grosenick ( 2004 ) , expressionism , taschen , p —of '' an insult to the german heroes of the great war '' 54 by his order , 70 mostly expressionist paintings were removed from the permanent exhibition of the weimar schlossmuseum in 1930 , and the director of the könig albert museum in zwickau , hildebrand gurlitt , was dismissed for displaying modern art as dictator , hitler gave his personal taste in art the force of law to a degree never before seen only in stalin 's soviet union , where socialist realism was the mandatory style , had a modern state shown such concern with regulation of the arts in the case of germany , the model was to be classical greek and roman art , regarded by hitler as an art whose exterior form embodied an inner racial ideal modern art was seen as an act of aesthetic violence by the jews against the german spirit such was true to hitler even though only liebermann , meidner , freundlich , and marc chagall , among those who made significant contributions to the german modernist movement , were jewish by propagating the theory of degeneracy , the nazis combined their antisemitism with their drive to control the culture , thus consolidating public support for both campaigns nordau drew upon the writings of the criminology cesare lombroso , whose the criminal man , published in 1876 , attempted to prove that there were '' born criminals '' whose atavism personality traits could be detected by scientifically measuring abnormal physical characteristics nordau developed from this premise a critique of modern art , explained as the work of those so corrupted and enfeebled by modern life that they have lost the self-control needed to produce coherent works despite the fact that nordau was jewish and a key figure in the zionist movement ( lombroso was also jewish ) , his theory of artistic degeneracy would be seized upon by german nazis during the weimar republic as a rallying point for their antisemitic and racist demand for aryan purity in art belief in a germanic spirit—defined as mystical , rural , moral , bearing ancient wisdom , and noble in the face of a tragic destiny—existed long before the rise of the nazis ;

the christian bible is made up of the old testament and the new testament christians consider the quran a non-divine false , later work the quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in the books of the bible christianity and islam differ in their fundamental views in regard to the nature of their religion , their beliefs about the crucifixion and resurrection of jesus christians believe that jesus is the son of god most christians are trinity and believe that jesus is divine and god the son christianity teaches that jesus was condemned to death by the sanhedrin and the roman prefect pontius pilate , crucified and resurrected , as per the gospel narratives christians believe jesus was divine and sinless muslims and christians both believe that jesus was born to mary , a virgin they also both believe that jesus is the messiah islam teaches that jesus was one of the most important prophets of god , but not the son of god , not divine , and not part of a god as part of a trinity in islam , jesus was a human prophet who , like the other prophets , tried to bring the children of adam to the worship of the one god , termed tawhid muslims contend that jesus argued against the division of god 's oneness christians do not see the trinity as implying any division and that christianity follows god 's command to have no other gods from the old testament christians argue that the new testament , particularly the gospel of john , contains or is centered on the trinity and that jesus made several implicit and explicit claims to be the son of god , and divine in nature they consider the quran to be the only revealed book that has been protected by god from tahrif unlike jesus , who christians believe was god 's son , muhammad was a mortal , albeit with extraordinary qualities at various times and places pious muslims represented muhammad although they never worshiped these images in islam such plurality in god is a denial of tawhid , and thus a sin of shirk , which is considered to be a major 'al-kaba'ir ' sin christians believe that the holy spirit is god , and also the paraclete referred to in the gospel of john , who was manifested on the day of pentecost the author ( s ) of the 11th century song of roland evidently had little actual knowledge of islam muhammad is portrayed as split in half , with his entrails hanging out , representing his status as a heresiarch ( canto 28 ) the question of islam was not on the agenda when nostra aetate was first drafted , or even at the opening of the second vatican council while mormonism and islam certainly have many similarities , there are also significant , fundamental differences between the two religions the two faiths share a common place of origin in the middle east , and consider themselves to be monotheistic robert spencer , not peace but a sword : the great chasm between christianity and islam

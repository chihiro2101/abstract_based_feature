for reasons that are not understood , many people with defective variants of the ampd genes are asymptomatic , while others have symptoms including exercise intolerance , and/or muscle pain and cramping fatigue and sedation after heavy exertion can be caused by excess adenosine in the cells which signals muscle fiber to feel fatigued ; muscle pain muscle pain from madd is not well understood , but is partially due to high levels of lactate madd causes an increase of free adenosine during heavy activity which may cause exercise-induced muscle pain over time , excess free adenosine down-regulates primary a1 adenosine receptors , leading to increased muscle pain ; muscle cramping the cause of cramping is unknown , but may be related to elevated lactate , increased calcium signaling across the sarcoplasmic reticulum caused by membrane instability from reduced levels of atp , or increased levels of free adenosine there is an increased risk that statin ( cholesterol-reducing drugs ) will cause myopathy ( muscle weakness ) in individuals with madd amp deaminase is an enzyme that converts adenosine monophosphate ( amp ) to inosine monophosphate ( imp ) , freeing an ammonia molecule in the process amp is normally converted into imp by myoadenylate deaminase—so myoadenylate deaminase deficiency reduces energy that would be available to the cell through the purine nucleotide cycle in persons with a defective enzyme , 5'-nucleotidase removes the ribose and phosphorus from amp , increasing levels of adenosine measured in muscle cells by ~16–25× , after exercise it may result in a reduction of the amount of fumarate available to the citric acid cycle , and it may result in lower levels of nitric oxide ( a vasodilator ) in the body , reducing blood flow and oxygen intake during vigorous exercise , though this may be offset by increased levels of adenosine , another vasodilator the following is a very simplified model of what may be going on inside a muscle cell with ampd deficiency there are two major semi-stable states : one with intra-cellular glycogen available , and one with glycogen exhausted start from the state where glycogen is available and the citric acid cycle is severely down-regulated once the cell has received a non-trivial load , and has expended the phosphocreatine reserve , a small quantity of atp will become discharged down to amp amp will instantly up-regulate myophosphorylase , which will start liberating glucose from glycogen and make it available to the glycolytic pathway , producing pyruvate and recharging amp back to atp the combination of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle now balances atp production with atp demand and the pool of amp does not grow further in muscle cells with normal ampd activity , the purine nucleotide cycle would now start to gradually add fumarate to the pool of the citric acid cycle intermediates this would decrease the excess rate of pyruvate production by increasing its consumption , increase the rate of amp recharge to atp by the citric acid cycle , and consequently reduce liberation of glucose from glycogen , until increased supply of blood-borne fuels allows to shut down glycogenolysis completely in muscle cells with ampd deficiency , atp production rate of the citric acid cycle will not be synchronized with atp demand if a large group of muscles is still actively drawing fuels from blood after the most recent continuous exercise , in order to replenish the atp and the phosphocreatine reserve , it may become sour without any additional exercise by the time the carbohydrate meal is finished the resulting excess of glucose is metabolized down to lactic acid ( the body can not increase aerobic metabolism in an instant ) , recharging all amp to atp notably , a small quantity of dietary fructose does not produce this effect ( the lactic acidosis ) , as it is captured by liver and may be fully expended for replenishing liver glycogen if carbohydrate-rich food is not consumed in this state , amp elimination from the cell eventually completes , glycogen stores can be replenished again , and the cell transitions back to the original state but with reduced atp pool and an up-regulated citric acid cycle patients with myoadenylate deaminase deficiency do not retain ribose during heavy exercise , so supplementation may be required to rebuild levels of atp

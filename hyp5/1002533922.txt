for reasons that are not understood , many people with defective variants of the ampd genes are asymptomatic , while others have symptoms including exercise intolerance , and/or muscle pain and cramping ; fatigue madd lowers aerobic power output , so increased anaerobic power is needed to perform the same amount of work without myoadenlyate deaminase , heavy activity causes adenosine to be released into the cell or perfused into the surrounding tissues fatigue and sedation after heavy exertion can be caused by excess adenosine in the cells which signals muscle fiber to feel fatigued ; muscle pain muscle pain from madd is not well understood , but is partially due to high levels of lactate increased levels of free adenosine temporarily decrease pain , allowing over-exertion without awareness madd causes an increase of free adenosine during heavy activity which may cause exercise-induced muscle pain over time , excess free adenosine down-regulates primary a1 adenosine receptors , leading to increased muscle pain ; muscle cramping the cause of cramping is unknown , but may be related to elevated lactate , increased calcium signaling across the sarcoplasmic reticulum caused by membrane instability from reduced levels of atp , or increased levels of free adenosine similarly , the long-term metabolic effects may result in nerve damage there is an increased risk that statin ( cholesterol-reducing drugs ) will cause myopathy ( muscle weakness ) in individuals with madd in most cases where myopathy is present with madd , a second muscle disease is present and symptoms are worse than either disease in isolation amp deaminase is an enzyme that converts adenosine monophosphate ( amp ) to inosine monophosphate ( imp ) , freeing an ammonia molecule in the process cellular processes , especially muscles , then convert the atp into adenosine diphosphate ( adp ) , freeing the energy to do work amp is normally converted into imp by myoadenylate deaminase—so myoadenylate deaminase deficiency reduces energy that would be available to the cell through the purine nucleotide cycle instead of being converted to imp , the amp builds up in the cells of affected individuals , spills into the blood , and is eventually metabolized in the liver in persons with a defective enzyme , 5'-nucleotidase removes the ribose and phosphorus from amp , increasing levels of adenosine measured in muscle cells by ~16–25× , after exercise amp will instantly up-regulate myophosphorylase , which will start liberating glucose from glycogen and make it available to the glycolytic pathway , producing pyruvate and recharging amp back to atp due to the greater availability of pyruvate as a substrate , and pyruvate also contributing a citric acid cycle intermediate , α-ketoglutarate , while consuming glutamate , the citric acid cycle will also speed up because all pyruvate is not burned down in the citric acid cycle — a consequence of the pyruvate 's concentration regulating its burning at this moment — the excess is converted to lactate and passed into blood as lactic acid in muscle cells with normal ampd activity , the purine nucleotide cycle would now start to gradually add fumarate to the pool of the citric acid cycle intermediates in muscle cells with ampd deficiency , atp production rate of the citric acid cycle will not be synchronized with atp demand on the other hand , in persons with balanced ampd and myophosphorylase activities in muscle cells , lactic acid and ammonia are produced simultaneously , counteracting each other 's effects to some degree if carbohydrate-rich food is not consumed in this state , amp elimination from the cell eventually completes , glycogen stores can be replenished again , and the cell transitions back to the original state but with reduced atp pool and an up-regulated citric acid cycle patients with myoadenylate deaminase deficiency do not retain ribose during heavy exercise , so supplementation may be required to rebuild levels of atp

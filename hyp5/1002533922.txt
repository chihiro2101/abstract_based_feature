fatigue and sedation after heavy exertion can be caused by excess adenosine in the cells which signals muscle fiber to feel fatigued in cases of rhabdomyolysis , which is the rapid breakdown of muscle fibers , time to recovery is dependent on duration and intensity of original activity plus any excess activity during the recovery period ; muscle pain muscle pain from madd is not well understood , but is partially due to high levels of lactate madd causes an increase of free adenosine during heavy activity which may cause exercise-induced muscle pain over time , excess free adenosine down-regulates primary a1 adenosine receptors , leading to increased muscle pain ; muscle cramping the cause of cramping is unknown , but may be related to elevated lactate , increased calcium signaling across the sarcoplasmic reticulum caused by membrane instability from reduced levels of atp , or increased levels of free adenosine anesthesia has the potential to cause malignant hyperthermia , an uncontrolled increase in body temperature , and permanent muscle damage in patients with madd amp deaminase is an enzyme that converts adenosine monophosphate ( amp ) to inosine monophosphate ( imp ) , freeing an ammonia molecule in the process cellular processes , especially muscles , then convert the atp into adenosine diphosphate ( adp ) , freeing the energy to do work during heavy or prolonged mild to moderate activity , other enzymes convert two molecules of adp into one atp molecule and one amp molecule , making more atp available to supply energy instead of being converted to imp , the amp builds up in the cells of affected individuals , spills into the blood , and is eventually metabolized in the liver in persons with a defective enzyme , 5'-nucleotidase removes the ribose and phosphorus from amp , increasing levels of adenosine measured in muscle cells by ~16–25× , after exercise it may somehow result in a reduction in the amount of lactic acid produced by the muscles , though serum lactate is typically slightly elevated with madd start from the state where glycogen is available and the citric acid cycle is severely down-regulated amp will instantly up-regulate myophosphorylase , which will start liberating glucose from glycogen and make it available to the glycolytic pathway , producing pyruvate and recharging amp back to atp because all pyruvate is not burned down in the citric acid cycle — a consequence of the pyruvate 's concentration regulating its burning at this moment — the excess is converted to lactate and passed into blood as lactic acid in muscle cells with normal ampd activity , the purine nucleotide cycle would now start to gradually add fumarate to the pool of the citric acid cycle intermediates this would decrease the excess rate of pyruvate production by increasing its consumption , increase the rate of amp recharge to atp by the citric acid cycle , and consequently reduce liberation of glucose from glycogen , until increased supply of blood-borne fuels allows to shut down glycogenolysis completely in muscle cells with ampd deficiency , atp production rate of the citric acid cycle will not be synchronized with atp demand if the load on muscles is greater than the body 's ability to recycle lactate back into glucose , lactate will start to build up in the blood in order to excrete lactate , kidney must also excrete magnesium as an obligatory cation , which may lead to acute and chronic magnesium deficiency on the other hand , in persons with balanced ampd and myophosphorylase activities in muscle cells , lactic acid and ammonia are produced simultaneously , counteracting each other 's effects to some degree the resulting excess of glucose is metabolized down to lactic acid ( the body can not increase aerobic metabolism in an instant ) , recharging all amp to atp if carbohydrate-rich food is not consumed in this state , amp elimination from the cell eventually completes , glycogen stores can be replenished again , and the cell transitions back to the original state but with reduced atp pool and an up-regulated citric acid cycle learning this balance may be more difficult than normally , as muscle pain and fatigue may be perceived differently from normal individuals

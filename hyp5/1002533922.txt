for reasons that are not understood , many people with defective variants of the ampd genes are asymptomatic , while others have symptoms including exercise intolerance , and/or muscle pain and cramping without myoadenlyate deaminase , heavy activity causes adenosine to be released into the cell or perfused into the surrounding tissues fatigue and sedation after heavy exertion can be caused by excess adenosine in the cells which signals muscle fiber to feel fatigued ; muscle pain muscle pain from madd is not well understood , but is partially due to high levels of lactate madd causes an increase of free adenosine during heavy activity which may cause exercise-induced muscle pain over time , excess free adenosine down-regulates primary a1 adenosine receptors , leading to increased muscle pain there is an increased risk that statin ( cholesterol-reducing drugs ) will cause myopathy ( muscle weakness ) in individuals with madd anesthesia has the potential to cause malignant hyperthermia , an uncontrolled increase in body temperature , and permanent muscle damage in patients with madd amp deaminase is an enzyme that converts adenosine monophosphate ( amp ) to inosine monophosphate ( imp ) , freeing an ammonia molecule in the process during heavy or prolonged mild to moderate activity , other enzymes convert two molecules of adp into one atp molecule and one amp molecule , making more atp available to supply energy amp is normally converted into imp by myoadenylate deaminase—so myoadenylate deaminase deficiency reduces energy that would be available to the cell through the purine nucleotide cycle the first effect—the loss of amp—is mostly significant because amp contains ribose , a sugar molecule that is also used to make dna , rna , and some enzymes it may somehow result in a reduction in the amount of lactic acid produced by the muscles , though serum lactate is typically slightly elevated with madd the following is a very simplified model of what may be going on inside a muscle cell with ampd deficiency start from the state where glycogen is available and the citric acid cycle is severely down-regulated amp will instantly up-regulate myophosphorylase , which will start liberating glucose from glycogen and make it available to the glycolytic pathway , producing pyruvate and recharging amp back to atp due to the greater availability of pyruvate as a substrate , and pyruvate also contributing a citric acid cycle intermediate , α-ketoglutarate , while consuming glutamate , the citric acid cycle will also speed up the combination of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle now balances atp production with atp demand and the pool of amp does not grow further in muscle cells with ampd deficiency , atp production rate of the citric acid cycle will not be synchronized with atp demand it was demonstrated , that muscle cells , that lack ampd1 , stock and consume significantly more glutamate , and produce more alanine in this state , compared to healthy controls , which indicates occurrence of a higher concentration of pyruvate in the cell during exercise amp conversion to adenosine , excretion to the blood ( as amp and its various metabolites ) , further conversion to uric acid and excretion to urine becomes significant for some time , until all amp is eliminated from the muscle cell the same situation would occur if blood flow to muscle cells becomes insufficient ( except that somewhat less amp is spilled over , and somewhat more of it is metabolized inside the muscle cell ) oxidation of odd-numbered saturated fatty acids may provide another mechanism , although very gradual , to up-regulate citric acid cycle during exercise the resulting excess of glucose is metabolized down to lactic acid ( the body can not increase aerobic metabolism in an instant ) , recharging all amp to atp patients with myoadenylate deaminase deficiency do not retain ribose during heavy exercise , so supplementation may be required to rebuild levels of atp

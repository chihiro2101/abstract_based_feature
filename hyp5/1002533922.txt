for reasons that are not understood , many people with defective variants of the ampd genes are asymptomatic , while others have symptoms including exercise intolerance , and/or muscle pain and cramping without myoadenlyate deaminase , heavy activity causes adenosine to be released into the cell or perfused into the surrounding tissues fatigue and sedation after heavy exertion can be caused by excess adenosine in the cells which signals muscle fiber to feel fatigued in this way , adenosine may play a role in fatigue from madd ; muscle pain muscle pain from madd is not well understood , but is partially due to high levels of lactate adenosine mediates pain through adenosine receptors madd causes an increase of free adenosine during heavy activity which may cause exercise-induced muscle pain over time , excess free adenosine down-regulates primary a1 adenosine receptors , leading to increased muscle pain anesthesia has the potential to cause malignant hyperthermia , an uncontrolled increase in body temperature , and permanent muscle damage in patients with madd amp deaminase is an enzyme that converts adenosine monophosphate ( amp ) to inosine monophosphate ( imp ) , freeing an ammonia molecule in the process in order to use energy , a cell converts one of the above fuels into adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) via the mitochondria during heavy or prolonged mild to moderate activity , other enzymes convert two molecules of adp into one atp molecule and one amp molecule , making more atp available to supply energy amp is normally converted into imp by myoadenylate deaminase—so myoadenylate deaminase deficiency reduces energy that would be available to the cell through the purine nucleotide cycle in persons with a defective enzyme , 5'-nucleotidase removes the ribose and phosphorus from amp , increasing levels of adenosine measured in muscle cells by ~16–25× , after exercise first , significant amounts of amp are lost from the cell and the body it may somehow result in a reduction in the amount of lactic acid produced by the muscles , though serum lactate is typically slightly elevated with madd there are two major semi-stable states : one with intra-cellular glycogen available , and one with glycogen exhausted both states are modified by how much the citric acid cycle is down-regulated by default amp will instantly up-regulate myophosphorylase , which will start liberating glucose from glycogen and make it available to the glycolytic pathway , producing pyruvate and recharging amp back to atp the combination of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle now balances atp production with atp demand and the pool of amp does not grow further in muscle cells with ampd deficiency , atp production rate of the citric acid cycle will not be synchronized with atp demand oxidation of odd-numbered saturated fatty acids may provide another mechanism , although very gradual , to up-regulate citric acid cycle during exercise idle muscles may also take up some free amp thus , it may take the residual ampd activity less time to build up citric acid cycle intermediates , when the whole body is warmed up for an exercise at the same time , rather than a specific group of muscles needed in the exercise patients with myoadenylate deaminase deficiency do not retain ribose during heavy exercise , so supplementation may be required to rebuild levels of atp

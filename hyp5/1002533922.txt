for reasons that are not understood , many people with defective variants of the ampd genes are asymptomatic , while others have symptoms including exercise intolerance , and/or muscle pain and cramping without myoadenlyate deaminase , heavy activity causes adenosine to be released into the cell or perfused into the surrounding tissues in cases of rhabdomyolysis , which is the rapid breakdown of muscle fibers , time to recovery is dependent on duration and intensity of original activity plus any excess activity during the recovery period ; muscle pain muscle pain from madd is not well understood , but is partially due to high levels of lactate increased levels of free adenosine temporarily decrease pain , allowing over-exertion without awareness madd causes an increase of free adenosine during heavy activity which may cause exercise-induced muscle pain over time , excess free adenosine down-regulates primary a1 adenosine receptors , leading to increased muscle pain ; muscle cramping the cause of cramping is unknown , but may be related to elevated lactate , increased calcium signaling across the sarcoplasmic reticulum caused by membrane instability from reduced levels of atp , or increased levels of free adenosine ; muscle weakness muscle weakness is not a major symptom , though the progressive effects of chronic muscle damage from rhabdomyolysis will eventually cause significant weakness amp deaminase is an enzyme that converts adenosine monophosphate ( amp ) to inosine monophosphate ( imp ) , freeing an ammonia molecule in the process amp is normally converted into imp by myoadenylate deaminase—so myoadenylate deaminase deficiency reduces energy that would be available to the cell through the purine nucleotide cycle in persons with a defective enzyme , 5'-nucleotidase removes the ribose and phosphorus from amp , increasing levels of adenosine measured in muscle cells by ~16–25× , after exercise first , significant amounts of amp are lost from the cell and the body the first effect—the loss of amp—is mostly significant because amp contains ribose , a sugar molecule that is also used to make dna , rna , and some enzymes amp will instantly up-regulate myophosphorylase , which will start liberating glucose from glycogen and make it available to the glycolytic pathway , producing pyruvate and recharging amp back to atp due to the greater availability of pyruvate as a substrate , and pyruvate also contributing a citric acid cycle intermediate , α-ketoglutarate , while consuming glutamate , the citric acid cycle will also speed up because all pyruvate is not burned down in the citric acid cycle — a consequence of the pyruvate 's concentration regulating its burning at this moment — the excess is converted to lactate and passed into blood as lactic acid in muscle cells with normal ampd activity , the purine nucleotide cycle would now start to gradually add fumarate to the pool of the citric acid cycle intermediates in muscle cells with ampd deficiency , atp production rate of the citric acid cycle will not be synchronized with atp demand the pool of amp also grows bigger than in the controls , which would cause higher rate of glucose liberation from glycogen amp conversion to adenosine , excretion to the blood ( as amp and its various metabolites ) , further conversion to uric acid and excretion to urine becomes significant for some time , until all amp is eliminated from the muscle cell by sitting down , walking , or cycling ) , the ammonia , produced by the amplified residual ampd activity , may accumulate in the muscle cells and in the surrounding tissues to toxic levels , and may also indirectly affect other organs the resulting excess of glucose is metabolized down to lactic acid ( the body can not increase aerobic metabolism in an instant ) , recharging all amp to atp if carbohydrate-rich food is not consumed in this state , amp elimination from the cell eventually completes , glycogen stores can be replenished again , and the cell transitions back to the original state but with reduced atp pool and an up-regulated citric acid cycle patients with myoadenylate deaminase deficiency do not retain ribose during heavy exercise , so supplementation may be required to rebuild levels of atp

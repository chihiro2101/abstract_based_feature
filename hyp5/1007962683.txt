the name zygomycota refers to the zygosporangia characteristically formed by the members of this clade , in which resistant spherical spores are formed during sexual reproduction zygos is greek for '' joining '' or '' a yoke '' , referring to the fusion of two hyphae which produces these spores , and -mycota is a suffix referring to a division of fungi zygomycete spores can be formed through both sexual and asexual means during this period , the metabolic rate is very low and it may last from a few hours to many years in this type of dormancy , germination may be prevented even if the environmental conditions favor growth mitosporangia are carried by specialized hyphae , the mitosporangiophores ( sporangiophores ) these specialized hyphae usually show negative gravitropism and positive phototropism allowing good spore dispersal the sporangia wall is thin and is easily destroyed by mechanical stimuli ( e.g zygomycete spores may also be classified in respect to their persistence : the primary function of chlamydospores is the persistence of the mycelium and they are released when the mycelium degrades in zygomycetes the formation of chlamydospores is usually intercalar in accordance with their function chlamydospores have a thick cell wall and are pigmented zygophores are chemotropic aerial hyphae that are the sex organs of zygomycota , except for phycomyces in which they are not aerial but found in the substratum the opposite mating types grow towards each other due to volatile pheromones given off by the opposite strand , mainly trisporic acid and its precursors a little before the fusion septum completely dissolves , the primary outer wall begins to thicken meiosis usually occurs before zygospore germination and there are a few main types of distinguishable nuclear behavior type 1 is when the nuclei fuse quickly , within a few days , resulting in mature zygospore having haploid nuclei type 2 is when some nuclei do not pair and degenerate instead , meiosis is delayed until germination type 3 is when haploid nuclei continue to divide mitotically and then some associate into groups and some do not this results in diploid and haploid nuclei being found in the germ sporangium most fungi have chitin as structural polysaccharide , while zygomycetes synthesize chitosan , the deacetylated homopolymer of chitin therefore , specialized vesicles , the chitosomes , bring precursors of chitin and its synthesizing enzyme , chitin synthetase , to the outside of the membrane by exocytosis after this the chitosan polymer chain forms micro fibrils it is a pheromone compound responsible for sexual differentiation in those fungal species early trisporoid derivatives and trisporic acid induce swelling of two potential hyphae , hence called zygophores , and a chemical gradient of these inducer molecules results in a growth towards each other in the next stage , septae are established to limit the developing zygospore from the vegetative mycelium and in this way the zygophores become suspensor hyphae and gametangia are formed several cell wall modifications , as well as incorporation of sporopollenin ( responsible for the dark colour of spores ) take place resulting in a mature zygospore trisporoids are also used in the mediation of the recognition between parasite and host many morphological similarities in comparison to zygospore formation are seen , but the mature spore is called a sikyospore and is parasitic this , coupled with further evidence , has led to the assumption that trisporoids are not strictly species-specific , but that they might represent the general principle of mating recognition in mucorales for example , in pilobolus crystallinus light is responsible for the dispersal mechanism and the sporangiophores of phycomyces blakesleeanus grow towards light for instance , the zygomycota use light as signal to promote vegetative reproduction and growth of aerial hyphae to facilitate spore dispersal a common example of a zygomycete is black bread mold ( rhizopus stolonifer ) , a member of the mucorales sexual reproduction in rhizopus stolonifer , as in other zygomycetes , occurs when haploid hyphae of different mating types are in close proximity to each other the evolution of sporangiospores typical of zygomycetes to conidia similar to those found in ascomycetes can be modeled by a series of forms seen in zygomycetes

the name zygomycota refers to the zygosporangia characteristically formed by the members of this clade , in which resistant spherical spores are formed during sexual reproduction zygos is greek for '' joining '' or '' a yoke '' , referring to the fusion of two hyphae which produces these spores , and -mycota is a suffix referring to a division of fungi the term '' spore '' is used to describe a structure related to propagation and dispersal zygomycete spores can be formed through both sexual and asexual means during this period , the metabolic rate is very low and it may last from a few hours to many years in this type of dormancy , germination may be prevented even if the environmental conditions favor growth in zygomycetes , mitospores ( sporangiospores ) are formed asexually they are formed in specialized structures , the mitosporangia ( sporangia ) that contain few to several thousand of spores , depending on the species these specialized hyphae usually show negative gravitropism and positive phototropism allowing good spore dispersal the sporangia wall is thin and is easily destroyed by mechanical stimuli ( e.g zygomycete spores may also be classified in respect to their persistence : zygophores are chemotropic aerial hyphae that are the sex organs of zygomycota , except for phycomyces in which they are not aerial but found in the substratum they have two different mating types ( + ) and ( - ) the opposite mating types grow towards each other due to volatile pheromones given off by the opposite strand , mainly trisporic acid and its precursors once two opposite mating types have made initial contact , they give rise to a zygospore through multiple steps once contact between the zygophores has been made , their walls adhere to each other , flatten and then the contact site is referred to as the fusion septum a septum develops by gradual inward extension until it separates the terminal gametangia from the progametangial base a little before the fusion septum completely dissolves , the primary outer wall begins to thicken these dark patches on the wall will eventually develop into warty structures that make up the thickness of the zygospore wall type 1 is when the nuclei fuse quickly , within a few days , resulting in mature zygospore having haploid nuclei trisporic acid was discovered in 1964 as a metabolite that caused enhanced carotene production in blakeslea trispora the american mycologist and geneticist albert francis blakeslee discovered that some species of mucorales were self-sterile ( heterothallic ) , in which interactions of two strains , designated ( + ) and ( - ) , are necessary for the initiation of sexual activity early trisporoid derivatives and trisporic acid induce swelling of two potential hyphae , hence called zygophores , and a chemical gradient of these inducer molecules results in a growth towards each other a selectional process ( unstudied ) results in a reduction of nuclei and meiosis takes place ( also unstudied until today ) an example is the host-parasite interaction of a parasexual nature observed between parasitella parasitica , a facultative mycoparasite of zygomycetes , and absidia glauca many morphological similarities in comparison to zygospore formation are seen , but the mature spore is called a sikyospore and is parasitic light regulation has been investigated in the zygomycetes phycomyces blakesleeanus , mucor circinelloides and pilobolus crystallinus when light , particularly blue light , is involved in the regulation of fungal development , it directs the growth of fungal structures and activates metabolic pathways fungal phototropism has been investigated in detail using the fruiting body , sporangiophore , of phycomyces as a model it is able to react to different light intensities and different wavelengths the two genes for the enzymes phytoene desaturase ( carb ) and the bifunctional phytoene synthase/carotene cyclase ( carra in phycomyces , carrp in mucor ) are responsible for synthesis of beta-carotene most species of mucor grow rapidly on agar at room temperature filling the petri dish in 2â€“3 days with their coarse aerial mycelium sexual reproduction in rhizopus stolonifer , as in other zygomycetes , occurs when haploid hyphae of different mating types are in close proximity to each other the evolution of the conidium from the sporangiospore is the main defining difference between zygomycetes and ascomycetes in some cases , there may be a few as three spores in each sporangiolum , and a few species have sporangiola which contain just a single spore

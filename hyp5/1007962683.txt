the name zygomycota refers to the zygosporangia characteristically formed by the members of this clade , in which resistant spherical spores are formed during sexual reproduction zygos is greek for '' joining '' or '' a yoke '' , referring to the fusion of two hyphae which produces these spores , and -mycota is a suffix referring to a division of fungi zygomycete spores can be formed through both sexual and asexual means they are formed in specialized structures , the mitosporangia ( sporangia ) that contain few to several thousand of spores , depending on the species these specialized hyphae usually show negative gravitropism and positive phototropism allowing good spore dispersal the sporangia wall is thin and is easily destroyed by mechanical stimuli ( e.g zygomycete spores may also be classified in respect to their persistence : in accordance with their function chlamydospores have a thick cell wall and are pigmented zygophores are chemotropic aerial hyphae that are the sex organs of zygomycota , except for phycomyces in which they are not aerial but found in the substratum the opposite mating types grow towards each other due to volatile pheromones given off by the opposite strand , mainly trisporic acid and its precursors once two opposite mating types have made initial contact , they give rise to a zygospore through multiple steps zygospore formation is the result of a multiple step process beginning with compatible mating type zygophores growing towards each other a little before the fusion septum completely dissolves , the primary outer wall begins to thicken this can be seen as dark patches on the primary wall as the fusion septum dissolves these dark patches on the wall will eventually develop into warty structures that make up the thickness of the zygospore wall eventually the warts push through the primary wall and darken which is likely caused by melanin type 1 is when the nuclei fuse quickly , within a few days , resulting in mature zygospore having haploid nuclei zygomycetes exhibit a special structure of cell wall most fungi have chitin as structural polysaccharide , while zygomycetes synthesize chitosan , the deacetylated homopolymer of chitin the enzyme on the membrane catalyzes glycosidic bond formations from the nucleotide sugar substrate , uridine diphospho-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine trisporic acid is a c-18 terpenoid compound that is synthesized via ÃŸ-carotene and retinol pathways in the zygomycetes trisporic acid was discovered in 1964 as a metabolite that caused enhanced carotene production in blakeslea trispora recognition of compatible sexual partners in zygomycota is based on a cooperative biosynthesis pathway of trisporic acid these progametangia come in contact with each other and build a strong connection a selectional process ( unstudied ) results in a reduction of nuclei and meiosis takes place ( also unstudied until today ) several cell wall modifications , as well as incorporation of sporopollenin ( responsible for the dark colour of spores ) take place resulting in a mature zygospore light regulation has been investigated in the zygomycetes phycomyces blakesleeanus , mucor circinelloides and pilobolus crystallinus for example , in pilobolus crystallinus light is responsible for the dispersal mechanism and the sporangiophores of phycomyces blakesleeanus grow towards light when light , particularly blue light , is involved in the regulation of fungal development , it directs the growth of fungal structures and activates metabolic pathways fungal phototropism has been investigated in detail using the fruiting body , sporangiophore , of phycomyces as a model the bending is caused by differential growth on the respective opposite flanks of the sporangiophore , and influence each other historically , all fungi producing a zygospore were considered to be related and placed into zygomycota sexual reproduction in rhizopus stolonifer , as in other zygomycetes , occurs when haploid hyphae of different mating types are in close proximity to each other when conditions improve , however , they germinate to produce a sporangium or vegetative hyphae this structure is similar to a conidium , which has two , fused cell walls , an inner spore wall and an outer sporangium wall

the name zygomycota refers to the zygosporangia characteristically formed by the members of this clade , in which resistant spherical spores are formed during sexual reproduction zygos is greek for '' joining '' or '' a yoke '' , referring to the fusion of two hyphae which produces these spores , and -mycota is a suffix referring to a division of fungi the term '' spore '' is used to describe a structure related to propagation and dispersal zygomycete spores can be formed through both sexual and asexual means during this period , the metabolic rate is very low and it may last from a few hours to many years in this type of dormancy , germination may be prevented even if the environmental conditions favor growth in zygomycetes , mitospores ( sporangiospores ) are formed asexually they are formed in specialized structures , the mitosporangia ( sporangia ) that contain few to several thousand of spores , depending on the species mitosporangia are carried by specialized hyphae , the mitosporangiophores ( sporangiophores ) these specialized hyphae usually show negative gravitropism and positive phototropism allowing good spore dispersal falling raindrops , passing animals ) , leading to the dispersal of the ripe mitospores the walls of these spores contain sporopollenin in some species sporopollenin is formed out of β-carotene and is very resistant to biological and chemical degradation zygomycete spores may also be classified in respect to their persistence : zygophores are chemotropic aerial hyphae that are the sex organs of zygomycota , except for phycomyces in which they are not aerial but found in the substratum once contact between the zygophores has been made , their walls adhere to each other , flatten and then the contact site is referred to as the fusion septum a septum develops by gradual inward extension until it separates the terminal gametangia from the progametangial base a little before the fusion septum completely dissolves , the primary outer wall begins to thicken this can be seen as dark patches on the primary wall as the fusion septum dissolves as the zygospore enlarges , so do the warty structures until there are contiguous around the entire cell type 2 is when some nuclei do not pair and degenerate instead , meiosis is delayed until germination type 3 is when haploid nuclei continue to divide mitotically and then some associate into groups and some do not zygomycetes exhibit a special structure of cell wall most fungi have chitin as structural polysaccharide , while zygomycetes synthesize chitosan , the deacetylated homopolymer of chitin fungal hyphae grow at the tip the enzyme on the membrane catalyzes glycosidic bond formations from the nucleotide sugar substrate , uridine diphospho-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine the nascent polysaccharide chain is then cleaved by the enzyme chitin deacetylase after this the chitosan polymer chain forms micro fibrils trisporic acid is a c-18 terpenoid compound that is synthesized via ß-carotene and retinol pathways in the zygomycetes recognition of compatible sexual partners in zygomycota is based on a cooperative biosynthesis pathway of trisporic acid a selectional process ( unstudied ) results in a reduction of nuclei and meiosis takes place ( also unstudied until today ) historically , all fungi producing a zygospore were considered to be related and placed into zygomycota when incubated in liquid culture under semi-anaerobic conditions , several species grow in yeast like state zygosporangia are typically thick-walled , highly resilient to environmental hardships , and metabolically inert different mechanisms for forcible spore discharge have evolved among members of the zygomycete order entomophthorales

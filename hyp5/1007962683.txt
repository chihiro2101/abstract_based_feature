the name zygomycota refers to the zygosporangia characteristically formed by the members of this clade , in which resistant spherical spores are formed during sexual reproduction zygos is greek for '' joining '' or '' a yoke '' , referring to the fusion of two hyphae which produces these spores , and -mycota is a suffix referring to a division of fungi the term '' spore '' is used to describe a structure related to propagation and dispersal zygomycete spores can be formed through both sexual and asexual means in this type of dormancy , germination may be prevented even if the environmental conditions favor growth they are formed in specialized structures , the mitosporangia ( sporangia ) that contain few to several thousand of spores , depending on the species mitosporangia are carried by specialized hyphae , the mitosporangiophores ( sporangiophores ) these specialized hyphae usually show negative gravitropism and positive phototropism allowing good spore dispersal zygomycete spores may also be classified in respect to their persistence : chlamydospores are asexual spores different from sporangiospores zygophores are chemotropic aerial hyphae that are the sex organs of zygomycota , except for phycomyces in which they are not aerial but found in the substratum the opposite mating types grow towards each other due to volatile pheromones given off by the opposite strand , mainly trisporic acid and its precursors zygospore formation is the result of a multiple step process beginning with compatible mating type zygophores growing towards each other once contact between the zygophores has been made , their walls adhere to each other , flatten and then the contact site is referred to as the fusion septum a little before the fusion septum completely dissolves , the primary outer wall begins to thicken at this point , electron microscopy can no longer penetrate the wall type 1 is when the nuclei fuse quickly , within a few days , resulting in mature zygospore having haploid nuclei type 2 is when some nuclei do not pair and degenerate instead , meiosis is delayed until germination zygomycetes exhibit a special structure of cell wall most fungi have chitin as structural polysaccharide , while zygomycetes synthesize chitosan , the deacetylated homopolymer of chitin fungal hyphae grow at the tip trisporic acid is a c-18 terpenoid compound that is synthesized via ÃŸ-carotene and retinol pathways in the zygomycetes it is a pheromone compound responsible for sexual differentiation in those fungal species recognition of compatible sexual partners in zygomycota is based on a cooperative biosynthesis pathway of trisporic acid after dissolving of the fusion wall , cytoplasm and a high number of nuclei from both gametangia are mixed several cell wall modifications , as well as incorporation of sporopollenin ( responsible for the dark colour of spores ) take place resulting in a mature zygospore many morphological similarities in comparison to zygospore formation are seen , but the mature spore is called a sikyospore and is parasitic during this process , gall-like structures are produced by the host absidia glauca light regulation has been investigated in the zygomycetes phycomyces blakesleeanus , mucor circinelloides and pilobolus crystallinus in contrast , the sexual development of phycomyces is inhibited by light because of a specialized photoreceptor system these receptors in turn trigger a chain of events which finally leads to the asymmetrical growth of the cell wall in liquid culture , zygomycota usually form a bland mass and do not produce spores when conditions improve , however , they germinate to produce a sporangium or vegetative hyphae different mechanisms for forcible spore discharge have evolved among members of the zygomycete order entomophthorales this structure is similar to a conidium , which has two , fused cell walls , an inner spore wall and an outer sporangium wall

the name zygomycota refers to the zygosporangia characteristically formed by the members of this clade , in which resistant spherical spores are formed during sexual reproduction zygos is greek for '' joining '' or '' a yoke '' , referring to the fusion of two hyphae which produces these spores , and -mycota is a suffix referring to a division of fungi the term '' spore '' is used to describe a structure related to propagation and dispersal zygomycete spores can be formed through both sexual and asexual means the endogenous or constitutive dormancy depends on characteristics of the spore itself ; for example , metabolic features in this type of dormancy , germination may be prevented even if the environmental conditions favor growth they are formed in specialized structures , the mitosporangia ( sporangia ) that contain few to several thousand of spores , depending on the species these specialized hyphae usually show negative gravitropism and positive phototropism allowing good spore dispersal falling raindrops , passing animals ) , leading to the dispersal of the ripe mitospores zygomycete spores may also be classified in respect to their persistence : zygophores are chemotropic aerial hyphae that are the sex organs of zygomycota , except for phycomyces in which they are not aerial but found in the substratum they have two different mating types ( + ) and ( - ) the opposite mating types grow towards each other due to volatile pheromones given off by the opposite strand , mainly trisporic acid and its precursors zygospore formation is the result of a multiple step process beginning with compatible mating type zygophores growing towards each other these dark patches on the wall will eventually develop into warty structures that make up the thickness of the zygospore wall at this point , electron microscopy can no longer penetrate the wall eventually the warts push through the primary wall and darken which is likely caused by melanin meiosis usually occurs before zygospore germination and there are a few main types of distinguishable nuclear behavior type 1 is when the nuclei fuse quickly , within a few days , resulting in mature zygospore having haploid nuclei type 2 is when some nuclei do not pair and degenerate instead , meiosis is delayed until germination type 3 is when haploid nuclei continue to divide mitotically and then some associate into groups and some do not zygomycetes exhibit a special structure of cell wall the nascent polysaccharide chain is then cleaved by the enzyme chitin deacetylase it was later shown to be the hormone that brought about zygophore production in mucor mucedo recognition of compatible sexual partners in zygomycota is based on a cooperative biosynthesis pathway of trisporic acid after dissolving of the fusion wall , cytoplasm and a high number of nuclei from both gametangia are mixed many morphological similarities in comparison to zygospore formation are seen , but the mature spore is called a sikyospore and is parasitic this , coupled with further evidence , has led to the assumption that trisporoids are not strictly species-specific , but that they might represent the general principle of mating recognition in mucorales for example , in pilobolus crystallinus light is responsible for the dispersal mechanism and the sporangiophores of phycomyces blakesleeanus grow towards light when light , particularly blue light , is involved in the regulation of fungal development , it directs the growth of fungal structures and activates metabolic pathways for instance , the zygomycota use light as signal to promote vegetative reproduction and growth of aerial hyphae to facilitate spore dispersal in plants and fungi , phototropism and gravitropism interact in a complex manner zygomycetes grow well on most standard fungal growth medium such as sabouraud dextrose agar sexual reproduction in rhizopus stolonifer , as in other zygomycetes , occurs when haploid hyphae of different mating types are in close proximity to each other meiosis occurs during germination of the zygosporagium so the resulting spores or hyphae are haploid

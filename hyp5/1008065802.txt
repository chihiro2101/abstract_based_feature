unlike board-level designs composed of discrete parts , it is not practical to breadboard integrated circuits before manufacture further , the high costs of photomask and other manufacturing prerequisites make it essential to design the circuit to be as close to perfect as possible before the integrated circuit is first built simulating the circuit with spice is the industry-standard way to verify circuit operation at the transistor level before committing to manufacturing an integrated circuit these parasitic components can often be estimated more accurately using spice simulation also , designers may want more information about the circuit than is available from a single mock-up for instance , circuit performance is affected by component manufacturing tolerances in these cases it is common to use spice to perform monte carlo simulations of the effect of component variations on performance , a task which is impractical using calculations by hand for a circuit of any appreciable complexity circuit simulation programs , of which spice and derivatives are the most prominent , take a text netlist describing the circuit elements ( transistors , resistors , capacitors , etc spice was developed at the electronics research laboratory of the university of california , berkeley by laurence nagel with direction from his research advisor , prof spice1 is largely a derivative of the cancer program , which nagel had worked on under prof pederson insisted that cancer , a proprietary program , be rewritten enough that restrictions could be removed and the program could be put in the public domain 2nd spice1 ref spice1 is coded in fortran and uses nodal analysis to construct the circuit equations spice1 has relatively few circuit elements available and uses a fixed-timestep transient analysis the real popularity of spice started with spice2 2nd spice2 ref in 1975 , analysis of performance and convergence issues for circuit simulation , memorandum no as an early public domain software program with source code available , history-of-spice on allaboutcircuits.com '' the origin of spice traces back to another circuit simulation program called cancer its ubiquity became such that '' to spice a circuit '' remains synonymous with circuit simulation pederson award in solid-state circuits for the development of spice 871-874 , 10–13 may 1992 developed at georgia tech , which added mixed analog/digital '' code models '' for behavioral simulation ; cider codecs : a mixed-level circuit and device simulator , k berkeley spice inspired and served as a basis for many other circuit simulation programs , in academia , in industry , and in commercial products the first commercial version of spice is ispice , vladimirescu , andrei , spice – the third decade , proc the integrated circuit industry adopted spice quickly , and until commercial versions became well developed many ic design houses had proprietary versions of spice spice combined operating point solutions , transient analysis , and various small-signal analyses with the circuit elements and device models needed to successfully simulate many circuits however , since a transient analysis first performs a dc operating point analysis ( unless the uic option is specified in the in a transient analysis , the error message '' internal timestep too small '' indicates that the circuit failed to converge

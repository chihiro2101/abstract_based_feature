unlike board-level designs composed of discrete parts , it is not practical to breadboard integrated circuits before manufacture further , the high costs of photomask and other manufacturing prerequisites make it essential to design the circuit to be as close to perfect as possible before the integrated circuit is first built simulating the circuit with spice is the industry-standard way to verify circuit operation at the transistor level before committing to manufacturing an integrated circuit board-level circuit designs can often be breadboarded for testing even with a breadboard , some circuit properties may not be accurate compared to the final printed wiring board , such as parasitic resistances and capacitances also , designers may want more information about the circuit than is available from a single mock-up in these cases it is common to use spice to perform monte carlo simulations of the effect of component variations on performance , a task which is impractical using calculations by hand for a circuit of any appreciable complexity circuit simulation programs , of which spice and derivatives are the most prominent , take a text netlist describing the circuit elements ( transistors , resistors , capacitors , etc spice was developed at the electronics research laboratory of the university of california , berkeley by laurence nagel with direction from his research advisor , prof spice1 is largely a derivative of the cancer program , which nagel had worked on under prof 2nd spice1 ref spice1 is coded in fortran and uses nodal analysis to construct the circuit equations spice1 has relatively few circuit elements available and uses a fixed-timestep transient analysis the real popularity of spice started with spice2 2nd spice2 ref in 1975 , analysis of performance and convergence issues for circuit simulation , memorandum no '' the origin of spice traces back to another circuit simulation program called cancer spice source code was from the beginning distributed by uc berkeley for a nominal charge ( to cover the cost of magnetic tape ) the birth of spice was named an ieee milestone in 2011 ; the entry mentions that spice '' evolved to become the worldwide standard integrated circuit simulator '' no newer versions of berkeley spice have been released after version 3f.5 in 1993 871-874 , 10–13 may 1992 developed at georgia tech , which added mixed analog/digital '' code models '' for behavioral simulation ; cider codecs : a mixed-level circuit and device simulator , k berkeley spice inspired and served as a basis for many other circuit simulation programs , in academia , in industry , and in commercial products the first commercial version of spice is ispice , vladimirescu , andrei , spice – the third decade , proc spice combined operating point solutions , transient analysis , and various small-signal analyses with the circuit elements and device models needed to successfully simulate many circuits analysis at various temperatures is done by automatically updating semiconductor model parameters for temperature , allowing the circuit to be simulated at temperature extremes parametric sweeps were added to analyze circuit performance with changing manufacturing tolerances or operating conditions in particular , the bsim family of models were added , which were also developed at uc berkeley since transient analysis is dependent on time , it uses different analysis algorithms , control options with different convergence-related issues and different initialization parameters than dc analysis

unlike board-level designs composed of discrete parts , it is not practical to breadboard integrated circuits before manufacture further , the high costs of photomask and other manufacturing prerequisites make it essential to design the circuit to be as close to perfect as possible before the integrated circuit is first built simulating the circuit with spice is the industry-standard way to verify circuit operation at the transistor level before committing to manufacturing an integrated circuit board-level circuit designs can often be breadboarded for testing even with a breadboard , some circuit properties may not be accurate compared to the final printed wiring board , such as parasitic resistances and capacitances also , designers may want more information about the circuit than is available from a single mock-up circuit simulation programs , of which spice and derivatives are the most prominent , take a text netlist describing the circuit elements ( transistors , resistors , capacitors , etc spice was developed at the electronics research laboratory of the university of california , berkeley by laurence nagel with direction from his research advisor , prof spice1 is largely a derivative of the cancer program , which nagel had worked on under prof 2nd spice1 ref spice1 is coded in fortran and uses nodal analysis to construct the circuit equations spice1 has relatively few circuit elements available and uses a fixed-timestep transient analysis the real popularity of spice started with spice2 2nd spice2 ref in 1975 , analysis of performance and convergence issues for circuit simulation , memorandum no '' the origin of spice traces back to another circuit simulation program called cancer when rohrer left berkeley , cancer was re-written and re-named to spice , released as version 1 to the public domain in may of 1972 version 2 of spice was released in 1975 ( version 2g6—the version used in this book—is a minor revision of this 1975 release ) '' spice was widely distributed and used its ubiquity became such that '' to spice a circuit '' remains synonymous with circuit simulation 871-874 , 10–13 may 1992 developed at georgia tech , which added mixed analog/digital '' code models '' for behavioral simulation ; cider codecs : a mixed-level circuit and device simulator , k berkeley spice inspired and served as a basis for many other circuit simulation programs , in academia , in industry , and in commercial products the integrated circuit industry adopted spice quickly , and until commercial versions became well developed many ic design houses had proprietary versions of spice analog devices offers a similar free tool called adisimpe ( based on the simetrix/simplis simertrix/simplis implementation of spice ) spice combined operating point solutions , transient analysis , and various small-signal analyses with the circuit elements and device models needed to successfully simulate many circuits harmonic balance or time-domain steady state analyses were added for rf and switched-capacitor circuit design at 2019 , spice can not be used to '' simulate photonics and electronics together in a photonic circuit simulator '' , and thus it is not yet considered as a test simulator for photonic integrated circuits in a transient analysis , the error message '' internal timestep too small '' indicates that the circuit failed to converge

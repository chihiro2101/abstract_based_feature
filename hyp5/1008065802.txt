unlike board-level designs composed of discrete parts , it is not practical to breadboard integrated circuits before manufacture further , the high costs of photomask and other manufacturing prerequisites make it essential to design the circuit to be as close to perfect as possible before the integrated circuit is first built simulating the circuit with spice is the industry-standard way to verify circuit operation at the transistor level before committing to manufacturing an integrated circuit board-level circuit designs can often be breadboarded for testing in these cases it is common to use spice to perform monte carlo simulations of the effect of component variations on performance , a task which is impractical using calculations by hand for a circuit of any appreciable complexity circuit simulation programs , of which spice and derivatives are the most prominent , take a text netlist describing the circuit elements ( transistors , resistors , capacitors , etc the general equations produced are nonlinear differential algebraic equations which are solved using implicit integration methods , newton 's method and sparse matrix techniques spice was developed at the electronics research laboratory of the university of california , berkeley by laurence nagel with direction from his research advisor , prof spice1 is largely a derivative of the cancer program , which nagel had worked on under prof 2nd spice1 ref spice1 is coded in fortran and uses nodal analysis to construct the circuit equations nodal analysis has limitations in representing inductors , floating voltage sources and the various forms of controlled sources spice1 has relatively few circuit elements available and uses a fixed-timestep transient analysis the real popularity of spice started with spice2 2nd spice2 ref in 1975 , analysis of performance and convergence issues for circuit simulation , memorandum no '' the origin of spice traces back to another circuit simulation program called cancer when rohrer left berkeley , cancer was re-written and re-named to spice , released as version 1 to the public domain in may of 1972 its ubiquity became such that '' to spice a circuit '' remains synonymous with circuit simulation the birth of spice was named an ieee milestone in 2011 ; the entry mentions that spice '' evolved to become the worldwide standard integrated circuit simulator '' berkeley spice inspired and served as a basis for many other circuit simulation programs , in academia , in industry , and in commercial products the first commercial version of spice is ispice , vladimirescu , andrei , spice â€“ the third decade , proc the integrated circuit industry adopted spice quickly , and until commercial versions became well developed many ic design houses had proprietary versions of spice spice combined operating point solutions , transient analysis , and various small-signal analyses with the circuit elements and device models needed to successfully simulate many circuits however , a public-domain circuit simulator containing the modern analyses and features needed to become a successor in popularity to spice has not yet emerged however , since a transient analysis first performs a dc operating point analysis ( unless the uic option is specified in the op statement to store an estimate of the dc operating point during a transient analysis tran statement uic parameter in the above example bypasses the initial dc operating point analysis

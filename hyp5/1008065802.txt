unlike board-level designs composed of discrete parts , it is not practical to breadboard integrated circuits before manufacture further , the high costs of photomask and other manufacturing prerequisites make it essential to design the circuit to be as close to perfect as possible before the integrated circuit is first built simulating the circuit with spice is the industry-standard way to verify circuit operation at the transistor level before committing to manufacturing an integrated circuit board-level circuit designs can often be breadboarded for testing even with a breadboard , some circuit properties may not be accurate compared to the final printed wiring board , such as parasitic resistances and capacitances circuit simulation programs , of which spice and derivatives are the most prominent , take a text netlist describing the circuit elements ( transistors , resistors , capacitors , etc spice was developed at the electronics research laboratory of the university of california , berkeley by laurence nagel with direction from his research advisor , prof spice1 is largely a derivative of the cancer program , which nagel had worked on under prof pederson insisted that cancer , a proprietary program , be rewritten enough that restrictions could be removed and the program could be put in the public domain 2nd spice1 ref spice1 is coded in fortran and uses nodal analysis to construct the circuit equations spice1 has relatively few circuit elements available and uses a fixed-timestep transient analysis the real popularity of spice started with spice2 2nd spice2 ref in 1975 , analysis of performance and convergence issues for circuit simulation , memorandum no when rohrer left berkeley , cancer was re-written and re-named to spice , released as version 1 to the public domain in may of 1972 instrumental in the decision to release spice as a public-domain computer program was professor donald pederson of berkeley , who believed that all significant technical progress happens when information is freely shared spice source code was from the beginning distributed by uc berkeley for a nominal charge ( to cover the cost of magnetic tape ) the birth of spice was named an ieee milestone in 2011 ; the entry mentions that spice '' evolved to become the worldwide standard integrated circuit simulator '' no newer versions of berkeley spice have been released after version 3f.5 in 1993 since then , the open-source or academic continuations of spice include : xspice , code-level modeling in xspice , f berkeley spice inspired and served as a basis for many other circuit simulation programs , in academia , in industry , and in commercial products the first commercial version of spice is ispice , vladimirescu , andrei , spice â€“ the third decade , proc the integrated circuit industry adopted spice quickly , and until commercial versions became well developed many ic design houses had proprietary versions of spice academic publishers , boston , 1995 today a few ic manufacturers , typically the larger companies , have groups continuing to develop spice-based circuit simulation programs at 2019 , spice can not be used to '' simulate photonics and electronics together in a photonic circuit simulator '' , and thus it is not yet considered as a test simulator for photonic integrated circuits ic statement , the value at that node for the first time point ( time 0 ) is 5 v in a transient analysis , the error message '' internal timestep too small '' indicates that the circuit failed to converge

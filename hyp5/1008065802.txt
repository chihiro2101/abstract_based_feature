unlike board-level designs composed of discrete parts , it is not practical to breadboard integrated circuits before manufacture further , the high costs of photomask and other manufacturing prerequisites make it essential to design the circuit to be as close to perfect as possible before the integrated circuit is first built simulating the circuit with spice is the industry-standard way to verify circuit operation at the transistor level before committing to manufacturing an integrated circuit board-level circuit designs can often be breadboarded for testing even with a breadboard , some circuit properties may not be accurate compared to the final printed wiring board , such as parasitic resistances and capacitances these parasitic components can often be estimated more accurately using spice simulation also , designers may want more information about the circuit than is available from a single mock-up for instance , circuit performance is affected by component manufacturing tolerances in these cases it is common to use spice to perform monte carlo simulations of the effect of component variations on performance , a task which is impractical using calculations by hand for a circuit of any appreciable complexity circuit simulation programs , of which spice and derivatives are the most prominent , take a text netlist describing the circuit elements ( transistors , resistors , capacitors , etc spice was developed at the electronics research laboratory of the university of california , berkeley by laurence nagel with direction from his research advisor , prof spice1 is largely a derivative of the cancer program , which nagel had worked on under prof pederson insisted that cancer , a proprietary program , be rewritten enough that restrictions could be removed and the program could be put in the public domain 2nd spice1 ref spice1 is coded in fortran and uses nodal analysis to construct the circuit equations ucb/erl m89/42 , university of california , berkeley , april 1989 '' the origin of spice traces back to another circuit simulation program called cancer when rohrer left berkeley , cancer was re-written and re-named to spice , released as version 1 to the public domain in may of 1972 instrumental in the decision to release spice as a public-domain computer program was professor donald pederson of berkeley , who believed that all significant technical progress happens when information is freely shared its ubiquity became such that '' to spice a circuit '' remains synonymous with circuit simulation spice source code was from the beginning distributed by uc berkeley for a nominal charge ( to cover the cost of magnetic tape ) the birth of spice was named an ieee milestone in 2011 ; the entry mentions that spice '' evolved to become the worldwide standard integrated circuit simulator '' 871-874 , 10â€“13 may 1992 developed at georgia tech , which added mixed analog/digital '' code models '' for behavioral simulation ; cider codecs : a mixed-level circuit and device simulator , k berkeley spice inspired and served as a basis for many other circuit simulation programs , in academia , in industry , and in commercial products analysis at various temperatures is done by automatically updating semiconductor model parameters for temperature , allowing the circuit to be simulated at temperature extremes spice3 retaines the netlist for circuit description , but allows analyses to be controlled from a command-line interface similar to the c shell comparison of eda software list of free electronics circuit simulators input output buffer information specification ( ibis ) transistor models

glass fibers have been produced for centuries , but the earliest patent was awarded to the prussian inventor hermann hammesfahr ( 1845–1914 ) in the u.s mass production of glass strands was serendipity in 1932 when games slayter , a researcher at owens-illinois , directed a jet of compressed air at a stream of molten glass and produced fibers originally , fiberglas was a glass wool with fibers entrapping a great deal of gas , making it useful as an insulator , especially at high temperatures a suitable resin for combining the fiberglass with a plastic to produce a composite material was developed in 1936 by du pont with the combination of fiberglass and resin the gas content of the material was replaced by plastic many glass fiber composites continued to be called '' fiberglass '' ( as a generic name ) and the name was also used for the low-density glass wool product containing gas instead of plastic ray greene of owens corning is credited with producing the first composite boat in 1937 but did not proceed further at the time due to the brittle nature of the plastic used in 1939 russia was reported to have constructed a passenger boat of plastic materials , and the united states a fuselage and wings of an aircraft unlike glass fibers used for insulation , for the final structure to be strong , the fiber 's surfaces must be almost entirely free of defects , as this permits the fibers to reach gigapascal tensile strengths the process of manufacturing fiberglass is called pultrusion examples of standard yields are 225yield , 450yield , 675yield it is typically processed using the hand lay-up technique , where sheets of material are placed on a mold and brushed with resin using chopped strand mat gives the fiberglass isotropic in-plane material properties without this bonding , the fibers can 'slip ' in the matrix , causing localized failure an individual structural glass fiber is both stiff and strong in tension and compression—that is , along its axis on the other hand , the glass fiber is weak in shear—that is , across its axis therefore , if a collection of fibers can be arranged permanently in a preferred direction within a material , and if they can be prevented from buckling in compression , the material will be preferentially strong in that direction in fiberglass , it is the plastic matrix which permanently constrains the structural glass fibers to directions chosen by the designer with chopped strand mat , this directionality is essentially an entire two-dimensional plane ; with woven fabrics or unidirectional layers , directionality of stiffness and strength can be more precisely controlled within the plane a fiberglass component is typically of a thin '' shell '' construction , sometimes filled on the inside with structural foam , as in the case of surfboards for example , in severe temperature conditions ( over 180 & nbsp ; °c ) , the resin component of the composite may lose its functionality , partially due to bond deterioration of resin and fiber however , gfrps can still show significant residual strength after experiencing high temperatures ( 200 & nbsp ; °c ) . types of glass fiber used naming and use : pure silica ( silicon dioxide ) , when cooled as fused quartz into a glass with no true melting point , can be used as a glass fiber for fiberglass but has the drawback that it must be worked at very high temperatures s-glass ( '' s '' for '' stiff '' ) is used when tensile strength ( high modulus ) is important and is thus an important building and aircraft epoxy composite ( it is called r-glass , '' r '' for '' reinforcement '' in europe ) c-glass ( '' c '' for '' chemical resistance '' ) and t-glass ( '' t '' is for '' thermal insulator '' —a north american variant of c-glass ) are resistant to chemical attack ; both are often found in insulation-grades of blown fiberglass during world war ii , fiberglass was developed as a replacement for the molded plywood used in aircraft radomes ( fiberglass being transparent to microwaves ) in the production of some products , such as aircraft , carbon fiber is now used instead of fiberglass , which is stronger by volume and weight fiberglass is also used in the telecommunications industry for shrouding antennas , due to its rf permeability and low signal attenuation properties many sports use fiberglass protective gear , such as goaltenders ' and catchers ' masks much more reliable tanks are made using woven mat or filament wound fiber , with the fiber orientation at right angles to the hoop stress imposed in the sidewall by the contents resin—typically a 2-part thermoset polyester , vinyl , or epoxy—is mixed with its hardener and applied to the surface however , ntp considers fibrous glass dust to be '' reasonably anticipated as a human carcinogen ( certain glass wool fibers ( inhalable ) ) '' ntp and california 's oehha mean that a cancer warning label for biosoluble fiber glass home and building insulation is no longer required under federal or california law bulk moulding compound carbon fiber reinforced polymer ignace dubus-bonnel fiberglass sheet laminating g10 ( material ) glass fiber glass fiber reinforced concrete sheet moulding compound

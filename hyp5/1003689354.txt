glass fibers have been produced for centuries , but the earliest patent was awarded to the prussian inventor hermann hammesfahr ( 1845–1914 ) in the u.s '' the birth of fiberglass boats , '' the good ole boat mass production of glass strands was serendipity in 1932 when games slayter , a researcher at owens-illinois , directed a jet of compressed air at a stream of molten glass and produced fibers originally , fiberglas was a glass wool with fibers entrapping a great deal of gas , making it useful as an insulator , especially at high temperatures a suitable resin for combining the fiberglass with a plastic to produce a composite material was developed in 1936 by du pont with the combination of fiberglass and resin the gas content of the material was replaced by plastic this reduced the insulation properties to values typical of the plastic , but now for the first time , the composite showed great strength and promise as a structural and building material many glass fiber composites continued to be called '' fiberglass '' ( as a generic name ) and the name was also used for the low-density glass wool product containing gas instead of plastic unlike glass fibers used for insulation , for the final structure to be strong , the fiber 's surfaces must be almost entirely free of defects , as this permits the fibers to reach gigapascal tensile strengths if a bulk piece of glass were defect-free , it would be equally as strong as glass fibers ; however , it is generally impractical to produce and maintain bulk material in a defect-free state outside of laboratory conditions chopped strand mat or csm is a form of reinforcement used in fiberglass it is typically processed using the hand lay-up technique , where sheets of material are placed on a mold and brushed with resin using chopped strand mat gives the fiberglass isotropic in-plane material properties a coating or primer is applied to the roving to : help protect the glass filaments for processing and manipulation ensure proper bonding to the resin matrix , thus allowing for the transfer of shear loads from the glass fibers to the thermoset plastic without this bonding , the fibers can 'slip ' in the matrix , causing localized failure for example , in severe temperature conditions ( over 180 & nbsp ; °c ) , the resin component of the composite may lose its functionality , partially due to bond deterioration of resin and fiber however , gfrps can still show significant residual strength after experiencing high temperatures ( 200 & nbsp ; °c ) . types of glass fiber used composition : the most common types of glass fiber used in fiberglass is e-glass , which is alumino-borosilicate glass with less than 1 % w/w alkali oxides , mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics naming and use : pure silica ( silicon dioxide ) , when cooled as fused quartz into a glass with no true melting point , can be used as a glass fiber for fiberglass but has the drawback that it must be worked at very high temperatures ordinary a-glass ( '' a '' for '' alkali-lime '' ) or soda lime glass , crushed and ready to be remelted , as so-called cullet glass , was the first type of glass used for fiberglass it now makes up most of the fiberglass production in the world , and also is the single largest consumer of boron minerals globally c-glass ( '' c '' for '' chemical resistance '' ) and t-glass ( '' t '' is for '' thermal insulator '' —a north american variant of c-glass ) are resistant to chemical attack ; both are often found in insulation-grades of blown fiberglass a suitable resin for combining the '' fiberglas '' with a plastic was developed in 1936 by du pont during world war ii , fiberglass was developed as a replacement for the molded plywood used in aircraft radomes ( fiberglass being transparent to microwaves ) in the production of some products , such as aircraft , carbon fiber is now used instead of fiberglass , which is stronger by volume and weight fiberglass is also used in the telecommunications industry for shrouding antennas , due to its rf permeability and low signal attenuation properties other uses include sheet-form electrical insulators and structural components commonly found in power-industry products such tanks tend to be used for chemical storage because the plastic liner ( often polypropylene ) is resistant to a wide range of corrosive chemicals mass-produced fiberglass brick-effect panels can be used in the construction of composite housing , and can include insulation to reduce heat loss in rod pumping applications , fiberglass rods are often used for their high tensile strength to weight ratio the most common filaments are carbon or glass fiber and are coated with synthetic resin as they are wound the resin and glass may be applied separately or simultaneously '' chopped '' in a combined stream from a chopper gun bulk moulding compound carbon fiber reinforced polymer ignace dubus-bonnel fiberglass sheet laminating g10 ( material ) glass fiber glass fiber reinforced concrete sheet moulding compound

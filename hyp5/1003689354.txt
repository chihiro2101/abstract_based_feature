glass fibers have been produced for centuries , but the earliest patent was awarded to the prussian inventor hermann hammesfahr ( 1845–1914 ) in the u.s mass production of glass strands was serendipity in 1932 when games slayter , a researcher at owens-illinois , directed a jet of compressed air at a stream of molten glass and produced fibers a patent for this method of producing glass wool was first applied for in 1933 slayter , games ( 11 november 1933 ) '' method & apparatus for making glass wool '' owens joined with the corning company in 1935 and the method was adapted by owens corning to produce its patented '' fiberglas '' ( spelled with one '' s '' ) in 1936 originally , fiberglas was a glass wool with fibers entrapping a great deal of gas , making it useful as an insulator , especially at high temperatures a suitable resin for combining the fiberglass with a plastic to produce a composite material was developed in 1936 by du pont with the combination of fiberglass and resin the gas content of the material was replaced by plastic this reduced the insulation properties to values typical of the plastic , but now for the first time , the composite showed great strength and promise as a structural and building material many glass fiber composites continued to be called '' fiberglass '' ( as a generic name ) and the name was also used for the low-density glass wool product containing gas instead of plastic in 1939 russia was reported to have constructed a passenger boat of plastic materials , and the united states a fuselage and wings of an aircraft unlike glass fibers used for insulation , for the final structure to be strong , the fiber 's surfaces must be almost entirely free of defects , as this permits the fibers to reach gigapascal tensile strengths if a bulk piece of glass were defect-free , it would be equally as strong as glass fibers ; however , it is generally impractical to produce and maintain bulk material in a defect-free state outside of laboratory conditions the process of manufacturing fiberglass is called pultrusion it is then extruded through bushings , which are bundles of very small orifices ( typically 5–25 micrometres in diameter for e-glass , 9 micrometres for s-glass ) using chopped strand mat gives the fiberglass isotropic in-plane material properties ensure proper bonding to the resin matrix , thus allowing for the transfer of shear loads from the glass fibers to the thermoset plastic an individual structural glass fiber is both stiff and strong in tension and compression—that is , along its axis on the other hand , the glass fiber is weak in shear—that is , across its axis therefore , if a collection of fibers can be arranged permanently in a preferred direction within a material , and if they can be prevented from buckling in compression , the material will be preferentially strong in that direction furthermore , by laying multiple layers of fiber on top of one another , with each layer oriented in various preferred directions , the material 's overall stiffness and strength can be efficiently controlled in fiberglass , it is the plastic matrix which permanently constrains the structural glass fibers to directions chosen by the designer the component may be of nearly arbitrary shape , limited only by the complexity and tolerances of the mold used for manufacturing the shell . types of glass fiber used naming and use : pure silica ( silicon dioxide ) , when cooled as fused quartz into a glass with no true melting point , can be used as a glass fiber for fiberglass but has the drawback that it must be worked at very high temperatures e-glass ( '' e '' because of initial electrical application ) , is alkali-free and was the first glass formulation used for continuous filament formation it now makes up most of the fiberglass production in the world , and also is the single largest consumer of boron minerals globally fiberglass is an immensely versatile material due to its lightweight , inherent strength , weather-resistant finish and variety of surface textures during world war ii , fiberglass was developed as a replacement for the molded plywood used in aircraft radomes ( fiberglass being transparent to microwaves ) in the production of some products , such as aircraft , carbon fiber is now used instead of fiberglass , which is stronger by volume and weight fiberglass is also used in the telecommunications industry for shrouding antennas , due to its rf permeability and low signal attenuation properties such tanks tend to be used for chemical storage because the plastic liner ( often polypropylene ) is resistant to a wide range of corrosive chemicals one notable feature of fiberglass is that the resins used are subject to contraction during the curing process however , ntp considers fibrous glass dust to be '' reasonably anticipated as a human carcinogen ( certain glass wool fibers ( inhalable ) ) '' similarly , california 's office of environmental health hazard assessment ( '' oehha '' ) published a november , 2011 modification to its proposition 65 listing to include only '' glass wool fibers ( inhalable and biopersistent ) and harvard 's medical and public health schools which reached the same conclusion as iarc that there is no evidence of increased risk from occupational exposure to glass wool fibers

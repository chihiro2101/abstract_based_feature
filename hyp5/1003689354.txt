glass fibers have been produced for centuries , but the earliest patent was awarded to the prussian inventor hermann hammesfahr ( 1845–1914 ) in the u.s a patent for this method of producing glass wool was first applied for in 1933 originally , fiberglas was a glass wool with fibers entrapping a great deal of gas , making it useful as an insulator , especially at high temperatures a suitable resin for combining the fiberglass with a plastic to produce a composite material was developed in 1936 by du pont with the combination of fiberglass and resin the gas content of the material was replaced by plastic this reduced the insulation properties to values typical of the plastic , but now for the first time , the composite showed great strength and promise as a structural and building material many glass fiber composites continued to be called '' fiberglass '' ( as a generic name ) and the name was also used for the low-density glass wool product containing gas instead of plastic ray greene of owens corning is credited with producing the first composite boat in 1937 but did not proceed further at the time due to the brittle nature of the plastic used unlike glass fibers used for insulation , for the final structure to be strong , the fiber 's surfaces must be almost entirely free of defects , as this permits the fibers to reach gigapascal tensile strengths if a bulk piece of glass were defect-free , it would be equally as strong as glass fibers ; however , it is generally impractical to produce and maintain bulk material in a defect-free state outside of laboratory conditions the manufacturing process for glass fibers suitable for reinforcement uses large furnaces to gradually melt the silica sand , limestone , kaolin clay , fluorspar , colemanite , dolomite and other minerals until a liquid forms tex , or grams per km ( how many grams 1 & nbsp ; km of roving weighs , inverted from yield ; thus a smaller number means a lighter roving ) chopped strand mat or csm is a form of reinforcement used in fiberglass it consists of glass fibers laid randomly across each other and held together by a binder it is typically processed using the hand lay-up technique , where sheets of material are placed on a mold and brushed with resin ensure proper bonding to the resin matrix , thus allowing for the transfer of shear loads from the glass fibers to the thermoset plastic an individual structural glass fiber is both stiff and strong in tension and compression—that is , along its axis on the other hand , the glass fiber is weak in shear—that is , across its axis in fiberglass , it is the plastic matrix which permanently constrains the structural glass fibers to directions chosen by the designer the component may be of nearly arbitrary shape , limited only by the complexity and tolerances of the mold used for manufacturing the shell composition : the most common types of glass fiber used in fiberglass is e-glass , which is alumino-borosilicate glass with less than 1 % w/w alkali oxides , mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics ordinary a-glass ( '' a '' for '' alkali-lime '' ) or soda lime glass , crushed and ready to be remelted , as so-called cullet glass , was the first type of glass used for fiberglass it now makes up most of the fiberglass production in the world , and also is the single largest consumer of boron minerals globally advanced manufacturing techniques such as pre-pregs and fiber rovings extend fiberglass 's applications and the tensile strength possible with fiber-reinforced plastics fiberglass is also used in the telecommunications industry for shrouding antennas , due to its rf permeability and low signal attenuation properties because of fiberglass 's lightweight and durability , it is often used in protective equipment such as helmets smaller tanks can be made with chopped strand mat cast over a thermoplastic inner tank which acts as a preform during construction much more reliable tanks are made using woven mat or filament wound fiber , with the fiber orientation at right angles to the hoop stress imposed in the sidewall by the contents such tanks tend to be used for chemical storage because the plastic liner ( often polypropylene ) is resistant to a wide range of corrosive chemicals fiberglass is also used for septic tanks the resin and glass may be applied separately or simultaneously '' chopped '' in a combined stream from a chopper gun in fiberglass pultrusion , fibers ( the glass material ) are pulled from spools through a device that coats them with a resin fiberglass produced this way can be made in a variety of shapes and cross-sections , such as w or s cross-sections scientific evidence demonstrates that fiberglass is safe to manufacture , install and use when recommended work practices are followed to reduce temporary mechanical irritation bulk moulding compound carbon fiber reinforced polymer ignace dubus-bonnel fiberglass sheet laminating g10 ( material ) glass fiber glass fiber reinforced concrete sheet moulding compound

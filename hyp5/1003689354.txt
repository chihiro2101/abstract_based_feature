glass fibers have been produced for centuries , but the earliest patent was awarded to the prussian inventor hermann hammesfahr ( 1845–1914 ) in the u.s mass production of glass strands was serendipity in 1932 when games slayter , a researcher at owens-illinois , directed a jet of compressed air at a stream of molten glass and produced fibers originally , fiberglas was a glass wool with fibers entrapping a great deal of gas , making it useful as an insulator , especially at high temperatures a suitable resin for combining the fiberglass with a plastic to produce a composite material was developed in 1936 by du pont with the combination of fiberglass and resin the gas content of the material was replaced by plastic many glass fiber composites continued to be called '' fiberglass '' ( as a generic name ) and the name was also used for the low-density glass wool product containing gas instead of plastic ray greene of owens corning is credited with producing the first composite boat in 1937 but did not proceed further at the time due to the brittle nature of the plastic used notable progress – the use of plastics , evening post , wellington , new zealand , volume cxxviii , issue 31 , 5 august 1939 , page 28 the first car to have a fiber-glass body was a 1946 prototype of the stout scarab , but the model did not enter production unlike glass fibers used for insulation , for the final structure to be strong , the fiber 's surfaces must be almost entirely free of defects , as this permits the fibers to reach gigapascal tensile strengths if a bulk piece of glass were defect-free , it would be equally as strong as glass fibers ; however , it is generally impractical to produce and maintain bulk material in a defect-free state outside of laboratory conditions the process of manufacturing fiberglass is called pultrusion tex , or grams per km ( how many grams 1 & nbsp ; km of roving weighs , inverted from yield ; thus a smaller number means a lighter roving ) ensure proper bonding to the resin matrix , thus allowing for the transfer of shear loads from the glass fibers to the thermoset plastic an individual structural glass fiber is both stiff and strong in tension and compression—that is , along its axis on the other hand , the glass fiber is weak in shear—that is , across its axis with chopped strand mat , this directionality is essentially an entire two-dimensional plane ; with woven fabrics or unidirectional layers , directionality of stiffness and strength can be more precisely controlled within the plane a fiberglass component is typically of a thin '' shell '' construction , sometimes filled on the inside with structural foam , as in the case of surfboards for example , in severe temperature conditions ( over 180 & nbsp ; °c ) , the resin component of the composite may lose its functionality , partially due to bond deterioration of resin and fiber however , gfrps can still show significant residual strength after experiencing high temperatures ( 200 & nbsp ; °c ) . types of glass fiber used composition : the most common types of glass fiber used in fiberglass is e-glass , which is alumino-borosilicate glass with less than 1 % w/w alkali oxides , mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics naming and use : pure silica ( silicon dioxide ) , when cooled as fused quartz into a glass with no true melting point , can be used as a glass fiber for fiberglass but has the drawback that it must be worked at very high temperatures ordinary a-glass ( '' a '' for '' alkali-lime '' ) or soda lime glass , crushed and ready to be remelted , as so-called cullet glass , was the first type of glass used for fiberglass e-glass ( '' e '' because of initial electrical application ) , is alkali-free and was the first glass formulation used for continuous filament formation s-glass ( '' s '' for '' stiff '' ) is used when tensile strength ( high modulus ) is important and is thus an important building and aircraft epoxy composite ( it is called r-glass , '' r '' for '' reinforcement '' in europe ) fiberglass is an immensely versatile material due to its lightweight , inherent strength , weather-resistant finish and variety of surface textures a means of mass production of glass strands was accidentally discovered in 1932 when a researcher at owens-illinois directed a jet of compressed air at a stream of molten glass and produced fibers a suitable resin for combining the '' fiberglas '' with a plastic was developed in 1936 by du pont advanced manufacturing techniques such as pre-pregs and fiber rovings extend fiberglass 's applications and the tensile strength possible with fiber-reinforced plastics fiberglass is also used in the telecommunications industry for shrouding antennas , due to its rf permeability and low signal attenuation properties much more reliable tanks are made using woven mat or filament wound fiber , with the fiber orientation at right angles to the hoop stress imposed in the sidewall by the contents mass-produced fiberglass brick-effect panels can be used in the construction of composite housing , and can include insulation to reduce heat loss the fiberglass spray lay-up process is similar to the hand lay-up process but differs in the application of the fiber and resin to the mold in june 2011 , the national toxicology program ( ntp ) removed from its report on carcinogens all biosoluble glass wool used in home and building insulation and for non-insulation products bulk moulding compound carbon fiber reinforced polymer ignace dubus-bonnel fiberglass sheet laminating g10 ( material ) glass fiber glass fiber reinforced concrete sheet moulding compound

glass fibers have been produced for centuries , but the earliest patent was awarded to the prussian inventor hermann hammesfahr ( 1845–1914 ) in the u.s mass production of glass strands was serendipity in 1932 when games slayter , a researcher at owens-illinois , directed a jet of compressed air at a stream of molten glass and produced fibers a patent for this method of producing glass wool was first applied for in 1933 originally , fiberglas was a glass wool with fibers entrapping a great deal of gas , making it useful as an insulator , especially at high temperatures a suitable resin for combining the fiberglass with a plastic to produce a composite material was developed in 1936 by du pont the first ancestor of modern polyester resins is cyanamid 's resin of 1942 with the combination of fiberglass and resin the gas content of the material was replaced by plastic many glass fiber composites continued to be called '' fiberglass '' ( as a generic name ) and the name was also used for the low-density glass wool product containing gas instead of plastic ray greene of owens corning is credited with producing the first composite boat in 1937 but did not proceed further at the time due to the brittle nature of the plastic used in 1939 russia was reported to have constructed a passenger boat of plastic materials , and the united states a fuselage and wings of an aircraft unlike glass fibers used for insulation , for the final structure to be strong , the fiber 's surfaces must be almost entirely free of defects , as this permits the fibers to reach gigapascal tensile strengths using chopped strand mat gives the fiberglass isotropic in-plane material properties ensure proper bonding to the resin matrix , thus allowing for the transfer of shear loads from the glass fibers to the thermoset plastic an individual structural glass fiber is both stiff and strong in tension and compression—that is , along its axis , because a typical fiber is long and narrow , it buckles easily therefore , if a collection of fibers can be arranged permanently in a preferred direction within a material , and if they can be prevented from buckling in compression , the material will be preferentially strong in that direction the component may be of nearly arbitrary shape , limited only by the complexity and tolerances of the mold used for manufacturing the shell the mechanical functionality of materials is heavily reliant on the combined performances of both the resin ( aka matrix ) and fibers for example , in severe temperature conditions ( over 180 & nbsp ; °c ) , the resin component of the composite may lose its functionality , partially due to bond deterioration of resin and fiber however , gfrps can still show significant residual strength after experiencing high temperatures ( 200 & nbsp ; °c ) composition : the most common types of glass fiber used in fiberglass is e-glass , which is alumino-borosilicate glass with less than 1 % w/w alkali oxides , mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics naming and use : pure silica ( silicon dioxide ) , when cooled as fused quartz into a glass with no true melting point , can be used as a glass fiber for fiberglass but has the drawback that it must be worked at very high temperatures ordinary a-glass ( '' a '' for '' alkali-lime '' ) or soda lime glass , crushed and ready to be remelted , as so-called cullet glass , was the first type of glass used for fiberglass e-glass ( '' e '' because of initial electrical application ) , is alkali-free and was the first glass formulation used for continuous filament formation it now makes up most of the fiberglass production in the world , and also is the single largest consumer of boron minerals globally c-glass ( '' c '' for '' chemical resistance '' ) and t-glass ( '' t '' is for '' thermal insulator '' —a north american variant of c-glass ) are resistant to chemical attack ; both are often found in insulation-grades of blown fiberglass in the production of some products , such as aircraft , carbon fiber is now used instead of fiberglass , which is stronger by volume and weight advanced manufacturing techniques such as pre-pregs and fiber rovings extend fiberglass 's applications and the tensile strength possible with fiber-reinforced plastics smaller tanks can be made with chopped strand mat cast over a thermoplastic inner tank which acts as a preform during construction much more reliable tanks are made using woven mat or filament wound fiber , with the fiber orientation at right angles to the hoop stress imposed in the sidewall by the contents such tanks tend to be used for chemical storage because the plastic liner ( often polypropylene ) is resistant to a wide range of corrosive chemicals fiberglass is also used for septic tanks the work must be done quickly before the resin starts to cure unless high-temperature resins are used which will not cure until the part is warmed in an oven in fiberglass pultrusion , fibers ( the glass material ) are pulled from spools through a device that coats them with a resin bulk moulding compound carbon fiber reinforced polymer ignace dubus-bonnel fiberglass sheet laminating g10 ( material ) glass fiber glass fiber reinforced concrete sheet moulding compound

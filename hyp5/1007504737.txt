plans for a national bank of mexico began as early as the mexican empire of agustín de iturbide with his idea of a gran banco del imperio mexicano ( grand bank of the mexican empire ) the first bank organized by the government was the banco de avío which was formed in 1830 during the regime of anastasio bustamante under the direction of the minister of interior and foreign affairs , lucas alamán private banking officially began in mexico under the rule of emperor maximiliano in 1864 when the banco de londres , méxico y sud america ( bank of london , mexico and south america ) opened in mexico city both banks issued their own bank notes and many more banks followed suit in the next decade , including the banco nacional mexicano ( mexican national bank ) in 1882 , opened by the administration of president manuel gonzález in 1884 the banco nacional mexicano soon merged with banco mercantil mexicano ( mexican mercantile bank ) to form the banco nacional de méxico ( national bank of mexico ) which issued notes and was the primary lender to the government the new code also stipulated that all paper money had to be backed by gold or silver on deposit in the national treasury the new law grouped banks into three categories : issuing banks , mortgage loan banks , and auxiliary development banks the 1897 law said that private banks only had to back 33 % of the value of their issued notes , consequently all of the private banks were dissolved and their assets seized but it was n't until the end of 1924 that the ley general de instituciones de crédito ( general law of credit institutions ) was passed which was the legal antecedent for the banco de méxico initially , retail banks even had the option not to partner with banco de méxico the unease of the private banking institution was assuaged somewhat when the initial offices of banco de méxico were temporarily located in the headquarters of the banco de londres y mexico in 1932 , laws were passed that required all private banks to invest their capital in mexico and associate themselves with banco de méxico

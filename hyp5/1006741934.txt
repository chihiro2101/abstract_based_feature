language in towne 's script peter guber recalls , '' the first seven minutes , there were 342 'fucks ' '' ayres remembers , '' i thought that this was a picture that required a skewed perspective , and that 's what hal had '' ashby was coming off the disappointing commercial and critical failure of harold and maude and was in pre-production on three cornered circle at mgm when jack nicholson told him about the last detail , his upcoming film at columbia the director had been sent the script in the fall of 1971 , with a reader 's report calling it '' lengthy and unimaginative '' , but he personally found it very appealing columbia did not like ashby because he had a reputation of distrusting authority and made little effort to communicate with executives bud cort met with ashby and begged to play meadows , but the director felt that he was not right for the role robert englund also auditioned for the role of meadows casting director lynn stalmaster gave ashby a final selection of actors , and the two that stood out were randy quaid and john travolta the base suited their needs and ashby met carol kane , whom he would cast in a small role ashby postponed principal photography for a week to allow crosse to deal with the news and decide if he still wanted to do the film after nicholson won best actor there , it shamed the studio into releasing the film the film earned 5 million in rentals at the north american box office the last detail was nominated for the palme d'or at the 1974 cannes film festival and nicholson was awarded best actor in addition , the last detail was nominated for two golden globes awards – nicholson for best motion picture actor – drama and quaid for best supporting actor – motion picture '' i like the idea of winning at cannes with the last detail , but not getting our own academy award hurt real bad

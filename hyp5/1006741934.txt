they bitch '' ayres sent the script to robert altman and then hal ashby ashby was coming off the disappointing commercial and critical failure of harold and maude and was in pre-production on three cornered circle at mgm when jack nicholson told him about the last detail , his upcoming film at columbia ashby pulled out of his deal with mgm , and nicholson suggested that they team up on last detail gilda radner was cast in her first screen role , speaking one line as a member of nichiren shoshu guber told ayres that he could get burt reynolds , jim brown , and david cassidy and a new writer , and he would approve production immediately ayres rejected this proposal , and the studio agreed to wait because they were afraid that the producer would take the film to another studio however , the canadian navy was willing to cooperate and in mid-august 1972 , ashby and his casting director stalmaster traveled to toronto to look at a naval base and meet with actors opening scenes of the film were not shot at a canadian naval base , but rather at cfb borden , a major training base for the canadian air force & army this almost changed the studio 's mind about backing the project , but the director 's drug bust was not widely reported and nicholson remained fiercely loyal to him , which was a deciding factor just as the film was about to go into production , crosse was diagnosed with terminal cancer ashby postponed principal photography for a week to allow crosse to deal with the news and decide if he still wanted to do the film ashby decided to shoot the film chronologically in order to help the inexperienced quaid and recently cast young ease into their characters the actor said , '' hal is the first director to let me go , to let me find my own level '' ayres persuaded columbia to submit the last detail to the cannes film festival it was also nominated for three academy awards â€“ jack nicholson for academy award for best actor , randy quaid for best actor in a supporting role , and robert towne for academy award for best adapted screenplay with none of them winning '' i like the idea of winning at cannes with the last detail , but not getting our own academy award hurt real bad

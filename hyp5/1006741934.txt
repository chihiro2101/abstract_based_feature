they bitch '' towne refused to tone down the language and the project remained in limbo until nicholson , by then a bankable star , got involved ayres sent the script to robert altman and then hal ashby ayres remembers , '' i thought that this was a picture that required a skewed perspective , and that 's what hal had '' ashby was coming off the disappointing commercial and critical failure of harold and maude and was in pre-production on three cornered circle at mgm when jack nicholson told him about the last detail , his upcoming film at columbia he wanted to do it but it conflicted with his schedule for three cornered circle nicholson was set to play buddusky ; additional casting focused mainly on the roles of mule and meadows casting director lynn stalmaster gave ashby a final selection of actors , and the two that stood out were randy quaid and john travolta as originally written , the character of meadows was a '' helpless little guy '' , but ashby wanted to cast quaid , who was 6 ' 4 '' towne remembers thinking , '' there 's a real poignancy to this huge guy 's helplessness that 's great guber told ayres that he could get burt reynolds , jim brown , and david cassidy and a new writer , and he would approve production immediately the director wanted to shoot on location at the naval base in norfolk , virginia , and the brig at portsmouth , new hampshire , but was unable to get permission from the united states navy the base suited their needs and ashby met carol kane , whom he would cast in a small role opening scenes of the film were not shot at a canadian naval base , but rather at cfb borden , a major training base for the canadian air force & army ashby postponed principal photography for a week to allow crosse to deal with the news and decide if he still wanted to do the film ashby decided to shoot the film chronologically in order to help the inexperienced quaid and recently cast young ease into their characters ashby persuaded columbia to let him preview the film to see how the public would react the studio decided to give the film a limited release to qualify for oscar consideration with a wide release planned for the spring of 1974 it was also nominated for three academy awards â€“ jack nicholson for academy award for best actor , randy quaid for best actor in a supporting role , and robert towne for academy award for best adapted screenplay with none of them winning '' i like the idea of winning at cannes with the last detail , but not getting our own academy award hurt real bad

by august 1793 , the coalition army under command of the austrian prince of coburg had taken condé , valenciennes , and le cateau in northern france the allies planned to next besiege cambrai , however the british government ordered the duke of york 's anglo-hanoverian corps to instead seize the coastal port of dunkirk , the possession of which they believed would be a valuable military base and bargaining counter york concentrated at menen and split his command in two forces : 22,000 british troops he led directly to invest the city of dunkirk , while the 14,500 man covering army of marshal freytag consisting of the hanoverian troops and ten squadrons of british cavalry had to protect his left flank 227 the duke of york drove souham 's men back into dunkirk , taking the rosendaël suburb on 24 august then digging in to besiege dunkirk from the east side arriving at poperinge on 20 august , hessian troops under freytag 's command drove the french from oost-cappel and rexpoëde back to bergues this fortified town was , two days later , surrounded by a corps moving south of bergues and taking wormhout and esquelbecq freytag was an experienced commander and had seen much service in the seven years war commanding light troops , however at hondschoote his trust in the cordon system of linked army outposts was to prove fatal the new french commander of the armée du nord was jean nicolas houchard , a brave and experienced subordinate general but patently out of his depth as commander-in-chief formerly one of custine 's closest deputies , he was in his element leading the charge of a cavalry regiment , but had neither the acumen or confidence to head an army the size of the armée du nord 211 '' custine certainly could judge men , and he was right in this case , for all who knew the worthy old houchard considered him as lost when given a charge so much beyond his powers ” the only concessions made were for a corps under beaulieu to be moved up to bouvines and orchies , while the lackluster dutch troops of the prince of orange spread out between lannoy to menin 234 on 27 august houchard launched 15,000 men in three columns against orange and beaulieu 's forces towards tourcoing and menin at tourcoing , faced by houchard 's central column the dutch abandoned the village after a stiff fight , but the french then dispersed to plunder , only to flee on the sight of two small bodies of enemy cavalry having realised that york 's objective was to besiege dunkirk , houchard saw his opportunity to drive a wedge between the anglo-hanoverians and the austrians however he had no intention of massing troops to strike a decisive blow , houchard merely planned to use the concentrated forces at cassel to demonstrate against york and draw him away from dunkirk 223 at the beginning of september houchard learned of the execution of custine in paris , which sent him into a spiral of dejection and allowed the representatives virtually a free hand on the same day freytag , fearful of the french build-up to his front , sent two detachments to seize arneke , which was duly stormed , though a british colonel was taken prisoner with his men exhausted and knowing hédouville 's column had also crossed the river at oost-capel houchard wished to halt for the night , but representative hentz overruled him , announcing '' free men were never too tired to fight the slaves of tyrants ; therefore the army should continue its movement '' the next day houchard attempted to renew the assault , but jourdan 's troops in particular were scattered and demoralised after the hard fighting , so his forces were pulled back to the south bank of the yser to reorganize and re-supply so , of his entire 43,000 men houchard only utilised some 22,000 for the attack on walmoden , while another 12,000 were sent to dunkirk , and dumesny 's 9,000 men were left facing ypres , far from the seat of action with the centre wavering houchard rode out to bring up colaud 's brigade on the right , ordering jourdan to attack again when he heard the charge sounded york writes of freytag : '' on the 6th of september , the day of the first attack upon the field marshal 's corps , he never would believe that the enemy had forced the post on his left flank in spite of repeated reports that were sent to him , nor was it till six in the evening , that he consented to retreat , which he did in two columns

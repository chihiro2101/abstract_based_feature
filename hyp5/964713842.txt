petroleum geology is principally concerned with the evaluation of seven key elements in sedimentary basins : thumb source reservoir seal trap timing maturation migration in general , all these elements must be assessed via a limited 'window ' into the subsurface world , provided by one ( or possibly more ) exploration wells evaluation of the source uses the methods of geochemistry to quantify the nature of organic-rich rocks which contain the precursors to hydrocarbons , such that the type and quality of expelled hydrocarbon can be assessed analysis of reservoirs at the simplest level requires an assessment of their porosity ( to calculate the volume of in situ hydrocarbons ) and their permeability ( to calculate how easily hydrocarbons will flow out of them ) the petroleum trap is the stratigraphic or structural feature that ensures the juxtaposition of reservoir and seal such that hydrocarbons remain trapped in the subsurface , rather than escaping ( due to their natural buoyancy ) and being lost finally , careful studies of migration reveal information on how hydrocarbons move from source to reservoir and help quantify the source ( or kitchen ) of hydrocarbons in a particular area delineation and identification of potential source rocks depends on studies of the local stratigraphy , palaeogeography and sedimentology to determine the likelihood of organic-rich sediments having been deposited in the past if the likelihood of there being a source rock is thought to be high , the next matter to address is the state of thermal maturity of the source , and the timing of maturation this is performed with a combination of geochemical analysis of the source rock ( to determine the type of kerogens present and their maturation characteristics ) and basin modelling methods , such as back-stripping , to model the temperature in the sedimentary column this study tackles the petroleum system and studies source rock ( presence and quality ) ; burial history ; maturation ( timing and volumes ) ; migration and focus ; and potential regional seals and major reservoir units ( that define carrier beds ) although a basin analysis is usually part of the first study a company conducts prior to moving into an area for future exploration , it is also sometimes conducted during the exploration phase once a possible hydrocarbon reservoir is identified , the key physical characteristics of a reservoir that are of interest to a hydrocarbon explorationist are its bulk rock volume , net-to-gross ratio , porosity and permeability the bulk rock volume multiplied by the net-to-gross ratio gives the net rock volume of the reservoir

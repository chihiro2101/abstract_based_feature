junipers vary in size and shape from tall trees , tall , to columnar or low-spreading shrubs with long , trailing branches the female seed cones are very distinctive , with fleshy , fruit-like coalescing scales which fuse together to form a '' berry '' -like structure ( galbulus ) , long , with one to 12 unwinged , hard-shelled seeds in some species , these '' berries '' are red-brown or orange , but in most they are blue ; they are often aromatic and can be used as a spice the seed maturation time varies between species from 6 to 18 months after pollination in zones 7 through 10 , junipers can bloom and release pollen several times each year a few species of junipers bloom in autumn , while most species pollinate from early winter until late spring squamata ) , all the foliage is of the juvenile needle-like type , with no scale leaves the needle-leaves of junipers are hard and sharp , making the juvenile foliage very prickly to handle those of the tortrix moth cydia duplicana feed on the bark around injuries or canker these seeds last a long time , as they can be dispersed long distances over the course of a few years the number of juniper species is in dispute , with two studies giving very different totals : farjon ( 2001 ) accepted 52 species and adams ( 2004 ) accepted 67 species the junipers are divided into several sections , though ( particularly among the scale-leaved species ) which species belong to which sections is still far from clear , with research still ongoing juniperus – needle-leaf junipers ; the adult leaves are needle-like , in whorls of three , and jointed at the base juniperus sect alpina – alpine juniper juniperus conferta – shore juniper juniperus rigida – temple juniper or needle juniper juniperus sect caryocedrus – cones with 3 seeds fused together ; needles with two stomatal bands juniperus drupacea – syrian juniper juniperus sect confirmation of the southern-most population of juniperus seravschanica in oman by dna sequencing of nrdna and four cpdna regions phytologia 96 : 218-224 additionally , the western juniper plants , a particular species in the juniper genus , are found in woodlands where there are large , open spaces some species found in cultivation include : juniperu chinensis juniperus communis juniperus horizontalis juniperus × pfitzeriana juniperus procumbens juniperus rigida juniperus scapulorum juniperus squamata completely male juniper plants have an opals rating of 10 , and release abundant amounts of pollen

for example , mechanics and mathematical analysis were commonly combined into one subject during the 18th century , united by the differential equation concept ; while algebra and geometry were considered largely distinct now we consider analysis , algebra , and geometry , but not mechanics , as parts of mathematics because they are primarily deductive formal sciences , while mechanics like physics must proceed from observation the term theory is used informally within mathematics to mean a self-consistent body of definitions , axioms , theorems , examples , and so on ( examples include group theory , galois theory , control theory , and k-theory a well-known example was the development of analytic geometry , which in the hands of mathematicians such as descartes and fermat showed that many theorems about curves and surfaces of special types could be stated in algebraic language ( then new ) , each of which could then be proved using the same techniques in 1872 , felix klein noted that the many branches of geometry which had been developed during the 19th century ( affine geometry , projective geometry , hyperbolic geometry , etc early in the 20th century , many parts of mathematics began to be treated by delineating useful sets of axioms and then studying their consequences thus , for example , the studies of '' hypercomplex numbers '' , such as considered by the quaternion society , were put onto an axiomatic footing as branches of ring theory ( in this case , with the specific meaning of associative algebras over the field of complex numbers ) in most cases , mathematical objects under study can be defined ( albeit non-canonically ) as sets or , more informally , as sets with additional structure such as an addition operation in particular , this perspective placed little value on fields of mathematics ( such as combinatorics ) whose objects of study are very often special , or found in situations which can only superficially be related to more axiomatic branches of the subject category theory is a unifying theory of mathematics that was initially developed in the second half of the 20th century a well-known example is the taniyamaâ€“shimura conjecture , now the modularity theorem , which proposed that each elliptic curve over the rational numbers can be translated into a modular form ( in such a way as to preserve the associated l-function ) certain curves had been known to be both elliptic curves ( of genus 1 ) and modular curves , before the conjecture was formulated ( about 1955 ) his principle of functoriality with respect to the l-group has a very large explanatory value with respect to known types of lifting of automorphic forms ( now more broadly studied as automorphic representations )

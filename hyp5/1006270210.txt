the lifting body was conceived as long ago as 1917 , when it was described in a patent by roy scroggs however at low airspeeds the lifting body is inefficient and did not enter mainstream airplane design aerospace-related lifting body research arose from the idea of spacecraft re-entering the earth 's atmosphere and landing much like a regular aircraft a steerable spacecraft with wings could significantly extend its landing envelope however , the vehicle 's wings would have to be designed to withstand the dynamic and thermal stresses of both re-entry and hypersonic flight a proposed solution eliminated wings altogether : design the fuselage body itself to produce lift image : x24.jpg thumb 250px right the martin aircraft company x-24 built as part of a 1963 to 1975 experimental us military program nasa 's refinements of the lifting body concept began in 1962 with r the first full-size model to come out of reed 's program was the nasa m2-f1 , an unpowered craft made of wood of the dryden lifting bodies , all but the unpowered nasa m2-f1 used an xlr11 rocket engine as was used on the bell x-1 nasa dryden fact sheet - lifting bodies a follow-on design designated the northrop hl-10 was developed at nasa langley research center air flow separation caused the crash of the northrop m2-f2 lifting body starting 1965 the russian lifting-body mikoyan-gurevich mig-105 or epos ( russian acronym for experimental passenger orbital aircraft ) was developed and several test flights made the ixv is a european space agency lifting body experimental re-entry vehicle intended to validate european reusable launchers which could be evaluated in the frame of the flpp program data acquired in flight test using high-speed landing approaches at very steep descent angles and high sink rates was used for modeling shuttle flight and landing profiles although a lifting body configuration would not have been vulnerable to the wing leading edge failure that caused the second shuttle loss , such a configuration could not meet the flight envelope requirements of both nasa and the military during landing attempts , the first stage deploys grid fins which steer lift produced by the cylindrical body of the first stage in addition to orbital sciences , the consortium behind the proposal included northrop grumman , which would have built the spaceplane , and the united launch alliance , which would have provided the launch vehicle the us government developed a variety of proof-of-concept and flight-test vehicle lifting body designs from the early 1960s through the mid-1970s at armstrong flight research center

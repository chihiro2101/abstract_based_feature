the lifting body was conceived as long ago as 1917 , when it was described in a patent by roy scroggs however at low airspeeds the lifting body is inefficient and did not enter mainstream airplane design aerospace-related lifting body research arose from the idea of spacecraft re-entering the earth 's atmosphere and landing much like a regular aircraft following atmospheric re-entry , the traditional capsule-like spacecraft from the mercury , gemini , and apollo series had very little control over where they landed a steerable spacecraft with wings could significantly extend its landing envelope however , the vehicle 's wings would have to be designed to withstand the dynamic and thermal stresses of both re-entry and hypersonic flight image : x24.jpg thumb 250px right the martin aircraft company x-24 built as part of a 1963 to 1975 experimental us military program nasa 's refinements of the lifting body concept began in 1962 with r in 1963 , nasa began programs with heavier rocket-powered lifting-body vehicles to be air launched from under the starboard wing of a nb-52b , a derivative of the b-52 jet bomber of the dryden lifting bodies , all but the unpowered nasa m2-f1 used an xlr11 rocket engine as was used on the bell x-1 nasa dryden fact sheet - lifting bodies a follow-on design designated the northrop hl-10 was developed at nasa langley research center air flow separation caused the crash of the northrop m2-f2 lifting body the ixv is a european space agency lifting body experimental re-entry vehicle intended to validate european reusable launchers which could be evaluated in the frame of the flpp program lifting bodies pose complex control , structural , and internal configuration issues lifting bodies were eventually rejected in favor of a delta wing design for the space shuttle although a lifting body configuration would not have been vulnerable to the wing leading edge failure that caused the second shuttle loss , such a configuration could not meet the flight envelope requirements of both nasa and the military the us government developed a variety of proof-of-concept and flight-test vehicle lifting body designs from the early 1960s through the mid-1970s at armstrong flight research center his series ufo featured a lifting body craft visually similar to the m2-f2 for orbital operations ( '' the man who came back '' ) the 1970s television program the six million dollar man used footage of a lifting body aircraft , culled from actual nasa exercises , in the show 's title sequence

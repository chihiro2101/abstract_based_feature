aerospace-related lifting body research arose from the idea of spacecraft re-entering the earth 's atmosphere and landing much like a regular aircraft however , the vehicle 's wings would have to be designed to withstand the dynamic and thermal stresses of both re-entry and hypersonic flight a proposed solution eliminated wings altogether : design the fuselage body itself to produce lift image : x24.jpg thumb 250px right the martin aircraft company x-24 built as part of a 1963 to 1975 experimental us military program nasa 's refinements of the lifting body concept began in 1962 with r dale reed of nasa 's armstrong flight research center the first full-size model to come out of reed 's program was the nasa m2-f1 , an unpowered craft made of wood in 1963 , nasa began programs with heavier rocket-powered lifting-body vehicles to be air launched from under the starboard wing of a nb-52b , a derivative of the b-52 jet bomber of the dryden lifting bodies , all but the unpowered nasa m2-f1 used an xlr11 rocket engine as was used on the bell x-1 nasa dryden fact sheet - lifting bodies a follow-on design designated the northrop hl-10 was developed at nasa langley research center the ixv is a european space agency lifting body experimental re-entry vehicle intended to validate european reusable launchers which could be evaluated in the frame of the flpp program lifting bodies were eventually rejected in favor of a delta wing design for the space shuttle data acquired in flight test using high-speed landing approaches at very steep descent angles and high sink rates was used for modeling shuttle flight and landing profiles another use of a lifting body is spacex 's falcon 9 rocket 's first stage the f-15 's pilot was aware that the wing had been seriously damaged , but decided to try and land in a nearby airbase , not knowing the extent of his wing damage in addition to orbital sciences , the consortium behind the proposal included northrop grumman , which would have built the spaceplane , and the united launch alliance , which would have provided the launch vehicle list of armstrong flight research center lifting body vehicles ( 1963 to 1975 ) the us government developed a variety of proof-of-concept and flight-test vehicle lifting body designs from the early 1960s through the mid-1970s at armstrong flight research center the 1970s television program the six million dollar man used footage of a lifting body aircraft , culled from actual nasa exercises , in the show 's title sequence

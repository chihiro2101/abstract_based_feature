the family is known from fossils of the extinct genus paleoleishmania preserved in burmese amber dating to the albian ( 100 mya ) and dominican amber from the burdigalian ( 20–15 mya ) of hispaniola the genus trypanosoma is also represented in dominican amber in the extinct species trypanosoma antiquus three genera are dixenous ( two hosts in the life cycle ) – leishmania , phytomonas and trypanosoma and the remainder are monoxenous ( one host in the life cycle ) 2000 genus zelonia shaw , camargo et teixeira 2016 subfamily phytomonadinae kostygov & yurchenko 2015 genus herpetomonas kent 1880 non donovan 1909 genus lafontella kostygov & yurchenko 2015 genus phytomonas donovan 1909 subfamily strigomonadinae votypka et al a variety of different morphological forms appear in the life cycles of trypanosomatids , distinguished mainly by the position , length and the cell body attachment of the flagellum the kinetoplast is found closely associated with the basal body at the base of the flagellum and all species of trypanosomatid have a single nucleus most of these morphologies can be found as a life cycle stage in all trypanosomatid genera however certain morphologies are particularly common in a particular genus for example , the amastigote ( prefix '' a- '' , meaning no flagellum ) form is also known as the leishmanial form as all leishmania have an amastigote life cycle stage this stage is characteristic of the genus trypanosoma in the mammalian host bloodstream as well as infective metacyclic stages in the fly vector

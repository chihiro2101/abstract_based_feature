the genus trypanosoma is also represented in dominican amber in the extinct species trypanosoma antiquus three genera are dixenous ( two hosts in the life cycle ) â€“ leishmania , phytomonas and trypanosoma and the remainder are monoxenous ( one host in the life cycle ) the genera in the subfamily strigomonadinae are characterised by the presence of obligatory intracellular bacteria of the kinetoplastibacterium genus 2000 genus zelonia shaw , camargo et teixeira 2016 subfamily phytomonadinae kostygov & yurchenko 2015 genus herpetomonas kent 1880 non donovan 1909 genus lafontella kostygov & yurchenko 2015 genus phytomonas donovan 1909 subfamily strigomonadinae votypka et al this heteroxenous life cycle typically includes the intestine of a bloodsucking insect and the blood and/or tissues of a vertebrate the kinetoplast is found closely associated with the basal body at the base of the flagellum and all species of trypanosomatid have a single nucleus most of these morphologies can be found as a life cycle stage in all trypanosomatid genera however certain morphologies are particularly common in a particular genus the various morphologies were originally named from the genus where the morphology was commonly found , although this terminology is now rarely used because of potential confusion between morphologies and genus the flagellum is found anterior of nucleus and flagellum not attached to the cell body

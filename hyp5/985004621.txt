the family is known from fossils of the extinct genus paleoleishmania preserved in burmese amber dating to the albian ( 100 mya ) and dominican amber from the burdigalian ( 20â€“15 mya ) of hispaniola the genus trypanosoma is also represented in dominican amber in the extinct species trypanosoma antiquus 2000 genus zelonia shaw , camargo et teixeira 2016 subfamily phytomonadinae kostygov & yurchenko 2015 genus herpetomonas kent 1880 non donovan 1909 genus lafontella kostygov & yurchenko 2015 genus phytomonas donovan 1909 subfamily strigomonadinae votypka et al 2014 genus angomonas souza & corte-real 1991 genus kentomonas votypka et al most of these morphologies can be found as a life cycle stage in all trypanosomatid genera however certain morphologies are particularly common in a particular genus the various morphologies were originally named from the genus where the morphology was commonly found , although this terminology is now rarely used because of potential confusion between morphologies and genus modern terminology is derived from the greek ; '' mastig '' , meaning whip ( referring to the flagellum ) , and a prefix which indicates the location of the flagellum on the cell the flagellum exits the cell anterior of nucleus and is connected to the cell body for part of its length by an undulating membrane image : leishmaniamexicana amastigote sem.jpg amastigote : false colour sem micrograph of amastigote form leishmania mexicana

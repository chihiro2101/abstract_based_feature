three genera are dixenous ( two hosts in the life cycle ) â€“ leishmania , phytomonas and trypanosoma and the remainder are monoxenous ( one host in the life cycle ) the genera in the subfamily strigomonadinae are characterised by the presence of obligatory intracellular bacteria of the kinetoplastibacterium genus some trypanosomatids only occupy a single host , while many others are heteroxenous : they live in more than one host species over their life cycle this heteroxenous life cycle typically includes the intestine of a bloodsucking insect and the blood and/or tissues of a vertebrate the kinetoplast is found closely associated with the basal body at the base of the flagellum and all species of trypanosomatid have a single nucleus modern terminology is derived from the greek ; '' mastig '' , meaning whip ( referring to the flagellum ) , and a prefix which indicates the location of the flagellum on the cell the flagellum is found anterior of nucleus and flagellum not attached to the cell body epimastigotes are a common form in the insect host and crithidia and blastocrithidia , both parasites of insects , exhibit this form during their life cycles the cell body is shown in orange and the flagellum is in red

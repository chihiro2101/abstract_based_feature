the family is known from fossils of the extinct genus paleoleishmania preserved in burmese amber dating to the albian ( 100 mya ) and dominican amber from the burdigalian ( 20–15 mya ) of hispaniola the genus trypanosoma is also represented in dominican amber in the extinct species trypanosoma antiquus three genera are dixenous ( two hosts in the life cycle ) – leishmania , phytomonas and trypanosoma and the remainder are monoxenous ( one host in the life cycle ) some trypanosomatids only occupy a single host , while many others are heteroxenous : they live in more than one host species over their life cycle most of these morphologies can be found as a life cycle stage in all trypanosomatid genera however certain morphologies are particularly common in a particular genus modern terminology is derived from the greek ; '' mastig '' , meaning whip ( referring to the flagellum ) , and a prefix which indicates the location of the flagellum on the cell the flagellum is found anterior of nucleus and flagellum not attached to the cell body this stage is characteristic of the genus trypanosoma in the mammalian host bloodstream as well as infective metacyclic stages in the fly vector the cell body is shown in orange and the flagellum is in red

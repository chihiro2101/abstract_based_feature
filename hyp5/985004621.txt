the genus trypanosoma is also represented in dominican amber in the extinct species trypanosoma antiquus 2000 genus zelonia shaw , camargo et teixeira 2016 subfamily phytomonadinae kostygov & yurchenko 2015 genus herpetomonas kent 1880 non donovan 1909 genus lafontella kostygov & yurchenko 2015 genus phytomonas donovan 1909 subfamily strigomonadinae votypka et al some trypanosomatids only occupy a single host , while many others are heteroxenous : they live in more than one host species over their life cycle typically the promastigote and epimastigote forms are found in insect hosts , trypomastigote forms in the mammalian bloodstream and amastigotes in intracellular environments the kinetoplast is found closely associated with the basal body at the base of the flagellum and all species of trypanosomatid have a single nucleus most of these morphologies can be found as a life cycle stage in all trypanosomatid genera however certain morphologies are particularly common in a particular genus the various morphologies were originally named from the genus where the morphology was commonly found , although this terminology is now rarely used because of potential confusion between morphologies and genus modern terminology is derived from the greek ; '' mastig '' , meaning whip ( referring to the flagellum ) , and a prefix which indicates the location of the flagellum on the cell for example , the amastigote ( prefix '' a- '' , meaning no flagellum ) form is also known as the leishmanial form as all leishmania have an amastigote life cycle stage

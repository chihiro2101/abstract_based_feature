futurebus looked to fix these problems and create a successor to systems like vmebus with a system that could grow in speed without affecting existing devices another problem that needed to be addressed was the ability to have several cards in the system as '' masters '' , allowing futurebus to build multiprocessor machines typical ieee standards start with a company building a device , and then submitting it to the ieee for the standardization effort american logic machines ( alm ) continues to build end to end system futurebus hybrid solutions , including vme-to-futurebus+ and other bus-to-futurebus bridge technologies seeing a potential massive government buy , the additions effort started immediately on futurebus+ it took another four years for the futurebus+ standard to be released by this time custom variation of futurebus took the lead in industry this degenerated into '' profiles '' , different versions of futurebus+ targeted towards a particular market the futurebus+ standards development politics got so complicated that the ieee 896 committee split from the ieee microcomputer standards committee and formed the ieee bus architecture standards committee ( basc ) many of the technical features ( asynchronous data bus , distributed bus arbitration , large board size ) are shared with ieee standard fastbus profile b was sponsored by digital equipment corporation and implemented in vax and alpha systems as an i/o bus futurebus+ boards are 12sux12su hard metric size defined in the ieee 1301 standards

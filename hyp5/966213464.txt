it was quite reasonable to connect a cpu and ram to vme on separate cards to build a computer another problem that needed to be addressed was the ability to have several cards in the system as '' masters '' , allowing futurebus to build multiprocessor machines typical ieee standards start with a company building a device , and then submitting it to the ieee for the standardization effort in the case of futurebus this was reversed , the whole system was being designed during the standardization effort seeing a potential massive government buy , the additions effort started immediately on futurebus+ it took another four years for the futurebus+ standard to be released by this time custom variation of futurebus took the lead in industry all of the futurebus+ proponents had their idea of what futurebus+ should be vme and other parallel bus standards are still trying to adapt concepts that are implemented in the futurebus , specially in high performance applications many of the technical features ( asynchronous data bus , distributed bus arbitration , large board size ) are shared with ieee standard fastbus futurebus+ boards are 12sux12su hard metric size defined in the ieee 1301 standards one of the most elegant features of the futurebus design is its distributed bus arbitration mechanism

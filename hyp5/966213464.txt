it was quite reasonable to connect a cpu and ram to vme on separate cards to build a computer another problem that needed to be addressed was the ability to have several cards in the system as '' masters '' , allowing futurebus to build multiprocessor machines typical ieee standards start with a company building a device , and then submitting it to the ieee for the standardization effort in the case of futurebus this was reversed , the whole system was being designed during the standardization effort american logic machines ( alm ) continues to build end to end system futurebus hybrid solutions , including vme-to-futurebus+ and other bus-to-futurebus bridge technologies it took another four years for the futurebus+ standard to be released by this time custom variation of futurebus took the lead in industry the futurebus+ standards development politics got so complicated that the ieee 896 committee split from the ieee microcomputer standards committee and formed the ieee bus architecture standards committee ( basc ) in the end very little use of futurebus was attempted vme and other parallel bus standards are still trying to adapt concepts that are implemented in the futurebus , specially in high performance applications many of the technical features ( asynchronous data bus , distributed bus arbitration , large board size ) are shared with ieee standard fastbus one of the most elegant features of the futurebus design is its distributed bus arbitration mechanism

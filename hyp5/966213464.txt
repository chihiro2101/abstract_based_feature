it was quite reasonable to connect a cpu and ram to vme on separate cards to build a computer another problem that needed to be addressed was the ability to have several cards in the system as '' masters '' , allowing futurebus to build multiprocessor machines typical ieee standards start with a company building a device , and then submitting it to the ieee for the standardization effort in the case of futurebus this was reversed , the whole system was being designed during the standardization effort american logic machines ( alm ) continues to build end to end system futurebus hybrid solutions , including vme-to-futurebus+ and other bus-to-futurebus bridge technologies seeing a potential massive government buy , the additions effort started immediately on futurebus+ it took another four years for the futurebus+ standard to be released by this time custom variation of futurebus took the lead in industry the futurebus+ standards development politics got so complicated that the ieee 896 committee split from the ieee microcomputer standards committee and formed the ieee bus architecture standards committee ( basc ) many of the technical features ( asynchronous data bus , distributed bus arbitration , large board size ) are shared with ieee standard fastbus profile b was sponsored by digital equipment corporation and implemented in vax and alpha systems as an i/o bus infiniband quickring sci bus topology the futurebus+ handbook , john theus , vita futurebus+ handbook for digital systems , digital equipment corporation fastbus

it was quite reasonable to connect a cpu and ram to vme on separate cards to build a computer in order to do this the primary technology of futurebus was built using asynchronous links , allowing the devices plugged into it to talk at whatever speed they wished another problem that needed to be addressed was the ability to have several cards in the system as '' masters '' , allowing futurebus to build multiprocessor machines typical ieee standards start with a company building a device , and then submitting it to the ieee for the standardization effort in the case of futurebus this was reversed , the whole system was being designed during the standardization effort seeing a potential massive government buy , the additions effort started immediately on futurebus+ it took another four years for the futurebus+ standard to be released by this time custom variation of futurebus took the lead in industry the futurebus+ standards development politics got so complicated that the ieee 896 committee split from the ieee microcomputer standards committee and formed the ieee bus architecture standards committee ( basc ) newer futurebus+ transceivers that meet the ieee std 1194.1-1991 backplane transceiver logic ( btl ) standard are still made by texas instruments many of the technical features ( asynchronous data bus , distributed bus arbitration , large board size ) are shared with ieee standard fastbus split bus transactions are supported so that slow response to a read or write will not tie up the backplane bus

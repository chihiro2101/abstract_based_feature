the word galleon , '' large ship '' , comes from spanish ( castilian ) gale처n , '' armed merchant ship '' , from old french galion , '' little ship '' ( 13c ) , from portuguese gale찾o , '' war ship '' , from medieval greek galea , '' galley '' + augmentative suffix -on the annali genovesi mentions galleons of 60 , 64 and 80 oars , used for battle and on missions of exploration , in the 12th and 13th centuries it is very likely that the galleons and galliots mentioned in the accounts of the crusades were the same vessels in the early 16th century , the venetian galleoni was a new class of galley used to hunt down pirates in the mediterranean later , when the term started to be applied to sail-only vessels , it meant , like the english term '' man-of-war '' , any large warship that was otherwise no different from the other sailing ships of the time in the beginning of the 16th century , a lowering of the carrack 's forecastle and elongation of the hull gave the ocean-going galleons an unprecedented level of stability in the water , and reduced drag ( physics ) at the front , leading to a faster , more maneuverable vessel in portugal at least , portuguese carracks were usually very large ships for their time ( often over 1,000 tons ) , while galleons were mostly under 500 tons , although the manila galleons were to reach up to 2,000 tons one of the largest and most famous of portuguese galleons was the s찾o jo찾o baptista ( nicknamed botafogo , '' spitfire '' ) , a 1,000-ton galleon built in 1534 , said to have carried 366 guns galeones were classed as 1- , 2- or 3-deckers , and stepped two or more masts rigged with square sails and topsails ( except for a lateen sail on the mizzenmast ) the galleon was powered entirely by wind , using sails carried on three or four masts , with a lateen sail continuing to be used on the last ( usually third and fourth ) masts while carracks played the leading role in early global explorations , galleons also played a part in the 16th and 17th centuries the galleon was the prototype of all square-rigged ships with three or more masts for over two and a half centuries , including the later full-rigged ship therefore , most galleons were originally consigned for trade , although those captured by rival states were usually put into military service on average with three masts , in larger galleons , a fourth mast was added , usually another lateen-rigged mizzen , called the mast ( sailing ) this manuscript , held at the pepysian library , magdalene college , cambridge , provides an authentic reference for the size and shape of typical english galleons built during this period

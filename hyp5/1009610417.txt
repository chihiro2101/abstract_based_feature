one of the best-known early natural experiments was the 1854 broad street cholera outbreak in london , england in this example , snow discovered a strong association between the use of the water from the pump , and deaths and illnesses due to cholera snow found that the southwark and vauxhall waterworks company , which supplied water to districts with high attack rates , obtained the water from the thames downstream from where raw sewage was discharged into the river by contrast , districts that were supplied water by the lambeth waterworks company , which obtained water upstream from the points of sewage discharge , had low attack rates therefore , this exposure has been recognized as being a natural experiment in stopping the use of water from the well-pump , the authorities conducted , in effect , a second study , an uncontrolled intervention study , a study with an intervention group but no control group an aim of a study angrist and evans ( 1998 ) was to estimate the effect of family size on the labor market outcomes of the mother first , both labor market outcomes and family size may be affected by unobserved '' third '' variables ( e.g this study was an example of a natural experiment , called a crossover study , where the exposure is removed for a time and then returned the study also potentially suggests that the inability to control variables in natural experiments can impede investigators from drawing firm conclusions in the twentieth century , as regulation improved and pollution fell , providing the conditions for a large-scale natural experiment , the trend towards industrial melanism was reversed , and melanic forms quickly became scarce

ch√¢tillon-sur-loire , but a part of his patrimony was '' violently and unjustly confiscated '' , according to one of his letters he came to the kingdom of jerusalem before 1153 when he was mentioned as a mercenary fighting in the army of baldwin iii of jerusalem the 12th-century historian william of tyre , who was raynald 's opponent , claimed that raynald was '' almost a common soldier ''

of antioch ) came to antioch at the head of his army at least three times during the following years he may have already been engaged to constance of antioch ( as runciman suggests ) , or their betrothal took place during raynald 's visit to the principality before the end of the siege ( as malcolm barber proposes ) after baldwin granted his consent , constance married raynald the wealthy latin patriarch of antioch , aimery of limoges , was raynald 's principal opponent in retaliation , raynald captured and tortured aimery , forcing him to sit naked and covered with honey in the sun , before imprisoning him emperor manuel sent his envoys to antioch , proposing to recognize raynald as the new prince if he launched a campaign against the armenians of cilicia , who had risen up against byzantine rule manuel also promised that he would compensate raynald for the expenses of the campaign after raynald defeated the armenians at alexandretta in 1155 , the knights templar seized the region of the syrian gates that the armenians had recently captured cyprus would never entirely recover from the devastation that raynald 's and thoros 's marauding raid caused raynald joined the

river euphrates at marash to seize cattle , horses and camels from the local peasants in november 1160 or 1161 majd al-din , governor of aleppo , attacked raynald and his retinue on the way back to antioch in raynald 's absence , constance wanted to rule alone , but baldwiniii of jerusalem made patriarch aimery regent for her fifteen-year-old son ( raynald 's stepson ) , bohemond iii of antioch raynald came to jerusalem with joscelin before 1september 1176 where he became a close ally of joscelin 's sister , agnes of courtenay according to historian bernard hamilton , these words suggest that raynald led the embassy that baldwiniv sent to constantinople to confirm an alliance between jerusalem and the byzantine empire against egypt raynald married stephanie of milly , the lady of oultrejordain , and baldwiniv also granted him hebron after william of montferrat died in june 1177 , the king made raynald regent william of tyre and ernoul attributed the victory to the king , but baha ad-din ibn shaddad and other muslim authors recorded that raynald was the supreme commander raynald became one of the principal supporters of guy of lusignan , who married the king 's elder sister , sybilla , in early 1180 , although many barons of the realm had opposed the marriage the king 's half sister , isabella ( whose stepfather , balian of ibelin was guy of lusignan 's opponent )

fought against saladin in the 1180s the contemporaneous ernoul mentioned two raids that raynald made against caravans travelling between egypt and syria , breaking the truce saladin 's nephew , farrukh shah , invaded oultrejourdain instead of attacking aleppo to compel raynald to return from the arabian desert raynald 's soldiers were executed , and saladin took an oath that he would never forgive him however , raynald refused to obey the king , stating that '' he was lord of his land , just as guy was lord of his , and he had no truces with the saracens '' raynald 's first wife , constance of antioch ( born in 1128 ) , was the only daughter of bohemond ii of antioch and alice of antioch most christian authors who wrote of raynald in the 12th and 13th centuries were influenced by raynald 's political opponent , william of tyre the author of the estoire of eracles stated that raynald 's attack against a caravan at the turn of 1186 and 1187 was the '' reason of the loss of the kingdom of jerusalem ''

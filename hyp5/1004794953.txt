raynald was the younger son of hervé ii , lord of donzy in older historiography , raynald was described as the son of geoffrey , count of gien , but in 1989 jean richard demonstrated raynald 's kinship with the lords of donzy he came to the kingdom of jerusalem before 1153 when he was mentioned as a mercenary fighting in the army of baldwin iii of jerusalem the 12th-century historian william of tyre , who was raynald 's opponent , claimed that raynald was '' almost a common soldier '' louisvii left the holy land for france in the summer of 1149 , but raynald stayed behind in palestine raymond , prince of antioch , and thousands of his soldiers fell in the battle of inab on 28june 1148 , leaving the principality almost undefended baldwiniii of jerusalem ( who was the cousin of raymond 's widow , constance , the ruling princess of antioch ) came to antioch at the head of his army at least three times during the following years she also refused john roger , whom the byzantine emperor , manuel i komnenos , proposed for her husband raynald accompanied baldwin to antioch in 1151 and settled in the principality , according to steven runciman it is certain that raynald fought in baldwin 's army during the siege of ascalon in early 1153 he may have already been engaged to constance of antioch ( as runciman suggests ) , or their betrothal took place during raynald 's visit to the principality before the end of the siege ( as malcolm barber proposes ) emperor manuel sent his envoys to antioch , proposing to recognize raynald as the new prince if he launched a campaign against the armenians of cilicia , who had risen up against byzantine rule always in need of funds , raynald urged manuel to send the promised subsidy to him , but manuel failed to pay the money cyprus would never entirely recover from the devastation that raynald 's and thoros 's marauding raid caused after thierry sharply refused to swear fealty to an upstart , the crusaders abandoned the siege after the crusaders captured harenc in february 1158 , raynald granted it to the flemish raynald of saint-valery william of tyre stated that '' the glory of the latin world was put to shame '' on this occasion , because envoys from the nearby muslim and christian rulers were also present at raynald 's humiliation raynald made a plundering raid in the valley of the river euphrates at marash to seize cattle , horses and camels from the local peasants in november 1160 or 1161 majd al-din , governor of aleppo , attacked raynald and his retinue on the way back to antioch in raynald 's absence , constance wanted to rule alone , but baldwiniii of jerusalem made patriarch aimery regent for her fifteen-year-old son ( raynald 's stepson ) , bohemond iii of antioch her death deprived raynald of his claim to antioch from his castles at kerak and montréal , he controlled the routes between the two main parts of saladin 's empire , syria and egypt after william of montferrat died in june 1177 , the king made raynald regent baldwin iv 's cousin , philip i , count of flanders , came to the holy land at the head of a crusader army in early august 1177 philip declared that he was '' willing to take orders '' from anybody , but he protested when baldwin confirmed raynald 's position as '' regent of the kingdom and of the armies '' saladin invaded the region of ascalon , but the royal army launched an attack on him in the battle of montgisard on 25november , leading to his defeat raynald became one of the principal supporters of guy of lusignan , who married the king 's elder sister , sybilla , in early 1180 , although many barons of the realm had opposed the marriage the king 's half sister , isabella ( whose stepfather , balian of ibelin was guy of lusignan 's opponent ) was engaged to raynald 's stepson , humphrey iv of toron , in autumn 1180 baldwiniv dispatched raynald , along with heraclius , latin patriarch of jerusalem , to mediate a reconciliation between bohemond iii of antioch and patriarch aimery in early 1181 ruben iii , prince of armenia , married raynald 's stepdaughter , isabella of toron the contemporaneous ernoul mentioned two raids that raynald made against caravans travelling between egypt and syria , breaking the truce raynald stormed into saladin 's territory , reaching as far as tabuk on the route between damascus and mecca in late 1181 on saladin 's protest , baldwiniv ordered raynald to free them , but raynald did not obey him raynald laid siege to the egyptian fortress on ile de graye raynald 's soldiers were executed , and saladin took an oath that he would never forgive him raynald urged the townspeople to accept sybilla as the lawful monarch , according to the estoire de eracles raynald 's first wife , constance of antioch ( born in 1128 ) , was the only daughter of bohemond ii of antioch and alice of antioch according to barber , raynald 's behavior during the reign of guy of lusignan shows that the kingdom had broken up into '' a collection of semi-autonomous fiefdoms '' by that time

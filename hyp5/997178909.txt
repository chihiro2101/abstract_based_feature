the understanding of the concept of second messengers , and in particular the role of cyclic nucleotides and their ability to relay physiological signals to a cell , has its origins in the research of glycogen metabolism by carl and gerty cori , for which they were awarded a nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1947 while investigating the action of adrenaline on glycogenolysis the next year , sutherland and walter wosilait reported that inorganic phosphate is released when the enzyme liver phosphorylase is inactivated ; but when it is activated , it incorporates a phosphate evgeny fesenko , stanislav kolesnikov , and arkady lyubarsky discovered in 1985 that cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cgmp ) can initiate the photoresponse in rods image : cgmp.png thumb cyclic guanosine monophosphate the cyclic portion refers to the two single bonds between the phosphate group and the ribose the two most well-studied cyclic nucleotides are cyclic amp ( camp ) and cyclic gmp ( cgmp ) , while cyclic cmp ( ccmp ) and cyclic ump ( cump ) are less understood camp is 3 ’ 5 ’ -cyclic adenosine monophosphate , cgmp is 3 ’ 5 ’ -cyclic guanosine monophosphate , ccmp is cytidine 3',5'-monophosphate , and cump is uridine 2',3'-cyclic phosphate these three components are connected so that the nitrogenous base is attached to the first carbon of ribose ( 1 ’ carbon ) , and the phosphate group is attached to the 5 ’ carbon of ribose while all nucleotides have this structure , the phosphate group makes a second connection to the ribose ring at the 3 ’ carbon in cyclic nucleotides because the phosphate group has two separate bonds to the ribose sugar , it forms a cyclic ring cyclic nucleotides can be found in many different types of eukaryotic cells , including photo-receptor rods and cones , smooth muscle cells and liver cells there is also data to support a synergistic binding effect amongst multiple cyclic nucleotides , with ccmp lowering the effective concentration ( ec 50 ) of camp for activation of protein kinase a ( pka ) cyclic nucleotides are integral to a communication system that acts within cells this releases camp into the cell interior , where it stimulates a protein kinase called cyclic amp-dependent protein kinase they also facilitate relaxation of smooth muscle cells in vascular tissue , and activate cyclic cng channels in retinal photoreceptors and olfactory sensory neurons

the understanding of the concept of second messengers , and in particular the role of cyclic nucleotides and their ability to relay physiological signals to a cell , has its origins in the research of glycogen metabolism by carl and gerty cori , for which they were awarded a nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1947 while investigating the action of adrenaline on glycogenolysis the next year , sutherland and walter wosilait reported that inorganic phosphate is released when the enzyme liver phosphorylase is inactivated ; but when it is activated , it incorporates a phosphate the “ active factor ” that the hormones produced was finally purified in 1958 , and then identified as containing a ribose , a phosphate , and an adenine in equal ratios evgeny fesenko , stanislav kolesnikov , and arkady lyubarsky discovered in 1985 that cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cgmp ) can initiate the photoresponse in rods by the end of the decade , the presence of two types of intramembrane receptors was understood : rs ( which stimulates cyclase ) and ri ( which inhibits cyclase ) the cyclic portion refers to the two single bonds between the phosphate group and the ribose the two most well-studied cyclic nucleotides are cyclic amp ( camp ) and cyclic gmp ( cgmp ) , while cyclic cmp ( ccmp ) and cyclic ump ( cump ) are less understood camp is 3 ’ 5 ’ -cyclic adenosine monophosphate , cgmp is 3 ’ 5 ’ -cyclic guanosine monophosphate , ccmp is cytidine 3',5'-monophosphate , and cump is uridine 2',3'-cyclic phosphate these three components are connected so that the nitrogenous base is attached to the first carbon of ribose ( 1 ’ carbon ) , and the phosphate group is attached to the 5 ’ carbon of ribose while all nucleotides have this structure , the phosphate group makes a second connection to the ribose ring at the 3 ’ carbon in cyclic nucleotides because the phosphate group has two separate bonds to the ribose sugar , it forms a cyclic ring therefore , for camp , 3 ’ 5 ’ -cyclic adenosine monophosphate indicates that a single phosphate group forms a cyclic structure with the ribose group at its 3 ’ and 5 ’ carbons , while the ribose group is also attached to adenosine ( this bond is understood to be at the 1 ’ position of the ribose ) cyclic nucleotides are produced from the generic reaction ntp → cnmp + pp i , where n represents a nitrogenous base cyclic nucleotides are well-suited to act as second messengers for several reasons the involvement of cyclic nucleotides on biological functions is varied , while an understanding of their role continues to grow

the understanding of the concept of second messengers , and in particular the role of cyclic nucleotides and their ability to relay physiological signals to a cell , has its origins in the research of glycogen metabolism by carl and gerty cori , for which they were awarded a nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1947 in 1956 edwin krebs and edmond fischer discovered that adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) is required for the conversion of phosphorylase b to glycogen phosphorylase a evgeny fesenko , stanislav kolesnikov , and arkady lyubarsky discovered in 1985 that cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cgmp ) can initiate the photoresponse in rods the cyclic portion refers to the two single bonds between the phosphate group and the ribose the two most well-studied cyclic nucleotides are cyclic amp ( camp ) and cyclic gmp ( cgmp ) , while cyclic cmp ( ccmp ) and cyclic ump ( cump ) are less understood camp is 3 ’ 5 ’ -cyclic adenosine monophosphate , cgmp is 3 ’ 5 ’ -cyclic guanosine monophosphate , ccmp is cytidine 3',5'-monophosphate , and cump is uridine 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and finally , a cyclic nucleotide contains a phosphate these three components are connected so that the nitrogenous base is attached to the first carbon of ribose ( 1 ’ carbon ) , and the phosphate group is attached to the 5 ’ carbon of ribose while all nucleotides have this structure , the phosphate group makes a second connection to the ribose ring at the 3 ’ carbon in cyclic nucleotides because the phosphate group has two separate bonds to the ribose sugar , it forms a cyclic ring therefore , for camp , 3 ’ 5 ’ -cyclic adenosine monophosphate indicates that a single phosphate group forms a cyclic structure with the ribose group at its 3 ’ and 5 ’ carbons , while the ribose group is also attached to adenosine ( this bond is understood to be at the 1 ’ position of the ribose ) cyclic nucleotides are produced from the generic reaction ntp → cnmp + pp i , where n represents a nitrogenous base cellular concentrations of cyclic nucleotides can be very low , in the 10 −7 m range , because metabolism and function are often localized in particular parts of the cell cyclic nucleotides are integral to a communication system that acts within cells cyclic nucleotides act as second messengers when first messengers , which can not enter the cell , instead bind to receptors in the cellular membrane

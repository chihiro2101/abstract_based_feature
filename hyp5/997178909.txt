the understanding of the concept of second messengers , and in particular the role of cyclic nucleotides and their ability to relay physiological signals to a cell , has its origins in the research of glycogen metabolism by carl and gerty cori , for which they were awarded a nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1947 while investigating the action of adrenaline on glycogenolysis the next year , sutherland and walter wosilait reported that inorganic phosphate is released when the enzyme liver phosphorylase is inactivated ; but when it is activated , it incorporates a phosphate evgeny fesenko , stanislav kolesnikov , and arkady lyubarsky discovered in 1985 that cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cgmp ) can initiate the photoresponse in rods the cyclic portion refers to the two single bonds between the phosphate group and the ribose the two most well-studied cyclic nucleotides are cyclic amp ( camp ) and cyclic gmp ( cgmp ) , while cyclic cmp ( ccmp ) and cyclic ump ( cump ) are less understood camp is 3 ’ 5 ’ -cyclic adenosine monophosphate , cgmp is 3 ’ 5 ’ -cyclic guanosine monophosphate , ccmp is cytidine 3',5'-monophosphate , and cump is uridine 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and finally , a cyclic nucleotide contains a phosphate a double-ring purine is the nitrogenous base for camp and cgmp , while cytosine , thymine , and uracil each have a single-ring nitrogenous base ( pyrimidine ) while all nucleotides have this structure , the phosphate group makes a second connection to the ribose ring at the 3 ’ carbon in cyclic nucleotides because the phosphate group has two separate bonds to the ribose sugar , it forms a cyclic ring therefore , for camp , 3 ’ 5 ’ -cyclic adenosine monophosphate indicates that a single phosphate group forms a cyclic structure with the ribose group at its 3 ’ and 5 ’ carbons , while the ribose group is also attached to adenosine ( this bond is understood to be at the 1 ’ position of the ribose ) cyclic nucleotides are produced from the generic reaction ntp → cnmp + pp i , where n represents a nitrogenous base cyclic nucleotides can be found in many different types of eukaryotic cells , including photo-receptor rods and cones , smooth muscle cells and liver cells cellular concentrations of cyclic nucleotides can be very low , in the 10 −7 m range , because metabolism and function are often localized in particular parts of the cell in bacteria , cyclic nucleotides bind to catabolite gene activator protein ( cap ) , which acts to increase metabolic enzymatic activity by increasing the rate of dna transcription

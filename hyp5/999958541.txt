an example of forced perspective is a scene in an action/adventure movie in which dinosaurs are threatening the heroes by placing a miniature model of a dinosaur close to the camera , the director may make the dinosaur look monstrously tall to the viewer , even though it is just closer to the camera forced perspective can be made more believable when environmental conditions obscure the difference in perspective early instances of forced perspective used in low-budget motion pictures showed objects that were clearly different from their surroundings : often blurred or at a different light level this means that a light source must be four times as bright to produce the same illuminance at an object twice as far away thus to create the illusion of a distant object being at the same distance as a near object and scaled accordingly , much more light is required when shooting with forced perspective , it 's important to have the aperture stopped down sufficiently to achieve proper dof ( depth of field ) , so that the foreground object and background are both sharp peter jackson 's film adaptations of the lord of the rings make extended use of forced perspective characters apparently standing next to each other would be displaced by several feet in depth from the camera even if the camera is just rotated , its point of view may move accidentally if the camera is not rotated about the correct point portions of sets were mounted on movable platforms which would move precisely according to the movement of the camera , so that the optical illusion would be preserved at all times for the duration of the shot the same techniques were used in the harry potter movies to make the character hagrid look like a giant as with many film genres and effects , forced perspective can be used to visual gag effect a character then interacts with the object or character , in the process showing that the viewer has been fooled and there is forced perspective in use in the television version , larger than life props are used to make the caricatured waterman look just three feet tall or less blue , the creators used forced perspective to make the character of tucker 's baby , junior , look small in architecture , a structure can be made to seem larger , taller , farther away or otherwise by adjusting the scale of objects in relation to the spectator , increasing or decreasing perceived depth in contrast , the opposite technique was sometimes used in classical garden designs and other folly to shorten the perceived distances of points of interest along a path the technique takes advantage of the visual cues humans use to perceive depth such as angular size , aerial perspective , shading , and relative size in film , photography and art , perceived object distance is manipulated by altering fundamental monocular cues used to discern the depth of an object in the scene such as aerial perspective , blurring , relative size and lighting artists are able to freely move the visual plane of objects by obscuring these cues to their advantage the subtended angle increases as the object moves closer to the lens using the monocular cue of aerial perspective , the eye uses the relative luminescence of objects in a scene to discern relative distance some notable examples of forced perspective in the parks , used to make the objects bigger , are the castles ( sleeping beauty , cinderella , and belle ) one of the most notable examples of forced perspective being used to make the object appear smaller is the american adventure pavilion in epcot

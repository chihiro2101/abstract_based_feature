an example of forced perspective is a scene in an action/adventure movie in which dinosaurs are threatening the heroes by placing a miniature model of a dinosaur close to the camera , the director may make the dinosaur look monstrously tall to the viewer , even though it is just closer to the camera forced perspective can be made more believable when environmental conditions obscure the difference in perspective a downpour ( created in the studio ) draws much of the viewer 's attention away from the backdrop and extras , making the simulated perspective less noticeable early instances of forced perspective used in low-budget motion pictures showed objects that were clearly different from their surroundings : often blurred or at a different light level this means that a light source must be four times as bright to produce the same illuminance at an object twice as far away thus to create the illusion of a distant object being at the same distance as a near object and scaled accordingly , much more light is required when shooting with forced perspective , it 's important to have the aperture stopped down sufficiently to achieve proper dof ( depth of field ) , so that the foreground object and background are both sharp this , in a still shot , makes some characters ( dwarves and hobbits ) appear much smaller than others if the camera 's point of view were moved , then parallax would reveal the true relative positions of the characters in space portions of sets were mounted on movable platforms which would move precisely according to the movement of the camera , so that the optical illusion would be preserved at all times for the duration of the shot props around harry and his friends are of normal size , while seemingly identical props placed around hagrid are in fact smaller as with many film genres and effects , forced perspective can be used to visual gag effect a character then interacts with the object or character , in the process showing that the viewer has been fooled and there is forced perspective in use the 1930 laurel and hardy movie brats used forced perspective to depict stan and ollie simultaneously as adults and as their own sons an example used for comic effect can be found in the slapstick comedy top secret ! in a scene which appears to begin as a close-up of a ringing phone with the characters in the distance however , when the character walks up to the phone ( towards the camera ) and picks it up , it becomes apparent that the phone is extremely oversized instead of being close to the camera blue , the creators used forced perspective to make the character of tucker 's baby , junior , look small when the statue was designed in the late 19th century ( before easy air flight ) , there were few other angles from which to view the statue the technique takes advantage of the visual cues humans use to perceive depth such as angular size , aerial perspective , shading , and relative size in film , photography and art , perceived object distance is manipulated by altering fundamental monocular cues used to discern the depth of an object in the scene such as aerial perspective , blurring , relative size and lighting objects that are farther away from the eye have a lower luminescent contrast due to atmospheric scattering of rays his shading technique allows the audience to discern the distance between objects due to their relative distances from a stationary light source that illuminates the scene furthermore , he uses a blue tint on objects that should be farther away and redder tint to objects in the foreground one of the most notable examples of forced perspective being used to make the object appear smaller is the american adventure pavilion in epcot

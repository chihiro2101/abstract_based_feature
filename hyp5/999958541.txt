an example of forced perspective is a scene in an action/adventure movie in which dinosaurs are threatening the heroes by placing a miniature model of a dinosaur close to the camera , the director may make the dinosaur look monstrously tall to the viewer , even though it is just closer to the camera kevin brownlow , david lean , p.209 movies , especially b-movies in the 1950s and 1960s , were produced on limited budgets and often featured forced perspective shots forced perspective can be made more believable when environmental conditions obscure the difference in perspective a downpour ( created in the studio ) draws much of the viewer 's attention away from the backdrop and extras , making the simulated perspective less noticeable early instances of forced perspective used in low-budget motion pictures showed objects that were clearly different from their surroundings : often blurred or at a different light level this means that a light source must be four times as bright to produce the same illuminance at an object twice as far away thus to create the illusion of a distant object being at the same distance as a near object and scaled accordingly , much more light is required peter jackson 's film adaptations of the lord of the rings make extended use of forced perspective if the camera 's point of view were moved , then parallax would reveal the true relative positions of the characters in space portions of sets were mounted on movable platforms which would move precisely according to the movement of the camera , so that the optical illusion would be preserved at all times for the duration of the shot a character then interacts with the object or character , in the process showing that the viewer has been fooled and there is forced perspective in use tyzik , '' the headcrusher '' , who used forced perspective ( from his own point of view ) to '' crush '' other people 's heads between his fingers in architecture , a structure can be made to seem larger , taller , farther away or otherwise by adjusting the scale of objects in relation to the spectator , increasing or decreasing perceived depth when forced perspective is supposed to make an object appear farther away , the following method can be used : by constantly decreasing the scale of objects from expectancy and convention toward the farthest point from the spectator , an illusion is created that the scale of said objects is decreasing due to their distant location the technique takes advantage of the visual cues humans use to perceive depth such as angular size , aerial perspective , shading , and relative size in film , photography and art , perceived object distance is manipulated by altering fundamental monocular cues used to discern the depth of an object in the scene such as aerial perspective , blurring , relative size and lighting increasing the object 's distance from the audience makes an object appear smaller , its apparent size decreases as distance from the audience increases a person perceives the size of an object based on the size of the object 's image on the retina the larger the angle an object subtends , the larger the apparent size of the object using the monocular cue of aerial perspective , the eye uses the relative luminescence of objects in a scene to discern relative distance selectively blurring an object moves it out of its original visual plane without having to manually move the object once the audience becomes acquainted with the size of an object in proportion to the rest of the objects in a scene , the photographer or filmmaker can replace the object with a larger or smaller replica to change another part of the scene 's apparent size furthermore , he uses a blue tint on objects that should be farther away and redder tint to objects in the foreground one of the most notable examples of forced perspective being used to make the object appear smaller is the american adventure pavilion in epcot

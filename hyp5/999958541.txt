by placing a miniature model of a dinosaur close to the camera , the director may make the dinosaur look monstrously tall to the viewer , even though it is just closer to the camera forced perspective had been a feature of german silent films and citizen kane revived the practice forced perspective can be made more believable when environmental conditions obscure the difference in perspective early instances of forced perspective used in low-budget motion pictures showed objects that were clearly different from their surroundings : often blurred or at a different light level this means that a light source must be four times as bright to produce the same illuminance at an object twice as far away thus to create the illusion of a distant object being at the same distance as a near object and scaled accordingly , much more light is required when shooting with forced perspective , it 's important to have the aperture stopped down sufficiently to achieve proper dof ( depth of field ) , so that the foreground object and background are both sharp peter jackson 's film adaptations of the lord of the rings make extended use of forced perspective this , in a still shot , makes some characters ( dwarves and hobbits ) appear much smaller than others if the camera 's point of view were moved , then parallax would reveal the true relative positions of the characters in space this point of view is called the 'zero-parallax-point ' ( or front nodal point ) , and is approximated in practice as the centre of the entrance pupil portions of sets were mounted on movable platforms which would move precisely according to the movement of the camera , so that the optical illusion would be preserved at all times for the duration of the shot props around harry and his friends are of normal size , while seemingly identical props placed around hagrid are in fact smaller a character then interacts with the object or character , in the process showing that the viewer has been fooled and there is forced perspective in use the next cut shows that the character actually has a gargantuan wristwatch in the television version , larger than life props are used to make the caricatured waterman look just three feet tall or less blue , the creators used forced perspective to make the character of tucker 's baby , junior , look small the short-lived 2013 internet meme '' baby mugging '' used forced perspective to make babies look like they were inside items like mugs and teacups in architecture , a structure can be made to seem larger , taller , farther away or otherwise by adjusting the scale of objects in relation to the spectator , increasing or decreasing perceived depth this caused a difficulty for special effects technicians working on the movie ghostbusters ii , who had to back off on the amount of forced perspective used when replicating the statue for the movie so that their model ( which was photographed head-on ) would not look top-heavy solely manipulating angular size by moving objects closer and farther away can not fully trick the eye a painter can give the illusion of distance by adding blue or red tinting to the color of the object he is painting furthermore , he uses a blue tint on objects that should be farther away and redder tint to objects in the foreground one of the most notable examples of forced perspective being used to make the object appear smaller is the american adventure pavilion in epcot file : epcotusa.jpg the american adventure pavilion in epcot , also in walt disney world , uses forced perspective to make a five-story building appear to be two and a half stories

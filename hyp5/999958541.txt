an example of forced perspective is a scene in an action/adventure movie in which dinosaurs are threatening the heroes by placing a miniature model of a dinosaur close to the camera , the director may make the dinosaur look monstrously tall to the viewer , even though it is just closer to the camera kevin brownlow , david lean , p.209 movies , especially b-movies in the 1950s and 1960s , were produced on limited budgets and often featured forced perspective shots forced perspective can be made more believable when environmental conditions obscure the difference in perspective a downpour ( created in the studio ) draws much of the viewer 's attention away from the backdrop and extras , making the simulated perspective less noticeable early instances of forced perspective used in low-budget motion pictures showed objects that were clearly different from their surroundings : often blurred or at a different light level thus to create the illusion of a distant object being at the same distance as a near object and scaled accordingly , much more light is required when shooting with forced perspective , it 's important to have the aperture stopped down sufficiently to achieve proper dof ( depth of field ) , so that the foreground object and background are both sharp peter jackson 's film adaptations of the lord of the rings make extended use of forced perspective characters apparently standing next to each other would be displaced by several feet in depth from the camera this , in a still shot , makes some characters ( dwarves and hobbits ) appear much smaller than others portions of sets were mounted on movable platforms which would move precisely according to the movement of the camera , so that the optical illusion would be preserved at all times for the duration of the shot props around harry and his friends are of normal size , while seemingly identical props placed around hagrid are in fact smaller as with many film genres and effects , forced perspective can be used to visual gag effect the 1930 laurel and hardy movie brats used forced perspective to depict stan and ollie simultaneously as adults and as their own sons in the television version , larger than life props are used to make the caricatured waterman look just three feet tall or less tyzik , '' the headcrusher '' , who used forced perspective ( from his own point of view ) to '' crush '' other people 's heads between his fingers blue , the creators used forced perspective to make the character of tucker 's baby , junior , look small the short-lived 2013 internet meme '' baby mugging '' used forced perspective to make babies look like they were inside items like mugs and teacups in film , photography and art , perceived object distance is manipulated by altering fundamental monocular cues used to discern the depth of an object in the scene such as aerial perspective , blurring , relative size and lighting increasing the object 's distance from the audience makes an object appear smaller , its apparent size decreases as distance from the audience increases the larger the angle an object subtends , the larger the apparent size of the object two objects with different actual size have the same apparent size when they subtend the same angle using the monocular cue of aerial perspective , the eye uses the relative luminescence of objects in a scene to discern relative distance one of the most notable examples of forced perspective being used to make the object appear smaller is the american adventure pavilion in epcot

an example of forced perspective is a scene in an action/adventure movie in which dinosaurs are threatening the heroes forced perspective had been a feature of german silent films and citizen kane revived the practice forced perspective can be made more believable when environmental conditions obscure the difference in perspective early instances of forced perspective used in low-budget motion pictures showed objects that were clearly different from their surroundings : often blurred or at a different light level thus to create the illusion of a distant object being at the same distance as a near object and scaled accordingly , much more light is required when shooting with forced perspective , it 's important to have the aperture stopped down sufficiently to achieve proper dof ( depth of field ) , so that the foreground object and background are both sharp if the camera 's point of view were moved , then parallax would reveal the true relative positions of the characters in space even if the camera is just rotated , its point of view may move accidentally if the camera is not rotated about the correct point the same techniques were used in the harry potter movies to make the character hagrid look like a giant as with many film genres and effects , forced perspective can be used to visual gag effect typically , when an object or character is portrayed in a scene , its size is defined by its surroundings a character then interacts with the object or character , in the process showing that the viewer has been fooled and there is forced perspective in use tyzik , '' the headcrusher '' , who used forced perspective ( from his own point of view ) to '' crush '' other people 's heads between his fingers blue , the creators used forced perspective to make the character of tucker 's baby , junior , look small the short-lived 2013 internet meme '' baby mugging '' used forced perspective to make babies look like they were inside items like mugs and teacups in architecture , a structure can be made to seem larger , taller , farther away or otherwise by adjusting the scale of objects in relation to the spectator , increasing or decreasing perceived depth the technique takes advantage of the visual cues humans use to perceive depth such as angular size , aerial perspective , shading , and relative size using these monocular cues in concert with angular size , the eyes can perceive the distance of an object increasing the object 's distance from the audience makes an object appear smaller , its apparent size decreases as distance from the audience increases a person perceives the size of an object based on the size of the object 's image on the retina the larger the angle an object subtends , the larger the apparent size of the object using the monocular cue of aerial perspective , the eye uses the relative luminescence of objects in a scene to discern relative distance forced perspective has been employed to realize characters in film , such as hagrid , the half-giant in the harry potter series , and hobbits in the lord of the rings series his shading technique allows the audience to discern the distance between objects due to their relative distances from a stationary light source that illuminates the scene one of the most notable examples of forced perspective being used to make the object appear smaller is the american adventure pavilion in epcot

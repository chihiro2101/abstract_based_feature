in march 1964 , king paul died of cancer , and the 23-year-old constantine succeeded him as king king paul 's long-time prime minister konstantinos karamanlis regarded him partly responsible for his fall from leadership in 1963 the accession of constantine coincided with the recent election of centrist george papandreou as prime minister in february 1964 , which ended 11 years of right-wing rule by the national radical union ( ere ) greece was still feeling the effects of the civil war of 1944â€“49 between communists and monarchists , and society was strongly polarised between the royalist/conservative right and the liberal/socialist left it was hoped that the new young king and the new prime minister would be able to overcome past dissensions immediately , george papandreou assigned the defence portfolio to himself ; this caused alarm in the palace and the conservative security circles , which interpreted this move as an attempt by papandreou to control the army constantine refused to accept the self-appointment , and a new political issue resulted constantine proposed the appointment of any other person of the prime minister 's choosing as defence minister because , as the king argued , there was a conflict of interest : the prime minister 's son was allegedly involved in the scandal a short time after his resignation , constantine appointed a new government led by georgios athanasiadis-novas , who failed to ensure the confidence ( politics ) when stefanopoulos resigned in frustration , constantine appointed a caretaker government under ioannis paraskevopoulos , which called elections for may 1967 according to united states diplomat john day , the americans worried that , due to the old age of george papandreou , andreas papandreou would have a very powerful role in the next government the embassy responded negatively in principle , adding that '' us reaction to such a move can not be determined in advance but would depend on circumstances at time '' according to then-ambassador from the united states phillips talbot , after this communication , constantine met with the generals of the army , who promised the king that they would not take any action before the coming elections however , they were nervous by the proclamations of andreas papandreou and reserved to themselves the right to reconsider possible courses of action according to the results of the election panayotis kanellopoulos , the last legitimate prime minister of greece prior to the coup , acting as witness for the prosecution , at the junta trials in 1975 during metapolitefsi , testified how he was arrested by machine gun toting soldiers and transported to the palace to meet king constantine constantine organised a counter-coup , though no help or involvement of the united states was forthcoming since athens was effectively in the hands of the junta militarily , constantine decided to fly to the small northern city of kavala , east of thessaloniki the vague plan he and his advisors had conceived was to form a unit that would advance to thessaloniki ( greece 's second biggest city and unofficial capital of northern greece ) and take it realising that the countercoup had failed , constantine fled greece on board the royal plane , taking his family and hapless premier with him they landed in rome early in the morning of 14 december , where they remained in exile all through the rest of military rule ( although he continued as king until 1 june 1973 ) he said to the toronto star : i consider myself king of the hellenes and sole expression of legality in my country until the greek people freely decide otherwise they are frightened of the crown because it is a unifying force among the people with constantine abroad , colonel george papadopoulos illegally appointed himself prime-minister and general george zoitakis as regent over the next year the junta sent intermediaries to the king to negotiate the terms on which he might return to greece but constantine insisted on the full restoration of democracy under the existing constitution as a precondition , and george papadopoulos would not agree to this instead the regime illegally promulgated a new constitution in november 1968 , which retained the monarchy , but stripped it of its powers , and provided for a permanent regency until the king chose to accept the new order in may , officers of the largely royalist navy staged an abortive coup , although constantine himself was not involved on 24 july he declared his '' deep satisfaction with the initiative of the armed forces in overthrowing the dictatorial regime '' and welcomed the advent of karamanlis as prime minister following karamanlis ' resounding victory in the november 1974 parliamentary elections ( his new democracy party won 54.4 % of the vote ) , he called a referendum ( held on 8 december 1974 ) on whether greece would restore the monarchy or remain a republic instead he called on the greek people to vote '' according to their conscience '' the former king was not allowed by the government to return to greece to campaign on behalf of the benefits to greece of the constitutional monarchy in 1994 , the second government of andreas papandreou passed new legislation reversing the 1992 agreement and stripping constantine of his property in greece and his greek citizenship '' ''

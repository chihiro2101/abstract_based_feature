this caused alarm in the palace and the conservative security circles , which interpreted this move as an attempt by papandreou to control the army constantine refused to accept the self-appointment , and a new political issue resulted constantine proposed the appointment of any other person of the prime minister 's choosing as defence minister because , as the king argued , there was a conflict of interest : the prime minister 's son was allegedly involved in the scandal a short time after his resignation , constantine appointed a new government led by georgios athanasiadis-novas , who failed to ensure the confidence ( politics ) according to then-ambassador from the united states phillips talbot , after this communication , constantine met with the generals of the army , who promised the king that they would not take any action before the coming elections constantine later recounted that the officers of the tank platoons believed they were carrying out the coup under his orders he added that during the meeting he urged the king to use his status as commander-in-chief of the greek military to order loyal officers to crush the coup the vague plan he and his advisors had conceived was to form a unit that would advance to thessaloniki ( greece 's second biggest city and unofficial capital of northern greece ) and take it constantine also took with him premier kollias another of constantine 's generals effectively cut all communication between athens and the north they landed in rome early in the morning of 14 december , where they remained in exile all through the rest of military rule ( although he continued as king until 1 june 1973 ) he was never to return to greece as a reigning king he said to the toronto star : i consider myself king of the hellenes and sole expression of legality in my country until the greek people freely decide otherwise over the next year the junta sent intermediaries to the king to negotiate the terms on which he might return to greece but constantine insisted on the full restoration of democracy under the existing constitution as a precondition , and george papadopoulos would not agree to this the former king was not allowed by the government to return to greece to campaign on behalf of the benefits to greece of the constitutional monarchy the republic received overwhelming support by the centrist voters who condemned constantine for , among other things , swearing in the junta in 1967 they also blamed his reluctance to sever all ties with the junta once in exile , and the dismissal of the legitimately elected george papandreou administration ( apostasia of 1965 ) , the event which some believed led to the coup in 1994 , the second government of andreas papandreou passed new legislation reversing the 1992 agreement and stripping constantine of his property in greece and his greek citizenship constantine sued greece at the european court of human rights for €500 million in compensation for the seized property the greek government chose to pay out of the '' extraordinary natural disasters '' fund , but was not obliged by the court 's decision to return any lands ( the court of human rights awards only monetary compensation ) constantine , in turn , announced the creation of the anna maria foundation , to allocate the funds in question back to the greek people for use in '' extraordinary natural disasters '' and charitable causes following the abolition of the monarchy , constantine has repeatedly stated that he recognizes the republic , the laws and the constitution of greece he is co-president of honour of the international sailing federation with king harald v of norway , since 1994 the first volume of 'king constantine ' , 23 november 2015 ;

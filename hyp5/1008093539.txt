in march 1964 , king paul died of cancer , and the 23-year-old constantine succeeded him as king king paul 's long-time prime minister konstantinos karamanlis regarded him partly responsible for his fall from leadership in 1963 the accession of constantine coincided with the recent election of centrist george papandreou as prime minister in february 1964 , which ended 11 years of right-wing rule by the national radical union ( ere ) greece was still feeling the effects of the civil war of 1944â€“49 between communists and monarchists , and society was strongly polarised between the royalist/conservative right and the liberal/socialist left it was hoped that the new young king and the new prime minister would be able to overcome past dissensions the conservative establishment feared the rising influence of papandreou 's left-leaning son andreas , and the outbreak of the purported aspida scandal seemed to confirm their suspicions the name of andreas papandreou was implicated in the case , and when the defence minister , petros garoufalias tried to form a committee of inquiry into the alleged scandal , the prime minister forced his resignation constantine proposed the appointment of any other person of the prime minister 's choosing as defence minister because , as the king argued , there was a conflict of interest : the prime minister 's son was allegedly involved in the scandal a short time after his resignation , constantine appointed a new government led by georgios athanasiadis-novas , who failed to ensure the confidence ( politics ) this appointment , which became known as the '' royal coup '' , evoked much criticism as being unconstitutional when stefanopoulos resigned in frustration , constantine appointed a caretaker government under ioannis paraskevopoulos , which called elections for may 1967 according to then-ambassador from the united states phillips talbot , after this communication , constantine met with the generals of the army , who promised the king that they would not take any action before the coming elections however , they were nervous by the proclamations of andreas papandreou and reserved to themselves the right to reconsider possible courses of action according to the results of the election later in the day , he went to the ministry of national defence , where all coup leaders were gathered , and had a discussion with kanellopoulos and with leading generals time magazine ( 11 august 1975 ) from the outset , the relationship between constantine and the regime of the colonels was an uneasy one constantine organised a counter-coup , though no help or involvement of the united states was forthcoming constantine also took with him premier kollias constantine was well received in kavala which , militarily , was under the command of a general loyal to him the air force and navy , both strongly royalist and not involved in the 1967 coup , immediately declared for him and mobilised realising that the countercoup had failed , constantine fled greece on board the royal plane , taking his family and hapless premier with him he was never to return to greece as a reigning king constantine continued to watch events from abroad he said to the toronto star : i consider myself king of the hellenes and sole expression of legality in my country until the greek people freely decide otherwise instead the regime illegally promulgated a new constitution in november 1968 , which retained the monarchy , but stripped it of its powers , and provided for a permanent regency until the king chose to accept the new order in may , officers of the largely royalist navy staged an abortive coup , although constantine himself was not involved george papadopoulos retaliated by declaring greece a republic ( 1 june ) , a decision which was confirmed by a plebiscite on 29 july in july 1974 , the events in cyprus led to the downfall of the military regime , and karamanlis returned from exile to become prime minister the 1973 republican constitution was regarded as illegitimate , and the new administration issued a constitutional decree restoring the 1952 constitution on 24 july he declared his '' deep satisfaction with the initiative of the armed forces in overthrowing the dictatorial regime '' and welcomed the advent of karamanlis as prime minister the left voted overwhelmingly for the republic because the former king was perceived by them as having engaged in political interference far beyond the scope of the monarchical prerogative they also objected to the perceived influence exercised by members of the royal family who had no constitutional role in the political life of the country ; the former king 's mother , queen frederica , being a case in point the republic received overwhelming support by the centrist voters who condemned constantine for , among other things , swearing in the junta in 1967 in 1992 he concluded an agreement with the conservative government of prime minister constantine mitsotakis , ceding most of his land in greece to a non-profit foundation in exchange for the former palace of tatoi , near athens , and the right to export a number of movables from greece until 1994 , constantine 's official greek passport identified him as '' constantine , former king of the hellenes '' : knight of the order of the seraphim aloveofroyalhistory : queen rania of jordan on the arm of king constantine of greece , 2010 greek scout association silver phoenix award ( 1959 ) scout association of japan golden pheasant award ( 1964 ) reinanzaka-sc.o.oo7.jp/kiroku/documents/20140523-3-kiji-list.pdf international sailing federation beppe croce trophy ( 2010 )

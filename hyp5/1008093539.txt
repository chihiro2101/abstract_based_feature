in march 1964 , king paul died of cancer , and the 23-year-old constantine succeeded him as king prior to this , constantine had already been appointed as regent for his ailing father king paul 's long-time prime minister konstantinos karamanlis regarded him partly responsible for his fall from leadership in 1963 however , due to his youth , he was also perceived as a promise of change the accession of constantine coincided with the recent election of centrist george papandreou as prime minister in february 1964 , which ended 11 years of right-wing rule by the national radical union ( ere ) greece was still feeling the effects of the civil war of 1944–49 between communists and monarchists , and society was strongly polarised between the royalist/conservative right and the liberal/socialist left it was hoped that the new young king and the new prime minister would be able to overcome past dissensions initially , relations between the king and papandreou seemed good , but by 1965 , they had deteriorated the conservative establishment feared the rising influence of papandreou 's left-leaning son andreas , and the outbreak of the purported aspida scandal seemed to confirm their suspicions a short time after his resignation , constantine appointed a new government led by georgios athanasiadis-novas , who failed to ensure the confidence ( politics ) when stefanopoulos resigned in frustration , constantine appointed a caretaker government under ioannis paraskevopoulos , which called elections for may 1967 according to then-ambassador from the united states phillips talbot , after this communication , constantine met with the generals of the army , who promised the king that they would not take any action before the coming elections however , they were nervous by the proclamations of andreas papandreou and reserved to themselves the right to reconsider possible courses of action according to the results of the election he added that during the meeting he urged the king to use his status as commander-in-chief of the greek military to order loyal officers to crush the coup the king finally decided to launch his counter-coup on 13 december 1967 since athens was effectively in the hands of the junta militarily , constantine decided to fly to the small northern city of kavala , east of thessaloniki constantine also took with him premier kollias constantine was well received in kavala which , militarily , was under the command of a general loyal to him however , the king 's plans were overly bureaucratic , naïvely supposing that orders from a commanding general would automatically be followed further , the king was obsessive about avoiding '' bloodshed '' even where the junta would be the attacker realising that the countercoup had failed , constantine fled greece on board the royal plane , taking his family and hapless premier with him they landed in rome early in the morning of 14 december , where they remained in exile all through the rest of military rule ( although he continued as king until 1 june 1973 ) he was never to return to greece as a reigning king he said to the toronto star : i consider myself king of the hellenes and sole expression of legality in my country until the greek people freely decide otherwise with constantine abroad , colonel george papadopoulos illegally appointed himself prime-minister and general george zoitakis as regent this standoff continued until 1972 , when george papadopoulos illegally dismissed george zoitakis and appointed himself regent in june 1973 , george papadopoulos condemned constantine as '' a collaborator with foreign forces and with murderers '' and accused him of '' pursuing ambitions to become a political leader '' constantine refused to accept the outcome in july 1974 , the events in cyprus led to the downfall of the military regime , and karamanlis returned from exile to become prime minister they also objected to the perceived influence exercised by members of the royal family who had no constitutional role in the political life of the country ; the former king 's mother , queen frederica , being a case in point the republic received overwhelming support by the centrist voters who condemned constantine for , among other things , swearing in the junta in 1967 they also blamed his reluctance to sever all ties with the junta once in exile , and the dismissal of the legitimately elected george papandreou administration ( apostasia of 1965 ) , the event which some believed led to the coup constantine , speaking from london , freely admitted his past mistakes the court decision also ruled that constantine 's human rights were not violated by the greek state 's decision not to grant him greek citizenship and passport unless he adopts a surname the international olympic committee continues to refer to constantine as his majesty king constantine : knight of the order of the seraphim aloveofroyalhistory : queen rania of jordan on the arm of king constantine of greece , 2010

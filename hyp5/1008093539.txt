in march 1964 , king paul died of cancer , and the 23-year-old constantine succeeded him as king king paul 's long-time prime minister konstantinos karamanlis regarded him partly responsible for his fall from leadership in 1963 the accession of constantine coincided with the recent election of centrist george papandreou as prime minister in february 1964 , which ended 11 years of right-wing rule by the national radical union ( ere ) greece was still feeling the effects of the civil war of 1944–49 between communists and monarchists , and society was strongly polarised between the royalist/conservative right and the liberal/socialist left it was hoped that the new young king and the new prime minister would be able to overcome past dissensions the name of andreas papandreou was implicated in the case , and when the defence minister , petros garoufalias tried to form a committee of inquiry into the alleged scandal , the prime minister forced his resignation immediately , george papandreou assigned the defence portfolio to himself ; this caused alarm in the palace and the conservative security circles , which interpreted this move as an attempt by papandreou to control the army constantine refused to accept the self-appointment , and a new political issue resulted constantine proposed the appointment of any other person of the prime minister 's choosing as defence minister because , as the king argued , there was a conflict of interest : the prime minister 's son was allegedly involved in the scandal constantine next appointed some of papandreou 's dissidents , known as the july apostates and led by stefanos stefanopoulos , to form a government of '' king 's men '' , which lasted until december 1966 , amidst mounting strikes and protests , supported by the right-wing ere according to united states diplomat john day , the americans worried that , due to the old age of george papandreou , andreas papandreou would have a very powerful role in the next government the embassy responded negatively in principle , adding that '' us reaction to such a move can not be determined in advance but would depend on circumstances at time '' according to then-ambassador from the united states phillips talbot , after this communication , constantine met with the generals of the army , who promised the king that they would not take any action before the coming elections however , they were nervous by the proclamations of andreas papandreou and reserved to themselves the right to reconsider possible courses of action according to the results of the election the coup leaders met constantine at his residence in tatoi , which was surrounded by tanks to prevent resistance he added that during the meeting he urged the king to use his status as commander-in-chief of the greek military to order loyal officers to crush the coup constantine organised a counter-coup , though no help or involvement of the united states was forthcoming the king finally decided to launch his counter-coup on 13 december 1967 since athens was effectively in the hands of the junta militarily , constantine decided to fly to the small northern city of kavala , east of thessaloniki constantine also took with him premier kollias however , the king 's plans were overly bureaucratic , naïvely supposing that orders from a commanding general would automatically be followed realising that the countercoup had failed , constantine fled greece on board the royal plane , taking his family and hapless premier with him they landed in rome early in the morning of 14 december , where they remained in exile all through the rest of military rule ( although he continued as king until 1 june 1973 ) i fully expected that the ( military ) regime would depose me eventually with constantine abroad , colonel george papadopoulos illegally appointed himself prime-minister and general george zoitakis as regent instead the regime illegally promulgated a new constitution in november 1968 , which retained the monarchy , but stripped it of its powers , and provided for a permanent regency until the king chose to accept the new order this standoff continued until 1972 , when george papadopoulos illegally dismissed george zoitakis and appointed himself regent in may , officers of the largely royalist navy staged an abortive coup , although constantine himself was not involved george papadopoulos retaliated by declaring greece a republic ( 1 june ) , a decision which was confirmed by a plebiscite on 29 july in july 1974 , the events in cyprus led to the downfall of the military regime , and karamanlis returned from exile to become prime minister following karamanlis ' resounding victory in the november 1974 parliamentary elections ( his new democracy party won 54.4 % of the vote ) , he called a referendum ( held on 8 december 1974 ) on whether greece would restore the monarchy or remain a republic constantine sued greece at the european court of human rights for €500 million in compensation for the seized property until 1994 , constantine 's official greek passport identified him as '' constantine , former king of the hellenes '' the law that mr papandreou passed basically says that he considers that i am not greek and that my family was greek only so long as we were exercising the responsibilities of sovereign , and i had to go out and acquire a name recipient of the ruby jubilee medal of queen margrethe ii photographic image : knight of the order of the seraphim aloveofroyalhistory : queen rania of jordan on the arm of king constantine of greece , 2010

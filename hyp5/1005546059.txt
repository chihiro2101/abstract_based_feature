evaluation functions in chess consist of a material balance term that dominates the evaluation , plus a set of positional terms usually totaling no more than the value of a pawn , though in some positions the positional terms can get much larger , such as when checkmate is imminent an evaluation function also implicitly encodes the value of the right to move , which can vary from a small fraction of a pawn to win or loss an evaluation function for chess might take the form c 1 material + c 2 mobility + c 3 king safety + c 4 center control + c 5 pawn structure + c 6 king tropism + the conventional values are : queen 9 , rook 5 ; knight or bishop 3 ; pawn 1 ; the king is assigned an arbitrarily large value , usually larger than the total value of all the other pieces this ratio is usually implemented as an exchange-down bonus according to the rule of thumb : 'trade pieces but not pawns when ahead , and vice versa when behind ' the mobility score is the number of legal moves available to a player , or alternately the sum of the number of spaces attacked or defended by each piece , including spaces occupied by friendly or opposing pieces effective mobility , or the number of '' safe '' spaces a piece may move to , may also be taken into account evaluation functions typically contain dozens to hundreds of individual terms , and the evaluation of a position typically ranges from plus or minus a small fraction of a pawn toward this end , exemplary positions from master games are employed , and the efficacy of the evaluation function measured by the percentage of moves selected that agree with the choices of the masters an important technique in evaluation since at least the early 1990s , is the use of piece-square tables ( also called piece-value tables ) for evaluation in master level programs and beyond , the tables are constructed from a composite of positions occupied by the pieces in master games , adjusted for the application evaluation functions in go take into account both territory controlled , influence of stones , number of prisoners and life and death of groups on the board .

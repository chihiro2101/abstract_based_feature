evaluation functions in chess consist of a material balance term that dominates the evaluation , plus a set of positional terms usually totaling no more than the value of a pawn , though in some positions the positional terms can get much larger , such as when checkmate is imminent an evaluation function also implicitly encodes the value of the right to move , which can vary from a small fraction of a pawn to win or loss an evaluation function for chess might take the form c 1 material + c 2 mobility + c 3 king safety + c 4 center control + c 5 pawn structure + c 6 king tropism + the conventional values are : queen 9 , rook 5 ; knight or bishop 3 ; pawn 1 ; the king is assigned an arbitrarily large value , usually larger than the total value of all the other pieces the king safety score is a set of bonuses and penalties assessed for the location of the king and the configuration of pawns and pieces adjacent to or in front of the king , and opposing pieces bearing on spaces around the king king tropism is a bonus for closeness ( or penalty for distance ) of certain pieces , especially queens and knights , to the opposing king , are n't necessarily constant - they are application coefficients that can vary with stage of game ( opening , middle game , endgame ) , pieces on the board ( e.g the focus , and therefore the relevant terms and weights of the evaluation function , differ depending on the stage of the game evaluation functions typically contain dozens to hundreds of individual terms , and the evaluation of a position typically ranges from plus or minus a small fraction of a pawn toward this end , exemplary positions from master games are employed , and the efficacy of the evaluation function measured by the percentage of moves selected that agree with the choices of the masters chess machines like leela chess zero have a substantively different search and evaluation paradigm than the conventional alphabeta/minimax scheme with leaf node evaluation evaluation functions in go take into account both territory controlled , influence of stones , number of prisoners and life and death of groups on the board .

evaluation functions in chess consist of a material balance term that dominates the evaluation , plus a set of positional terms usually totaling no more than the value of a pawn , though in some positions the positional terms can get much larger , such as when checkmate is imminent an evaluation function also implicitly encodes the value of the right to move , which can vary from a small fraction of a pawn to win or loss in the endgame , it is possible to construct positions where whoever moves , wins , though the position is otherwise in balance ; it is also possible to construct positions where whoever must move , loses ( zugzwang ) an evaluation function for chess might take the form c 1 material + c 2 mobility + c 3 king safety + c 4 center control + c 5 pawn structure + c 6 king tropism + not just the absolute value of the material , but also the ratio between white and black material matters : sacrificing a pawn in the opening may confer a positional advantage ( the material ratio is scarcely affected ) , but the plus of a pawn in a king and pawn end game is usually sufficient to win ( ratio of material is large ) effective mobility , or the number of '' safe '' spaces a piece may move to , may also be taken into account the king safety score is a set of bonuses and penalties assessed for the location of the king and the configuration of pawns and pieces adjacent to or in front of the king , and opposing pieces bearing on spaces around the king the focus , and therefore the relevant terms and weights of the evaluation function , differ depending on the stage of the game evaluation functions typically contain dozens to hundreds of individual terms , and the evaluation of a position typically ranges from plus or minus a small fraction of a pawn an important technique in evaluation since at least the early 1990s , is the use of piece-square tables ( also called piece-value tables ) for evaluation in master level programs and beyond , the tables are constructed from a composite of positions occupied by the pieces in master games , adjusted for the application chess machines like leela chess zero have a substantively different search and evaluation paradigm than the conventional alphabeta/minimax scheme with leaf node evaluation

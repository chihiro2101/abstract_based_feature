evaluation functions in chess consist of a material balance term that dominates the evaluation , plus a set of positional terms usually totaling no more than the value of a pawn , though in some positions the positional terms can get much larger , such as when checkmate is imminent an evaluation function for chess might take the form c 1 material + c 2 mobility + c 3 king safety + c 4 center control + c 5 pawn structure + c 6 king tropism + the conventional values are : queen 9 , rook 5 ; knight or bishop 3 ; pawn 1 ; the king is assigned an arbitrarily large value , usually larger than the total value of all the other pieces not just the absolute value of the material , but also the ratio between white and black material matters : sacrificing a pawn in the opening may confer a positional advantage ( the material ratio is scarcely affected ) , but the plus of a pawn in a king and pawn end game is usually sufficient to win ( ratio of material is large ) ' the mobility score is the number of legal moves available to a player , or alternately the sum of the number of spaces attacked or defended by each piece , including spaces occupied by friendly or opposing pieces the king safety score is a set of bonuses and penalties assessed for the location of the king and the configuration of pawns and pieces adjacent to or in front of the king , and opposing pieces bearing on spaces around the king pawn structure is a set of penalties and bonuses for various strengths and weaknesses in pawn structure , such as penalties for doubled and isolated pawns king tropism is a bonus for closeness ( or penalty for distance ) of certain pieces , especially queens and knights , to the opposing king , are n't necessarily constant - they are application coefficients that can vary with stage of game ( opening , middle game , endgame ) , pieces on the board ( e.g in the opening , the dominant considerations are development of the minor pieces , castling and king safety , and control of the center in mating situations , the relevant factors are distance of the target king from the edge or corner of the board , and proximity of the king and mating pieces to the opposing king for example , knights are seldom found on left and right edges of the board in master games , so one may assign a penalty value to those spaces of the knight piece-square table proportionate to how seldom a knight is found there in master games

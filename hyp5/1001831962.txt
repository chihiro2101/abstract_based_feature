( not to be confused with the nobel laureate ) published an article describing the production of mif in virus-infected allantoic membrane and kidney cells , showing its production is not limited to immune cells ogawa described the early acting growth factors , intermediate acting growth factors and late acting growth factors classic hormones circulate in nanomolar ( 10 m ) concentrations that usually vary by less than one order of magnitude the widespread distribution of cellular sources for cytokines may be a feature that differentiates them from hormones virtually all nucleated cells , but especially endo/epithelial cells and resident macrophages ( many near the interface with the external environment ) are potent producers of il-1 , il-6 , and tnf-α a contributing factor to the difficulty of distinguishing cytokines from hormones is that some immunomodulating effects of cytokines are systemic rather than local cytokines have been classed as lymphokines , interleukins , and chemokines , based on their presumed function , cell of secretion , or target of action because cytokines are characterised by considerable redundancy and pleiotropy , such distinctions , allowing for exceptions , are obsolete the term interleukin was initially used by researchers for those cytokines whose presumed targets are principally white blood cells ( leukocytes ) the cysteine knot cytokines include members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily , including tgf-β1 , tgf-β2 and tgf-β3 the il-17 family , which has yet to be completely characterized , though member cytokines have a specific effect in promoting proliferation of t-cells that cause cytotoxic effects a classification that proves more useful in clinical and experimental practice outside of structural biology divides immunological cytokines into those that enhance cellular immune responses , type 1 ( tnfα , ifn-γ , etc in this regard , and also because the redundancy and pleomorphism of cytokines are , in fact , a consequence of their homologous receptors , many authorities think that a classification of cytokine receptors would be more clinically and experimentally useful immunoglobulin superfamily , which are ubiquitously present throughout several cells and tissues of the vertebrate body , and share structural homology with immunoglobulins ( antibody ) , cell adhesion molecules , and even some cytokines cytokines are characterized by considerable redundancy , in that many cytokines appear to share similar functions it seems to be a paradox that cytokines binding to antibody have a stronger immune effect than the cytokine alone '' ( 719 ) cytokines are crucial for fighting off infections and in other immune responses normal tissue integrity is preserved by feedback interactions between diverse cell types mediated by adhesion molecules and secreted cytokines ; disruption of normal feedback mechanisms in cancer threatens tissue integrity

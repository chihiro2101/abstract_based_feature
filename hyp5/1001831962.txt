in 1969 , dudley dumonde proposed the term '' lymphokine '' to describe proteins secreted from lymphocytes and later , proteins derived from macrophages and monocytes in culture were called '' monokines '' ( not to be confused with the nobel laureate ) published an article describing the production of mif in virus-infected allantoic membrane and kidney cells , showing its production is not limited to immune cells ogawa described the early acting growth factors , intermediate acting growth factors and late acting growth factors classic hormones circulate in nanomolar ( 10 m ) concentrations that usually vary by less than one order of magnitude in contrast , some cytokines ( such as il-6 ) circulate in picomolar ( 10 m ) concentrations that can increase up to 1,000 times during trauma or infection the widespread distribution of cellular sources for cytokines may be a feature that differentiates them from hormones virtually all nucleated cells , but especially endo/epithelial cells and resident macrophages ( many near the interface with the external environment ) are potent producers of il-1 , il-6 , and tnf-α a contributing factor to the difficulty of distinguishing cytokines from hormones is that some immunomodulating effects of cytokines are systemic rather than local for instance , to accurately utilize hormone terminology , cytokines may be autocrine or paracrine in nature , and chemotaxis , chemokinesis and endocrine as a pyrogen essentially , cytokines are not limited to their immunomodulatory status as molecules cytokines have been classed as lymphokines , interleukins , and chemokines , based on their presumed function , cell of secretion , or target of action the term interleukin was initially used by researchers for those cytokines whose presumed targets are principally white blood cells ( leukocytes ) lymphokines : produced by lymphocytes monokines : produced exclusively by monocytes interferons : involved in antiviral responses colony stimulating factors : support the growth of cells in semisolid media chemokines : mediate chemoattraction ( chemotaxis ) between cells the cysteine knot cytokines include members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily , including tgf-β1 , tgf-β2 and tgf-β3 a classification that proves more useful in clinical and experimental practice outside of structural biology divides immunological cytokines into those that enhance cellular immune responses , type 1 ( tnfα , ifn-γ , etc the fact that cytokines themselves trigger the release of other cytokines and also lead to increased oxidative stress makes them important in chronic inflammation , as well as other immunoresponses , such as fever and acute phase proteins of the liver ( il-1,6,12 , ifn-a ) cytokines are characterized by considerable redundancy , in that many cytokines appear to share similar functions saito explains '' much evidence has suggested that cytokines and chemokines play a very important role in the reproduction , i.e

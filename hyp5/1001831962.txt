( not to be confused with the nobel laureate ) published an article describing the production of mif in virus-infected allantoic membrane and kidney cells , showing its production is not limited to immune cells in contrast , some cytokines ( such as il-6 ) circulate in picomolar ( 10 m ) concentrations that can increase up to 1,000 times during trauma or infection the widespread distribution of cellular sources for cytokines may be a feature that differentiates them from hormones virtually all nucleated cells , but especially endo/epithelial cells and resident macrophages ( many near the interface with the external environment ) are potent producers of il-1 , il-6 , and tnf-α a contributing factor to the difficulty of distinguishing cytokines from hormones is that some immunomodulating effects of cytokines are systemic rather than local the term interleukin was initially used by researchers for those cytokines whose presumed targets are principally white blood cells ( leukocytes ) lymphokines : produced by lymphocytes monokines : produced exclusively by monocytes interferons : involved in antiviral responses colony stimulating factors : support the growth of cells in semisolid media chemokines : mediate chemoattraction ( chemotaxis ) between cells structural homogeneity has been able to partially distinguish between cytokines that do not demonstrate a considerable degree of redundancy so that they can be classified into four types : the four-helix bundle family : member cytokines have three-dimensional structures with a bundle of four α-helices the cysteine knot cytokines include members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily , including tgf-β1 , tgf-β2 and tgf-β3 the il-17 family , which has yet to be completely characterized , though member cytokines have a specific effect in promoting proliferation of t-cells that cause cytotoxic effects the fact that cytokines themselves trigger the release of other cytokines and also lead to increased oxidative stress makes them important in chronic inflammation , as well as other immunoresponses , such as fever and acute phase proteins of the liver ( il-1,6,12 , ifn-a ) in recent years , the cytokine receptors have come to demand the attention of more investigators than cytokines themselves , partly because of their remarkable characteristics and partly because a deficiency of cytokine receptors has now been directly linked to certain debilitating immunodeficiency states immunoglobulin superfamily , which are ubiquitously present throughout several cells and tissues of the vertebrate body , and share structural homology with immunoglobulins ( antibody ) , cell adhesion molecules , and even some cytokines hemopoietic growth factor ( type 1 ) family , whose members have certain conserved motifs in their extracellular amino-acid domain the effect of a particular cytokine on a given cell depends on the cytokine , its extracellular abundance , the presence and abundance of the complementary receptor on the cell surface , and downstream signals activated by receptor binding ; these last two factors can vary by cell type it seems to be a paradox that cytokines binding to antibody have a stronger immune effect than the cytokine alone it has been shown that inflammatory cytokines cause an il-10-dependent inhibition of t-cell expansion and function by up-regulating pd-1 levels on monocytes , which leads to il-10 production by monocytes after binding of pd-1 by pd-l deaths were weighted more heavily towards people with healthy immune systems , because of their ability to produce stronger immune responses , with dramatic increases in cytokine levels

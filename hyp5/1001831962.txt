in 1969 , dudley dumonde proposed the term '' lymphokine '' to describe proteins secreted from lymphocytes and later , proteins derived from macrophages and monocytes in culture were called '' monokines '' ( not to be confused with the nobel laureate ) published an article describing the production of mif in virus-infected allantoic membrane and kidney cells , showing its production is not limited to immune cells the widespread distribution of cellular sources for cytokines may be a feature that differentiates them from hormones virtually all nucleated cells , but especially endo/epithelial cells and resident macrophages ( many near the interface with the external environment ) are potent producers of il-1 , il-6 , and tnf-α a contributing factor to the difficulty of distinguishing cytokines from hormones is that some immunomodulating effects of cytokines are systemic rather than local cytokines have been classed as lymphokines , interleukins , and chemokines , based on their presumed function , cell of secretion , or target of action the term interleukin was initially used by researchers for those cytokines whose presumed targets are principally white blood cells ( leukocytes ) ) , and those that enhance antibody responses , type 2 ( tgf-β , il-4 , il-10 , il-13 , etc the fact that cytokines themselves trigger the release of other cytokines and also lead to increased oxidative stress makes them important in chronic inflammation , as well as other immunoresponses , such as fever and acute phase proteins of the liver ( il-1,6,12 , ifn-a ) in recent years , the cytokine receptors have come to demand the attention of more investigators than cytokines themselves , partly because of their remarkable characteristics and partly because a deficiency of cytokine receptors has now been directly linked to certain debilitating immunodeficiency states immunoglobulin superfamily , which are ubiquitously present throughout several cells and tissues of the vertebrate body , and share structural homology with immunoglobulins ( antibody ) , cell adhesion molecules , and even some cytokines hemopoietic growth factor ( type 1 ) family , whose members have certain conserved motifs in their extracellular amino-acid domain the il-2 receptor belongs to this chain , whose γ-chain ( common to several other cytokines ) deficiency is directly responsible for the x-linked form of severe combined immunodeficiency ( x-scid ) this may include the upregulation and/or downregulation of several genes and their transcription factors , resulting in the production of other cytokines , an increase in the number of surface receptors for other molecules , or the suppression of their own effect by enzyme inhibitor it seems to be a paradox that cytokines binding to antibody have a stronger immune effect than the cytokine alone saito explains '' much evidence has suggested that cytokines and chemokines play a very important role in the reproduction , i.e '' ( 719 ) cytokines are crucial for fighting off infections and in other immune responses deaths were weighted more heavily towards people with healthy immune systems , because of their ability to produce stronger immune responses , with dramatic increases in cytokine levels

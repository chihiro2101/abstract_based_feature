( not to be confused with the nobel laureate ) published an article describing the production of mif in virus-infected allantoic membrane and kidney cells , showing its production is not limited to immune cells ogawa described the early acting growth factors , intermediate acting growth factors and late acting growth factors in contrast , some cytokines ( such as il-6 ) circulate in picomolar ( 10 m ) concentrations that can increase up to 1,000 times during trauma or infection the widespread distribution of cellular sources for cytokines may be a feature that differentiates them from hormones virtually all nucleated cells , but especially endo/epithelial cells and resident macrophages ( many near the interface with the external environment ) are potent producers of il-1 , il-6 , and tnf-α a contributing factor to the difficulty of distinguishing cytokines from hormones is that some immunomodulating effects of cytokines are systemic rather than local for instance , to accurately utilize hormone terminology , cytokines may be autocrine or paracrine in nature , and chemotaxis , chemokinesis and endocrine as a pyrogen the term interleukin was initially used by researchers for those cytokines whose presumed targets are principally white blood cells ( leukocytes ) it is now used largely for designation of newer cytokine molecules and bears little relation to their presumed function the il-1 family , which primarily includes il-1 and il-18 the cysteine knot cytokines include members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily , including tgf-β1 , tgf-β2 and tgf-β3 ) , and those that enhance antibody responses , type 2 ( tgf-β , il-4 , il-10 , il-13 , etc a key focus of interest has been that cytokines in one of these two sub-sets tend to inhibit the effects of those in the other hemopoietic growth factor ( type 1 ) family , whose members have certain conserved motifs in their extracellular amino-acid domain 7tm receptor family , the ubiquitous receptor type of the animal kingdom it seems to be a paradox that cytokines binding to antibody have a stronger immune effect than the cytokine alone adverse effects of cytokines have been linked to many disease states and conditions ranging from schizophrenia , major depression and alzheimer 's disease to cancer interleukin 11 ( il-11 ) , used to treat thrombocytopenia in cancer patients

in 1969 , dudley dumonde proposed the term '' lymphokine '' to describe proteins secreted from lymphocytes and later , proteins derived from macrophages and monocytes in culture were called '' monokines '' ( not to be confused with the nobel laureate ) published an article describing the production of mif in virus-infected allantoic membrane and kidney cells , showing its production is not limited to immune cells ogawa described the early acting growth factors , intermediate acting growth factors and late acting growth factors classic hormones circulate in nanomolar ( 10 m ) concentrations that usually vary by less than one order of magnitude in contrast , some cytokines ( such as il-6 ) circulate in picomolar ( 10 m ) concentrations that can increase up to 1,000 times during trauma or infection virtually all nucleated cells , but especially endo/epithelial cells and resident macrophages ( many near the interface with the external environment ) are potent producers of il-1 , il-6 , and tnf-α a contributing factor to the difficulty of distinguishing cytokines from hormones is that some immunomodulating effects of cytokines are systemic rather than local for instance , to accurately utilize hormone terminology , cytokines may be autocrine or paracrine in nature , and chemotaxis , chemokinesis and endocrine as a pyrogen cytokines have been classed as lymphokines , interleukins , and chemokines , based on their presumed function , cell of secretion , or target of action the term interleukin was initially used by researchers for those cytokines whose presumed targets are principally white blood cells ( leukocytes ) lymphokines : produced by lymphocytes monokines : produced exclusively by monocytes interferons : involved in antiviral responses colony stimulating factors : support the growth of cells in semisolid media chemokines : mediate chemoattraction ( chemotaxis ) between cells the il-17 family , which has yet to be completely characterized , though member cytokines have a specific effect in promoting proliferation of t-cells that cause cytotoxic effects ) , and those that enhance antibody responses , type 2 ( tgf-β , il-4 , il-10 , il-13 , etc cytokines also play a role in anti-inflammatory pathways and are a possible therapeutic treatment for pathological pain from inflammation or peripheral nerve injury in this regard , and also because the redundancy and pleomorphism of cytokines are , in fact , a consequence of their homologous receptors , many authorities think that a classification of cytokine receptors would be more clinically and experimentally useful immunoglobulin superfamily , which are ubiquitously present throughout several cells and tissues of the vertebrate body , and share structural homology with immunoglobulins ( antibody ) , cell adhesion molecules , and even some cytokines it seems to be a paradox that cytokines binding to antibody have a stronger immune effect than the cytokine alone deaths were weighted more heavily towards people with healthy immune systems , because of their ability to produce stronger immune responses , with dramatic increases in cytokine levels

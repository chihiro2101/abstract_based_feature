a man named casaubon casaubon 's name refers to classical scholar isaac casaubon and also evokes a scholar character in george eliot 's middlemarch in 1970s milan , casaubon is studying the knights templar when he meets belbo and his colleague diotallevi belbo works as an editor in a publishing house and invites casaubon to review a manuscript about the templars the manuscript , by a colonel ardenti , claims he discovered a secret plan of the templars to take over the world ardenti mysteriously vanishes after meeting with belbo and casaubon casaubon moves to brazil to pursue a relationship with a woman named amparo and meets agliè , an elderly man who implies that he is the mystical count of st casaubon 's relationship with amparo falls apart after attending an umbanda rite and he returns to milan , where he is hired by belbo 's employer , mr belbo , diotallevi and casaubon become submerged in occult manuscripts that draw flimsy connections between historical events , and have the idea to develop their own as a game using belbo 's personal computer , with abulafia and ardenti 's manuscript as a foundation , the three create what they call '' the plan '' using a program that rearranges text at random belbo discusses the plan with agliè and claims to be in possession of a templar map of the telluric currents ; agliè demands to see it and is refused casaubon goes to belbo 's apartment and reads his personal files , and goes to paris and foucault 's pendulum to see agliè and his associates belbo is questioned but he refuses to reveal what he knows , inciting a riot during which belbo is hanged from foucault 's pendulum casaubon meditates on events and is resigned to capture by the tres , and he will follow belbo 's lead and tell them nothing he realizes that much of belbo 's behavior and possibly his creation of the plan and even his death was inspired by belbo 's desire to recapture that lost meaning these passages are often eccentrically written , and deal in most part with belbo 's childhood , his constant sense of failure , and his obsession with lorenza my answer is that dan brown is one of the characters in my novel foucault 's pendulum , which is about people who start believing in occult stuff

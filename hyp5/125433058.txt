i have a question about np-complete problems this problem is left as an exercise by the reader : ) seriously , most of them are probably np-complete , some are n't -- user : robert merkel -- -- what are the largest moons in the solar system ? a few are larger than mercury , no ? ( posted sept it 'd be nice if someone could clarify some other things , though , e.g : 1 ) what powers the nyse employee has over the stock she 's managing , and 2 ) how the traders actually on the nyse floor connect back to people that invest without physically going to nyse user : sjc -- -- 20020912 i would like the history behind the canadian expression '' canuck '' -- heron -- -- here 's a question that any encyclopedia worth its salt must answer : why do dogs eat other dogs ' poop ? this has been bothering me for a long time next question ? ( indeed ! : - ) but what explains this moronic behavior ? ) the real answer is apparently '' several possible reasons , including copying their mother , copying their owner , or just because they like the taste '' -- tarquin 01:36 aug 27 , 2002 ( pdt ) potential difference is a pedantic term for what normal people call a voltage if somebody one day replaced the si system with another , then the volt would become obsolete , and '' potential difference '' would be measured in fnuts or whatever if you have a battery which gives you a higher voltage , then every electron moving between the poles of the battery will be able to do more work ( like giving you a brighter lamp ) when the battery is fresh , its internal resistance is low , so the voltage across the load is almost equal to that of the battery 's internal voltage source measuring the voltage of a battery with no load ( called its open-circuit voltage ) tells you very little about its state of charge as it runs down , its on-load voltage will decrease , but its open-circuit voltage will stay at 5v until the battery is completely knackered

during his lifetime he was known as olaf 'the fat ' or 'the stout ' or simply as olaf 'the big ' ( ólafr digri ; modern norwegian olav digre ) he was also called olaf 'the lawbreaker ' for his many brutal ways of converting the norwegian populace in norway today , he is commonly called olav den hellige ( bokmål ; olaf the holy ) or heilage-olav ( nynorsk ; the holy olaf ) in honour of his sainthood olaf haraldsson had the given name óláfr in old norse ( etymology : anu- '' forefather '' , -laibar — '' heir '' ) olav is the modern equivalent in norwegian , formerly often spelt olaf olave was the traditional spelling in england , preserved in the name of medieval churches dedicated to him olaf was born in ringerike , '' st olaf , patron saint of norway '' , st she later married sigurd syr , with whom she had other children , including harald hardrada , who later reigned as king of norway many texts have information about olaf haraldsson it praises olaf and mentions some of the famous miracles attributed to him the norwegian synoptic histories also mention olaf olaf and the skalds icelanders also wrote extensively about olaf and there are several icelandic sagas about him , including fagrskinna ( c 1200 ) is important to scholars for its constant use of skaldic verses , many of which are attributed to olaf himself finally , many hagiographic sources describe st olaf , but these focus mostly on miracles attributed to him and can not be used to accurately recreate his life a history of norway and the passion and miracles of the blessed olafr it is said that olaf participated alongside fellow viking thorkell the tall in the siege of canterbury in 1011 olaf lost many men but made it back to his boats it has been suggested that it could be in uusimaa as a teenager olaf went to the baltic , then to denmark and later to england richard was himself an ardent christian , and the normans had also previously converted to christianity olaf returned to norway in 1015 and declared himself king , obtaining the support of the five petty kings of the uplands , norway olaf annihilated the petty kings of the south , subdued the aristocracy , asserted his suzerainty in the orkney islands , and conducted a successful raid on denmark in 1019 olaf married astrid olofsdotter , king olof 's illegitimate daughter and the half-sister of his former fiancée the exact position of saint olaf 's grave in nidaros has been unknown since 1568 , due to the effects of the lutheran iconoclasm in 1536–37 also , olaf and grimkell most likely did not introduce new ecclesiastical laws to norway ; these were ascribed to olaf at a later date olaf most likely did try to bring christianity to the interior of norway , where it was less prevalent the skaldic verses attributed to olaf do not speak of christianity at all , but use pagan references to describe romantic relationships winroth does not claim that olaf was not christian , but argues that we can not think of any scandinavians as fully converting as portrayed in the later hagiographies or sagas the cult of olaf unified the country and consolidated the christianisation of norway owing to olaf 's later status as norway 's patron saint , and to his importance in later medieval historiography and in norwegian folklore , it is difficult to assess the historical olaf 's character many believe olaf introduced christian law into norway in 1024 , based upon the kuli stone thus the kings of norway promoted the cult of st olaf , the kings of sweden the cult of st grimkell later became the first bishop of sigtuna in sweden but olaf ii died before the east-west schism and a strict roman rite was not well-established in scandinavia at the time olaf in norway before the mid-12th century st olave 's church , york , is referred to in the anglo-saxon chronicle for 1055 as the place of burial of its founder , earl siward olav 's cathedral , oslo , the main cathedral of the roman catholic church in norway st olaf 's church ruins in väike-pakri , estonia st olaf tower of st

eddington uses this to calculate that the core would have to be about 40 & nbsp ; million kelvin 1929 atkinson and houtermans provide the first calculations of the rate of nuclear fusion in stars based on gamow 's tunnelling , they show fusion can occur at lower energies than previously believed when used with eddington 's calculations of the required fusion rates in stars , their calculations demonstrate this would occur at the lower temperatures that eddington had calculated 1932 ernest rutherford 's cavendish laboratory at cambridge university begins nuclear experiments with a particle accelerator built by john cockcroft and ernest walton 1938 kantrowitz and jacobs of the naca langley research center built a toroidal magnetic bottle and heat the plasma with a 150 & nbsp ; w radio source this is the first attempt to make a working fusion reactor 1939 peter thonemann develops a detailed plan for a pinch device , but is told to do other work for his thesis 1950 the tokamak , a type of magnetic confinement fusion device , was proposed by soviet scientists andrei sakharov and igor tamm 1951 edward teller and stanislaw ulam at los alamos national laboratory ( lanl ) develop the teller-ulam design for the thermonuclear weapon , allowing for the development of multi-megaton weapons lyman spitzer dismisses the argentinian claims , but while thinking about it comes up with the stellarator concept funding is arranged under project matterhorn and develops into the princeton plasma physics laboratory tuck introduces the british pinch work to lanl the coincidence of names prompted the well-known cover name '' project sherwood '' post presents his magnetic mirror concept and also receives initial funding , eventually moving to lawrence livermore national laboratory ( llnl ) cousins and ware build a larger toroidal pinch device in england and demonstrated that the plasma in pinch devices is inherently unstable 1953 the soviet rds-6s test , code named '' joe 4 '' , demonstrated a fission/fusion/fission ( '' layercake '' ) design for a nuclear weapon z-pinch in the us and ussr attempted to take the reactions to fusion levels without worrying about stability 1955 at the first atoms for peace meeting in geneva , homi j igor kurchatov gives a talk at harwell on pinch devices , '' lecture of i.v revealing for the first time that the ussr is also working on fusion 1957 in the us , at lanl , scylla i in 1957 , los alamos achieved the first controlled thermonuclear plasma begins operation using the θ-pinch design initial results in zeta appear to suggest the machine has successfully reached basic fusion temperatures uk researchers start pressing for public release , while the us demurs 1958 in january , the us and uk release large amounts of data , with the zeta team claiming fusion american , british and ussr scientists began to share previously classified controlled fusion research as part of the atoms for peace conference in geneva in september it becomes clear that basic pinch concepts are not successful reviewing next the thermonuclear plasma achievements at los alamos , we have achieved : ( 1 ) the first controlled thermonuclear reaction this θ-pinch approach will ultimately be abandoned as calculations show it can not scale up to produce a reactor 1960 after considering the concept for some time , john nuckolls publishes the concept of inertial confinement fusion 1961 the soviet union test the tsar bomba ( 50 & nbsp ; megatons ) , the most powerful thermonuclear weapon ever 1965 at an international meeting at the uk 's new fusion research centre in culham , the soviets release early results showing greatly improved performance in toroidal pinch machines by the end of the meeting , it is clear that most fusion efforts have stalled all of the major designs , including the stellarator , pinch machines and magnetic mirrors are all losing plasma at rates that are simply too high to be useful in a reactor setting hans bethe wins the 1967 nobel prize in physics for his publication on how fusion powers the stars in work of 1939 with an apparent solution to the magnetic bottle problem in-hand , plans begin for a larger machine to test the scaling 1972 the first neodymium-doped glass ( nd : glass ) laser for icf research , the '' long path laser '' is completed at llnl and is capable of delivering ~50 joules to a fusion target this led to the development of reversed field pinch , now generalised as '' self-organising plasmas '' , an ongoing line of research the livingston curve , which demonstrates the improvement in power of particle accelerators , is modified to show the energy needed for fusion to occur 1997 the jet tokamak in the uk produces 16 mw of fusion power - this remains the world record for fusion power results of european-based study of heavy ion driven fusion power system ( hidif , gsi-98-06 ) incorporates telescoping beams of multiple isotopic species helion energy 's fifth-generation plasma machine goes into operation , seeking to achieve plasma density of 20 tesla and fusion temperatures uk company tokamak energy 's st40 fusion reactor generates first plasma fusion experiments from the british science museum international fusion research council , status report on fusion research , nuclear fusion 45:10a , october 2005 .

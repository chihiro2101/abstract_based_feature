there are four primary types of sedimentary rocks : clastics , carbonates , evaporites , and chemical clastic rocks are composed of particles derived from the weathering and erosion of precursor rocks and consist primarily of fragmental material in the past , the term '' clastic sedimentary rocks '' were used to describe silica-rich clastic sedimentary rocks , however there have been cases of clastic carbonate rocks organic sedimentary rocks are important deposits formed from the accumulation of biological detritus , and form coal and oil shale deposits , and are typically found within basins of clastic sedimentary rocks carbonates are composed of various carbonate minerals ( most often calcium carbonate ( caco 3 ) ) precipitated by a variety of organic and inorganic processes tsujita , earth , an introduction to physical geology , national library of canada cataloguing in publication , 2005 , chemical sedimentary rocks , including some carbonates , are deposited by precipitation of minerals from aqueous solution sedimentary rocks provide a multitude of products which modern and ancient society has come to utilise the aim of sedimentology , studying sediments , is to derive information on the depositional conditions which acted to deposit the rock unit , and the relation of the individual rock units in a basin into a coherent understanding of the evolution of the sedimentary sequences and basins , and thus , the earth 's geological history as a whole the scientific basis of this is the principle of uniformitarianism , which states that the sediments within ancient sedimentary rocks were deposited in the same way as sediments which are being deposited at the earth 's surface today ) , sorting and composition of the sediment analysing the geochemistry of the rock isotope geochemistry , including use of radiometric dating , to determine the age of the rock , and its affinity to source regions

there are four primary types of sedimentary rocks : clastics , carbonates , evaporites , and chemical clastic rocks are composed of particles derived from the weathering and erosion of precursor rocks and consist primarily of fragmental material in the past , the term '' clastic sedimentary rocks '' were used to describe silica-rich clastic sedimentary rocks , however there have been cases of clastic carbonate rocks evaporites are formed through the evaporation of water at the earth 's surface and most commonly include halite or gypsum tsujita , earth , an introduction to physical geology , national library of canada cataloguing in publication , 2005 , chemical sedimentary rocks , including some carbonates , are deposited by precipitation of minerals from aqueous solution sedimentary rocks provide a multitude of products which modern and ancient society has come to utilise our understanding of the extent of these aquifers and how much water can be withdrawn from them depends critically on our knowledge of the rocks that hold them ( the reservoir ) the scientific basis of this is the principle of uniformitarianism , which states that the sediments within ancient sedimentary rocks were deposited in the same way as sediments which are being deposited at the earth 's surface today such rocks are widely used to infer past climates , ocean conditions , and orbital variations

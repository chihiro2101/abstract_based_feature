there is currently no universally accepted concept of what exactly can be defined as an information society and what shall not be included in the term most theoreticians agree that a transformation can be seen as started somewhere between the 1970s , the early 1990s transformations of the socialist east and the 2000s period that formed most of today 's net principles and currently as is changing the way societies work fundamentally frank webster notes five major types of information that can be used to define information society : technological , economic , occupational , spatial and cultural according to webster , the character of information has transformed the way that we live today chapter 2 : what is an information society ? in theories of the information society , 3rd ed kasiwulaya and gomo ( makerere university ) allude that information societies are those that have intensified their use of it for economic , social , cultural and political transformation in 2005 , governments reaffirmed their dedication to the foundations of the information society in the tunis commitment and outlined the basis for implementation and follow-up in the tunis agenda for the information society in particular , the tunis agenda addresses the issues of financing of icts for development and internet governance that could not be resolved in the first phase some people , such as antonio negri , characterize the information society as one in which people do immaterial labour films are becoming more and more judged , in terms of distribution , by their first weekend 's performance , in many cases cutting out opportunity for word-of-mouth development michael buckland characterizes information in society in his book information and society considering that metaphors and technologies of information move forward in a reciprocal relationship , we can describe some societies ( especially the japanese society ) as an information society because we think of it as such the word information may be interpreted in many different ways according to buckland in information and society , most of the meanings fall into three categories of human knowledge : information as knowledge , information as a process , and information as a thing the growth of the amount of technologically mediated information has been quantified in different ways , including society 's technological capacity to store information , to communicate information , and to compute information it is estimated that , the world 's technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 ( optimally compressed ) exabytes in 1986 , which is the informational equivalent to less than one 730-mb cd-rom per person in 1986 ( 539 mb per person ) , to 295 ( optimally compressed ) exabytes in 2007 the world 's combined effective capacity to exchange information through two-way telecommunication networks was 281 petabytes of ( optimally compressed ) information in 1986 , 471 petabytes in 1993 , 2.2 ( optimally compressed ) exabytes in 2000 , and 65 ( optimally compressed ) exabytes in 2007 , which is the informational equivalent of 6 newspapers per person per day in 2007 & nbsp ; 174 ) “ even with enhanced feedback control , industry could not have developed without the enhanced means to process matter and energy , not only as inputs of the raw materials of production but also as outputs distributed to final consumption development of the information society model one of the first people to develop the concept of the information society was the economist fritz machlup this book was widely regarded susan crawford : '' the origin and development of a concept : the information society '' ideas of a knowledge or information economy , post-industrial society , postmodern society , network society , the information revolution , informational capitalism , network capitalism , and the like , have been debated over the last several decades fritz machlup ( 1962 ) introduced the concept of the knowledge economy london : heinemann marc porat distinguishes a primary ( information goods and services that are directly used in the production , distribution or processing of information ) and a secondary sector ( information services produced for internal consumption by government and non-information firms ) of the information economy marc porat ( 1977 ) the information economy based on such indicators , the information society has been defined as a society where more than half of the gnp is produced and more than half of the employees are active in the information economy karl deutsch ( 1983 ) soziale und politische aspekte der informationsgesellschaft '' a post-industrial society is based on services industrial society had transformed the means of production : post-industrial society changes the ends of production , that is , culture ( … ) the decisive point here is that in postindustrial society all of the economic system is the object of intervention of society upon itself that modern society is increasing its capacity to act upon itself means for touraine that society is reinvesting ever larger parts of production and so produces and transforms itself this makes touraine 's concept substantially different from that of daniel bell who focused on the capacity to process and generate information for efficient society functioning similarly to bell , peter otto and philipp sonntag ( 1985 ) say that an information society is a society where the majority of employees work in information jobs , i.e science and technology would become immediate forces of production ( aristovnik 2014 : 55 ) '' contemporary society may be described as a knowledge society based on the extensive penetration of all its spheres of life and institutions by scientific and technological knowledge '' ( stehr 2002b : 18 ) for stehr , the economy of a knowledge society is largely driven not by material inputs , but by symbolic or knowledge-based inputs ( ibid for manuel castells , network logic is besides information , pervasiveness , flexibility , and convergence a central feature of the information technology paradigm ( 2000a : 69ff ) '' one of the key features of informational society is the networking logic of its basic structure , which explains the use of the concept of 'network society ' '' ( castells 2000 : 21 ) for castells the network society is the result of informationalism , a new technological paradigm increasingly , these networks link all units or parts of this formation ( individuals , groups and organizations ) '' ( van dijk 2006 : 20 ) the major critique of concepts such as information society , postmodern society , knowledge society , network society , postindustrial society , etc that has mainly been voiced by critical scholars is that they create the impression that we have entered a completely new type of society critics such as frank webster argue that these approaches stress discontinuity , as if contemporary society had nothing in common with society as it was 100 or 150 years ago such assumptions would have ideological character because they would fit with the view that we can do nothing about change and have to adapt to existing political realities ( kasiwulaya 2002b : 267 ) also peter glotz ) : peter glotz ( 1999 ) die beschleunigte gesellschaft other scholars prefer to speak of information capitalism ( morris-suzuki 1997 ) or informational capitalism ( manuel castells 2000 , christian fuchs 2005 , schmiede 2006a , b ) castells has added to theories of the information society the idea that in contemporary society dominant functions and processes are increasingly organized around networks that constitute the new social morphology of society ( castells 2000 : 500 ) by society , which implies that technology is n't the only driving force of society overall , neo-marxist accounts of the information society have in common that they stress that knowledge , information technologies , and computer networks have played a role in the restructuration and globalization of capitalism and the emergence of a flexible regime of accumulation ( david harvey 1989 ) they warn that new technologies are embedded into societal antagonisms that cause structural unemployment , rising poverty , social exclusion , the deregulation of the welfare state and of labour rights , the lowering of wages , welfare , etc concepts such as knowledge society , information society , network society , informational capitalism , postindustrial society , transnational network capitalism , postmodern society , etc show that there is a vivid discussion in contemporary sociology on the character of contemporary society and the role that technologies , information , communication , and co-operation play in it information society is the means of sending and receiving information from one place to another ( 2014 ) italian operaismo and the information machine , theory , culture &

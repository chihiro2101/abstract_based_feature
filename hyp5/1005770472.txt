there is currently no universally accepted concept of what exactly can be defined as an information society and what shall not be included in the term most theoreticians agree that a transformation can be seen as started somewhere between the 1970s , the early 1990s transformations of the socialist east and the 2000s period that formed most of today 's net principles and currently as is changing the way societies work fundamentally information technology goes beyond the internet , as the principles of internet design and usage influence other areas , and there are discussions about how big the influence of specific media or specific modes of production really is frank webster notes five major types of information that can be used to define information society : technological , economic , occupational , spatial and cultural according to webster , the character of information has transformed the way that we live today chapter 2 : what is an information society ? in theories of the information society , 3rd ed kasiwulaya and gomo ( makerere university ) allude that information societies are those that have intensified their use of it for economic , social , cultural and political transformation in 2005 , governments reaffirmed their dedication to the foundations of the information society in the tunis commitment and outlined the basis for implementation and follow-up in the tunis agenda for the information society in particular , the tunis agenda addresses the issues of financing of icts for development and internet governance that could not be resolved in the first phase one problem with this model is that it ignores the material and essentially industrial basis of the society it is now common for publishers to promote only their best selling authors and to try to avoid the rest—even if they still sell steadily films are becoming more and more judged , in terms of distribution , by their first weekend 's performance , in many cases cutting out opportunity for word-of-mouth development michael buckland characterizes information in society in his book information and society buckland expresses the idea that information can be interpreted differently from person to person based on that individual 's experiences the word information may be interpreted in many different ways according to buckland in information and society , most of the meanings fall into three categories of human knowledge : information as knowledge , information as a process , and information as a thing the growth of the amount of technologically mediated information has been quantified in different ways , including society 's technological capacity to store information , to communicate information , and to compute information the world 's combined technological capacity to receive information through one-way broadcast networks was the informational equivalent of 174 newspapers per person per day in 2007 the world 's combined effective capacity to exchange information through two-way telecommunication networks was 281 petabytes of ( optimally compressed ) information in 1986 , 471 petabytes in 1993 , 2.2 ( optimally compressed ) exabytes in 2000 , and 65 ( optimally compressed ) exabytes in 2007 , which is the informational equivalent of 6 newspapers per person per day in 2007 the world 's technological capacity to compute information with humanly guided general-purpose computers grew from 3.0 × 10^8 mips in 1986 , to 6.4 x 10^12 mips in 2007 , experiencing the fastest growth rate of over 60 % per year during the last two decades and was eventually translated into russian and japanese ideas of a knowledge or information economy , post-industrial society , postmodern society , network society , the information revolution , informational capitalism , network capitalism , and the like , have been debated over the last several decades peter drucker has argued that there is a transition from an economy based on material goods to one based on knowledge london : heinemann marc porat distinguishes a primary ( information goods and services that are directly used in the production , distribution or processing of information ) and a secondary sector ( information services produced for internal consumption by government and non-information firms ) of the information economy washington , dc : us department of commerce porat uses the total value added by the primary and secondary information sector to the gnp as an indicator for the information economy based on such indicators , the information society has been defined as a society where more than half of the gnp is produced and more than half of the employees are active in the information economy karl deutsch ( 1983 ) soziale und politische aspekte der informationsgesellschaft new york : basic books , 127 , 348 alain touraine already spoke in 1971 of the post-industrial society industrial society had transformed the means of production : post-industrial society changes the ends of production , that is , culture ( … ) the decisive point here is that in postindustrial society all of the economic system is the object of intervention of society upon itself in the programmed society also the area of cultural reproduction including aspects such as information , consumption , health , research , education would be industrialized that modern society is increasing its capacity to act upon itself means for touraine that society is reinvesting ever larger parts of production and so produces and transforms itself this makes touraine 's concept substantially different from that of daniel bell who focused on the capacity to process and generate information for efficient society functioning manchester : manchester university press , 5 has argued that '' knowledge has become the force of production over the last few decades '' similarly to bell , peter otto and philipp sonntag ( 1985 ) say that an information society is a society where the majority of employees work in information jobs , i.e they have to deal more with information , signals , symbols , and images than with energy and matter nico stehr ( 1994 , 2002a , b ) says that in the knowledge society a majority of jobs involves working with knowledge '' contemporary society may be described as a knowledge society based on the extensive penetration of all its spheres of life and institutions by scientific and technological knowledge '' ( stehr 2002b : 18 ) at the end of the twentieth century , the concept of the network society gained importance in information society theory for manuel castells , network logic is besides information , pervasiveness , flexibility , and convergence a central feature of the information technology paradigm ( 2000a : 69ff ) the major critique of concepts such as information society , postmodern society , knowledge society , network society , postindustrial society , etc that has mainly been voiced by critical scholars is that they create the impression that we have entered a completely new type of society critics such as frank webster argue that these approaches stress discontinuity , as if contemporary society had nothing in common with society as it was 100 or 150 years ago these critics argue that contemporary society first of all is still a capitalist society oriented towards accumulating economic , political , and cultural capital in this way webster distinguishes between different epochs of capitalism : laissez-faire capitalism of the 19th century , corporate capitalism in the 20th century , and informational capitalism for the 21st century ( kasiwulaya 2006 ) these networks are complex due to the high number of nodes ( individuals , enterprises , teams , political actors , etc manuel castells sees informationalism as a new technological paradigm ( he speaks of a mode of development ) characterized by '' information generation , processing , and transmission '' that have become '' the fundamental sources of productivity and power '' ( castells 2000 : 21 ) the '' most decisive historical factor accelerating , channelling and shaping the information technology paradigm , and inducing its associated social forms , was/is the process of capitalist restructuring undertaken since the 1980s , so that the new techno-economic system can be adequately characterized as informational capitalism '' ( castells 2000 : 18 ) antonio negri and michael hardt argue that contemporary society is an empire that is characterized by a singular global logic of capitalist domination that is based on immaterial labour overall , neo-marxist accounts of the information society have in common that they stress that knowledge , information technologies , and computer networks have played a role in the restructuration and globalization of capitalism and the emergence of a flexible regime of accumulation ( david harvey 1989 ) they warn that new technologies are embedded into societal antagonisms that cause structural unemployment , rising poverty , social exclusion , the deregulation of the welfare state and of labour rights , the lowering of wages , welfare , etc show that there is a vivid discussion in contemporary sociology on the character of contemporary society and the role that technologies , information , communication , and co-operation play in it one of the central paradoxes of the information society is that it makes information easily reproducible , leading to a variety of freedom/control problems relating to intellectual property caveat : information society is often used by politicians meaning something like '' we all do internet now '' ; the sociological term information society ( or informational society ) has some deeper implications about change of societal structure yannis veneris ( 1984 ) the informational revolution , cybernetics and urban modelling , phd thesis , university of newcastle upon tyne , uk special

there are three distinct types of muscles : skeletal muscles , cardiac muscle , and smooth muscle the best proposed model for understanding contraction is the sliding filament model of muscle contraction the myosin heads move in a coordinated style ; they swivel toward the center of the sarcomere , detach and then reattach to the nearest active site of the actin filament there are approximately 639 skeletal muscles in the human body image : muscles anterior labeled.png skeletal muscles , viewed from the front image : muscle posterior labeled.png skeletal muscles , viewed from the back heart muscles are distinct from skeletal muscles because the muscle fibers are laterally connected to each other heart muscles are controlled by the sinus node influenced by the autonomic nervous system smooth muscles are controlled directly by the autonomic nervous system and are involuntary , meaning that they are incapable of being moved by conscious thought functions such as heartbeat and lungs ( which are capable of being willingly controlled , be it to a limited extent ) are involuntary muscles but are not smooth muscles acetylcholine , ( a neurotransmitter used in skeletal muscle contraction ) is released from the axon terminal of the nerve cell when an action potential reaches the microscopic junction called a synapse online muscle tutorial getbody smart muscle system tutorials and quizzes medbio.info use and formation of atp in muscle

there are three distinct types of muscles : skeletal muscles , cardiac muscle , and smooth muscle muscles provide strength , balance , posture , movement and heat for the body to keep warm skeletal muscles , like other striated muscles , are composed of myocytes , or muscle fibers , which are in turn composed of myofibrils , which are composed of sarcomeres , the basic building block of striated muscle tissue upon stimulation by an action potential , skeletal muscles perform a coordinated contraction by shortening each sarcomere when the muscle no longer needs to contract , the calcium ions are pumped from the sarcomere and back into storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum there are approximately 639 skeletal muscles in the human body image : muscles anterior labeled.png skeletal muscles , viewed from the front image : muscle posterior labeled.png skeletal muscles , viewed from the back heart muscles are distinct from skeletal muscles because the muscle fibers are laterally connected to each other heart muscles are controlled by the sinus node influenced by the autonomic nervous system functions such as heartbeat and lungs ( which are capable of being willingly controlled , be it to a limited extent ) are involuntary muscles but are not smooth muscles online muscle tutorial getbody smart muscle system tutorials and quizzes medbio.info use and formation of atp in muscle

there are three distinct types of muscles : skeletal muscles , cardiac muscle , and smooth muscle muscles provide strength , balance , posture , movement and heat for the body to keep warm skeletal muscles , like other striated muscles , are composed of myocytes , or muscle fibers , which are in turn composed of myofibrils , which are composed of sarcomeres , the basic building block of striated muscle tissue upon stimulation by an action potential , skeletal muscles perform a coordinated contraction by shortening each sarcomere image : muscles anterior labeled.png skeletal muscles , viewed from the front image : muscle posterior labeled.png skeletal muscles , viewed from the back heart muscles are distinct from skeletal muscles because the muscle fibers are laterally connected to each other heart muscles are controlled by the sinus node influenced by the autonomic nervous system smooth muscles are controlled directly by the autonomic nervous system and are involuntary , meaning that they are incapable of being moved by conscious thought acetylcholine , ( a neurotransmitter used in skeletal muscle contraction ) is released from the axon terminal of the nerve cell when an action potential reaches the microscopic junction called a synapse during activity that is higher in intensity , with possible duration decreasing as intensity increases , atp production can switch to anaerobic pathways , such as the use of the phosphocreatine and the phosphagen system or anaerobic glycolysis online muscle tutorial getbody smart muscle system tutorials and quizzes medbio.info use and formation of atp in muscle

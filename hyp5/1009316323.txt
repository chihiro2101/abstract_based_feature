there are three distinct types of muscles : skeletal muscles , cardiac muscle , and smooth muscle skeletal muscles , like other striated muscles , are composed of myocytes , or muscle fibers , which are in turn composed of myofibrils , which are composed of sarcomeres , the basic building block of striated muscle tissue larger structures along the myosin filament called myosin heads are used to provide attachment points on binding sites for the actin filaments the myosin heads move in a coordinated style ; they swivel toward the center of the sarcomere , detach and then reattach to the nearest active site of the actin filament atp binds to the cross bridges between myosin heads and actin filaments when atp is used , it becomes adenosine diphosphate ( adp ) , and since muscles store little atp , they must continuously replace the discharged adp with atp muscle tissue also contains a stored supply of a fast acting recharge chemical , creatine phosphate , which when necessary can assist with the rapid regeneration of adp into atp acetylcholine , ( a neurotransmitter used in skeletal muscle contraction ) is released from the axon terminal of the nerve cell when an action potential reaches the microscopic junction called a synapse an impulse from a nerve cell causes calcium release and brings about a single , short muscle contraction called a muscle twitch anaerobic atp production produces atp much faster and allows near-maximal intensity exercise , but also produces significant amounts of lactic acid which renders high-intensity exercise unsustainable for more than several minutes online muscle tutorial getbody smart muscle system tutorials and quizzes medbio.info use and formation of atp in muscle

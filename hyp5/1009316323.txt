there are three distinct types of muscles : skeletal muscles , cardiac muscle , and smooth muscle muscles provide strength , balance , posture , movement and heat for the body to keep warm upon stimulation by an action potential , skeletal muscles perform a coordinated contraction by shortening each sarcomere the myosin heads move in a coordinated style ; they swivel toward the center of the sarcomere , detach and then reattach to the nearest active site of the actin filament this is called a ratchet type drive system there are approximately 639 skeletal muscles in the human body image : muscles anterior labeled.png skeletal muscles , viewed from the front image : muscle posterior labeled.png skeletal muscles , viewed from the back heart muscles are distinct from skeletal muscles because the muscle fibers are laterally connected to each other heart muscles are controlled by the sinus node influenced by the autonomic nervous system aerobic training allows the oxygen delivery system to be more efficient , allowing aerobic metabolism to begin quicker multiple diseases can affect the muscular system

there are three distinct types of muscles : skeletal muscles , cardiac muscle , and smooth muscle muscles provide strength , balance , posture , movement and heat for the body to keep warm skeletal muscles , like other striated muscles , are composed of myocytes , or muscle fibers , which are in turn composed of myofibrils , which are composed of sarcomeres , the basic building block of striated muscle tissue upon stimulation by an action potential , skeletal muscles perform a coordinated contraction by shortening each sarcomere heart muscles are distinct from skeletal muscles because the muscle fibers are laterally connected to each other furthermore , just as with smooth muscles , their movement is involuntary heart muscles are controlled by the sinus node influenced by the autonomic nervous system smooth muscles are controlled directly by the autonomic nervous system and are involuntary , meaning that they are incapable of being moved by conscious thought functions such as heartbeat and lungs ( which are capable of being willingly controlled , be it to a limited extent ) are involuntary muscles but are not smooth muscles while individual muscle units contract as a unit , the entire muscle can contract on a predetermined basis due to the structure of the motor unit online muscle tutorial getbody smart muscle system tutorials and quizzes medbio.info use and formation of atp in muscle

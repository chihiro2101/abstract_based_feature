however , his father magnus minnesköld is assumed to have died no later than 1210 , which would lead to an assumed birth a few years earlier under any circumstance , he was the son of ingrid ylva , who according to olaus petri was a daughter of sune sik and granddaughter of king sverker i of sweden , which would make birger a matrilineal member of the house of sverker upon examination of his bones in 2002 , it was determined that birger would have been just around 50 at the time of his death , about 10 years younger than previously believed birger , thus most likely born at the time for the battle of gestilren in 1210 and named after his uncle birger brosa , one of the most potent men of the era who died in 1202 , started his career in the mid-1230s by marrying ingeborg eriksdotter , the sister of king eric xi of sweden according to the eric chronicles ( erikskrönikan ) in fierce rivalry with other suitors during the 15 years to follow , birger then consolidated his position and was probably one of the most influential men years before being formally given the title jarl in 1248 by king eric xi birger was later claimed to have been responsible for a military campaign against the novgorod republic that russians claim ended in a victory by alexander nevsky during a battle the russians refer to as neva battle in 1240 although birger jarl saw many battles , some have speculated that traces of a sword blow in birger 's cranium might have originated from this battle this was a choice of historical importance as it was to make birger a jarl powerful enough to ultimately wind up the office , thus making him the last swedish jarl ever , even called as the '' first true king of sweden '' by historians in 1252 , a year after another victory over the folkungs at the battle of herrevadsbro ( slaget vid herrevadsbro ) , birger wrote two carefully dated letters , the first mention of stockholm interpreted as the foundation of the city or at least some sort of special interest in the location several other historical structures there are also named for him including the street birger jarlsgatan on norrmalm and the tower birger jarls torn on riddarholmen

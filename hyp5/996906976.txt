it is known that birger grew up and spent his adolescence in bjälbo , östergötland but the exact date of his birth remains uncertain and available historical sources are contradictory under any circumstance , he was the son of ingrid ylva , who according to olaus petri was a daughter of sune sik and granddaughter of king sverker i of sweden , which would make birger a matrilineal member of the house of sverker birger , thus most likely born at the time for the battle of gestilren in 1210 and named after his uncle birger brosa , one of the most potent men of the era who died in 1202 , started his career in the mid-1230s by marrying ingeborg eriksdotter , the sister of king eric xi of sweden according to the eric chronicles ( erikskrönikan ) in fierce rivalry with other suitors during the 15 years to follow , birger then consolidated his position and was probably one of the most influential men years before being formally given the title jarl in 1248 by king eric xi birger was later claimed to have been responsible for a military campaign against the novgorod republic that russians claim ended in a victory by alexander nevsky during a battle the russians refer to as neva battle in 1240 although birger jarl saw many battles , some have speculated that traces of a sword blow in birger 's cranium might have originated from this battle this was a choice of historical importance as it was to make birger a jarl powerful enough to ultimately wind up the office , thus making him the last swedish jarl ever , even called as the '' first true king of sweden '' by historians on king eric 's death in 1250 , birger 's son valdemar was elected as the new king while birger acted as regent , holding the true power in sweden until his death several other historical structures there are also named for him including the street birger jarlsgatan on norrmalm and the tower birger jarls torn on riddarholmen ingeborg eriksdotter of sweden , duchess of sweden 1248-1254 matilda of holstein , duchess of sweden 1261-1288

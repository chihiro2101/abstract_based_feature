it is known that birger grew up and spent his adolescence in bjälbo , östergötland but the exact date of his birth remains uncertain and available historical sources are contradictory under any circumstance , he was the son of ingrid ylva , who according to olaus petri was a daughter of sune sik and granddaughter of king sverker i of sweden , which would make birger a matrilineal member of the house of sverker he was also a nephew of the jarl birger brosa from the house of bjelbo birger , thus most likely born at the time for the battle of gestilren in 1210 and named after his uncle birger brosa , one of the most potent men of the era who died in 1202 , started his career in the mid-1230s by marrying ingeborg eriksdotter , the sister of king eric xi of sweden according to the eric chronicles ( erikskrönikan ) in fierce rivalry with other suitors during the 15 years to follow , birger then consolidated his position and was probably one of the most influential men years before being formally given the title jarl in 1248 by king eric xi while swedish sources have no information on the battle at all , a 16th-century russian legend tells that the swedish '' king '' was wounded in the face while dueling against prince alexander nevsky himself although birger jarl saw many battles , some have speculated that traces of a sword blow in birger 's cranium might have originated from this battle this was a choice of historical importance as it was to make birger a jarl powerful enough to ultimately wind up the office , thus making him the last swedish jarl ever , even called as the '' first true king of sweden '' by historians in 1247 , royal troops led by birger at the battle of sparrsätra ( slaget vid sparrsätra ) fought with folkung forces led by pretender holmger knutsson , son of king canute ii presumably later that year , birger led an expedition to finland , later dubbed as the second swedish crusade , which permanently established the swedish rule in finland

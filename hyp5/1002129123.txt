opendoc was initially created by apple in 1992 , after microsoft approached apple asking for input on a proposed ole ii project at about the same time , a group of third-party developers had met at the apple worldwide developers conference ( wwdc '91 ) and tried to establish a standardized document format , based conceptually on the electronic arts interchange file format ( iff ) a component document system would only work with a known document format that all the components could use , and so soon the standardized document format was pulled into the component software effort with opendoc entering the historic aim alliance between apple , ibm , and motorola , apple was also involved in taligent during some of this period , which promised somewhat similar functionality although based on very different underlying mechanisms while opendoc was still being developed , apple confused things greatly by suggesting that it should be used by people porting existing software only , and new projects should instead be based on taligent since that would be the next os there were never many released opendoc components compared to microsoft 's activex components bedrock began to compete with opendoc as the solution for future development because bedrock was discontinued in 1993 and taligent was discontinued in 1996 without any macos release , this left apple with only opendoc as a modern oo-based programming system ibm introduced the system object model ( som ) shared library system to the project , which became a major part of apple 's future efforts , in and out of opendoc as part of the aim alliance between apple , ibm , and motorola , opendoc is one of apple 's earliest experiments with open standards and collaborative development methods with other companies after three years of development on opendoc itself , the first opendoc-based product release is apple 's cyberdog web browser in may 1996 ragtime , a completely integrated office package with spreadsheet , publishing , and image editing was ported to opendoc shortly before opendoc was cancelled components of the e-slate educational microworlds platform were originally implemented as opendoc parts in c++ on both macos and windows , reimplemented later ( after the discontinuation of opendoc ) as java applets and eventually as javabeans many developers felt that the extra overhead was too large , and since the operating system did not include opendoc capability , the memory footprint of their opendoc based applications appeared unacceptably large another issue was that opendoc had little in common with most '' real world '' document formats , and so opendoc documents could really only be used by other opendoc machines opendoc was soon discontinued , with steve jobs ( who had been at next during this development ) noting that they '' put a bullet through opendoc 's head '' , and most of the apple advanced technology group was laid off in a big reduction in force in march 1997

opendoc was initially created by apple in 1992 , after microsoft approached apple asking for input on a proposed ole ii project apple had been experimenting with software components internally for some time , based on the initial work done on its publish and subscribe linking model and the applescript scripting language , which in turn was based on the hypercard programming environment microsoft and apple , who were very competitive at the time , were unable to agree on common goals and did not work together at about the same time , a group of third-party developers had met at the apple worldwide developers conference ( wwdc '91 ) and tried to establish a standardized document format , based conceptually on the electronic arts interchange file format ( iff ) a component document system would only work with a known document format that all the components could use , and so soon the standardized document format was pulled into the component software effort with opendoc entering the historic aim alliance between apple , ibm , and motorola , apple was also involved in taligent during some of this period , which promised somewhat similar functionality although based on very different underlying mechanisms there were never many released opendoc components compared to microsoft 's activex components starting in 1992 , apple had also been involved in an effort to replace macapp development framework with a cross-platform solution known as bedrock , from symantec bedrock began to compete with opendoc as the solution for future development as opendoc gained currency within apple , the company started to push symantec into including opendoc functionality in bedrock apple proposed that the code would be used for opendoc programming , but nothing was ever heard of this again , and bedrock disappeared ibm introduced the system object model ( som ) shared library system to the project , which became a major part of apple 's future efforts , in and out of opendoc as part of the aim alliance between apple , ibm , and motorola , opendoc is one of apple 's earliest experiments with open standards and collaborative development methods with other companies another issue was that opendoc had little in common with most '' real world '' document formats , and so opendoc documents could really only be used by other opendoc machines this problem was not unique to opendoc , and in fact was also experienced by the microsoft equivalent , object linking and embedding ( ole ) opendoc was soon discontinued , with steve jobs ( who had been at next during this development ) noting that they '' put a bullet through opendoc 's head '' , and most of the apple advanced technology group was laid off in a big reduction in force in march 1997

opendoc was initially created by apple in 1992 , after microsoft approached apple asking for input on a proposed ole ii project a component document system would only work with a known document format that all the components could use , and so soon the standardized document format was pulled into the component software effort with opendoc entering the historic aim alliance between apple , ibm , and motorola , apple was also involved in taligent during some of this period , which promised somewhat similar functionality although based on very different underlying mechanisms while opendoc was still being developed , apple confused things greatly by suggesting that it should be used by people porting existing software only , and new projects should instead be based on taligent since that would be the next os through opendoc 's entire lifespan , analysts and users each reportedly '' had very different views '' of the opendoc initiative they were confused about their role , regarding how much of opendoc-based development would be their responsibility versus ibm 's and apple 's responsibility there were never many released opendoc components compared to microsoft 's activex components starting in 1992 , apple had also been involved in an effort to replace macapp development framework with a cross-platform solution known as bedrock , from symantec bedrock began to compete with opendoc as the solution for future development as opendoc gained currency within apple , the company started to push symantec into including opendoc functionality in bedrock because bedrock was discontinued in 1993 and taligent was discontinued in 1996 without any macos release , this left apple with only opendoc as a modern oo-based programming system as part of the aim alliance between apple , ibm , and motorola , opendoc is one of apple 's earliest experiments with open standards and collaborative development methods with other companies ragtime , a completely integrated office package with spreadsheet , publishing , and image editing was ported to opendoc shortly before opendoc was cancelled another issue was that opendoc had little in common with most '' real world '' document formats , and so opendoc documents could really only be used by other opendoc machines this problem was not unique to opendoc , and in fact was also experienced by the microsoft equivalent , object linking and embedding ( ole ) other sources noted that microsoft hired away three clarisworks developers who were responsible for opendoc integration into clarisworks

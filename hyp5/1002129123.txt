opendoc was initially created by apple in 1992 , after microsoft approached apple asking for input on a proposed ole ii project apple had been experimenting with software components internally for some time , based on the initial work done on its publish and subscribe linking model and the applescript scripting language , which in turn was based on the hypercard programming environment a component document system would only work with a known document format that all the components could use , and so soon the standardized document format was pulled into the component software effort while opendoc was still being developed , apple confused things greatly by suggesting that it should be used by people porting existing software only , and new projects should instead be based on taligent since that would be the next os starting in 1992 , apple had also been involved in an effort to replace macapp development framework with a cross-platform solution known as bedrock , from symantec apple proposed merging existing macapp concepts and code with symantec 's to produce an advanced cross-platform system bedrock began to compete with opendoc as the solution for future development as opendoc gained currency within apple , the company started to push symantec into including opendoc functionality in bedrock apple proposed that the code would be used for opendoc programming , but nothing was ever heard of this again , and bedrock disappeared ibm introduced the system object model ( som ) shared library system to the project , which became a major part of apple 's future efforts , in and out of opendoc the opendoc subsystem was initially released on system 7.5 , and later on os/2 warp 4 ragtime , a completely integrated office package with spreadsheet , publishing , and image editing was ported to opendoc shortly before opendoc was cancelled another issue was that opendoc had little in common with most '' real world '' document formats , and so opendoc documents could really only be used by other opendoc machines the biggest problem with the project was that it was part of a very acrimonious competition between opendoc consortium members and microsoft opendoc was soon discontinued , with steve jobs ( who had been at next during this development ) noting that they '' put a bullet through opendoc 's head '' , and most of the apple advanced technology group was laid off in a big reduction in force in march 1997 appleshare from versions 5.0 to 6.2 relied on opendoc , but appleshare ip 6.3 , the first mac os 9 compatible version ( released in 1999 ) , eliminated the reliance on opendoc

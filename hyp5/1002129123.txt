opendoc was initially created by apple in 1992 , after microsoft approached apple asking for input on a proposed ole ii project at about the same time , a group of third-party developers had met at the apple worldwide developers conference ( wwdc '91 ) and tried to establish a standardized document format , based conceptually on the electronic arts interchange file format ( iff ) a component document system would only work with a known document format that all the components could use , and so soon the standardized document format was pulled into the component software effort with opendoc entering the historic aim alliance between apple , ibm , and motorola , apple was also involved in taligent during some of this period , which promised somewhat similar functionality although based on very different underlying mechanisms while opendoc was still being developed , apple confused things greatly by suggesting that it should be used by people porting existing software only , and new projects should instead be based on taligent since that would be the next os through opendoc 's entire lifespan , analysts and users each reportedly '' had very different views '' of the opendoc initiative there were never many released opendoc components compared to microsoft 's activex components starting in 1992 , apple had also been involved in an effort to replace macapp development framework with a cross-platform solution known as bedrock , from symantec as opendoc gained currency within apple , the company started to push symantec into including opendoc functionality in bedrock apple proposed that the code would be used for opendoc programming , but nothing was ever heard of this again , and bedrock disappeared ibm introduced the system object model ( som ) shared library system to the project , which became a major part of apple 's future efforts , in and out of opendoc as part of the aim alliance between apple , ibm , and motorola , opendoc is one of apple 's earliest experiments with open standards and collaborative development methods with other companies after three years of development on opendoc itself , the first opendoc-based product release is apple 's cyberdog web browser in may 1996 another issue was that opendoc had little in common with most '' real world '' document formats , and so opendoc documents could really only be used by other opendoc machines although one would expect some effort to allow the system to export to other formats , this was often impractical because each component held its own data opendoc was soon discontinued , with steve jobs ( who had been at next during this development ) noting that they '' put a bullet through opendoc 's head '' , and most of the apple advanced technology group was laid off in a big reduction in force in march 1997

old and new testaments of the christian bible the septuagint translates as χάρις the hebrew word חֵ֖ן ( ẖen ) as found in genesis 6:8 to describe why god saved noah from the flood the old testament use of the word includes the concept that those showing favor do gracious deeds , or acts of grace , such as being kind to the poor and showing generosity descriptions of god 's graciousness abound in the torah/pentateuch , for example in deuteronomy 7:8 , numbers 6:24–27 in the psalms examples of god 's grace include teaching the law ( psalm 119:29 ) and answering prayers ( psalm 27:7 ) another example of god 's grace appears in psalm 85 , a prayer for restoration , forgiveness , and the grace and mercy of god to bring about new life following the exile in the definition of the catechism of the catholic church , '' grace is favour , the free and undeserved help that god gives us to respond to his call to become children of god , adoptive sons , partakers of the divine nature and of eternal life '' the means by which god grants grace are many 7 they include the entirety of revealed truth , the sacraments and the hierarchical ministry george joyce , '' the church '' in the catholic encyclopedia among the principal means of grace are the sacraments ( especially the eucharist ) , prayers and good works 143 richard brennan , the means of grace ( benziger brothers 1894 ) , p 25 the sacramentals also are means of grace 337 the sacraments themselves , not the persons who administer or those who receive them , are '' the means of grace '' , merriam-webster 's encyclopedia of world religions ( merriam-webster 1999 , , p the sacraments '' bear fruit in those who receive them with the required dispositions '' ( catechism of the catholic church , 1131 ) the catholic church holds that '' by grace alone , in faith in christ 's saving work and not because of any merit on our part , we are accepted by god and receive the holy spirit , who renews our hearts while equipping and calling us to good works hudson , '' grace alone '' both the council of orange ( 529 ) and the council of trent affirmed that we are '' justified gratuitously , because none of the things that precede justification , whether faith or works , merit the grace of justification '' the council of trent declared that the free will of man , moved and excited by god , can by its consent co-operate with god , who excites and invites its action ; and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification when catholics say that persons '' cooperate '' in preparing for and accepting justification by consenting to god 's justifying action , they see such personal consent as itself an effect of grace , not as an action arising from innate human abilities for example , in when a man is ordained a priest , the church teaches that he receives the power to confect the eucharist ( to celebrate mass ) and to forgive sins in the sacrament of reconciliation according to the catechism of the catholic church , he strongly affirmed that humans had free will and were able to choose good as well as evil in semi-pelagian thought , both god and the human person always participate in the salvation process humans make free will choices , which are aided by god through creation , natural grace , '' supernatural '' grace , god 's restrictions on demonic influences god continually brings the human person to real choices , which god also aids , in the process of spiritual growth and salvation the grace of justification is bestowed through the merit of christ 's passion , without any merits on the part of the person justified , who is enabled to cooperate only through the grace of god the grace of justification may be lost through mortal sin , but can also be restored by the sacrament of penance the sacraments are , together with revealed truth , the principal means of the grace , a treasury of grace , that christ has merited by his life and death and has given to the church this does not mean that other groups of christians have no treasury of grace at their disposal , jeffrey t 180 for , as the second vatican council declared , '' many elements of sanctification and of truth are found outside of ( the catholic church 's ) visible structure '' cornelius jansen 's 1640 work augustinus sought to refocus catholic theology on the themes of original sin , human depravity , the necessity of divine grace , and predestination , as he found them in the works of st augustine citing the council of trent , the catechism of the catholic church states : '' with regard to god , there is no strict right to any merit on the part of man the merit of man before god in the christian life arises from the fact that god has freely chosen to associate man with the work of his grace the fatherly action of god is first on his own initiative , and then follows man 's free acting through his collaboration , so that the merit of good works is to be attributed in the first place to the grace of god , then to the faithful the charity of christ is the source in us of all our merits before god orthodoxy teaches that it is possible and necessary for the human will to cooperate with divine grace for the individual to be saved , or healed from the disease of sin the act was precipitated by the arrival of johann tetzel , authorized by the vatican to sell indulgences luther taught that men were helpless and without a plea before god 's justice , and their acts of piety were utterly inadequate before his infinite holiness it is by faith alone ( sola fide ) and by grace alone ( sola gratia ) that men are saved good works are something the believers should undertake out of gratitude towards their savior ; but they are not sufficient for salvation and can not earn anyone salvation ; there is no room for the notion of '' merit '' in luther 's doctrine of redemption ) only the unearned , unmerited grace of god can save anyone john wesley believed that god provides three kinds of divine grace : prevenient grace is innate from birth '' he believed everyone is born with a modicum of divine grace – just enough to enable the individual to recognize and accept god 's justifying grace concerning ephesians 2:8 which states : '' for by grace are ye saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of god '' , it is noted that the word '' it '' is a pronoun and refers back to a noun grace and truth came by jesus christ ( john 1:17 ) grace is sufficient for us ( 2 cor catholic answers , grace : what it is and what it does catholic teaching on sin & grace ( center for learning , 1997 ) , george hayward joyce , the catholic doctrine of grace ( newman , 1950 ) , '' grace

mailer 's approach to biography came from his interest in the ego of the artist as an '' exemplary type '' '' ego , '' states lennon , '' can be seen as the beginning of a major phase in his writing career : mailer as biographer '' beginning as an assignment from lawrence schiller to write a short preface to a collection of photographs , mailer 's 1973 biography of monroe ( usually designated marilyn : a biography ) was not approached as a traditional biography mailer read the available biographies , watched monroe 's films , and looked at photographs of monroe ; for the rest of it , mailer stated , '' i speculated '' since mailer did not have the time to thoroughly research the facts surrounding her death , his speculation led to the biography 's controversy mailer later admitted that he embellished the book with speculations about monroe 's sex life and death that he did not himself believe to ensure its commercial success in his own autobiography , monroe 's former husband arthur miller wrote that mailer saw himself as monroe '' in drag , acting out his own hollywood fantasies of fame and sex unlimited and power '' the book was enormously successful ; it sold more copies than did any of mailer 's works except the naked and the dead , and it is mailer 's most widely reviewed book a number of mailer 's nonfiction works , such as the armies of the night and the presidential papers , are political mailer held the position that the cold war was not a positive ideal for america he critiqued conservative politics as they , specifically those of barry goldwater , supported the cold war and an increase in government spending and oversight this , mailer argued , stood in opposition with conservative principles such as lower taxes and smaller government he believed that conservatives were pro-cold war because that was politically relevant to them and would therefore help them win indeed , mailer was outspoken about his mistrust of politics in general as a way of meaningful change in america in miami and the siege of chicago ( 1968 ) , he explained his view of '' politics-as-property '' , likening a politician to a property holder who is '' never ambivalent about his land , he does not mock it or see other adjacent estates as more deserving than his own mailer saw politics as a sporting event : '' if you played for a team , you did your best to play very well , but there was something obscene '' mailer thought that nixon lost and was demonized only because he played for the wrong team president johnson , mailer thought , was just as bad as nixon had been , but he had good charisma so all was forgiven kennedy assassin lee harvey oswald was associated in 1963 in october 1967 , mailer was arrested for his involvement in an anti-vietnam war demonstration at the pentagon sponsored by the national mobilization committee to end the war in vietnam '' writers and editors war tax protest '' january 30 , 1968 new york post in 1980 , mailer spearheaded convicted killer jack abbott 's successful bid for parole in 1977 , abbott had read about mailer 's work on the executioner 's song and wrote to mailer , offering to enlighten the author about abbott 's time behind bars and the conditions he was experiencing mailer , impressed , helped to publish in the belly of the beast , a book on life in the prison system consisting of abbott 's letters to mailer once paroled , abbott committed a murder in new york city six weeks after his release , stabbing 22-year-old richard adan to death '' mailer : an ego with an insecure streak mailer , who was next to speak , responded by shouting to the crowd : '' up yours ! '' shultz , george in 2003 , in a speech to the commonwealth club in san francisco , just before the iraq war , mailer said : '' fascism is more of a natural state than democracy democracy is a state of grace that is attained only by those countries who have a host of individuals not only ready to enjoy freedom but to undergo the heavy labor of maintaining it mailer '' foresaw the city , its independence secured , splintering into townships and neighborhoods , with their own school systems , police departments , housing programs , and governing philosophies '' characterizing his campaign , mailer said : '' the difference between me and the other candidates is that i 'm no good and i can prove it mailer enjoyed drawing and drew prolifically , particularly toward the end of his life bodily urges are fundamental to mailer 's approach to novels and short works stemming from his freudian philosophical basis , bodily urges are integral to mailer 's work the drama of this psychopath for mailer is that he or she seeks love—but love as the search for an orgasm more '' apocalyptic '' than the ones that preceded it the mailer–reader relationship is also integral to mailer 's literary body trope his prose presentation of an existential struggle is frequently conveyed to the reader via references to the body the body is an entity to be poked , prodded , broken , even snuffed into non-existence critiques of mailer based on sexuality , race , and gender , have been levied by authors such as kate millett and bell hooks , among others throughout his writing , mailer never presents a very clear perspective on race his works range from a profound understanding of the african american condition in america to extremely stereotypical depictions of race for the majority of mailer 's career he does not delve directly into race , but chose to pursue the matter only as a side note to the larger currents of the 1960s and 1970s mailer goes on to argue that because of this innate psychopathy , african americans are left to explore the least virtuous areas of civilized life mailer 's analysis culminates in his expression that if african americans were to achieve equality it would have violent and chaotic effects on white society mailer focused on jazz as the ultimate expression of african-american bravado , and figures like miles davis would become represented in works like an american dream to mailer , african-american men reflected a challenge to his own notions of masculinity mailer became even more fascinated with african-americans after meeting baldwin , and this friendship inspired mailer to write '' the white negro '' baldwin said a white american writer '' affords too many opportunities to avoid reality '' the subject of masculinity shows up frequently throughout mailer 's works critics have argued that while mailer says he supports feminism , he unconsciously intertwines his own masculine biases which can be seen through naked and the dead and prisoner of sex mailer 's issues of masculinity can be seen in cummings and hearn 's relationship cummings views this relationship more than a friendship , while hearn does not reciprocate the feeling i wo n't have him actin ' like a goddamn woman , you 're to stop feedin ' him all these books , all this womanish.claptrap '' in the prisoner of sex , mailer questions the women 's liberation movement and the role of women in the society around him he viewed women as questioning societal roles that posed a risk to interfering with masculine roles that had already been established the head-butting and later on-air altercation was described by mailer himself in his essay '' of a small and modest malignancy , wicked and bristling with dots '' michael lennon chose 712 of those letters and published them in selected letters of norman mailer , which covers the period between the 1940s and the early 2000s short stories the short fiction of norman mailer king of the hill : norman mailer on the fight of the century the long patrol : 25 years of writing from the work of norman mailer

mailer 's approach to biography came from his interest in the ego of the artist as an '' exemplary type '' '' ego , '' states lennon , '' can be seen as the beginning of a major phase in his writing career : mailer as biographer '' beginning as an assignment from lawrence schiller to write a short preface to a collection of photographs , mailer 's 1973 biography of monroe ( usually designated marilyn : a biography ) was not approached as a traditional biography mailer read the available biographies , watched monroe 's films , and looked at photographs of monroe ; for the rest of it , mailer stated , '' i speculated '' since mailer did not have the time to thoroughly research the facts surrounding her death , his speculation led to the biography 's controversy the book 's final chapter theorizes that monroe was murdered by rogue agents of the fbi and cia who resented her supposed affair with robert f mailer later admitted that he embellished the book with speculations about monroe 's sex life and death that he did not himself believe to ensure its commercial success in his own autobiography , monroe 's former husband arthur miller wrote that mailer saw himself as monroe '' in drag , acting out his own hollywood fantasies of fame and sex unlimited and power '' the book was enormously successful ; it sold more copies than did any of mailer 's works except the naked and the dead , and it is mailer 's most widely reviewed book it was the inspiration for the emmy-nominated tv movie marilyn : the untold story , which aired in 1980 two later works co-written by mailer presented imagined words and thoughts in monroe 's voice : the 1980 book of women and their elegance and the 1986 play strawhead , which was produced off broadway starring his daughter kate mailer in the wake of the marilyn controversy , mailer attempted to explain his unique approach to biography a number of mailer 's nonfiction works , such as the armies of the night and the presidential papers , are political in the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s and 1970s , his work mingled autobiography , social commentary , history , fiction , and poetry in a formally original way that influenced the development of new journalism mailer held the position that the cold war was not a positive ideal for america mailer saw politics as a sporting event : '' if you played for a team , you did your best to play very well , but there was something obscene '' mailer thought that nixon lost and was demonized only because he played for the wrong team president johnson , mailer thought , was just as bad as nixon had been , but he had good charisma so all was forgiven in december 1963 , mailer and several of the other sponsors left the organization in october 1967 , mailer was arrested for his involvement in an anti-vietnam war demonstration at the pentagon sponsored by the national mobilization committee to end the war in vietnam in 1977 , abbott had read about mailer 's work on the executioner 's song and wrote to mailer , offering to enlighten the author about abbott 's time behind bars and the conditions he was experiencing mailer , impressed , helped to publish in the belly of the beast , a book on life in the prison system consisting of abbott 's letters to mailer once paroled , abbott committed a murder in new york city six weeks after his release , stabbing 22-year-old richard adan to death '' mailer : an ego with an insecure streak in new york city featured key speeches by secretary of state george p the appearance of a government official was derided by many , and as shultz ended his speech , the crowd seethed , with some calling to '' read the protest '' that had been circulated to criticize shultz 's appearance in 2003 , in a speech to the commonwealth club in san francisco , just before the iraq war , mailer said : '' fascism is more of a natural state than democracy mailer '' foresaw the city , its independence secured , splintering into townships and neighborhoods , with their own school systems , police departments , housing programs , and governing philosophies looking back on the campaign , journalist and historian theodore white called it '' one of the most serious campaigns run in the united states in the last five years mailer enjoyed drawing and drew prolifically , particularly toward the end of his life bodily urges are fundamental to mailer 's approach to novels and short works stemming from his freudian philosophical basis , bodily urges are integral to mailer 's work the mailerâ€“reader relationship is also integral to mailer 's literary body trope in addition - and notable for such a prominent mainstream american writer of his generation - mailer , throughout his work and personal communications , repeatedly expresses interest in , includes episodes of or makes references to bisexuality or homosexuality by filling his work with graphic depictions of sex , violence , and even rock and roll , mailer elevates the experience of the reader consistent use of bodily reference or allusion is clearly integral to his depiction of human existence mailer elevates the reader experience , and wrestles the reader for domination while allowing room for interpretation '' kate millett , sexual politics ( garden city , n.y throughout his writing , mailer never presents a very clear perspective on race mailer does , however , spend some time working through the issue in '' the white negro '' , of a fire on the moon , and in his work the fight about the heavyweight title bout between muhammad ali and george foreman mailer goes on to argue that because of this innate psychopathy , african americans are left to explore the least virtuous areas of civilized life mailer 's analysis culminates in his expression that if african americans were to achieve equality it would have violent and chaotic effects on white society mailer uses african americans to criticize the moon landing , as he reflects on the fact that many problems still exist on earth , and within america to mailer , african-american men reflected a challenge to his own notions of masculinity while in paris in 1956 , mailer met the famous african-american author james baldwin mailer became even more fascinated with african-americans after meeting baldwin , and this friendship inspired mailer to write '' the white negro '' to mailer , baldwin was a natural point of intrigue as baldwin was both gay and an african-american author , similar to mailer 's stature their relationship was never a close friendship nor contemptuous , but one of mutual intrigue and a sense of competition existed between the two writers mailer often commented on baldwin 's work , and baldwin did the same to mailer he stated the reason for the decline in his relationship with mailer was '' that myth of the sexuality of negroes which norman , like so many others , refused to give up '' baldwin said a white american writer '' affords too many opportunities to avoid reality '' the subject of masculinity shows up frequently throughout mailer 's works she was the mother of two of his sons , producer michael mailer and actor stephen mailer over the course of his life , mailer was connected with several women other than his wives , including carole mallory , who wrote a '' tell all '' biography , loving mailer , after his death at the december 15 , 1971 , taping of the dick cavett show , with janet flanner and gore vidal , mailer , annoyed with a less-than-stellar review by vidal of prisoner of sex , apparently insulted then head-butted vidal backstage michael lennon chose 712 of those letters and published them in selected letters of norman mailer , which covers the period between the 1940s and the early 2000s the selected letters of norman mailer new york : new american library , 1968

that he embellished the book with speculations about monroe 's sex life and death that he did not himself believe to ensure its commercial success in his own autobiography , monroe 's former husband arthur miller wrote that mailer saw himself as monroe '' in drag , acting out his own hollywood fantasies of fame and sex unlimited and power '' the book was enormously successful ; it sold more copies than did any of mailer 's works except the naked and the dead , and it is mailer 's most widely reviewed book in the wake of the marilyn controversy , mailer attempted to explain his unique approach to biography he suggests that his biography must be seen as a '' species of novel ready to play by the rules of biography a number of mailer 's nonfiction works , such as the armies of the night and the presidential papers , are political in the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s and 1970s , his work mingled autobiography , social commentary , history , fiction , and poetry in a formally original way that influenced the development of new journalism mailer held the position that the cold war was not a positive ideal for america he believed that conservatives were pro-cold war because that was politically relevant to them and would therefore help them win indeed , mailer was outspoken about his mistrust of politics in general as a way of meaningful change in america this

journalist and historian theodore white called it '' one of the most serious campaigns run in the united states in the last five years mailer enjoyed drawing and drew prolifically , particularly toward the end of his life bodily urges are fundamental to mailer 's approach to novels and short works these urges are in tension with the themes of '' apocalypse '' and morality the '' psychopath '' presented in the white negro continues to occupy the central narrative of much of mailer 's work throughout his career these views on sex were not light vices for mailer the mailerâ€“reader relationship is also integral to mailer 's literary body trope moments of physical and sexual power or powerlessness are the climax of the naked and the dead , '' the time of her time '' , and the armies of the night his prose presentation of an existential struggle is frequently conveyed to the reader via references to the body the body is an entity to be poked , prodded , broken , even snuffed into non-existence by filling his work with graphic depictions of sex , violence , and even rock and roll , mailer elevates the experience of the reader critiques of mailer based on sexuality

the white negro '' , of a fire on the moon , and in his work the fight about the heavyweight title bout between muhammad ali and george foreman in '' the white negro '' mailer argues that african americans are psychopaths because they live in a society that hates them ( meaning white society ) , which in turn causes them to hate themselves mailer goes on to argue that because of this innate psychopathy , african americans are left to explore the least virtuous areas of civilized life mailer often directly engaged with racial issues in his works , but some have seen his writings on the subject of race to be problematic mailer became even more fascinated with african-americans after meeting baldwin , and this friendship inspired mailer to write '' the white negro '' mailer often commented on baldwin 's work , and baldwin did the same to mailer baldwin wrote a letter disapproving of mailer 's comments on race and sexuality in '' the white negro '' he stated the reason for the decline in his relationship with mailer was '' that myth of the sexuality of negroes which norman , like so many others , refused to give up '' baldwin said a white american writer '' affords too many opportunities to avoid reality '' the subject of masculinity shows up frequently throughout mailer 's works in naked and the dead , norman mailer examines cummings 's struggle with sexuality while on the frontline during world war ii based on the good war narrative that has been taught , it is not acknowledged that many men sought comfort with men and women another example of the concept of

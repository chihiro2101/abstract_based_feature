pyroelectricity can be visualized as one side of a triangle , where each corner represents energy states in the crystal : kinetic , electrical and thermal energies the side between electrical and thermal corners represents the pyroelectric effect and produces no kinetic energy pyroelectric charge in minerals develops on the opposite faces of asymmetric crystals the direction in which the propagation of the charge tends is usually constant throughout a pyroelectric material , but , in some materials , this direction can be changed by a nearby electric field all known pyroelectric materials are also piezoelectric however , note that some piezoelectric materials have a crystal symmetry that does not allow pyroelectricity pyroelectric materials are mostly hard and crystals , however , soft pyroelectricity can be achieved by using electrets pyroelectricity is measured as the change in net polarization ( a vector ) proportional to a change in temperature the total pyroelectric coefficient measured at constant stress is the sum of the pyroelectric coefficients at constant strain ( primary pyroelectric effect ) and the piezoelectric contribution from thermal expansion ( secondary pyroelectric effect ) spontaneous polarization is temperature dependent , so a good perturbation probe is a change in temperature which induces a flow of charge to and from the surfaces all polar crystals are pyroelectric , so the 10 polar crystal classes are sometimes referred to as the pyroelectric classes pyroelectric materials can be used as infrared and millimeter wavelength radiation detectors the first reference to the pyroelectric effect is found in writings by theophrastus ( c all polar crystals are pyroelectric , so the ten polar crystal classes are sometimes referred to as the pyroelectric classes as pressure is applied , each side of the crystal takes on an opposite charge , resulting in a voltage drop across the crystal although artificial pyroelectric materials have been engineered , the effect was first discovered in minerals such as tourmaline pyroelectric materials have been used to generate large electric fields necessary to steer deuterium ions in a nuclear fusion process

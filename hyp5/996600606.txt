pyroelectricity can be visualized as one side of a triangle , where each corner represents energy states in the crystal : kinetic , electrical and thermal energies the side between electrical and thermal corners represents the pyroelectric effect and produces no kinetic energy the side between kinetic and electrical corners represents the piezoelectric effect and produces no heat pyroelectric charge in minerals develops on the opposite faces of asymmetric crystals the direction in which the propagation of the charge tends is usually constant throughout a pyroelectric material , but , in some materials , this direction can be changed by a nearby electric field all known pyroelectric materials are also piezoelectric however , note that some piezoelectric materials have a crystal symmetry that does not allow pyroelectricity pyroelectric materials are mostly hard and crystals , however , soft pyroelectricity can be achieved by using electrets as a consequence there are no electric dipole equivalents of bar magnets because the intrinsic dipole moment is neutralized by '' free '' electric charge that builds up on the surface by internal conduction or from the ambient atmosphere this is the pyroelectric effect all polar crystals are pyroelectric , so the 10 polar crystal classes are sometimes referred to as the pyroelectric classes the pyroelectric coefficient may be described as the change in the spontaneous polarization vector with temperature : : p_i \frac where p i ( cm −2 k −1 ) is the vector for the pyroelectric coefficient it has the power of attraction , just as amber has , and some say that it not only attracts straws and bits of wood , but also copper and iron , if the pieces are thin , as diokles used to explain any dielectric material develops a dielectric polarization ( electrostatics ) when an electric field is applied , but a substance which has such a natural charge separation even in the absence of a field is called a polar material if this dipole moment changes with the effect of applied temperature changes , applied electric field , or applied pressure , the material is pyroelectric , ferroelectric , or piezoelectric , respectively since all ferroelectric materials exhibit a spontaneous polarization , all ferroelectric materials are also pyroelectric ( but not all pyroelectric materials are ferroelectric ) lithium tantalate ( litao 3 ) is a crystal exhibiting both piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties , which has been used to create small-scale nuclear fusion ( '' pyroelectric fusion '' )

pyroelectricity can be visualized as one side of a triangle , where each corner represents energy states in the crystal : kinetic , electrical and thermal energies the side between electrical and thermal corners represents the pyroelectric effect and produces no kinetic energy the direction in which the propagation of the charge tends is usually constant throughout a pyroelectric material , but , in some materials , this direction can be changed by a nearby electric field however , note that some piezoelectric materials have a crystal symmetry that does not allow pyroelectricity pyroelectric materials are mostly hard and crystals , however , soft pyroelectricity can be achieved by using electrets pyroelectricity is measured as the change in net polarization ( a vector ) proportional to a change in temperature spontaneous polarization is temperature dependent , so a good perturbation probe is a change in temperature which induces a flow of charge to and from the surfaces all polar crystals are pyroelectric , so the 10 polar crystal classes are sometimes referred to as the pyroelectric classes richards , theophrastus : on stones ( columbus , ohio : ohio state university , 1956 ) , page 51 , paragraph 28 of the original text : '' it smaragdos is remarkable in its powers , and so is the lyngourion i.e it has the power of attraction , just as amber has , and some say that it not only attracts straws and bits of wood , but also copper and iron , if the pieces are thin , as diokles used to explain both william thomson in 1878 william thomson ( 1878 ) '' on the thermoelastic , thermomagnetic and pyroelectric properties of matter , '' philosophical magazine , series 5 , vol all crystal structures belong to one of thirty-two crystal classes based on the number of rotational axes and mirror plane they possess that leave the crystal structure unchanged ( point groups ) as pressure is applied , each side of the crystal takes on an opposite charge , resulting in a voltage drop across the crystal pyroelectricity should not be confused with thermoelectricity : in a typical demonstration of pyroelectricity , the whole crystal is changed from one temperature to another , and the result is a temporary voltage across the crystal both effects convert temperature change to electrical potential , but the pyroelectric effect converts temperature change over time into electrical potential , while the thermoelectric effect converts temperature change with position into electrical potential passive infrared sensors are often designed around pyroelectric materials , as the heat of a human or animal from several feet away is enough to generate a voltage pyroelectric materials have been used to generate large electric fields necessary to steer deuterium ions in a nuclear fusion process

pyroelectricity can be visualized as one side of a triangle , where each corner represents energy states in the crystal : kinetic , electrical and thermal energies the side between electrical and thermal corners represents the pyroelectric effect and produces no kinetic energy the side between kinetic and electrical corners represents the piezoelectric effect and produces no heat the direction in which the propagation of the charge tends is usually constant throughout a pyroelectric material , but , in some materials , this direction can be changed by a nearby electric field however , note that some piezoelectric materials have a crystal symmetry that does not allow pyroelectricity pyroelectric materials are mostly hard and crystals , however , soft pyroelectricity can be achieved by using electrets pyroelectricity is measured as the change in net polarization ( a vector ) proportional to a change in temperature the total pyroelectric coefficient measured at constant stress is the sum of the pyroelectric coefficients at constant strain ( primary pyroelectric effect ) and the piezoelectric contribution from thermal expansion ( secondary pyroelectric effect ) spontaneous polarization is temperature dependent , so a good perturbation probe is a change in temperature which induces a flow of charge to and from the surfaces all polar crystals are pyroelectric , so the 10 polar crystal classes are sometimes referred to as the pyroelectric classes the pyroelectric coefficient may be described as the change in the spontaneous polarization vector with temperature : : p_i \frac where p i ( cm −2 k −1 ) is the vector for the pyroelectric coefficient all crystal structures belong to one of thirty-two crystal classes based on the number of rotational axes and mirror plane they possess that leave the crystal structure unchanged ( point groups ) all polar crystals are pyroelectric , so the ten polar crystal classes are sometimes referred to as the pyroelectric classes the piezoelectric effect is exhibited by crystals ( such as quartz or ceramic ) for which an electric voltage across the material appears when pressure is applied pyroelectricity should not be confused with thermoelectricity : in a typical demonstration of pyroelectricity , the whole crystal is changed from one temperature to another , and the result is a temporary voltage across the crystal lithium tantalate ( litao 3 ) is a crystal exhibiting both piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties , which has been used to create small-scale nuclear fusion ( '' pyroelectric fusion '' ) pyroelectric materials have been used to generate large electric fields necessary to steer deuterium ions in a nuclear fusion process

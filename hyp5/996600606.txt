pyroelectricity can be visualized as one side of a triangle , where each corner represents energy states in the crystal : kinetic , electrical and thermal energies the side between kinetic and electrical corners represents the piezoelectric effect and produces no heat pyroelectric charge in minerals develops on the opposite faces of asymmetric crystals despite being pyroelectric , novel materials such as boron aluminum nitride ( baln ) and boron gallium nitride ( bgan ) have zero piezoelectric response for strain along the c-axis at certain compositions , the two properties being closely related however , note that some piezoelectric materials have a crystal symmetry that does not allow pyroelectricity pyroelectric materials are mostly hard and crystals , however , soft pyroelectricity can be achieved by using electrets pyroelectricity is measured as the change in net polarization ( a vector ) proportional to a change in temperature the total pyroelectric coefficient measured at constant stress is the sum of the pyroelectric coefficients at constant strain ( primary pyroelectric effect ) and the piezoelectric contribution from thermal expansion ( secondary pyroelectric effect ) all polar crystals are pyroelectric , so the 10 polar crystal classes are sometimes referred to as the pyroelectric classes the pyroelectric coefficient may be described as the change in the spontaneous polarization vector with temperature : : p_i \frac where p i ( cm −2 k −1 ) is the vector for the pyroelectric coefficient johann georg schmidt , curiöse speculationes bey schalflosen nächten curious speculations during sleepless nights ( chemnitz and leipzig ( germany ) : conrad stössen , 1707 ) , pages 269-270 lang , sourcebook of pyroelectricity , vol all crystal structures belong to one of thirty-two crystal classes based on the number of rotational axes and mirror plane they possess that leave the crystal structure unchanged ( point groups ) any dielectric material develops a dielectric polarization ( electrostatics ) when an electric field is applied , but a substance which has such a natural charge separation even in the absence of a field is called a polar material if this dipole moment changes with the effect of applied temperature changes , applied electric field , or applied pressure , the material is pyroelectric , ferroelectric , or piezoelectric , respectively both effects convert temperature change to electrical potential , but the pyroelectric effect converts temperature change over time into electrical potential , while the thermoelectric effect converts temperature change with position into electrical potential passive infrared sensors are often designed around pyroelectric materials , as the heat of a human or animal from several feet away is enough to generate a voltage

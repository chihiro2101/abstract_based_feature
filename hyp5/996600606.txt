pyroelectricity can be visualized as one side of a triangle , where each corner represents energy states in the crystal : kinetic , electrical and thermal energies the side between electrical and thermal corners represents the pyroelectric effect and produces no kinetic energy the direction in which the propagation of the charge tends is usually constant throughout a pyroelectric material , but , in some materials , this direction can be changed by a nearby electric field however , note that some piezoelectric materials have a crystal symmetry that does not allow pyroelectricity pyroelectricity is measured as the change in net polarization ( a vector ) proportional to a change in temperature the total pyroelectric coefficient measured at constant stress is the sum of the pyroelectric coefficients at constant strain ( primary pyroelectric effect ) and the piezoelectric contribution from thermal expansion ( secondary pyroelectric effect ) under normal circumstances , even polar materials do not display a net dipole moment as a consequence there are no electric dipole equivalents of bar magnets because the intrinsic dipole moment is neutralized by '' free '' electric charge that builds up on the surface by internal conduction or from the ambient atmosphere spontaneous polarization is temperature dependent , so a good perturbation probe is a change in temperature which induces a flow of charge to and from the surfaces this is the pyroelectric effect all polar crystals are pyroelectric , so the 10 polar crystal classes are sometimes referred to as the pyroelectric classes the pyroelectric coefficient may be described as the change in the spontaneous polarization vector with temperature : : p_i \frac where p i ( cm −2 k −1 ) is the vector for the pyroelectric coefficient any dielectric material develops a dielectric polarization ( electrostatics ) when an electric field is applied , but a substance which has such a natural charge separation even in the absence of a field is called a polar material the ferroelectric effect is exhibited by materials which possess an electric polarization in the absence of an externally applied electric field such that the polarization can be reversed if the electric field is reversed pyroelectricity should not be confused with thermoelectricity : in a typical demonstration of pyroelectricity , the whole crystal is changed from one temperature to another , and the result is a temporary voltage across the crystal in a typical demonstration of thermoelectricity , one part of the device is kept at one temperature and the other part at a different temperature , and the result is a permanent voltage across the device as long as there is a temperature difference pyroelectric materials have been used to generate large electric fields necessary to steer deuterium ions in a nuclear fusion process

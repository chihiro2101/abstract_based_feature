tolkien , when deciding maedhros 's name , came up with the sound of it first , and then decided a suitable meaning for the word tolkien explained that the translations of the sindarin roots were meant to match the meaning of maedhros 's quenya names , maitimo '' well-shaped one '' and russandol tolkien wrote maedhros 's name as maedros '' when the latter name first appears in drafts , however , it does not designate the eldest son of fëanor , but his grandfather : fëanor 's father was originally named bruithwir-go-maidros the dragon-helm of dor-lómin was given to maedhros by azaghâl during the first age , in gratitude for saving the life of the dwarf-lord , with whom maedhros forged an alliance in earlier drafts , it is not the dragon-helm maedhros gives to fingon , but the elfstone , which maedhros received from his dying father in s , maglor alone steals the silmaril and casts himself into a pit after maedhros and maglor submit themselves to eönwë , while maedhros breaks the lost silmarils retrieved and restores the light back to the two trees in qi , it is maedhros who is convinced by maglor to regain the silmarils , but is captured by eönwë although it was maglor who , in the silmarillion , took pity on the sons of elwing , earlier versions portrayed maedhros as the one who saved elrond ( elros not appearing until later drafts ) during his travels maedhros befriended fingon , son of fingolfin , though their respective fathers would enter into a bitter feud they return to tirion , however , after maedhros brings tidings of finwë 's murder and the theft of the silmaril keen on peace and unification , maedhros on his part remained in friendship with the houses of fingolfin and finarfin maedhros restrained his brothers ' urge to attack , and instead , sent a message to dior demanding that he yield the silmaril to them , but dior ignored it eärendil and elwing 's sons , elrond and elros were taken captive by maedhros and maglor , but were treated gently and kindly the tolkien scholar verlyn flieger writes that maedhros 's death was caused by the silmarils

christopher tolkien thought that doegred referred to the colour of maedhros 's hair , though this is not certain tolkien , when deciding maedhros 's name , came up with the sound of it first , and then decided a suitable meaning for the word tolkien explained that the translations of the sindarin roots were meant to match the meaning of maedhros 's quenya names , maitimo '' well-shaped one '' and russandol when the latter name first appears in drafts , however , it does not designate the eldest son of fëanor , but his grandfather : fëanor 's father was originally named bruithwir-go-maidros in earlier drafts , it is not the dragon-helm maedhros gives to fingon , but the elfstone , which maedhros received from his dying father '' the fate of the silmarils undergo changes through all three drafts ( which christopher tolkien dubs s , qi , qii ) of the silmarillion in s , maglor alone steals the silmaril and casts himself into a pit after maedhros and maglor submit themselves to eönwë , while maedhros breaks the lost silmarils retrieved and restores the light back to the two trees in qi , it is maedhros who is convinced by maglor to regain the silmarils , but is captured by eönwë in qii , the fate of maedhros and maglor remains the same as in the published silmarillion although it was maglor who , in the silmarillion , took pity on the sons of elwing , earlier versions portrayed maedhros as the one who saved elrond ( elros not appearing until later drafts ) fëanor 's fiery words lead the noldor to middle-earth and the fëanorians to swear their father 's terrible oath to pursue anyone who keeps the silmarils from their possession when fëanor and his sons secretly sail to middle-earth , maedhros is shocked when he realises that they will not return for fingolfin and his host eärendil and elwing 's sons , elrond and elros were taken captive by maedhros and maglor , but were treated gently and kindly the tolkien scholar verlyn flieger writes that maedhros 's death was caused by the silmarils she finds this contradictory , as the silmarils embody the light of the two trees ; tolkien described the silmarils variously as '' holy '' , '' unsullied '' , and '' hallowed '' , but their effect is evil

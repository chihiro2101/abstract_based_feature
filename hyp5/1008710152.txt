christopher tolkien thought that doegred referred to the colour of maedhros 's hair , though this is not certain tolkien , when deciding maedhros 's name , came up with the sound of it first , and then decided a suitable meaning for the word tolkien wrote maedhros 's name as maedros '' when the latter name first appears in drafts , however , it does not designate the eldest son of fëanor , but his grandfather : fëanor 's father was originally named bruithwir-go-maidros the dragon-helm of dor-lómin was given to maedhros by azaghâl during the first age , in gratitude for saving the life of the dwarf-lord , with whom maedhros forged an alliance maedhros later passed it on to fingon in proof of their friendship in earlier drafts , it is not the dragon-helm maedhros gives to fingon , but the elfstone , which maedhros received from his dying father in qi , it is maedhros who is convinced by maglor to regain the silmarils , but is captured by eönwë in qii , the fate of maedhros and maglor remains the same as in the published silmarillion they return to tirion , however , after maedhros brings tidings of finwë 's murder and the theft of the silmaril although fëanor is killed in the dagor-nuin-giliath , morgoth 's forces suffer a crushing defeat eventually fingon finds him and with the help of thorondor , frees him by cutting off maedhros 's right hand this led many of the survivors from east beleriand and dorthonion to rally to maedhros eärendil and elwing 's sons , elrond and elros were taken captive by maedhros and maglor , but were treated gently and kindly the tolkien scholar verlyn flieger writes that maedhros 's death was caused by the silmarils

at the time , a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red , green and blue signals ( rgb ) , broadcast in succession most systems broadcast entire frames in sequence , with a colored filter ( or '' gel '' ) that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors , all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets focusing the right signal on each of these tiny spots was beyond the capability of electron guns of the era , and rca 's early experiments used three-tube projectors , or mirror-based systems known as '' triniscope '' rca eventually solved the problem of displaying the color images with their introduction of the shadow mask stray electrons at the edge of the beam were cut off by the mask , creating a sharply focused spot that was small enough to hit a single colored phosphor on the screen since each of the guns was aimed at the hole from a slightly different angle , the spots of phosphor on the tube could be separated slightly to prevent overlap this led to very dim images , requiring much greater electron beam power in order to provide a useful picture moreover , the system was highly dependent on the relative angles of the beams between the three guns , which required constant adjustment by the user to ensure the guns hit the correct colors the first broadcast using the new standard occurred on new year 's day in 1954 , when nbc broadcast the tournament of roses parade ( blog about this article , ( archived may 4 , 2019 ) in spite of this early start , only a few years after regularly scheduled television broadcasting had begun , consumer uptake of color televisions was very slow to start the dim images , constant adjustments and high costs had kept them in a niche of their own sony had entered the television market in 1960 with the black and white tv8-301 , the first non-projection type all-transistor television but by 1961 , dealers were asking the sony sales department when a color set would be available , and the sales department put pressure on engineering in turn masaru ibuka , sony 's president and co-founder , steadfastly refused to develop a system based on rca 's shadow mask design , which he considered technically deficient this was kihara 's first trip abroad and he spent much of his time wandering the trade floor , where he came across a small booth by the small company autometric they were demonstrating a new type of color television based on the chromatron tube , which used a single electron gun and a vertical grille of electrically charged thin wires instead of a shadow mask the resulting image was far brighter than anything the rca design could produce , and lacked the convergence problems that required constant adjustments he quickly brought morita and ibuka to see the design , and morita was '' sold '' on the spot by september 1964 , a 17-inch prototype had been built in japan , but mass-production test runs were demonstrating serious problems ibuka had bet the company on chromatron and had already set up a new factory to produce them with the hopes that the production problems would be ironed out and the line would become profitable later that week , on saturday , miyaoka was summoned to ibuka 's office while he was attempting to leave work to attend his weekly cello practice the following monday , ibuka announced that sony would be developing a new color television tube , based on miyaoka 's prototype 47 by february 1967 , the focusing problems had been solved , and because there was a single gun , the focusing was achieved with permanent magnets instead of a coil , and required no manual adjustments after manufacturing ge 's system improved on the rca shadow mask by replacing the small round holes with slightly larger rectangles ohgoshi proposed removing the mask entirely and replacing it with a series of vertical slots instead , lighting the entire screen this problem was solved by running several fine tungsten wires across the grille horizontally to keep the vertical wires of the grille in place the combination of three-in-one electron gun and the replacement of the shadow mask with the aperture grille resulted in a unique and easily patentable product in spite of trinitron and chromatron having no technology in common , the shared single electron gun has led to many erroneous claims that the two are very similar , or the same '' sony trinitron color television receiver , c 1970 '' is a common publication claiming that trinitron and chromatron are the same officially introduced by ibuka in april 1968 , the original 12 & nbsp ; inch trinitron had a display quality that easily surpassed any commercial set in terms of brightness , color fidelity , and simplicity of operation the decoder inside the uk-sold sony color trinitron sets , from the kv-1300ub to the kv-1330ub , had an ntsc decoder adapted for pal the decoder used a 64 microsecond delay line to store every other line , but instead of using the delay line to average out the phase of the current line and the previous line , it simply repeated the same line twice sony won an emmy award for the trinitron in 1973 in the mid-1980s , a new phosphor coating was introduced that was much darker than earlier sets , giving the screens a black color when turned off , as opposed to the earlier light grey after the expiration of sony 's trinitron patent , manufacturers like mitsubishi ( whose monitor production is now part of nec display solutions ) were free to use the trinitron design for their own product line without license from sony although they could not use the trinitron name monitors using trinitron technology have one or more thin tungsten wires running horizontally across the grille to prevent this trinitron : sony 's once unbeatable product sony trinitron explained

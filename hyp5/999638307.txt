at the time , a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red , green and blue signals ( rgb ) , broadcast in succession most systems broadcast entire frames in sequence , with a colored filter ( or '' gel '' ) that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube in spite of these problems , the united states federal communication commission selected a sequential-frame 144 frame/s standard from cbs as their color broadcast in 1950 ed reitan , '' cbs field sequential color system '' , 24 august 1997 rca worked along different lines entirely , using the luminance-chrominance system this system did not directly encode or transmit the rgb signals ; instead it combined these colors into one overall brightness figure , the '' luminance '' luminance closely matched the black and white signal of existing broadcasts , allowing it to be displayed on existing televisions on color sets the signal would be extracted , decoded back into rgb , and displayed although rca 's system had enormous benefits , it had not been successfully developed because it was difficult to produce the display tubes black and white tvs used a continuous signal and the tube could be coated with an even deposit of phosphor focusing the right signal on each of these tiny spots was beyond the capability of electron guns of the era , and rca 's early experiments used three-tube projectors , or mirror-based systems known as '' triniscope '' rca eventually solved the problem of displaying the color images with their introduction of the shadow mask the shadow mask consists of a thin sheet of steel with tiny holes photo etched into it , placed just behind the front surface of the picture tube three guns , arranged in a triangle , were all aimed at the holes since each of the guns was aimed at the hole from a slightly different angle , the spots of phosphor on the tube could be separated slightly to prevent overlap this led to very dim images , requiring much greater electron beam power in order to provide a useful picture moreover , the system was highly dependent on the relative angles of the beams between the three guns , which required constant adjustment by the user to ensure the guns hit the correct colors the first broadcast using the new standard occurred on new year 's day in 1954 , when nbc broadcast the tournament of roses parade ( blog about this article , ( archived may 4 , 2019 ) in spite of this early start , only a few years after regularly scheduled television broadcasting had begun , consumer uptake of color televisions was very slow to start low consumer acceptance led to a lack of color programming , further reducing the demand for the sets in a supply and demand problem sony had entered the television market in 1960 with the black and white tv8-301 , the first non-projection type all-transistor television a combination of factors , including its small screen size , limited its sales to niche markets sony engineers had been studying the color market , but the situation in japan was even worse than the u.s masaru ibuka , sony 's president and co-founder , steadfastly refused to develop a system based on rca 's shadow mask design , which he considered technically deficient when sets were finally made available in late 1964 , they were put on the market at a competitive 198,000 yen ( us 550 ) , but cost the company over 400,000 yen ( us 1111.11 ) to produce ibuka had bet the company on chromatron and had already set up a new factory to produce them with the hopes that the production problems would be ironed out and the line would become profitable his report was cause for concern in japan , where it seemed sony was falling ever-farther behind the u.s since the guns were in-line , their electrons would land onto three rectangular patches instead of three smaller spots , about doubling the lit area although this would require the guns to be very carefully aligned with the phosphors on the tube in order to ensure they hit the right colors , with miyaoka 's new tube , this appeared possible the combination of three-in-one electron gun and the replacement of the shadow mask with the aperture grille resulted in a unique and easily patentable product in spite of trinitron and chromatron having no technology in common , the shared single electron gun has led to many erroneous claims that the two are very similar , or the same '' sony trinitron color television receiver , c 1970 '' is a common publication claiming that trinitron and chromatron are the same officially introduced by ibuka in april 1968 , the original 12 & nbsp ; inch trinitron had a display quality that easily surpassed any commercial set in terms of brightness , color fidelity , and simplicity of operation sony started developing the trinitron for computer monitor use in the late 1970s demand was high , so high that there were examples of third party companies removing trinitron tubes from televisions to use as monitors sony responded with the fd trinitron , which used computer-controlled feedback systems to ensure sharp focus across a flat screen both of these technologies have well known problems , and for some time sony explored a wide array of technologies that would improve upon them in the same way the trinitron did on the shadow mask sony eventually ended production of the trinitron in japan in 2004 trinitron : sony 's once unbeatable product sony trinitron explained

color television had been studied , but it was only in the late 1940s that the problem was seriously considered at the time , a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red , green and blue signals ( rgb ) , broadcast in succession most systems broadcast entire frames in sequence , with a colored filter ( or '' gel '' ) that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors , all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets ed reitan , '' cbs field sequential color system '' , 24 august 1997 rca worked along different lines entirely , using the luminance-chrominance system this system did not directly encode or transmit the rgb signals ; instead it combined these colors into one overall brightness figure , the '' luminance '' luminance closely matched the black and white signal of existing broadcasts , allowing it to be displayed on existing televisions although rca 's system had enormous benefits , it had not been successfully developed because it was difficult to produce the display tubes focusing the right signal on each of these tiny spots was beyond the capability of electron guns of the era , and rca 's early experiments used three-tube projectors , or mirror-based systems known as '' triniscope '' rca eventually solved the problem of displaying the color images with their introduction of the shadow mask since each of the guns was aimed at the hole from a slightly different angle , the spots of phosphor on the tube could be separated slightly to prevent overlap to ensure there was no overlap of the beam on the screen , the dots had to be separated and covered perhaps 25 % of its surface this led to very dim images , requiring much greater electron beam power in order to provide a useful picture moreover , the system was highly dependent on the relative angles of the beams between the three guns , which required constant adjustment by the user to ensure the guns hit the correct colors sony had entered the television market in 1960 with the black and white tv8-301 , the first non-projection type all-transistor television sony engineers had been studying the color market , but the situation in japan was even worse than the u.s the resulting image was far brighter than anything the rca design could produce , and lacked the convergence problems that required constant adjustments he quickly brought morita and ibuka to see the design , and morita was '' sold '' on the spot to look for potential licenses , and was impressed with the improvements that rca had made in overall brightness by introducing new rare earth phosphors on the screen his report was cause for concern in japan , where it seemed sony was falling ever-farther behind the u.s 46 ibuka was not willing to give up entirely , and had his 30 engineers explore a wide variety of approaches to see if they could come up with their own design ge 's system improved on the rca shadow mask by replacing the small round holes with slightly larger rectangles since the guns were in-line , their electrons would land onto three rectangular patches instead of three smaller spots , about doubling the lit area ohgoshi proposed removing the mask entirely and replacing it with a series of vertical slots instead , lighting the entire screen the combination of three-in-one electron gun and the replacement of the shadow mask with the aperture grille resulted in a unique and easily patentable product in spite of trinitron and chromatron having no technology in common , the shared single electron gun has led to many erroneous claims that the two are very similar , or the same '' sony trinitron color television receiver , c 1970 '' is a common publication claiming that trinitron and chromatron are the same the vertical wires in the aperture grille meant that the tube had to be nearly flat vertically ; this gave it a unique cylindrical look it was also all solid state , with the exception of the picture tube itself , which allowed it to be much more compact and cool running than designs like ge 's porta-color 48 the kv-1210 was introduced in limited numbers in japan in october as promised , and in the u.s the decoder inside the uk-sold sony color trinitron sets , from the kv-1300ub to the kv-1330ub , had an ntsc decoder adapted for pal reviews of the trinitron were universally positive , although they all mentioned its high cost on his 84th birthday in 1992 , ibuka claimed the trinitron was his proudest product in 1990 , sony released the first hd trinitron tv set , for use with the multiple sub-nyquist sampling encoding standard in 1980 , sony introduced the '' profeel '' line of prosumer component televisions , consisting of a range of trinitron monitors that could be connected to standardized tuners demand was high , so high that there were examples of third party companies removing trinitron tubes from televisions to use as monitors in comparison to early shadow mask designs , the trinitron grille cuts off much less of the signal coming from the electron guns trinitron : sony 's once unbeatable product sony trinitron explained

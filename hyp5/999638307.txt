most systems broadcast entire frames in sequence , with a colored filter ( or '' gel '' ) that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube another problem was that the mechanical filter made them flicker unless very high refresh rates were used in spite of these problems , the united states federal communication commission selected a sequential-frame 144 frame/s standard from cbs as their color broadcast in 1950 ed reitan , '' cbs field sequential color system '' , 24 august 1997 rca worked along different lines entirely , using the luminance-chrominance system this system did not directly encode or transmit the rgb signals ; instead it combined these colors into one overall brightness figure , the '' luminance '' on color sets the signal would be extracted , decoded back into rgb , and displayed although rca 's system had enormous benefits , it had not been successfully developed because it was difficult to produce the display tubes black and white tvs used a continuous signal and the tube could be coated with an even deposit of phosphor rca eventually solved the problem of displaying the color images with their introduction of the shadow mask the shadow mask consists of a thin sheet of steel with tiny holes photo etched into it , placed just behind the front surface of the picture tube this led to very dim images , requiring much greater electron beam power in order to provide a useful picture in spite of this , the technical superiority of the rca system was overwhelming compared to the cbs system , and was selected as the new ntsc standard in 1953 the first broadcast using the new standard occurred on new year 's day in 1954 , when nbc broadcast the tournament of roses parade low consumer acceptance led to a lack of color programming , further reducing the demand for the sets in a supply and demand problem in the united states in 1960 , only 1 color set was sold for every 50 sets sold in total sony had entered the television market in 1960 with the black and white tv8-301 , the first non-projection type all-transistor television 43 in 1961 , a sony delegation was visiting the ieee trade show in new york city , including ibuka , akio morita ( sony 's other co-founder ) and nobutoshi kihara , who was promoting his new cv-2000 home video tape recorder they were demonstrating a new type of color television based on the chromatron tube , which used a single electron gun and a vertical grille of electrically charged thin wires instead of a shadow mask in early 1963 , senri miyaoka was sent to manhattan to arrange the transfer of the technology to sony , which would lead to the closing of chromatic labs when sets were finally made available in late 1964 , they were put on the market at a competitive 198,000 yen ( us 550 ) , but cost the company over 400,000 yen ( us 1111.11 ) to produce ibuka had bet the company on chromatron and had already set up a new factory to produce them with the hopes that the production problems would be ironed out and the line would become profitable in the autumn of 1966 , ibuka finally gave in , and announced he would personally lead a search for a replacement for chromatron to look for potential licenses , and was impressed with the improvements that rca had made in overall brightness by introducing new rare earth phosphors on the screen he also saw general electric 's '' porta-color '' design , using three guns in a row instead of a triangle , which allowed a greater portion of the screen to be lit the following monday , ibuka announced that sony would be developing a new color television tube , based on miyaoka 's prototype during development , sony engineer akio ohgoshi introduced another modification ge 's system improved on the rca shadow mask by replacing the small round holes with slightly larger rectangles since the guns were in-line , their electrons would land onto three rectangular patches instead of three smaller spots , about doubling the lit area ohgoshi proposed removing the mask entirely and replacing it with a series of vertical slots instead , lighting the entire screen in practice , this proved easy to build but difficult to place in the tube & ndash ; the fine wires were mechanically weak and tended to move when the tubes were bumped , resulting in shifting colors on the screen this problem was solved by running several fine tungsten wires across the grille horizontally to keep the vertical wires of the grille in place the combination of three-in-one electron gun and the replacement of the shadow mask with the aperture grille resulted in a unique and easily patentable product in spite of trinitron and chromatron having no technology in common , the shared single electron gun has led to many erroneous claims that the two are very similar , or the same sony started developing the trinitron for computer monitor use in the late 1970s new uses in the computer field and the demand for higher resolution televisions to match the quality of dvd when it was introduced in 1996 led to increased sales , with another 180 million units delivered in the next decade the electrons from the cathodes are all aimed toward a single point at the back of the screen where they hit the aperture grille , a steel sheet with vertical slots cut in it in the shadow mask design , the size of the holes in the mask is defined by the required resolution of the phosphor dots on the screen , which was constant trinitron : sony 's once unbeatable product sony trinitron explained

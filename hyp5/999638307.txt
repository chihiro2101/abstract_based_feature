at the time , a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red , green and blue signals ( rgb ) , broadcast in succession most systems broadcast entire frames in sequence , with a colored filter ( or '' gel '' ) that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors , all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets another problem was that the mechanical filter made them flicker unless very high refresh rates were used in spite of these problems , the united states federal communication commission selected a sequential-frame 144 frame/s standard from cbs as their color broadcast in 1950 ed reitan , '' cbs field sequential color system '' , 24 august 1997 rca worked along different lines entirely , using the luminance-chrominance system black and white tvs used a continuous signal and the tube could be coated with an even deposit of phosphor with the compatible color encoding scheme originally developed by georges valensi in 1938 , the color was changing continually along the line , which was far too fast for any sort of mechanical filter to follow focusing the right signal on each of these tiny spots was beyond the capability of electron guns of the era , and rca 's early experiments used three-tube projectors , or mirror-based systems known as '' triniscope '' rca eventually solved the problem of displaying the color images with their introduction of the shadow mask the shadow mask consists of a thin sheet of steel with tiny holes photo etched into it , placed just behind the front surface of the picture tube stray electrons at the edge of the beam were cut off by the mask , creating a sharply focused spot that was small enough to hit a single colored phosphor on the screen this led to very dim images , requiring much greater electron beam power in order to provide a useful picture moreover , the system was highly dependent on the relative angles of the beams between the three guns , which required constant adjustment by the user to ensure the guns hit the correct colors in spite of this , the technical superiority of the rca system was overwhelming compared to the cbs system , and was selected as the new ntsc standard in 1953 low consumer acceptance led to a lack of color programming , further reducing the demand for the sets in a supply and demand problem sony engineers had been studying the color market , but the situation in japan was even worse than the u.s but by 1961 , dealers were asking the sony sales department when a color set would be available , and the sales department put pressure on engineering in turn masaru ibuka , sony 's president and co-founder , steadfastly refused to develop a system based on rca 's shadow mask design , which he considered technically deficient they were demonstrating a new type of color television based on the chromatron tube , which used a single electron gun and a vertical grille of electrically charged thin wires instead of a shadow mask he quickly brought morita and ibuka to see the design , and morita was '' sold '' on the spot 44 morita arranged a deal with paramount pictures , who was paying for chromatic labs ' development of the chromatron , taking over the entire project to look for potential licenses , and was impressed with the improvements that rca had made in overall brightness by introducing new rare earth phosphors on the screen at one point , yoshida asked senri miyaoka if the in-line gun arrangement used by ge could be replaced by a single gun with three cathodes ; this would be more difficult to build , but be lower cost in the long run later that week , on saturday , miyaoka was summoned to ibuka 's office while he was attempting to leave work to attend his weekly cello practice the following monday , ibuka announced that sony would be developing a new color television tube , based on miyaoka 's prototype ge 's system improved on the rca shadow mask by replacing the small round holes with slightly larger rectangles since the guns were in-line , their electrons would land onto three rectangular patches instead of three smaller spots , about doubling the lit area in practice , this proved easy to build but difficult to place in the tube & ndash ; the fine wires were mechanically weak and tended to move when the tubes were bumped , resulting in shifting colors on the screen this problem was solved by running several fine tungsten wires across the grille horizontally to keep the vertical wires of the grille in place the combination of three-in-one electron gun and the replacement of the shadow mask with the aperture grille resulted in a unique and easily patentable product '' sony trinitron color television receiver , c 1970 '' is a common publication claiming that trinitron and chromatron are the same early color sets intended for the uk market had a pal decoder that was different from those invented and licensed by telefunken of germany , who invented the pal color system the decoder inside the uk-sold sony color trinitron sets , from the kv-1300ub to the kv-1330ub , had an ntsc decoder adapted for pal in april 1981 , they announced the sony hdvs ( hdvs ) , a suite of muse equipment including cameras , recorders , trinitron monitors and projection tvs the single gun consists of a long-necked tube with a single electrode at its base , flaring out into a horizontally-aligned rectangular shape with three rectangular cathodes inside in comparison to early shadow mask designs , the trinitron grille cuts off much less of the signal coming from the electron guns trinitron : sony 's once unbeatable product sony trinitron explained

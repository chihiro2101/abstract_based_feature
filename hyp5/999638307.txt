at the time , a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red , green and blue signals ( rgb ) , broadcast in succession most systems broadcast entire frames in sequence , with a colored filter ( or '' gel '' ) that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors , all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets ed reitan , '' cbs field sequential color system '' , 24 august 1997 rca worked along different lines entirely , using the luminance-chrominance system this system did not directly encode or transmit the rgb signals ; instead it combined these colors into one overall brightness figure , the '' luminance '' luminance closely matched the black and white signal of existing broadcasts , allowing it to be displayed on existing televisions on color sets the signal would be extracted , decoded back into rgb , and displayed although rca 's system had enormous benefits , it had not been successfully developed because it was difficult to produce the display tubes ed reitan , '' rca dot sequential color system '' , 28 august 1997 the shadow mask consists of a thin sheet of steel with tiny holes photo etched into it , placed just behind the front surface of the picture tube to ensure there was no overlap of the beam on the screen , the dots had to be separated and covered perhaps 25 % of its surface low consumer acceptance led to a lack of color programming , further reducing the demand for the sets in a supply and demand problem in the united states in 1960 , only 1 color set was sold for every 50 sets sold in total sony had entered the television market in 1960 with the black and white tv8-301 , the first non-projection type all-transistor television sony engineers had been studying the color market , but the situation in japan was even worse than the u.s but by 1961 , dealers were asking the sony sales department when a color set would be available , and the sales department put pressure on engineering in turn they were demonstrating a new type of color television based on the chromatron tube , which used a single electron gun and a vertical grille of electrically charged thin wires instead of a shadow mask in early 1963 , senri miyaoka was sent to manhattan to arrange the transfer of the technology to sony , which would lead to the closing of chromatic labs the american team was only too happy to point out the serious flaws in the chromatron system , telling miyaoka that the design was hopeless by 1966 , the chromatron was breaking the company financially to look for potential licenses , and was impressed with the improvements that rca had made in overall brightness by introducing new rare earth phosphors on the screen they might be forced to license the shadow mask system if they wanted to remain competitive the following monday , ibuka announced that sony would be developing a new color television tube , based on miyaoka 's prototype ohgoshi proposed removing the mask entirely and replacing it with a series of vertical slots instead , lighting the entire screen although this would require the guns to be very carefully aligned with the phosphors on the tube in order to ensure they hit the right colors , with miyaoka 's new tube , this appeared possible the combination of three-in-one electron gun and the replacement of the shadow mask with the aperture grille resulted in a unique and easily patentable product in spite of trinitron and chromatron having no technology in common , the shared single electron gun has led to many erroneous claims that the two are very similar , or the same '' sony trinitron color television receiver , c 1970 '' is a common publication claiming that trinitron and chromatron are the same the vertical wires in the aperture grille meant that the tube had to be nearly flat vertically ; this gave it a unique cylindrical look ibuka ended the press conference by claiming that 10,000 sets would be available by october , well beyond what engineering had told him was possible early color sets intended for the uk market had a pal decoder that was different from those invented and licensed by telefunken of germany , who invented the pal color system the decoder inside the uk-sold sony color trinitron sets , from the kv-1300ub to the kv-1330ub , had an ntsc decoder adapted for pal any phase errors could then be compensated for by using a tint control knob on the front of the set , normally unneeded on a pal set in 1980 , sony introduced the '' profeel '' line of prosumer component televisions , consisting of a range of trinitron monitors that could be connected to standardized tuners sony eventually ended production of the trinitron in japan in 2004 the trinitron design incorporates two unique features : the single-gun three-cathode picture tube , and the vertically aligned aperture grille monitors using trinitron technology have one or more thin tungsten wires running horizontally across the grille to prevent this trinitron : sony 's once unbeatable product sony trinitron explained

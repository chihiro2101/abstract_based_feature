an example of spatial aliasing is the moir√© pattern observed in a poorly pixelized image of a brick wall aliasing can be caused either by the sampling stage or the reconstruction stage ; these may be distinguished by calling sampling aliasing prealiasing and reconstruction aliasing postaliasing temporal aliasing is a major concern in the sampling of video and audio signals if a piece of music is sampled at 32,000 sampling rate ( hz ) , any frequency components at or above 16,000 hz ( the nyquist frequency for this sampling rate ) will cause aliasing when the music is reproduced by a digital-to-analog converter ( dac ) to prevent this , an anti-aliasing filter is used to remove components above the nyquist frequency prior to sampling some of the most dramatic and subtle examples of aliasing occur when the signal being sampled also has periodic content sometimes aliasing is used intentionally on signals with no low-frequency content , called bandpass signals see sampling ( signal processing ) , nyquist rate ( relative to sampling ) , and filter bank that is typically approximated by filtering the original signal to attenuate high frequency components before it is sampled this unwanted signal is known as an image or alias of the desired signal

if the image data is processed in some way during sampling or reconstruction , the reconstructed image will differ from the original image , and an alias is seen aliasing can be caused either by the sampling stage or the reconstruction stage ; these may be distinguished by calling sampling aliasing prealiasing and reconstruction aliasing postaliasing temporal aliasing is a major concern in the sampling of video and audio signals if a piece of music is sampled at 32,000 sampling rate ( hz ) , any frequency components at or above 16,000 hz ( the nyquist frequency for this sampling rate ) will cause aliasing when the music is reproduced by a digital-to-analog converter ( dac ) to prevent this , an anti-aliasing filter is used to remove components above the nyquist frequency prior to sampling temporal aliasing frequencies in video and cinematography are determined by the frame rate of the camera , but the relative intensity of the aliased frequencies is determined by the shutter timing ( exposure time ) or the use of a temporal aliasing reduction filter during filming undersampling , which creates low-frequency aliases , can produce the same result , with less effort , as frequency-shifting the signal to lower frequencies before sampling at the lower rate when sampling a function at frequency & nbsp ; is met for the highest frequency component of the original signal , then it is met for all the frequency components , a condition called the nyquist criterion six sawtooth waves are played in succession , with the first two sawtooths having a fundamental frequency of 440 & nbsp ; hz ( a4 ) , the second two having fundamental frequency of 880 & nbsp ; hz ( a5 ) , and the final two at 1,760 & nbsp ; hz ( a6 ) the aliasing distortion in the lower frequencies is increasingly obvious with higher fundamental frequencies , and while the bandlimited sawtooth is still clear at 1,760 & nbsp ; hz , the aliased sawtooth is degraded and harsh with a buzzing audible at frequencies lower than the fundamental

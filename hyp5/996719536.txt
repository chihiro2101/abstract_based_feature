if the image data is processed in some way during sampling or reconstruction , the reconstructed image will differ from the original image , and an alias is seen aliasing can be caused either by the sampling stage or the reconstruction stage ; these may be distinguished by calling sampling aliasing prealiasing and reconstruction aliasing postaliasing temporal aliasing is a major concern in the sampling of video and audio signals if a piece of music is sampled at 32,000 sampling rate ( hz ) , any frequency components at or above 16,000 hz ( the nyquist frequency for this sampling rate ) will cause aliasing when the music is reproduced by a digital-to-analog converter ( dac ) the high frequencies in the analog signal will appear as lower frequencies ( wrong alias ) in the recorded digital sample and , hence , can not be reproduced by the dac some of the most dramatic and subtle examples of aliasing occur when the signal being sampled also has periodic content when sampling a function at frequency & nbsp ; is met for the highest frequency component of the original signal , then it is met for all the frequency components , a condition called the nyquist criterion that is typically approximated by filtering the original signal to attenuate high frequency components before it is sampled aliasing occurs whenever the use of discrete elements to capture or produce a continuous signal causes frequency ambiguity a form of spatial aliasing can also occur in antenna arrays or microphone arrays used to estimate the direction of arrival of a wave signal , as in geophysical exploration by seismic waves

when a digital image is viewed , a reconstruction is performed by a display or printer device , and by the eyes and the brain temporal aliasing is a major concern in the sampling of video and audio signals if a piece of music is sampled at 32,000 sampling rate ( hz ) , any frequency components at or above 16,000 hz ( the nyquist frequency for this sampling rate ) will cause aliasing when the music is reproduced by a digital-to-analog converter ( dac ) the high frequencies in the analog signal will appear as lower frequencies ( wrong alias ) in the recorded digital sample and , hence , can not be reproduced by the dac temporal aliasing frequencies in video and cinematography are determined by the frame rate of the camera , but the relative intensity of the aliased frequencies is determined by the shutter timing ( exposure time ) or the use of a temporal aliasing reduction filter during filming audio signals are sampled ( digitized ) with an analog-to-digital converter , which produces a constant number of samples per second some of the most dramatic and subtle examples of aliasing occur when the signal being sampled also has periodic content undersampling , which creates low-frequency aliases , can produce the same result , with less effort , as frequency-shifting the signal to lower frequencies before sampling at the lower rate when sampling a function at frequency & nbsp ; is met for the highest frequency component of the original signal , then it is met for all the frequency components , a condition called the nyquist criterion when the receiver shifts multiple signals down to lower frequencies , from rf to if by heterodyne , an unwanted signal , from an rf frequency equally far from the local oscillator ( lo ) frequency as the desired signal , but on the wrong side of the lo , can end up at the same if frequency as the wanted one

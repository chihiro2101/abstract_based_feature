major drainage basins of the world the following is a list of the major ocean basins : about 48.7 % of the world 's land drains to the atlantic ocean the two major mediterranean seas of the world also flow to the atlantic : the caribbean sea and gulf of mexico basin includes most of the u.s the mediterranean sea basin includes much of north africa , east-central africa ( through the nile river ) , southern , central , and eastern europe , turkey , and the coastal areas of israel , lebanon , and syria the indian ocean 's drainage basin also comprises about 13 % of earth 's land some of these , such as the great basin , are not single drainage basins but collections of separate , adjacent closed basins drainage basins have been historically important for determining territorial boundaries , particularly in regions where trade by water has been important in hydrology , the drainage basin is a logical unit of focus for studying the movement of water within the hydrological cycle , because the majority of water that discharges from the basin outlet originated as precipitation falling on the basin a portion of the water that enters the groundwater system beneath the drainage basin may flow towards the outlet of another drainage basin because groundwater flow directions do not always match those of their overlying drainage network isochrone maps can be used to show the time taken for runoff water within a drainage basin to reach a lake , reservoir or outlet , assuming constant and uniform effective rainfall with the water , they are transported towards the outlet of the basin , and can affect the ecological processes along the way as well as in the receiving water source nile basin initiative , omvs for senegal river , mekong river commission are a few examples of arrangements involving management of shared river basins management of shared drainage basins is also seen as a way to build lasting peaceful relationships among countries rain that falls in steep mountainous areas will reach the primary river in the drainage basin faster than flat or lightly sloping areas ( e.g it is also determined on the basis of length and width of the drainage basin

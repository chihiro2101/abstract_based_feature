major drainage basins of the world drainage basins of the principal oceans and seas of the world the following is a list of the major ocean basins : about 48.7 % of the world 's land drains to the atlantic ocean in north america , surface water drains to the atlantic via the saint lawrence river and great lakes basins , the eastern seaboard of the united states , the maritimes , and most of newfoundland and labrador the two major mediterranean seas of the world also flow to the atlantic : the caribbean sea and gulf of mexico basin includes most of the u.s the indian ocean 's drainage basin also comprises about 13 % of earth 's land the five largest river basins ( by area ) , from largest to smallest , are the basins of the amazon ( 7m km , the congo ( 4m km , the nile ( 3.4m km , the mississippi ( 3.22m km , and the río de la plata ( 3.17m km the three rivers that drain the most water , from most to least , are the amazon , ganga , and congo rivers some of these , such as the great basin , are not single drainage basins but collections of separate , adjacent closed basins , international treaty and , within the us , interstate compacts ) or other political entities in a particular drainage basin to manage the body or bodies of water into which it drains in hydrology , the drainage basin is a logical unit of focus for studying the movement of water within the hydrological cycle , because the majority of water that discharges from the basin outlet originated as precipitation falling on the basin a portion of the water that enters the groundwater system beneath the drainage basin may flow towards the outlet of another drainage basin because groundwater flow directions do not always match those of their overlying drainage network in the thiessen polygon method , the drainage basin is divided into polygons with the rain gauge in the middle of each polygon assumed to be representative for the rainfall on the area of land included in its polygon in brazil , the national policy of water resources , regulated by act n° 9.433 of 1997 , establishes the drainage basin as the territorial division of brazilian water management rain that falls in steep mountainous areas will reach the primary river in the drainage basin faster than flat or lightly sloping areas ( e.g

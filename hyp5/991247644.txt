the following is a list of the major ocean basins : about 48.7 % of the world 's land drains to the atlantic ocean in north america , surface water drains to the atlantic via the saint lawrence river and great lakes basins , the eastern seaboard of the united states , the maritimes , and most of newfoundland and labrador nearly all of south america east of the andes also drains to the atlantic , as does most of western and central europe and the greatest portion of western sub-saharan africa , as well as western sahara and part of morocco the two major mediterranean seas of the world also flow to the atlantic : the caribbean sea and gulf of mexico basin includes most of the u.s the mediterranean sea basin includes much of north africa , east-central africa ( through the nile river ) , southern , central , and eastern europe , turkey , and the coastal areas of israel , lebanon , and syria the indian ocean 's drainage basin also comprises about 13 % of earth 's land the five largest river basins ( by area ) , from largest to smallest , are the basins of the amazon ( 7m km , the congo ( 4m km , the nile ( 3.4m km , the mississippi ( 3.22m km , and the río de la plata ( 3.17m km other endorheic regions include the great basin in the united states , much of the sahara desert , the drainage basin of the okavango river ( kalahari basin ) , highlands near the african great lakes , the interiors of australia and the arabian peninsula , and parts in mexico and the andes in endorheic bodies of water where evaporation is the primary means of water loss , the water is typically more saline than the oceans in hydrology , the drainage basin is a logical unit of focus for studying the movement of water within the hydrological cycle , because the majority of water that discharges from the basin outlet originated as precipitation falling on the basin a portion of the water that enters the groundwater system beneath the drainage basin may flow towards the outlet of another drainage basin because groundwater flow directions do not always match those of their overlying drainage network rain gauge data is used to measure total precipitation over a drainage basin , and there are different ways to interpret that data in brazil , the national policy of water resources , regulated by act n° 9.433 of 1997 , establishes the drainage basin as the territorial division of brazilian water management catchment topography and shape determine the time taken for rain to reach the river , while catchment size , soil type , and development determine the amount of water to reach the river size will help determine the amount of water reaching the river , as the larger the catchment the greater the potential for flooding

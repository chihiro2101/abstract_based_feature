drainage basins of the principal oceans and seas of the world in north america , surface water drains to the atlantic via the saint lawrence river and great lakes basins , the eastern seaboard of the united states , the maritimes , and most of newfoundland and labrador the two major mediterranean seas of the world also flow to the atlantic : the caribbean sea and gulf of mexico basin includes most of the u.s the indian ocean 's drainage basin also comprises about 13 % of earth 's land endorheic basin are inland basins that do not drain to an ocean some of these , such as the great basin , are not single drainage basins but collections of separate , adjacent closed basins drainage basins have been historically important for determining territorial boundaries , particularly in regions where trade by water has been important in hydrology , the drainage basin is a logical unit of focus for studying the movement of water within the hydrological cycle , because the majority of water that discharges from the basin outlet originated as precipitation falling on the basin a portion of the water that enters the groundwater system beneath the drainage basin may flow towards the outlet of another drainage basin because groundwater flow directions do not always match those of their overlying drainage network measurement of the discharge of water from a basin may be made by a stream gauge located at the basin 's outlet rain gauge data is used to measure total precipitation over a drainage basin , and there are different ways to interpret that data a drainage basin is the source for water and sediment that moves from higher elevation through the river system to lower elevations as they reshape the channel forms in brazil , the national policy of water resources , regulated by act nÂ° 9.433 of 1997 , establishes the drainage basin as the territorial division of brazilian water management management of shared drainage basins is also seen as a way to build lasting peaceful relationships among countries size will help determine the amount of water reaching the river , as the larger the catchment the greater the potential for flooding

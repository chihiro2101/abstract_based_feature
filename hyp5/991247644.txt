major drainage basins of the world drainage basins of the principal oceans and seas of the world in north america , surface water drains to the atlantic via the saint lawrence river and great lakes basins , the eastern seaboard of the united states , the maritimes , and most of newfoundland and labrador the two major mediterranean seas of the world also flow to the atlantic : the caribbean sea and gulf of mexico basin includes most of the u.s the mediterranean sea basin includes much of north africa , east-central africa ( through the nile river ) , southern , central , and eastern europe , turkey , and the coastal areas of israel , lebanon , and syria the indian ocean 's drainage basin also comprises about 13 % of earth 's land it drains the eastern coast of africa , the coasts of the red sea and the persian gulf , the indian subcontinent , burma , and most of australia some of these , such as the great basin , are not single drainage basins but collections of separate , adjacent closed basins , international treaty and , within the us , interstate compacts ) or other political entities in a particular drainage basin to manage the body or bodies of water into which it drains in hydrology , the drainage basin is a logical unit of focus for studying the movement of water within the hydrological cycle , because the majority of water that discharges from the basin outlet originated as precipitation falling on the basin a portion of the water that enters the groundwater system beneath the drainage basin may flow towards the outlet of another drainage basin because groundwater flow directions do not always match those of their overlying drainage network measurement of the discharge of water from a basin may be made by a stream gauge located at the basin 's outlet because drainage basins are coherent entities in a hydro-logical sense , it has become common to manage water resources on the basis of individual basins management of shared drainage basins is also seen as a way to build lasting peaceful relationships among countries rain that falls in steep mountainous areas will reach the primary river in the drainage basin faster than flat or lightly sloping areas ( e.g

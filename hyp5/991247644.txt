major drainage basins of the world drainage basins of the principal oceans and seas of the world in north america , surface water drains to the atlantic via the saint lawrence river and great lakes basins , the eastern seaboard of the united states , the maritimes , and most of newfoundland and labrador the two major mediterranean seas of the world also flow to the atlantic : the caribbean sea and gulf of mexico basin includes most of the u.s the mediterranean sea basin includes much of north africa , east-central africa ( through the nile river ) , southern , central , and eastern europe , turkey , and the coastal areas of israel , lebanon , and syria the indian ocean 's drainage basin also comprises about 13 % of earth 's land some of these , such as the great basin , are not single drainage basins but collections of separate , adjacent closed basins in endorheic bodies of water where evaporation is the primary means of water loss , the water is typically more saline than the oceans drainage basins have been historically important for determining territorial boundaries , particularly in regions where trade by water has been important in hydrology , the drainage basin is a logical unit of focus for studying the movement of water within the hydrological cycle , because the majority of water that discharges from the basin outlet originated as precipitation falling on the basin a portion of the water that enters the groundwater system beneath the drainage basin may flow towards the outlet of another drainage basin because groundwater flow directions do not always match those of their overlying drainage network rain gauge data is used to measure total precipitation over a drainage basin , and there are different ways to interpret that data a drainage basin is the source for water and sediment that moves from higher elevation through the river system to lower elevations as they reshape the channel forms because drainage basins are coherent entities in a hydro-logical sense , it has become common to manage water resources on the basis of individual basins nile basin initiative , omvs for senegal river , mekong river commission are a few examples of arrangements involving management of shared river basins

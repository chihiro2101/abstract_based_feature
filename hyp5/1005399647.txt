the edema is a white translucent fluid that causes a bulging ( distension ) of the vocal cord the most common clinical symptom associated with reinke 's edema is an abnormally low pitched voice with hoarseness the swelling of the vocal cords and the lowering of the voice are warning signs that an individual has reinke 's edema at the microscopic level , an examination of the vocal cords in patients with reinke 's edema will show lowered levels of collagen , elastin , and extracellular matrix these characteristics can be used to diagnose reinke 's edema reinke 's edema is considered a benign tumor that may become precancerous if smoking is involved smoking , gastric reflux , and hypothyroidism are all risk factors for reinke 's edema in the case of smoking , as long as the individual continues the habit of smoking , the reinke 's edema will continue to progress smoking is the number one cause of reinke 's edema other factors include gastroesophageal reflux , hypothyroidism and chronic overuse of the voice females also report more physical discomfort due to reinke 's edema the risk of reinke 's edema increases with age and also with prolonged exposure to smoking similarly , the only way to prevent reinke 's edema is to avoid smoking the two layers of the vocal cords that vibrate are the reinke 's space and the overlying epithelium because men normally have a lower voice than women , the change is more noticeable in women this is known as bilateral reinke 's edema the progression of reinke 's edema is gradual and is directly related to the duration of exposure to risk factors , such as smoking and gastric reflux the swelling of the vocal folds cause ballooned-like appearance , known as a polyp there is no familial or heredity link to reinke 's edema most cases of reinke 's edema are bilateral - effecting both vocal cords - rather than unilateral while smoking is a clear risk factor to reinke 's edema , other risk factors are being identified to explain reinke 's edema in nonsmokers the co2 laser has been successfully incorporated into the surgical technique , however , there are several other lasers being investigated for use in reinke 's edema

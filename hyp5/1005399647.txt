the edema is a white translucent fluid that causes a bulging ( distension ) of the vocal cord the most common clinical symptom associated with reinke 's edema is an abnormally low pitched voice with hoarseness the swelling of the vocal cords and the lowering of the voice are warning signs that an individual has reinke 's edema at the microscopic level , an examination of the vocal cords in patients with reinke 's edema will show lowered levels of collagen , elastin , and extracellular matrix these characteristics can be used to diagnose reinke 's edema reinke 's edema is considered a benign tumor that may become precancerous if smoking is involved smoking , gastric reflux , and hypothyroidism are all risk factors for reinke 's edema in the case of smoking , as long as the individual continues the habit of smoking , the reinke 's edema will continue to progress smoking is the number one cause of reinke 's edema for example , an individual who smokes and also has gastric reflux would have an increased susceptibility for developing reinke 's edema over time females also report more physical discomfort due to reinke 's edema the risk of reinke 's edema increases with age and also with prolonged exposure to smoking accumulation of fluid within the reinke 's space alters the elasticity of the vocal cord , making it less stiff and more gelatinous normally , the vocal cords are surrounded by neatly aligned blood vessels , however , these blood vessels can become disarranged and fragile in reinke 's edema the progression of reinke 's edema is gradual and is directly related to the duration of exposure to risk factors , such as smoking and gastric reflux the “ pale ” type of reinke 's edema is defined by a glazed appearance of the vocal cords with a clear ( colorless ) fluid underneath the advanced “ livid ” type of reinke 's edema is identified by an increased amount of fluid , accompanied by a color change from colorless to yellow-grey the swelling of the vocal folds cause ballooned-like appearance , known as a polyp reinke 's edema is often diagnosed by an ear , nose & throat ( ent ) specialist or an otolaryngologist by examination of the vocal folds most cases of reinke 's edema are bilateral - effecting both vocal cords - rather than unilateral while smoking is a clear risk factor to reinke 's edema , other risk factors are being identified to explain reinke 's edema in nonsmokers due to the importance of the reinke 's space in speech , it is important that minimally invasive techniques be perfected that minimize the risk of complications

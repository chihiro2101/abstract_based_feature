the edema is a white translucent fluid that causes a bulging ( distension ) of the vocal cord the most common clinical symptom associated with reinke 's edema is an abnormally low pitched voice with hoarseness the low pitch voice is a direct result of increased fluid in the reinke 's space , which vibrates at a lower frequency than normal ( females hoarseness is a common problem of many larynx diseases , such as laryngitis the swelling of the vocal cords and the lowering of the voice are warning signs that an individual has reinke 's edema at the microscopic level , an examination of the vocal cords in patients with reinke 's edema will show lowered levels of collagen , elastin , and extracellular matrix reinke 's edema is considered a benign tumor that may become precancerous if smoking is involved smoking , gastric reflux , and hypothyroidism are all risk factors for reinke 's edema the symptoms of reinke 's edema are considered to be chronic symptoms because they develop gradually over time and depend on how long the individual is exposed to the risk factor additionally , the combination of several risk factors increase the likelihood of an individual developing reinke 's edema for example , an individual who smokes and also has gastric reflux would have an increased susceptibility for developing reinke 's edema over time reinke 's edema is commonly diagnosed in middle-aged females with a history of smoking ( aged 50 years or older ) because the disease is heavily linked to smoking , there is no established way to screen for reinke 's edema the two layers of the vocal cords that vibrate are the reinke 's space and the overlying epithelium edema usually occurs on both vocal cords this is known as bilateral reinke 's edema the progression of reinke 's edema is gradual and is directly related to the duration of exposure to risk factors , such as smoking and gastric reflux the “ pale ” type of reinke 's edema is defined by a glazed appearance of the vocal cords with a clear ( colorless ) fluid underneath the polyps of reinke 's edema are usually benign , however , there may be a risk of cancer if the patient is a smoker the first step in treating reinke 's edema is to eliminate or control those risk factors that are causing the disease most cases of reinke 's edema are bilateral - effecting both vocal cords - rather than unilateral other complications of surgery include tissue scarring due to damage to the vocal ligament during the incision and vocal cord stiffening due to over-suctioning of the superficial lamina propria ( reinke 's space ) while smoking is a clear risk factor to reinke 's edema , other risk factors are being identified to explain reinke 's edema in nonsmokers

the temple stands on a terrace raised higher than the city it is made of three rectangular galleries rising to a central tower , each level higher than the last each gallery has a gopura at each of the points , and the two inner galleries each have towers at their corners , forming a quincunx with the central tower because the temple faces west , the features are all set back towards the east , leaving more space to be filled in each enclosure and gallery on the west side ; for the same reason the west-facing steps are shallower than those on the other sides the outer gallery measures by , with pavilions rather than towers at the corners connecting the outer gallery to the second enclosure on the west side is a cruciform cloister called preah poan ( meaning '' the thousand buddhas '' gallery ) this area has many inscriptions relating the good deeds of pilgrims , most written in khmer but others in burmese and japanese beyond , the second and inner galleries are connected to each other and to two flanking libraries by another cruciform terrace , again a later addition this inner gallery , called the bakan , is a square with axial galleries connecting each gopura with the central shrine , and subsidiary shrines located below the corner towers the shrine itself , originally occupied by a statue of vishnu and open on each side , was walled in when the temple was converted to theravada buddhism , the new walls featuring standing buddhas sappho marchal , khmer costumes and ornaments of the devatas of angkor wat the blocks were presumably put in place by a combination of elephants , coir ropes , pulleys and bamboo scaffolding some scholars have suggested that these were used to join them together with iron rods , but others claim they were used to hold temporary pegs to help manoeuvre them into place moreover , unlike the egyptian pyramids which use limestone quarried barely away all the time , the entire city of angkor was built with sandstone quarried ( or more ) away however , etsuo uchida and ichita shimoda of waseda university in tokyo , japan have discovered in 2011 a shorter canal connecting mount kulen and angkor wat using satellite imagery the war damage to angkor wat 's temples however has been very limited , compared to the rest of cambodia 's temple ruins , and it has also received the most attentive restoration however , work on angkor was abandoned during the khmer rouge era and the conservation d'angkor was disbanded in 1975 between 1986 and 1992 , the archaeological survey of india carried out restoration work on the temple , as france did not recognise the cambodian government at the time zoning of the area was set up to protect the angkor site in 1994 , apsara was established in 1995 to protect and manage the area , and a law to protect cambodian heritage was passed in 1996 a number of countries such as france , japan and china are currently involved in various angkor wat conservation projects the organisation 's survey found that around 20 % of the devatas were in very poor condition , mainly because of natural erosion and deterioration of the stone but in part also due to earlier restoration efforts world monuments fund began conservation work on the churning of the sea of milk gallery in 2008 after several years of studies on its condition most visited angkor wat , which received over two million foreign tourists in 2013 , and 2.6 million by 2018 since this local atmosphere is the key component to projects like angkor tourist city , the local officials continue to discuss how to successfully incorporate future tourism without sacrificing local values and culture falser , michael ( 2020 ) angkor wat â€“ a transcultural history of heritage

troy weight probably takes its name from the french market town of troyes where english merchants traded at least as early as the early 9th century troy weight referred to the tower system ; the earliest reference to the modern troy weights is in 1414 many aspects of the troy weight system were indirectly derived from the roman currency the troy ounce in use today is essentially the same as the british imperial troy ounce ( 1824â€“1971 ) , adopted as an official weight standard for united states coinage by act of congress on may 19 , 1828 the british imperial troy ounce ( known more commonly simply as the imperial troy ounce ) was based on , and virtually identical with , the pre-1824 british troy ounce and the pre-1707 english troy ounce ) troy ounces have been used in england since about 1400 and the english troy ounce was officially adopted for coinage in 1527 the only troy weight in widespread use today is the british imperial troy ounce and its american counterpart the british empire abolished the 12-ounce troy pound in the 19th century , though it has been retained ( although rarely used ) in the american system english troy weights were nearly identical to the troy weight system of bremen because of the international yard and pound agreement , one troy ounce ( oz t ) equals exactly grams we can derive an exact value for the troy ounce as follows : :1 lb an avoirdupois pound also equals 7,000 grains ( the international yard and pound agreement did not change the grain values of non-metric units )

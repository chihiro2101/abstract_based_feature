a vast and unprecedented international star-mapping project was initiated in 1887 by paris observatory director amédée mouchez , who realized the potential of the new dry plate to revolutionize the process of making maps of the stars different observatories around the world were charged with surveying specific declination zones ( see table ) the astrographic catalogue plates , of typically 6 & nbsp ; minutes exposure , were in due course photographed , measured , and published in their entirety they yielded a catalogue of positions and magnitudes down to about 11.5 & nbsp ; mag , and the programme was largely completed during the first quarter of the 20th century most of the carte du ciel plates used three exposures of 20 & nbsp ; minutes duration , displaced to form an equilateral triangle with sides of 10 & nbsp ; arcsec , making it easy to distinguish stars from plate flaws , and asteroids from stars turner , 1912 the great star map , being a brief general account of the international project known as the astrographic chart ( john murray ) other aspects are covered in various papers in the proceedings of iau symposium number & nbsp ; 133 held in 1988 for the astrographic catalogue , 20 observatories from around the world participated in exposing and measuring more than 22,000 glass plates ( see table ) the plates were turned over to a large number of semi-skilled '' computers '' to determine the positions of the stars on each plate the original goal of 11 & nbsp ; mag for the limiting magnitude was generally surpassed , however , with some observatories routinely measuring stars as faint as 13 & nbsp ; mag the still-more-ambitious carte du ciel component of the programme was undertaken by some of the participating observatories , but neither completed nor even started by others the stars from the hipparcos catalogue were used to establish a detailed reference framework at the various epochs of the astrographic catalogue plates , while the 2.5 million stars in the tycho-2 catalogue provided a dense reference framework to allow the plate distortions to be accurately calibrated and corrected

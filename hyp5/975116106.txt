a vast and unprecedented international star-mapping project was initiated in 1887 by paris observatory director amédée mouchez , who realized the potential of the new dry plate to revolutionize the process of making maps of the stars the astrographic catalogue plates , of typically 6 & nbsp ; minutes exposure , were in due course photographed , measured , and published in their entirety they yielded a catalogue of positions and magnitudes down to about 11.5 & nbsp ; mag , and the programme was largely completed during the first quarter of the 20th century these plates were to be reproduced and distributed as a set of charts , the carte du ciel , in contrast to previous sky charts which had been constructed from the celestial coordinates of stars observed by transit instruments most of the carte du ciel plates used three exposures of 20 & nbsp ; minutes duration , displaced to form an equilateral triangle with sides of 10 & nbsp ; arcsec , making it easy to distinguish stars from plate flaws , and asteroids from stars for the astrographic catalogue , 20 observatories from around the world participated in exposing and measuring more than 22,000 glass plates ( see table ) the '' computers '' would manually measure each star with respect to the dozen or so reference stars within that particular plate , and then perform calculations to determine the star 's right ascension and declination the original goal of 11 & nbsp ; mag for the limiting magnitude was generally surpassed , however , with some observatories routinely measuring stars as faint as 13 & nbsp ; mag the vast amount of work invested in the astrographic catalogue , taking plates , measuring , and publishing , looked for a long time as giving only a marginal scientific profit the stars from the hipparcos catalogue were used to establish a detailed reference framework at the various epochs of the astrographic catalogue plates , while the 2.5 million stars in the tycho-2 catalogue provided a dense reference framework to allow the plate distortions to be accurately calibrated and corrected long portrayed as an object lesson in overambition , the astrographic catalogue has more recently turned into a lesson in the way that old data can find new uses

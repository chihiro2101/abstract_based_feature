different observatories around the world were charged with surveying specific declination zones ( see table ) the astrographic catalogue plates , of typically 6 & nbsp ; minutes exposure , were in due course photographed , measured , and published in their entirety they yielded a catalogue of positions and magnitudes down to about 11.5 & nbsp ; mag , and the programme was largely completed during the first quarter of the 20th century for the second goal , a second set of plates , with longer exposures but minimal overlap , was to photograph all stars to 14 & nbsp ; mag most of the carte du ciel plates used three exposures of 20 & nbsp ; minutes duration , displaced to form an equilateral triangle with sides of 10 & nbsp ; arcsec , making it easy to distinguish stars from plate flaws , and asteroids from stars for the astrographic catalogue , 20 observatories from around the world participated in exposing and measuring more than 22,000 glass plates ( see table ) the first such plate was taken in august 1891 at the vatican observatory ( where the exposures took more than 27 & nbsp ; years to complete ) , and the last in december 1950 at the ukkel observatory ( brussels ) , with most observations being made between 1895 and 1920 the original goal of 11 & nbsp ; mag for the limiting magnitude was generally surpassed , however , with some observatories routinely measuring stars as faint as 13 & nbsp ; mag the vast amount of work invested in the astrographic catalogue , taking plates , measuring , and publishing , looked for a long time as giving only a marginal scientific profit the stars from the hipparcos catalogue were used to establish a detailed reference framework at the various epochs of the astrographic catalogue plates , while the 2.5 million stars in the tycho-2 catalogue provided a dense reference framework to allow the plate distortions to be accurately calibrated and corrected aside from the 120,000 stars of the hipparcos catalogue itself , the resulting tycho-2 catalogue ( compiled at the copenhagen university observatory under the leadership of erik h√∏g ) is now the largest , most accurate and most complete , star catalogue of the brightest stars on the sky

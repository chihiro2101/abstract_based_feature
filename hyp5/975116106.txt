a vast and unprecedented international star-mapping project was initiated in 1887 by paris observatory director amédée mouchez , who realized the potential of the new dry plate to revolutionize the process of making maps of the stars different observatories around the world were charged with surveying specific declination zones ( see table ) the astrographic catalogue plates , of typically 6 & nbsp ; minutes exposure , were in due course photographed , measured , and published in their entirety they yielded a catalogue of positions and magnitudes down to about 11.5 & nbsp ; mag , and the programme was largely completed during the first quarter of the 20th century these plates were to be reproduced and distributed as a set of charts , the carte du ciel , in contrast to previous sky charts which had been constructed from the celestial coordinates of stars observed by transit instruments most of the carte du ciel plates used three exposures of 20 & nbsp ; minutes duration , displaced to form an equilateral triangle with sides of 10 & nbsp ; arcsec , making it easy to distinguish stars from plate flaws , and asteroids from stars a fascinating contemporary account of this vast international astronomical collaboration , published in 1912 , is given by herbert hall turner , then savilian professor of astronomy at oxford university to compensate for plate defects , each area of the sky was photographed twice , using a two-fold , corner-to-centre overlap pattern , extended at the zone boundaries , such that each observatory 's plates would overlap with those of the adjacent zones the original goal of 11 & nbsp ; mag for the limiting magnitude was generally surpassed , however , with some observatories routinely measuring stars as faint as 13 & nbsp ; mag the still-more-ambitious carte du ciel component of the programme was undertaken by some of the participating observatories , but neither completed nor even started by others the proper motions of all the tycho catalogue stars could then be derived especially thanks to the astrographic catalogue , but additionally using star positions from more than 140 other ground-based catalogues

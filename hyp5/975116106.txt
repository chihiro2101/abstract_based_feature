a vast and unprecedented international star-mapping project was initiated in 1887 by paris observatory director amédée mouchez , who realized the potential of the new dry plate to revolutionize the process of making maps of the stars they yielded a catalogue of positions and magnitudes down to about 11.5 & nbsp ; mag , and the programme was largely completed during the first quarter of the 20th century these plates were to be reproduced and distributed as a set of charts , the carte du ciel , in contrast to previous sky charts which had been constructed from the celestial coordinates of stars observed by transit instruments for the astrographic catalogue , 20 observatories from around the world participated in exposing and measuring more than 22,000 glass plates ( see table ) around half of the observatories ordered telescopes from the paul henry and prosper henry in france , with others coming from the factory of howard grubb of dublin many factors , such as reference catalogue , reduction technique and print formats were left up to the individual institutions for decades the astrographic catalogue was largely ignored the still-more-ambitious carte du ciel component of the programme was undertaken by some of the participating observatories , but neither completed nor even started by others the proper motions of all the tycho catalogue stars could then be derived especially thanks to the astrographic catalogue , but additionally using star positions from more than 140 other ground-based catalogues aside from the 120,000 stars of the hipparcos catalogue itself , the resulting tycho-2 catalogue ( compiled at the copenhagen university observatory under the leadership of erik høg ) is now the largest , most accurate and most complete , star catalogue of the brightest stars on the sky some believe it is also the story of how the best european observatories of the 19th century lost their leadership in astronomical research by committing so many resources to this one undertaking

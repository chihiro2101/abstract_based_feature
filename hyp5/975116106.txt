the astrographic catalogue plates , of typically 6 & nbsp ; minutes exposure , were in due course photographed , measured , and published in their entirety they yielded a catalogue of positions and magnitudes down to about 11.5 & nbsp ; mag , and the programme was largely completed during the first quarter of the 20th century for the second goal , a second set of plates , with longer exposures but minimal overlap , was to photograph all stars to 14 & nbsp ; mag these plates were to be reproduced and distributed as a set of charts , the carte du ciel , in contrast to previous sky charts which had been constructed from the celestial coordinates of stars observed by transit instruments most of the carte du ciel plates used three exposures of 20 & nbsp ; minutes duration , displaced to form an equilateral triangle with sides of 10 & nbsp ; arcsec , making it easy to distinguish stars from plate flaws , and asteroids from stars for the astrographic catalogue , 20 observatories from around the world participated in exposing and measuring more than 22,000 glass plates ( see table ) the participating observatories agreed to use a standardized telescope so that all plates had a similar scale of approximately 60 & nbsp ; arcsec/mm the original goal of 11 & nbsp ; mag for the limiting magnitude was generally surpassed , however , with some observatories routinely measuring stars as faint as 13 & nbsp ; mag the plate measurements ( as rectangular coordinates ) , as well as the formulae to transform them to equatorial coordinates , were published in the original volumes of the astrographic catalogue , although the accompanying equatorial coordinates are now of only historical interest the stars from the hipparcos catalogue were used to establish a detailed reference framework at the various epochs of the astrographic catalogue plates , while the 2.5 million stars in the tycho-2 catalogue provided a dense reference framework to allow the plate distortions to be accurately calibrated and corrected aside from the 120,000 stars of the hipparcos catalogue itself , the resulting tycho-2 catalogue ( compiled at the copenhagen university observatory under the leadership of erik h√∏g ) is now the largest , most accurate and most complete , star catalogue of the brightest stars on the sky

the playfair cipher was the first cipher to encrypt pairs of letters in cryptologic history wheatstone invented the cipher for secrecy in telegraphy , but it carries the name of his friend lord playfair , first baron playfair of st the first recorded description of the playfair cipher was in a document signed by wheatstone on 26 march 1854 the playfair cipher uses a 5 by 5 table containing a key ( cryptography ) memorization of the keyword and 4 simple rules was all that was required to create the 5 by 5 table and use the cipher the keyword together with the conventions for filling in the 5 by 5 table constitute the cipher key to encrypt a message , one would break the message into digrams ( groups of 2 letters ) such that , for example , '' helloworld '' becomes '' he ll ow or ld '' to perform the substitution , apply the following 4 rules , in order , to each pair of letters in the plaintext : if both letters are the same ( or only one letter is left ) , add an '' x '' after the first letter if the letters appear on the same row of your table , replace them with the letters to their immediate right respectively ( wrapping around to the left side of the row if a letter in the original pair was on the right side of the row ) if the letters appear on the same column of your table , replace them with the letters immediately below respectively ( wrapping around to the top side of the column if a letter in the original pair was on the bottom side of the column ) like most classical ciphers , the playfair cipher can be easily cracked if there is enough text if there are no double letter digrams in the ciphertext and the length of the message is long enough to make this statistically significant , it is very likely that the method of encryption is playfair another cryptanalysis of a playfair cipher can be found in chapter xxi of helen fouch√© gaines , cryptanalysis / a study of ciphers and their solutions the german army , air force and police used the double playfair cipher as a medium-grade cipher in wwii , based on the british playfair cipher they had broken early in wwi solvers can then construct the key table by pairing the digrams ( it is sometimes possible to guess the keyword , but never necessary ) in the novel york : the map of stars ( part three of a trilogy for children ) by laura ruby , a clue to solving the morningstarr cipher is encrypted using the playfair cipher .

a ghz experiment is performed using a quantum system in a greenberger–horne–zeilinger state of a ghz state is three photons in an entangled state , with the photons being in a superposition of being all horizontally polarized ( hhh ) or all vertically polarized ( vvv ) , with respect to some coordinate system prior to any measurements being made , the polarizations of the photons are indeterminate ; if a measurement is made on one of the photons using a two-channel polarizer aligned with the axes of the coordinate system , the photon assumes either horizontal or vertical polarization , with 50 % probability for each orientation , and the other two photons immediately assume the identical polarization for specific combinations of orientations , perfect ( rather than statistical ) correlations between the three polarizations are predicted by both local hidden variable theory ( aka '' local realism '' ) and by quantum mechanical theory , and the predictions may be contradictory for instance , if the polarization of two of the photons are measured and determined to be rotated +45° from horizontal , then local hidden variable theory predicts that the polarization of the third photon will also be +45° from horizontal for any one signal which has been detected by a in one particular trial , b must have detected precisely one signal in the same trial , and c must have detected precisely one signal in the same trial ; and vice versa there are ( at least ) two distinguishable settings being considered for each , namely a 's settings a 1 , and a 2 , b 's settings b 1 , and b 2 , and c 's settings c 1 , and c 2 however , ghz and collaborators also require that the hidden variable argument to functions a ( ) , b ( ) , and c ( ) may take the same value , λ , even in distinct trials , being characterized by distinct experimental contexts

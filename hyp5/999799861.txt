a ghz experiment is performed using a quantum system in a greenberger–horne–zeilinger state of a ghz state is three photons in an entangled state , with the photons being in a superposition of being all horizontally polarized ( hhh ) or all vertically polarized ( vvv ) , with respect to some coordinate system in a ghz experiment regarding photon polarization , however , a set of measurements is performed on the three entangled photons using two-channel polarizers set to various orientations relative to the coordinate system for specific combinations of orientations , perfect ( rather than statistical ) correlations between the three polarizations are predicted by both local hidden variable theory ( aka '' local realism '' ) and by quantum mechanical theory , and the predictions may be contradictory the results of actual experiments agree with the predictions of quantum mechanics , not those of local realism however , ghz and collaborators also require that the hidden variable argument to functions a ( ) , b ( ) , and c ( ) may take the same value , λ , even in distinct trials , being characterized by distinct experimental contexts since equations ( 1 ) through ( 4 ) above can not be satisfied simultaneously when the hidden variable , λ , takes the same value in each equation , ghsz proceed by allowing λ to take different values in each equation with this assumption , p ( λ 1 ) can be determined by choosing the apparatus settings a 2 , b 2 , and c 2 , counting the number of triples for which the outcome is -1 , and dividing by the total number of triples observed at that setting

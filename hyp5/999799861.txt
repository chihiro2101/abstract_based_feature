zeilinger , dance of the photons , farrar , straus and giroux , new york , 2010 , pp for specific combinations of orientations , perfect ( rather than statistical ) correlations between the three polarizations are predicted by both local hidden variable theory ( aka '' local realism '' ) and by quantum mechanical theory , and the predictions may be contradictory for any one signal which has been detected by a in one particular trial , b must have detected precisely one signal in the same trial , and c must have detected precisely one signal in the same trial ; and vice versa trial s for instance would be characterized by a 's setting a 2 , b 's setting b 2 , and c 's settings c 2 ; another trial , r , would be characterized by a 's setting a 2 , b 's setting b 2 , and c 's settings c 1 , and so on ( since c 's settings are distinct between trials r and s , therefore these two trials are distinct the notion of local hidden variables is now introduced by considering the following question : can the individual detection outcomes and corresponding counts as obtained by any one observer , e.g however , ghz and collaborators also require that the hidden variable argument to functions a ( ) , b ( ) , and c ( ) may take the same value , Î» , even in distinct trials , being characterized by distinct experimental contexts fair sampling assumes that these inefficiencies are unrelated to the hidden variables ; in other words , the number of triples actually detected in any run of the experiment is proportional to the number that would have been detected if the apparatus had no inefficiencies - with the same constant of proportionality for all possible settings of the apparatus

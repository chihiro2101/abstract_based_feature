a ghz experiment is performed using a quantum system in a greenberger–horne–zeilinger state of a ghz state is three photons in an entangled state , with the photons being in a superposition of being all horizontally polarized ( hhh ) or all vertically polarized ( vvv ) , with respect to some coordinate system in a ghz experiment regarding photon polarization , however , a set of measurements is performed on the three entangled photons using two-channel polarizers set to various orientations relative to the coordinate system for specific combinations of orientations , perfect ( rather than statistical ) correlations between the three polarizations are predicted by both local hidden variable theory ( aka '' local realism '' ) and by quantum mechanical theory , and the predictions may be contradictory for instance , if the polarization of two of the photons are measured and determined to be rotated +45° from horizontal , then local hidden variable theory predicts that the polarization of the third photon will also be +45° from horizontal the results of actual experiments agree with the predictions of quantum mechanics , not those of local realism following an argument by john stewart bell , each trial is now characterized by particular individual adjustable apparatus parameters , or settings of the observers involved there are ( at least ) two distinguishable settings being considered for each , namely a 's settings a 1 , and a 2 , b 's settings b 1 , and b 2 , and c 's settings c 1 , and c 2

the word semaphore was coined in 1801 by the french inventor of the semaphore line itself , claude chappe groundbreaking scientific experiments , inventions & discoveries of the 18th century , jonathan shectman , p 60 however , the french army preferred to call chappe 's semaphore system the telegraph , meaning '' far writer '' , which was coined by french statesman andré françois miot de mélito semaphore telegraphs are also called , '' chappe telegraphs '' or '' napoleonic semaphore '' optical telegraphy dates from ancient times , in the form of hydraulic telegraphs , torches ( as used by ancient cultures since the discovery of fire ) and smoke signals one of the first experiments of optical signalling was carried out by the anglo-irish landowner and inventor , sir richard lovell edgeworth in 1767 a series of two such signals gave a total 64 code elements and a third signal took it up to 512 he returned to his idea in 1795 , after hearing of chappe 's system credit for the first successful optical telegraph goes to the french engineer claude chappe and his brothers in 1792 , who succeeded in covering france with a network of 556 stations stretching a total distance of le système chappe was used for military and national communications until the 1850s during 1790–1795 , at the height of the french revolution , france needed a swift and reliable military communications system to thwart the war efforts of its enemies the only advantage france held was the lack of cooperation between the allied forces due to their inadequate lines of communication patrice flichy , dynamics of modern communication , p 53 chappe settled on an optical system and the first public demonstration occurred on 2 march 1791 between brûlon and parcé , a distance of the system consisted of a modified pendulum clock at each end with dials marked with ten numerals in their preliminary experiments over a shorter distance , the chappes had banged a pan for synchronisation the message to be sent was chosen by town officials at brûlon and sent by rené chappe to claude chappe at parcé who had no pre-knowledge of the message the message read '' si vous réussissez , vous serez bientôt couverts de gloire '' ( if you succeed , you will soon bask in glory ) in the summer of 1792 claude was appointed ingénieur-télégraphiste and charged with establishing a line of stations between paris and lille , a distance of 230 kilometres ( about 143 miles ) the speed of the line varied with the weather , but the line to lille typically transferred 36 symbols , a complete message , in about 32 minutes another line of 50 stations was completed in 1798 , covering 488 & nbsp ; km between paris and strasbourg 213 to speed up transmission and to provide some semblance of security , a code book was developed for use with semaphore lines the revised chappe system of 1795 provided not only a set of codes but also an operational protocol intended to maximize line throughput step 1 , movement 2 ( transmission ) : the operator positioned the indicator arms for current symbol and waited for the downline station to copy it in this manner , each symbol could propagate down the line as quickly as operators could successfully copy it , with acknowledgement and flow control built into the protocol a symbol sent from paris took 2 minutes to reach lille through 22 stations and 9 minutes to reach lyon through 50 stations this corresponds to only 0.4–0.6 wpm , but with messages limited to those contained in the code book , this could be dramatically increased after chappe 's initial line ( between paris and lille ) , the paris to strasbourg with 50 stations followed soon after ( 1798 ) in 1801 he had abraham chappe build an extra-large station to transmit across the english channel in preparation for an invasion of britain a pair of such stations were built on a test line over a comparable distance in 1812 , napoleon took up another design of abraham chappe for a mobile telegraph that could be taken with him on campaign he employed rectangular framework towers with six five-foot-high octagonal shutters on horizontal axes that flipped between horizontal and vertical positions to signal mr gamble also proposed two distinct five-element systems in 1795 : one using five shutters , and one using five ten-foot poles an experimental semaphore line between the admiralty and chatham was installed in july 1816 , and its success helped to confirm the choice subsequently , the admiralty decided to establish a permanent link to portsmouth and built a chain of semaphore stations each of the arms of pasley 's system could take on one of eight positions and it thus had more codepoints than popham's holzmann & pehrson , p there will be public access on certain days when the restoration is complete the board of the port of liverpool obtained a private act of parliament to construct a chain of popham optical semaphore stations from liverpool to holyhead in 1825 faster than the wind , the liverpool to holyhead telegraph , frank large , an avid publication the system was designed and part-owned by barnard l the line is possibly the only example of an optical telegraph built entirely for commercial purposes it was used so that observers at holyhead could report incoming ships to the port of liverpool and trading could begin in the cargo being carried before the ship docked the madrid-cadiz line was the first to be dismantled in 1855 , but other segments of the optical system continued to function until the end of the carlist wars in 1876 the details of the early chappe system are not known precisely ; the first operating instructions to survive date to 1809 and the french system is not as fully explained as the swedish the early swedish system was more flexible , having the ability to set up message connections between arbitrary stations 188 another feature that would be considered advanced in a modern electronic system is the dynamic changing of transmission rates by the mid-19th century , the optical telegraph was well known enough to be referenced in popular works without special explanation

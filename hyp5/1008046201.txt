the word semaphore was coined in 1801 by the french inventor of the semaphore line itself , claude chappe 172 he composed it from the greek elements σῆμα ( sêma , '' sign '' ) ; and from φορός ( phorós , '' carrying '' ) , oxford english dictionary 60 however , the french army preferred to call chappe 's semaphore system the telegraph , meaning '' far writer '' , which was coined by french statesman andré françois miot de mélito le robert historique de la langue française , 1992 , 1998 the word semaphoric was first printed in english in 1808 : '' the newly constructed semaphoric telegraphs '' , referring to the destruction of telegraphs in france 500 years of new words , bill sherk the first use of the word semaphore in reference to english use was in 1816 : '' the improved semaphore has been erected on the top of the admiralty '' , referring to the installation of a simpler telegraph invented by sir home popham semaphore telegraphs are also called , '' chappe telegraphs '' or '' napoleonic semaphore '' modern design of semaphores was first foreseen by the british polymath robert hooke , who gave a vivid and comprehensive outline of visual telegraphy to the royal society in a 1684 submission in which he outlined many practical details one of the first experiments of optical signalling was carried out by the anglo-irish landowner and inventor , sir richard lovell edgeworth in 1767 he placed a bet with his friend , the horse racing gambler lord march , that he could transmit knowledge of the outcome of the race in just one hour using a network of signalling sections erected on high ground , the signal would be observed from one station to the next by means of a telescope he returned to his idea in 1795 , after hearing of chappe 's system credit for the first successful optical telegraph goes to the french engineer claude chappe and his brothers in 1792 , who succeeded in covering france with a network of 556 stations stretching a total distance of during 1790–1795 , at the height of the french revolution , france needed a swift and reliable military communications system to thwart the war efforts of its enemies in mid-1790 , the chappe brothers set about devising a system of communication that would allow the central government to receive intelligence and to transmit orders in the shortest possible time he even considered using electricity , but could not find insulation for the conductors that would withstand the high-voltage electrostatic sources available at the time 53 chappe settled on an optical system and the first public demonstration occurred on 2 march 1791 between brûlon and parcé , a distance of the hands of both clocks were set in motion at the same time with a synchronisation signal in the demonstration , they used black and white panels observed with a telescope the message to be sent was chosen by town officials at brûlon and sent by rené chappe to claude chappe at parcé who had no pre-knowledge of the message it was only later that chappe realised that he could dispense with the clocks and the synchronisation system itself could be used to pass messages in 1794 , it brought news of a french capture of condé-sur-l'escaut from the austrians less than an hour after it occurred how napoleon 's semaphore telegraph changed the world , bbc news , hugh schofield , 16 june 2013 the first symbol of a message to lille would pass through 15 stations in only nine minutes the speed of the line varied with the weather , but the line to lille typically transferred 36 symbols , a complete message , in about 32 minutes from 1803 on , the french also used the 3-arm depillon semaphore at coastal locations to provide warning of british incursions . chappe system technical operation the revised chappe system of 1795 provided not only a set of codes but also an operational protocol intended to maximize line throughput '' step 1 , movement 1 ( setup ) : the operator turned the indicator arms to align with the cross bar , forming a non-symbol , and then turned the cross bar into position for the next symbol in this manner , each symbol could propagate down the line as quickly as operators could successfully copy it , with acknowledgement and flow control built into the protocol a symbol sent from paris took 2 minutes to reach lille through 22 stations and 9 minutes to reach lyon through 50 stations the line to calais was extended to boulogne in anticipation and a new design station was briefly in operation at boulogne , but the invasion never happened in 1812 , napoleon took up another design of abraham chappe for a mobile telegraph that could be taken with him on campaign in ireland , richard lovell edgeworth returned to his earlier work in 1794 , and proposed a telegraph there to warn against an anticipated french invasion ; however , the proposal was not implemented chains of murray 's shutter telegraph stations were built along the following routes : london–deal and sheerness , london–great yarmouth , and london–portsmouth and plymouth the line to plymouth was not completed until 4 july 1806 , and so could not be used to relay the news of trafalgar a replacement semaphore system was sought , and of the many ideas and devices put forward the admiralty chose the simpler semaphore system invented by sir home popham a popham semaphore was a single fixed vertical 30 foot pole , with two movable 8 foot arms attached to the pole by horizontal pivots at their ends , one arm at the top of the pole , and the other arm at the middle of the pole the signals of the popham semaphore were found to be much more visible than those of the murray shutter telegraph an experimental semaphore line between the admiralty and chatham was installed in july 1816 , and its success helped to confirm the choice subsequently , the admiralty decided to establish a permanent link to portsmouth and built a chain of semaphore stations the semaphore tower at chatley heath , which replaced the netley heath station of the shutter telegraph , is currently being restored by the landmark trust as self-catering holiday accommodation the board of the port of liverpool obtained a private act of parliament to construct a chain of popham optical semaphore stations from liverpool to holyhead in 1825 in addition to providing information on approaching ships , the duke used the system to relay military commands , especially as they related to troop discipline 184–185 postrat carl pistor proposed instead a semaphore system based on watson 's design in england 186 the telegraph inspector for this network was friedrich clemens gerke , who would later move to the hamburg-cuxhaven electrical telegraph line and develop what became the international morse code intermediate stations could only pass messages by replacing the '' no news '' message with their traffic by the mid-19th century , the optical telegraph was well known enough to be referenced in popular works without special explanation on top of the tower there were two large black arms , moving all day this way and that

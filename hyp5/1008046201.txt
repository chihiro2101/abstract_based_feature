the word semaphore was coined in 1801 by the french inventor of the semaphore line itself , claude chappe 60 however , the french army preferred to call chappe 's semaphore system the telegraph , meaning '' far writer '' , which was coined by french statesman andré françois miot de mélito le robert historique de la langue française , 1992 , 1998 the word semaphoric was first printed in english in 1808 : '' the newly constructed semaphoric telegraphs '' , referring to the destruction of telegraphs in france semaphore telegraphs are also called , '' chappe telegraphs '' or '' napoleonic semaphore '' he placed a bet with his friend , the horse racing gambler lord march , that he could transmit knowledge of the outcome of the race in just one hour using a network of signalling sections erected on high ground , the signal would be observed from one station to the next by means of a telescope the signal itself consisted of a large pointer that could be placed into eight possible positions in 45 degree increments he returned to his idea in 1795 , after hearing of chappe 's system credit for the first successful optical telegraph goes to the french engineer claude chappe and his brothers in 1792 , who succeeded in covering france with a network of 556 stations stretching a total distance of le système chappe was used for military and national communications until the 1850s in mid-1790 , the chappe brothers set about devising a system of communication that would allow the central government to receive intelligence and to transmit orders in the shortest possible time he even considered using electricity , but could not find insulation for the conductors that would withstand the high-voltage electrostatic sources available at the time the hands of both clocks were set in motion at the same time with a synchronisation signal the message to be sent was chosen by town officials at brûlon and sent by rené chappe to claude chappe at parcé who had no pre-knowledge of the message it was only later that chappe realised that he could dispense with the clocks and the synchronisation system itself could be used to pass messages in the summer of 1792 claude was appointed ingénieur-télégraphiste and charged with establishing a line of stations between paris and lille , a distance of 230 kilometres ( about 143 miles ) in 1794 , it brought news of a french capture of condé-sur-l'escaut from the austrians less than an hour after it occurred how napoleon 's semaphore telegraph changed the world , bbc news , hugh schofield , 16 june 2013 the first symbol of a message to lille would pass through 15 stations in only nine minutes the speed of the line varied with the weather , but the line to lille typically transferred 36 symbols , a complete message , in about 32 minutes from 1803 on , the french also used the 3-arm depillon semaphore at coastal locations to provide warning of british incursions . chappe system technical operation the chappe brothers determined by experiment that it was easier to see the angle of a rod than to see the presence or absence of a panel their semaphore was composed of two black movable wooden arms , connected by a cross bar ; the positions of all three of these components together indicated an alphabetic letter with counterweights ( named forks ) on the arms , the chappe system was controlled by only two handles and was mechanically simple and reasonably robust 213 to speed up transmission and to provide some semblance of security , a code book was developed for use with semaphore lines the chappes ' corporation used a code that took 92 of the basic symbols two at a time to yield 8,464 coded words and phrases a symbol sent from paris took 2 minutes to reach lille through 22 stations and 9 minutes to reach lyon through 50 stations after chappe 's initial line ( between paris and lille ) , the paris to strasbourg with 50 stations followed soon after ( 1798 ) the line to calais was extended to boulogne in anticipation and a new design station was briefly in operation at boulogne , but the invasion never happened 71–73 the invention of the telegraph was followed by an enthusiasm concerning its potential to support direct democracy in ireland , richard lovell edgeworth returned to his earlier work in 1794 , and proposed a telegraph there to warn against an anticipated french invasion ; however , the proposal was not implemented lord george murray , stimulated by reports of the chappe semaphore , proposed a system of visual telegraphy to the british admiralty in 1795 the british admiralty accepted murray 's system in september 1795 , and the first system was the 15 site chain from london to deal the line to plymouth was not completed until 4 july 1806 , and so could not be used to relay the news of trafalgar a replacement semaphore system was sought , and of the many ideas and devices put forward the admiralty chose the simpler semaphore system invented by sir home popham an experimental semaphore line between the admiralty and chatham was installed in july 1816 , and its success helped to confirm the choice subsequently , the admiralty decided to establish a permanent link to portsmouth and built a chain of semaphore stations the semaphore tower at chatley heath , which replaced the netley heath station of the shutter telegraph , is currently being restored by the landmark trust as self-catering holiday accommodation with the exception of the towers around halifax harbour , the system was abandoned shortly after the duke 's departure in august 1800 the british military authorities began to consider installing a semaphore line in malta in the early 1840s due to this , in 1848 new semaphore towers were constructed at għargħur and għaxaq on the main island , and another was built at ta ' kenuna on gozo in india , semaphore towers were introduced in 1810 spain was spanned by an extensive semaphore telegraph network in the 1840s and 1850s 187 in russia , tsar nicolas i inaugurated a line between moscow and warsaw of length in 1833 ; it needed 220 stations manned by 1,320 operators in the united states , the first optical telegraph was built by jonathan grout in 1804 but ceased operation in 1807 dumas also describes in details the functioning of a chappe telegraph line on top of the tower there were two large black arms , moving all day this way and that

the word semaphore was coined in 1801 by the french inventor of the semaphore line itself , claude chappe beyer , rick , the greatest stories never told , a & e television networks / the history channel , , p 60 however , the french army preferred to call chappe 's semaphore system the telegraph , meaning '' far writer '' , which was coined by french statesman andré françois miot de mélito le robert historique de la langue française , 1992 , 1998 the word semaphoric was first printed in english in 1808 : '' the newly constructed semaphoric telegraphs '' , referring to the destruction of telegraphs in france semaphore telegraphs are also called , '' chappe telegraphs '' or '' napoleonic semaphore '' the system ( which was motivated by military concerns , following the battle of vienna in 1683 ) was never put into practice one of the first experiments of optical signalling was carried out by the anglo-irish landowner and inventor , sir richard lovell edgeworth in 1767 he placed a bet with his friend , the horse racing gambler lord march , that he could transmit knowledge of the outcome of the race in just one hour a series of two such signals gave a total 64 code elements and a third signal took it up to 512 he returned to his idea in 1795 , after hearing of chappe 's system credit for the first successful optical telegraph goes to the french engineer claude chappe and his brothers in 1792 , who succeeded in covering france with a network of 556 stations stretching a total distance of the only advantage france held was the lack of cooperation between the allied forces due to their inadequate lines of communication chappe considered many possible methods including audio and smoke 53 chappe settled on an optical system and the first public demonstration occurred on 2 march 1791 between brûlon and parcé , a distance of the system consisted of a modified pendulum clock at each end with dials marked with ten numerals the hands of the clocks almost certainly moved much faster than a normal clock the message to be sent was chosen by town officials at brûlon and sent by rené chappe to claude chappe at parcé who had no pre-knowledge of the message it was only later that chappe realised that he could dispense with the clocks and the synchronisation system itself could be used to pass messages the speed of the line varied with the weather , but the line to lille typically transferred 36 symbols , a complete message , in about 32 minutes from 1803 on , the french also used the 3-arm depillon semaphore at coastal locations to provide warning of british incursions their semaphore was composed of two black movable wooden arms , connected by a cross bar ; the positions of all three of these components together indicated an alphabetic letter with counterweights ( named forks ) on the arms , the chappe system was controlled by only two handles and was mechanically simple and reasonably robust night operation with lamps on the arms was unsuccessful 213 to speed up transmission and to provide some semblance of security , a code book was developed for use with semaphore lines the revised chappe system of 1795 provided not only a set of codes but also an operational protocol intended to maximize line throughput step 1 , movement 2 ( transmission ) : the operator positioned the indicator arms for current symbol and waited for the downline station to copy it step 2 , movement 3 ( completion ) : the operator turned the cross bar to a vertical or horizontal position , indicating the end of a cycle a symbol sent from paris took 2 minutes to reach lille through 22 stations and 9 minutes to reach lyon through 50 stations after chappe 's initial line ( between paris and lille ) , the paris to strasbourg with 50 stations followed soon after ( 1798 ) napoleon bonaparte made full use of the telegraph by obtaining speedy information on enemy movements in 1812 , napoleon took up another design of abraham chappe for a mobile telegraph that could be taken with him on campaign this was still in use in 1853 during the crimean war holzmann & pehrson , pp in ireland , richard lovell edgeworth returned to his earlier work in 1794 , and proposed a telegraph there to warn against an anticipated french invasion ; however , the proposal was not implemented lord george murray , stimulated by reports of the chappe semaphore , proposed a system of visual telegraphy to the british admiralty in 1795 wrixon ( 2005 ) , codes , ciphers , secrets and cryptic communication pp the signals of the popham semaphore were found to be much more visible than those of the murray shutter telegraph an experimental semaphore line between the admiralty and chatham was installed in july 1816 , and its success helped to confirm the choice subsequently , the admiralty decided to establish a permanent link to portsmouth and built a chain of semaphore stations work started in december 1820 with popham 's equipment replaced with another two-arm system invented by charles pasley 196 in good conditions messages were sent from london to portsmouth in less than eight minutes hamilton , the making of the modern admiralty : british naval policy-making , 1805–1927 , p faster than the wind , the liverpool to holyhead telegraph , frank large , an avid publication the system was designed and part-owned by barnard l in the united states , the first optical telegraph was built by jonathan grout in 1804 but ceased operation in 1807 214–215 routing in the french system was almost permanently fixed ; only paris and the station at the remote end of a line were allowed to initiate a message dumas also describes in details the functioning of a chappe telegraph line i was told later that this was saint-eustache church and that these large black arms were a telegraph

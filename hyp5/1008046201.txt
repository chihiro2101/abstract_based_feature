the word semaphore was coined in 1801 by the french inventor of the semaphore line itself , claude chappe groundbreaking scientific experiments , inventions & discoveries of the 18th century , jonathan shectman , p 172 he composed it from the greek elements σῆμα ( sêma , '' sign '' ) ; and from φορός ( phorós , '' carrying '' ) , oxford english dictionary 60 however , the french army preferred to call chappe 's semaphore system the telegraph , meaning '' far writer '' , which was coined by french statesman andré françois miot de mélito 500 years of new words , bill sherk the first use of the word semaphore in reference to english use was in 1816 : '' the improved semaphore has been erected on the top of the admiralty '' , referring to the installation of a simpler telegraph invented by sir home popham semaphore telegraphs are also called , '' chappe telegraphs '' or '' napoleonic semaphore '' optical telegraphy dates from ancient times , in the form of hydraulic telegraphs , torches ( as used by ancient cultures since the discovery of fire ) and smoke signals the system ( which was motivated by military concerns , following the battle of vienna in 1683 ) was never put into practice one of the first experiments of optical signalling was carried out by the anglo-irish landowner and inventor , sir richard lovell edgeworth in 1767 using a network of signalling sections erected on high ground , the signal would be observed from one station to the next by means of a telescope a series of two such signals gave a total 64 code elements and a third signal took it up to 512 he returned to his idea in 1795 , after hearing of chappe 's system credit for the first successful optical telegraph goes to the french engineer claude chappe and his brothers in 1792 , who succeeded in covering france with a network of 556 stations stretching a total distance of france was surrounded by the forces of britain , the netherlands , prussia , austria , and spain , the cities of marseille and lyon were in revolt , and the british fleet held toulon 53 chappe settled on an optical system and the first public demonstration occurred on 2 march 1791 between brûlon and parcé , a distance of the message to be sent was chosen by town officials at brûlon and sent by rené chappe to claude chappe at parcé who had no pre-knowledge of the message the message read '' si vous réussissez , vous serez bientôt couverts de gloire '' ( if you succeed , you will soon bask in glory ) 53–55 the chappes carried out experiments during the next two years , and on two occasions their apparatus at place de l'étoile , paris was destroyed by mobs who thought they were communicating with royalist forces in the summer of 1792 claude was appointed ingénieur-télégraphiste and charged with establishing a line of stations between paris and lille , a distance of 230 kilometres ( about 143 miles ) how napoleon 's semaphore telegraph changed the world , bbc news , hugh schofield , 16 june 2013 the first symbol of a message to lille would pass through 15 stations in only nine minutes the speed of the line varied with the weather , but the line to lille typically transferred 36 symbols , a complete message , in about 32 minutes with counterweights ( named forks ) on the arms , the chappe system was controlled by only two handles and was mechanically simple and reasonably robust the chappes ' corporation used a code that took 92 of the basic symbols two at a time to yield 8,464 coded words and phrases the revised chappe system of 1795 provided not only a set of codes but also an operational protocol intended to maximize line throughput '' step 1 , movement 1 ( setup ) : the operator turned the indicator arms to align with the cross bar , forming a non-symbol , and then turned the cross bar into position for the next symbol step 1 , movement 2 ( transmission ) : the operator positioned the indicator arms for current symbol and waited for the downline station to copy it step 2 , movement 3 ( completion ) : the operator turned the cross bar to a vertical or horizontal position , indicating the end of a cycle a symbol sent from paris took 2 minutes to reach lille through 22 stations and 9 minutes to reach lyon through 50 stations after chappe 's initial line ( between paris and lille ) , the paris to strasbourg with 50 stations followed soon after ( 1798 ) the line to calais was extended to boulogne in anticipation and a new design station was briefly in operation at boulogne , but the invasion never happened in 1812 , napoleon took up another design of abraham chappe for a mobile telegraph that could be taken with him on campaign for instance , based on rousseau 's argument that direct democracy was improbable in large constituencies , the french intellectual alexandre-théophile vandermonde commented : lord george murray , stimulated by reports of the chappe semaphore , proposed a system of visual telegraphy to the british admiralty in 1795 he employed rectangular framework towers with six five-foot-high octagonal shutters on horizontal axes that flipped between horizontal and vertical positions to signal lieutenant watson 's telegraph mechanics ' magazine , volume 8 no the british admiralty accepted murray 's system in september 1795 , and the first system was the 15 site chain from london to deal subsequently , the admiralty decided to establish a permanent link to portsmouth and built a chain of semaphore stations 196 in good conditions messages were sent from london to portsmouth in less than eight minutes the line was operational from 1822 until 1847 , when the railway and electric telegraph provided a better means of communication the semaphore tower at chatley heath , which replaced the netley heath station of the shutter telegraph , is currently being restored by the landmark trust as self-catering holiday accommodation the board of the port of liverpool obtained a private act of parliament to construct a chain of popham optical semaphore stations from liverpool to holyhead in 1825 edgeworth was to develop an optical telegraph based on a triangle pointer , measuring up to 16 feet in height despite its success in operation , the receding threat of french invasion was to see the system disestablished in 1804 the labour needed to build and continually man so many stations taxed the already stretched-thin british military and there is doubt the new brunswick line was ever in operation the two lines were later linked with three additional stations to create possibly the only private telegraph network in the optical telegraph era the prussian system required the coblenz station ( at the end of the line ) to send a '' no news '' message ( or a real message if there was one pending ) back to berlin on the hour , every hour dumas also describes in details the functioning of a chappe telegraph line

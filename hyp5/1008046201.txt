the word semaphore was coined in 1801 by the french inventor of the semaphore line itself , claude chappe 60 however , the french army preferred to call chappe 's semaphore system the telegraph , meaning '' far writer '' , which was coined by french statesman andré françois miot de mélito 500 years of new words , bill sherk the first use of the word semaphore in reference to english use was in 1816 : '' the improved semaphore has been erected on the top of the admiralty '' , referring to the installation of a simpler telegraph invented by sir home popham semaphore telegraphs are also called , '' chappe telegraphs '' or '' napoleonic semaphore '' the system ( which was motivated by military concerns , following the battle of vienna in 1683 ) was never put into practice one of the first experiments of optical signalling was carried out by the anglo-irish landowner and inventor , sir richard lovell edgeworth in 1767 he placed a bet with his friend , the horse racing gambler lord march , that he could transmit knowledge of the outcome of the race in just one hour using a network of signalling sections erected on high ground , the signal would be observed from one station to the next by means of a telescope the signal itself consisted of a large pointer that could be placed into eight possible positions in 45 degree increments he returned to his idea in 1795 , after hearing of chappe 's system credit for the first successful optical telegraph goes to the french engineer claude chappe and his brothers in 1792 , who succeeded in covering france with a network of 556 stations stretching a total distance of le système chappe was used for military and national communications until the 1850s during 1790–1795 , at the height of the french revolution , france needed a swift and reliable military communications system to thwart the war efforts of its enemies france was surrounded by the forces of britain , the netherlands , prussia , austria , and spain , the cities of marseille and lyon were in revolt , and the british fleet held toulon the system consisted of a modified pendulum clock at each end with dials marked with ten numerals their semaphore was composed of two black movable wooden arms , connected by a cross bar ; the positions of all three of these components together indicated an alphabetic letter with counterweights ( named forks ) on the arms , the chappe system was controlled by only two handles and was mechanically simple and reasonably robust each of the two 2-metre-long arms could display seven positions , and the 4.6-metre-long cross bar connecting the two arms could display four different angles , for a total of 196 symbols ( 7×7×4 ) 213 to speed up transmission and to provide some semblance of security , a code book was developed for use with semaphore lines the revised chappe system of 1795 provided not only a set of codes but also an operational protocol intended to maximize line throughput '' step 1 , movement 1 ( setup ) : the operator turned the indicator arms to align with the cross bar , forming a non-symbol , and then turned the cross bar into position for the next symbol step 1 , movement 2 ( transmission ) : the operator positioned the indicator arms for current symbol and waited for the downline station to copy it a symbol sent from paris took 2 minutes to reach lille through 22 stations and 9 minutes to reach lyon through 50 stations napoleon bonaparte made full use of the telegraph by obtaining speedy information on enemy movements in 1801 he had abraham chappe build an extra-large station to transmit across the english channel in preparation for an invasion of britain a pair of such stations were built on a test line over a comparable distance the line to calais was extended to boulogne in anticipation and a new design station was briefly in operation at boulogne , but the invasion never happened in 1812 , napoleon took up another design of abraham chappe for a mobile telegraph that could be taken with him on campaign in ireland , richard lovell edgeworth returned to his earlier work in 1794 , and proposed a telegraph there to warn against an anticipated french invasion ; however , the proposal was not implemented lord george murray , stimulated by reports of the chappe semaphore , proposed a system of visual telegraphy to the british admiralty in 1795 the british admiralty accepted murray 's system in september 1795 , and the first system was the 15 site chain from london to deal wrixon ( 2005 ) , codes , ciphers , secrets and cryptic communication pp the line to plymouth was not completed until 4 july 1806 , and so could not be used to relay the news of trafalgar a replacement semaphore system was sought , and of the many ideas and devices put forward the admiralty chose the simpler semaphore system invented by sir home popham popham 's 2-arm semaphore was modeled after the 3-arm depillon french semaphore an experimental semaphore line between the admiralty and chatham was installed in july 1816 , and its success helped to confirm the choice subsequently , the admiralty decided to establish a permanent link to portsmouth and built a chain of semaphore stations each of the arms of pasley 's system could take on one of eight positions and it thus had more codepoints than popham's the line was operational from 1822 until 1847 , when the railway and electric telegraph provided a better means of communication the semaphore tower at chatley heath , which replaced the netley heath station of the shutter telegraph , is currently being restored by the landmark trust as self-catering holiday accommodation faster than the wind , the liverpool to holyhead telegraph , frank large , an avid publication the system was designed and part-owned by barnard l the second ran west to the mediterranean , then north along the coast through barcelona to the french border 184–185 postrat carl pistor proposed instead a semaphore system based on watson 's design in england the two lines were later linked with three additional stations to create possibly the only private telegraph network in the optical telegraph era the details of the early chappe system are not known precisely ; the first operating instructions to survive date to 1809 and the french system is not as fully explained as the swedish 188 another feature that would be considered advanced in a modern electronic system is the dynamic changing of transmission rates dumas also describes in details the functioning of a chappe telegraph line

the autonomic nervous system is divided into the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system the sympathetic division emerges from the spinal cord in the thoracic and lumbar areas , terminating around l2-3 the parasympathetic division has craniosacral “ outflow ” , meaning that the neurons begin at the cranial nerves ( specifically the oculomotor nerve , facial nerve , glossopharyngeal nerve and vagus nerve ) and sacral ( s2-s4 ) spinal cord the autonomic nervous system is unique in that it requires a sequential two-neuron efferent pathway ; the preganglionic neuron must first synapse onto a postganglionic neuron before innervating the target organ the preganglionic , or first , neuron will begin at the “ outflow ” and will synapse at the postganglionic , or second , neuron 's cell body the sympathetic nervous system consists of cells with bodies in the lateral grey column from t1 to l2/3 the parasympathetic nervous system consists of cells with bodies in one of two locations : the brainstem ( cranial nerves iii , vii , ix , x ) or the sacral spinal cord ( s2 , s3 , s4 ) the sensory arm is composed of primary visceral sensory neurons found in the peripheral nervous system ( pns ) , in cranial sensory ganglia : the geniculate , petrosal and nodose ganglia , appended respectively to cranial nerves vii , ix and x most organs receive parasympathetic supply by the vagus nerve and sympathetic supply by splanchnic nerves motor neurons of the autonomic nervous system are found in ‘ ’ autonomic ganglia ’ ’ those of the parasympathetic branch are located close to the target organ whilst the ganglia of the sympathetic branch are located close to the spinal cord the sympathetic system is often considered the '' fight or flight '' system , while the parasympathetic system is often considered the '' rest and digest '' or '' feed and breed '' system the enteric nervous system is the intrinsic nervous system of the gastrointestinal system in the parasympathetic system , ganglionic neurons use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter to stimulate muscarinic receptors one study found that the seated position inhibited autonomic activity after caffeine consumption ( 75 & nbsp ; mg ) ; however , parasympathetic activity increased in the supine position

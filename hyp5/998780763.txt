the autonomic nervous system is divided into the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system the parasympathetic division has craniosacral “ outflow ” , meaning that the neurons begin at the cranial nerves ( specifically the oculomotor nerve , facial nerve , glossopharyngeal nerve and vagus nerve ) and sacral ( s2-s4 ) spinal cord the autonomic nervous system is unique in that it requires a sequential two-neuron efferent pathway ; the preganglionic neuron must first synapse onto a postganglionic neuron before innervating the target organ the preganglionic , or first , neuron will begin at the “ outflow ” and will synapse at the postganglionic , or second , neuron 's cell body the sympathetic nervous system consists of cells with bodies in the lateral grey column from t1 to l2/3 the parasympathetic nervous system consists of cells with bodies in one of two locations : the brainstem ( cranial nerves iii , vii , ix , x ) or the sacral spinal cord ( s2 , s3 , s4 ) examples are : the postganglionic parasympathetic splanchnic ( visceral ) nerves the vagus nerve , which passes through the thorax and abdominal regions innervating , among other organs , the heart , lungs , liver and stomach the sensory arm is composed of primary visceral sensory neurons found in the peripheral nervous system ( pns ) , in cranial sensory ganglia : the geniculate , petrosal and nodose ganglia , appended respectively to cranial nerves vii , ix and x primary sensory neurons project ( synapse ) onto “ second order ” visceral sensory neurons located in the medulla oblongata , forming the nucleus of the solitary tract ( nts ) , that integrates all visceral information motor neurons of the autonomic nervous system are found in ‘ ’ autonomic ganglia ’ ’ the sympathetic ganglia here , are found in two chains : the pre-vertebral and pre-aortic chains the activity of autonomic ganglionic neurons is modulated by “ preganglionic neurons ” located in the central nervous system functions of nerves within the parasympathetic nervous system include : dilating blood vessels leading to the gi tract , increasing the blood flow short-term physiological effects of caffeine include increased blood pressure and sympathetic nerve outflow consumption of caffeinated espresso increases parasympathetic activity in habitual caffeine consumers ; however , decaffeinated espresso inhibits parasympathetic activity in habitual caffeine consumers

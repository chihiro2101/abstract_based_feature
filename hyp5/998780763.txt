the autonomic nervous system is divided into the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system the parasympathetic division has craniosacral “ outflow ” , meaning that the neurons begin at the cranial nerves ( specifically the oculomotor nerve , facial nerve , glossopharyngeal nerve and vagus nerve ) and sacral ( s2-s4 ) spinal cord the autonomic nervous system is unique in that it requires a sequential two-neuron efferent pathway ; the preganglionic neuron must first synapse onto a postganglionic neuron before innervating the target organ the sympathetic nervous system consists of cells with bodies in the lateral grey column from t1 to l2/3 the parasympathetic nervous system consists of cells with bodies in one of two locations : the brainstem ( cranial nerves iii , vii , ix , x ) or the sacral spinal cord ( s2 , s3 , s4 ) examples are : the postganglionic parasympathetic splanchnic ( visceral ) nerves the vagus nerve , which passes through the thorax and abdominal regions innervating , among other organs , the heart , lungs , liver and stomach the sensory arm is composed of primary visceral sensory neurons found in the peripheral nervous system ( pns ) , in cranial sensory ganglia : the geniculate , petrosal and nodose ganglia , appended respectively to cranial nerves vii , ix and x motor neurons of the autonomic nervous system are found in ‘ ’ autonomic ganglia ’ ’ the activity of autonomic ganglionic neurons is modulated by “ preganglionic neurons ” located in the central nervous system preganglionic sympathetic neurons are located in the spinal cord , at the thorax and upper lumbar levels the sympathetic system is often considered the '' fight or flight '' system , while the parasympathetic system is often considered the '' rest and digest '' or '' feed and breed '' system functions of nerves within the parasympathetic nervous system include : dilating blood vessels leading to the gi tract , increasing the blood flow the specialised system of the autonomic nervous system was recognised by galen caffeine is a bioactive compound found in commonly consumed beverages such as coffee , tea , and sodas one study found that the seated position inhibited autonomic activity after caffeine consumption ( 75 & nbsp ; mg ) ; however , parasympathetic activity increased in the supine position

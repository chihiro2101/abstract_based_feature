the autonomic nervous system is divided into the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system the sympathetic division emerges from the spinal cord in the thoracic and lumbar areas , terminating around l2-3 the autonomic nervous system is unique in that it requires a sequential two-neuron efferent pathway ; the preganglionic neuron must first synapse onto a postganglionic neuron before innervating the target organ the postganglionic neuron will then synapse at the target organ the sympathetic nervous system consists of cells with bodies in the lateral grey column from t1 to l2/3 the parasympathetic nervous system consists of cells with bodies in one of two locations : the brainstem ( cranial nerves iii , vii , ix , x ) or the sacral spinal cord ( s2 , s3 , s4 ) the sensory arm is composed of primary visceral sensory neurons found in the peripheral nervous system ( pns ) , in cranial sensory ganglia : the geniculate , petrosal and nodose ganglia , appended respectively to cranial nerves vii , ix and x all this visceral sensory information constantly and unconsciously modulates the activity of the motor neurons of the ans most organs receive parasympathetic supply by the vagus nerve and sympathetic supply by splanchnic nerves motor neurons of the autonomic nervous system are found in ‘ ’ autonomic ganglia ’ ’ the activity of autonomic ganglionic neurons is modulated by “ preganglionic neurons ” located in the central nervous system the sympathetic system is often considered the '' fight or flight '' system , while the parasympathetic system is often considered the '' rest and digest '' or '' feed and breed '' system nerves of the peripheral nervous system are involved in the erection of genital tissues via the pelvic splanchnic nerves 2–4 the specialised system of the autonomic nervous system was recognised by galen it is possible that other bioactive ingredients in decaffeinated espresso may also contribute to the inhibition of parasympathetic activity in habitual caffeine consumers

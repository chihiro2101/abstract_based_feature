the autonomic nervous system is divided into the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system the sympathetic division emerges from the spinal cord in the thoracic and lumbar areas , terminating around l2-3 the parasympathetic division has craniosacral “ outflow ” , meaning that the neurons begin at the cranial nerves ( specifically the oculomotor nerve , facial nerve , glossopharyngeal nerve and vagus nerve ) and sacral ( s2-s4 ) spinal cord the autonomic nervous system is unique in that it requires a sequential two-neuron efferent pathway ; the preganglionic neuron must first synapse onto a postganglionic neuron before innervating the target organ the sympathetic nervous system consists of cells with bodies in the lateral grey column from t1 to l2/3 the parasympathetic nervous system consists of cells with bodies in one of two locations : the brainstem ( cranial nerves iii , vii , ix , x ) or the sacral spinal cord ( s2 , s3 , s4 ) the sensory arm is composed of primary visceral sensory neurons found in the peripheral nervous system ( pns ) , in cranial sensory ganglia : the geniculate , petrosal and nodose ganglia , appended respectively to cranial nerves vii , ix and x they also convey the sense of taste and smell , which , unlike most functions of the ans , is a conscious perception all this visceral sensory information constantly and unconsciously modulates the activity of the motor neurons of the ans motor neurons of the autonomic nervous system are found in ‘ ’ autonomic ganglia ’ ’ the activity of autonomic ganglionic neurons is modulated by “ preganglionic neurons ” located in the central nervous system the sympathetic system is often considered the '' fight or flight '' system , while the parasympathetic system is often considered the '' rest and digest '' or '' feed and breed '' system the parasympathetic nervous system has been said to promote a '' rest and digest '' response , promotes calming of the nerves return to regular function , and enhancing digestion stimulation of the adrenal medulla releases adrenaline ( epinephrine ) into the bloodstream , which acts on adrenoceptors , thereby indirectly mediating or mimicking sympathetic activity one study found that the seated position inhibited autonomic activity after caffeine consumption ( 75 & nbsp ; mg ) ; however , parasympathetic activity increased in the supine position

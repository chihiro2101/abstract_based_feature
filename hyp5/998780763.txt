the autonomic nervous system is divided into the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system the autonomic nervous system is unique in that it requires a sequential two-neuron efferent pathway ; the preganglionic neuron must first synapse onto a postganglionic neuron before innervating the target organ the preganglionic , or first , neuron will begin at the “ outflow ” and will synapse at the postganglionic , or second , neuron 's cell body the sympathetic nervous system consists of cells with bodies in the lateral grey column from t1 to l2/3 the parasympathetic nervous system consists of cells with bodies in one of two locations : the brainstem ( cranial nerves iii , vii , ix , x ) or the sacral spinal cord ( s2 , s3 , s4 ) the sensory arm is composed of primary visceral sensory neurons found in the peripheral nervous system ( pns ) , in cranial sensory ganglia : the geniculate , petrosal and nodose ganglia , appended respectively to cranial nerves vii , ix and x they also convey the sense of taste and smell , which , unlike most functions of the ans , is a conscious perception primary sensory neurons project ( synapse ) onto “ second order ” visceral sensory neurons located in the medulla oblongata , forming the nucleus of the solitary tract ( nts ) , that integrates all visceral information motor neurons of the autonomic nervous system are found in ‘ ’ autonomic ganglia ’ ’ the sympathetic system is often considered the '' fight or flight '' system , while the parasympathetic system is often considered the '' rest and digest '' or '' feed and breed '' system another example is the constant , second-to-second , modulation of heart rate by sympathetic and parasympathetic influences , as a function of the respiratory cycles the parasympathetic nervous system has been said to promote a '' rest and digest '' response , promotes calming of the nerves return to regular function , and enhancing digestion functions of nerves within the parasympathetic nervous system include : dilating blood vessels leading to the gi tract , increasing the blood flow the enteric nervous system is the intrinsic nervous system of the gastrointestinal system the specialised system of the autonomic nervous system was recognised by galen

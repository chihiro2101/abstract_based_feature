the mann & ndash ; hugg blues brothers were formed in london by keyboard player manfred mann and drummer/vibes/piano player mike hugg , who formed a house band in clacton-on-sea that also featured graham bond bringing a shared love of jazz to the british blues boom then sweeping london 's clubs , the band was completed by mike vickers on guitar , alto saxophone and flute , bassist dave richmond and paul jones as lead vocalist and harmonicist by this time they had changed their name to manfred mann & the manfreds after changing their name to manfred mann at the behest of their label 's producer john burgess , the group signed with his master 's voice in march 1963 and began their recorded output that july with the slow , blues instrumental single '' why should we not ? '' , which they performed on their first appearance on television on a new year 's eve show shortly after '' 5-4-3-2-1 '' was recorded , richmond left the band , jazz4now – the dave richmond home page '' please note that '' 5-4-3-2-1 '' was recorded before i left the band , in fact i still receive ppl payments every time it is broadcast '' – dave richmond though he would record with them occasionally later after a further self-penned hit , '' hubble bubble ( toil and trouble ) '' , the band struck gold with '' do wah diddy diddy '' , a cover version of the exciters ' no 12 in the us and canada , and followed it with the sentimental '' come tomorrow '' ( originally by marie knight ) but both were of a noticeably lighter texture than their earliest output the group also returned to jazz and r & b themes on their albums : their first , 1964 's the five faces of manfred mann , included standards such as '' smokestack lightning '' while the second and last with this line-up , mann made , offered several self-composed instrumentals and a version of '' stormy monday blues '' alongside novelties and pop ballads the ep 's title track reached the british top ten singles , the last self-written song ( by jones ) and the band 's last r ' n ' b workout to do so in his brief tenure before leaving to form cream , bruce played on '' pretty flamingo '' and on the ep instrumental asylum ( for which both he , and wind instrumentalists henry lowther and lyn dobson , were included in the sleeve photo of the group ) , which began the group 's experiments with instrumental versions of chart songs 36 in the uk singles chart , upsetting the group—hence mcguinness 's wry comment '' manfreds disown new single '' on the sleeve of their next studio album for their new record label their first fontana single , a version of dylan 's '' just like a woman '' , released in july , scraped into the uk top ten and reached number one in sweden mann and hugg were already writing advertising jingles at the time of the group 's demise , but continued to work together in a group format with manfred mann chapter three , an experimental jazz rock band described by mann as an over-reaction to the hit factory of the manfred mann group from 1972 onward 'manfred mann 's earth band ' was the band name used on all releases by this group , and they are considered a separate band from manfred mann

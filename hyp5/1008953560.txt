the mann & ndash ; hugg blues brothers were formed in london by keyboard player manfred mann and drummer/vibes/piano player mike hugg , who formed a house band in clacton-on-sea that also featured graham bond bringing a shared love of jazz to the british blues boom then sweeping london 's clubs , the band was completed by mike vickers on guitar , alto saxophone and flute , bassist dave richmond and paul jones as lead vocalist and harmonicist after changing their name to manfred mann at the behest of their label 's producer john burgess , the group signed with his master 's voice in march 1963 and began their recorded output that july with the slow , blues instrumental single '' why should we not ? '' , which they performed on their first appearance on television on a new year 's eve show the overdubbed instrumental soloing on woodwinds , vibes , harmonica and second keyboard lent considerable weight to the group 's sound , and demonstrated the jazz-inspired technical prowess in which they took pride they responded with '' 5-4-3-2-1 '' which , with the help of weekly television exposure , rose to no shortly after '' 5-4-3-2-1 '' was recorded , richmond left the band , jazz4now – the dave richmond home page '' please note that '' 5-4-3-2-1 '' was recorded before i left the band , in fact i still receive ppl payments every time it is broadcast '' – dave richmond though he would record with them occasionally later after a further self-penned hit , '' hubble bubble ( toil and trouble ) '' , the band struck gold with '' do wah diddy diddy '' , a cover version of the exciters ' no with the success of '' do wah diddy diddy '' the sound of the group 's singles moved away from the jazzy , blues-based music of their early years to a pop hybrid that continued to make hit singles from cover material the group also returned to jazz and r & b themes on their albums : their first , 1964 's the five faces of manfred mann , included standards such as '' smokestack lightning '' while the second and last with this line-up , mann made , offered several self-composed instrumentals and a version of '' stormy monday blues '' alongside novelties and pop ballads the group had managed an initial jazz/rhythm-and-blues fusion , and then had taken chart music in their stride—but could not hope to cope with paul jones ' projected solo career as singer and actor , and with mike vickers ' orchestral and instrumental ambitions in his brief tenure before leaving to form cream , bruce played on '' pretty flamingo '' and on the ep instrumental asylum ( for which both he , and wind instrumentalists henry lowther and lyn dobson , were included in the sleeve photo of the group ) , which began the group 's experiments with instrumental versions of chart songs frustrated with the limitations and image of being seen purely as a hit singles band ( their last two albums failed to chart ) , the group split in 1969 their second single , randy newman 's '' living without you '' , was also released by 'manfred mann ' in europe , but by 'manfred mann 's earth band ' in the us , where the track became a minor chart hit uk albums the five faces of manfred mann ( 1964 ) mann made ( 1965 ) as is ( 1966 ) up the junction ( 1968 ) mighty garvey !

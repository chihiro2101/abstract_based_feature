most legal definitions of corporate farming in the united states pertain to tax laws , anti–corporate farming laws , and census data collection these definitions mostly reference farm income , indicating farms over a certain threshold as corporate farms , as well as ownership of the farm , specifically targeting farms that do not pass ownership through family lines this mostly stems from the widespread assumption that family farms are small farms while corporate farms are large-scale operations while it is true that the majority of small farms are family owned , many large farms are also family businesses , including some of the largest farms in the us ” additionally , there are large economic and legal incentives for family farmers to incorporate their businesses in most instances of contract farming , the farm is family owned while the buyer is a larger corporation this makes it difficult to distinguish the contract farmers from '' corporate farms , '' because they are family farms but with significant corporate influence this subtle distinction left a loop-hole in many state laws that prohibited corporate farming , effectively allowing corporations to farm in these states as long as they contracted with local farm owners these corporations do not have production farms , meaning they do not produce a significant amount of farm products the 2012 us census of agriculture indicates that 5.06 percent of us farms are corporate farms of the family farm corporations , 98 percent are small corporations , with 10 or fewer stockholders non-family corporate farms account for 1.36 percent of us farmland area in canada , 17.4 percent of farms are owned by family corporations and 2.4 percent by non-family corporations definitions of a farm can include any and all farm operations , or be dependent on the source of income , as in iowa , where 60 percent of income must come from farm products '' family farming is a lifestyle '' 2014 - international year of family farming – european economic and social committee

three divine liturgies are in common use in the byzantine rite : the divine liturgy of st john chrysostom ( 5th century ) , used on most days of the year and as a vesperal liturgy on the annunciation the divine liturgy of st basil the great ( 4th century ) , used on the five sundays of great lent and on saint basil 's feast day ( january 1 ) on the eves of the nativity and theophany and on holy thursday and holy saturday , it is celebrated as a vespers liturgy in some traditions , saint basil 's liturgy is also celebrated on the feast of the cross on september 14 in all , this liturgy is used 10 times during the liturgical year the liturgy of the presanctified gifts ( 6th century ) is used during great lent on wednesdays , fridays , and a handful of other occasions , and also on the first three days of holy week nowadays it is always celebrated as a vesperal liturgy ; the liturgy of the faithful has no anaphora ( liturgy ) , the holy gifts having been consecrated and reserved ( '' presanctified '' ) at a previous divine liturgy still , the church is understood in eastern orthodoxy in terms not of the presbyter , but the diocesan bishop when the latter celebrates the liturgy personally , the service is more complex and festive ) the format of divine liturgy is fixed , although the specific readings and hymns vary with season and feast in modern times , closed communion applies only to holy communion – reception of the sacrament of eucharist this part of the liturgy is private , performed only by the priest and deacon liturgy of preparation – the priest and deacon prepare the bread and wine for the eucharist ( see prosphora ) at the table of oblation ( prothesis ) liturgy of the faithful in the early church , only baptized members who could receive holy communion were allowed to attend this portion of the liturgy in ancient rubrics , and contemporary greek practice , the sermon , nicene creed and the lord 's prayer are spoken/read , rather than chanted at present , the coptic orthodox church and coptic catholic church have three liturgies : the liturgy of st basil ( 4th century ) the liturgy of st cyril , this liturgy is also known as the liturgy of st cyril the liturgy of st gregory the theologian the liturgy of st due to the long isolation of the saint thomas christians the rite of the syro-malankara catholic church shows some differences , so that this rite is called the malankara rite the main liturgy used by the coptic church is known as liturgy of saint basil the term liturgies of saint basil in a coptic context means not only the sole anaphora with or without the related prayers , but also the general order of the alexandrine rite liturgy the next epiclesis consists only of the prayer to the holy spirit to come and manifest the gifts , without any explicit request to change the gifts in the body and blood of christ at the altar , the priest , with appropriate prayers , blesses the lamb and the wine , places the lamb on the paten and pours wine and a few drops of water in the chalice ( the chalice is placed on the altar in a wooden box named ark ) the last part of the offertory resembles an anaphora : after a dialogue , the priest blesses the congregation and proclaims a prayer of thanksgiving , giving thanks to god for his support to us , and asking him for a worthy participation to the liturgy then comes the prayer of covering said inaudibly by the priest , which has the form of an epiclesis asking god to show his face on the gifts , and to change them in order that the bread and wine may became the body and blood of christ this portion was in ancient times the beginning of the liturgy , and the only part which could be attended by the catechumens one element which almost certainly derives from the influence of western liturgy is the reading of a last gospel at the conclusion of the patarag

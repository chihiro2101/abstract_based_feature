three divine liturgies are in common use in the byzantine rite : the divine liturgy of st john chrysostom ( 5th century ) , used on most days of the year and as a vesperal liturgy on the annunciation the divine liturgy of st basil the great ( 4th century ) , used on the five sundays of great lent and on saint basil 's feast day ( january 1 ) on the eves of the nativity and theophany and on holy thursday and holy saturday , it is celebrated as a vespers liturgy in all , this liturgy is used 10 times during the liturgical year the liturgy of the presanctified gifts ( 6th century ) is used during great lent on wednesdays , fridays , and a handful of other occasions , and also on the first three days of holy week nowadays it is always celebrated as a vesperal liturgy ; the liturgy of the faithful has no anaphora ( liturgy ) , the holy gifts having been consecrated and reserved ( '' presanctified '' ) at a previous divine liturgy as well as these , there are two others that are used locally and rarely , the liturgy of st as numbers in a diocese increased dramatically , the bishop who presides over the eucharistic assembly appointed presbyters to act as celebrants in the local communities ( the parishes ) : note : psalms are numbered according to the greek septuagint ) the format of divine liturgy is fixed , although the specific readings and hymns vary with season and feast in modern times , closed communion applies only to holy communion – reception of the sacrament of eucharist entrance and vesting prayers , the sacred servers ( priests and deacons ) enter the church , venerate the icons and put on their vestments liturgy of preparation – the priest and deacon prepare the bread and wine for the eucharist ( see prosphora ) at the table of oblation ( prothesis ) however , in most places , catechumens are formally dismissed for further study . gallery of parts of the eastern orthodox liturgy the antimension is opened three-quarters of the way ; the final portion will be unfolded at the petition : '' that he will reveal unto them the word of truth the oriental orthodox churches own a richness of different liturgies , which are named after the anaphora included at present , the coptic orthodox church and coptic catholic church have three liturgies : the liturgy of st cyril the liturgy of st gregory the theologian the liturgy of st james , which resembles that of the byzantine rite liturgy , and is mandated on certain occasions , such as major feasts , the consecration of churches , and the first liturgies offered by newly ordained priests due to the long isolation of the saint thomas christians the rite of the syro-malankara catholic church shows some differences , so that this rite is called the malankara rite the main liturgy used by the coptic church is known as liturgy of saint basil the term liturgies of saint basil in a coptic context means not only the sole anaphora with or without the related prayers , but also the general order of the alexandrine rite liturgy the next epiclesis consists only of the prayer to the holy spirit to come and manifest the gifts , without any explicit request to change the gifts in the body and blood of christ it begins with a penitential rite in which first the priest prays inaudibly to christ for the forgiveness of sins ( the absolution to the son ) and then all the participants kneel in front of the altar and the celebrant , or the bishop if present , recites a prayer of absolution ( the absolution to the ministers ) the fraction of the consecrated lamb ensues , during which the priest says a prayer which varies according to the coptic calendar for the liturgy : holy patarag or in western armenian holy badarak , meaning 'sacrifice ' one element which almost certainly derives from the influence of western liturgy is the reading of a last gospel at the conclusion of the patarag

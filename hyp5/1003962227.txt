three divine liturgies are in common use in the byzantine rite : the divine liturgy of st john chrysostom ( 5th century ) , used on most days of the year and as a vesperal liturgy on the annunciation the divine liturgy of st basil the great ( 4th century ) , used on the five sundays of great lent and on saint basil 's feast day ( january 1 ) on the eves of the nativity and theophany and on holy thursday and holy saturday , it is celebrated as a vespers liturgy in some traditions , saint basil 's liturgy is also celebrated on the feast of the cross on september 14 the liturgy of the presanctified gifts ( 6th century ) is used during great lent on wednesdays , fridays , and a handful of other occasions , and also on the first three days of holy week nowadays it is always celebrated as a vesperal liturgy ; the liturgy of the faithful has no anaphora ( liturgy ) , the holy gifts having been consecrated and reserved ( '' presanctified '' ) at a previous divine liturgy as well as these , there are two others that are used locally and rarely , the liturgy of st still , the church is understood in eastern orthodoxy in terms not of the presbyter , but the diocesan bishop when the latter celebrates the liturgy personally , the service is more complex and festive in modern times , closed communion applies only to holy communion – reception of the sacrament of eucharist a typical celebration of the byzantine liturgy consists of : this part of the liturgy is private , performed only by the priest and deacon liturgy of preparation – the priest and deacon prepare the bread and wine for the eucharist ( see prosphora ) at the table of oblation ( prothesis ) liturgy of the catechumens in the early church , only baptized members who could receive holy communion were allowed to attend this portion of the liturgy the oriental orthodox churches own a richness of different liturgies , which are named after the anaphora included at present , the coptic orthodox church and coptic catholic church have three liturgies : the liturgy of st basil ( 4th century ) the liturgy of st cyril , this liturgy is also known as the liturgy of st cyril the liturgy of st gregory the theologian the liturgy of st due to the long isolation of the saint thomas christians the rite of the syro-malankara catholic church shows some differences , so that this rite is called the malankara rite the main liturgy used by the coptic church is known as liturgy of saint basil the next epiclesis consists only of the prayer to the holy spirit to come and manifest the gifts , without any explicit request to change the gifts in the body and blood of christ the term liturgy of saint basil may refer also to the whole eucharistic liturgy which in the coptic church has the following structure : it begins with the dressing of the priest with vestments and the preparation of the altar , along with prayers of worthiness for the celebrant another offering of incense is conduced ( the praxis incense ) , similar to the pauline incense except that only the first row of the faithful is incensed the liturgy of the faithful is the core of the liturgy , where are placed the proper eucharistic rites this means that the text of the patarag can be contained in a single , unified liturgical book , the պատարագամատոյց ( pataragamatooyts , western armenian badarakamadooyts , meaning 'the offering of sacrifice ' ) the elements of the armenian eucharistic liturgy reflect the rich set of influences on armenian culture

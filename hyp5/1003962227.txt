three divine liturgies are in common use in the byzantine rite : the divine liturgy of st john chrysostom ( 5th century ) , used on most days of the year and as a vesperal liturgy on the annunciation basil the great ( 4th century ) , used on the five sundays of great lent and on saint basil 's feast day ( january 1 ) on the eves of the nativity and theophany and on holy thursday and holy saturday , it is celebrated as a vespers liturgy in some traditions , saint basil 's liturgy is also celebrated on the feast of the cross on september 14 in all , this liturgy is used 10 times during the liturgical year the liturgy of the presanctified gifts ( 6th century ) is used during great lent on wednesdays , fridays , and a handful of other occasions , and also on the first three days of holy week nowadays it is always celebrated as a vesperal liturgy ; the liturgy of the faithful has no anaphora ( liturgy ) , the holy gifts having been consecrated and reserved ( '' presanctified '' ) at a previous divine liturgy as well as these , there are two others that are used locally and rarely , the liturgy of st as numbers in a diocese increased dramatically , the bishop who presides over the eucharistic assembly appointed presbyters to act as celebrants in the local communities ( the parishes ) still , the church is understood in eastern orthodoxy in terms not of the presbyter , but the diocesan bishop ) the format of divine liturgy is fixed , although the specific readings and hymns vary with season and feast in modern times , closed communion applies only to holy communion – reception of the sacrament of eucharist a typical celebration of the byzantine liturgy consists of : liturgy of preparation – the priest and deacon prepare the bread and wine for the eucharist ( see prosphora ) at the table of oblation ( prothesis ) in ancient rubrics , and contemporary greek practice , the sermon , nicene creed and the lord 's prayer are spoken/read , rather than chanted the oriental orthodox churches own a richness of different liturgies , which are named after the anaphora included at present , the coptic orthodox church and coptic catholic church have three liturgies : the liturgy of st basil ( 4th century ) the liturgy of st cyril , this liturgy is also known as the liturgy of st in addition the clergy performing the liturgy can combine extracts of the liturgies of st james , which resembles that of the byzantine rite liturgy , and is mandated on certain occasions , such as major feasts , the consecration of churches , and the first liturgies offered by newly ordained priests due to the long isolation of the saint thomas christians the rite of the syro-malankara catholic church shows some differences , so that this rite is called the malankara rite liturgy of saint basil the term liturgy of saint basil may refer also to the whole eucharistic liturgy which in the coptic church has the following structure : it begins with the dressing of the priest with vestments and the preparation of the altar , along with prayers of worthiness for the celebrant this portion was in ancient times the beginning of the liturgy , and the only part which could be attended by the catechumens the elevation is similar to that in the byzantine rite , with the celebrant who raises the portion of the lamb engraved with a cross ( the ispadikon ) crying : '' the holy things for the holy ones '' this is in distinction from the other liturgies of the oriental orthodox churches ( coptic , west syrian , ethiopic ) which have retained multiple anaphora the elements of the armenian eucharistic liturgy reflect the rich set of influences on armenian culture one element which almost certainly derives from the influence of western liturgy is the reading of a last gospel at the conclusion of the patarag

aged 17 in a letter to pyotr vyazemsky in the 1820s , eugene onegin is a bored st petersburg dandy , whose life consists of balls , concerts , parties , and nothing more lensky takes onegin to dine with the family of his fiancée , the sociable but rather thoughtless olga larina at this meeting , he also catches a glimpse of olga 's sister tatyana a quiet , precocious romantic , and the exact opposite of olga , tatyana becomes intensely drawn to onegin soon after , she bares her soul to onegin in a letter professing her love later , lensky mischievously invites onegin to tatyana 's name day celebration , promising a small gathering with just tatyana , olga , and their parents when onegin arrives , he finds instead a boisterous country ball , a rural parody of and contrast to the society balls of st onegin is irritated with the guests who gossip about him and tatyana , and with lensky for persuading him to come olga is insensitive to her fiancé and apparently attracted to onegin onegin has come to attend the most prominent balls and interact with the leaders of old russian society his induction into selfishness , vanity , and indifference occupies the introduction , and he is unable to escape it when he moves to the country tatyana learns her lesson : armored against feelings and steeped in convention , she crushes his later sincerity and remorse ( this epic reversal of roles , and the work 's broad social perspectives , provide ample justification for its subtitle '' a novel in verse '' thus , onegin has lost his love , killed his only friend , and found no satisfaction in his life many changes , some small and some large , were made from the first appearance to the final edition during pushkin 's lifetime chapter 1 was first published as a whole in a

work on the gypsies the first separate edition of chapter 4 appeared with chapter 5 in a publication produced between january 31 and february 2 , 1828 the writing of chapter 5 began on january 4 ,

from '' onegin 's letter '' , which was completed on october 5 , 1831 pushkin wrote at least 18 stanzas of a never-completed tenth chapter it contained many satires and even direct criticism on contemporary russian rulers , including the emperor himself afraid of being prosecuted for dissidence , pushkin burnt most of the tenth chapter very little of it survived in pushkin 's notebooks опыт реконструкции формы the first complete edition of the book was published in 1833 slight corrections were made by pushkin for the 1837 edition the standard accepted text is based on the 1837 edition with a few changes due to the tsar 's censorship restored zaretsky is described as '' classical and pedantic in duels '' ( chapter 6 , stanza xxvi ) , and this seems very out of character for a nobleman zaretsky 's first chance to end the duel is when he delivers lensky 's written challenge to onegin ( chapter 6 , stanza ix ) however , onegin oversleeps ( chapter 6 , stanza xxiv ) , and arrives on the scene more than an hour late this particular challenge and the importance of eugene onegin in russian literature have resulted in an impressive number of competing translations arndt 's 1963 translation was written keeping to the strict rhyme scheme of the onegin stanza and won the bollingen prize vladimir nabokov severely criticised arndt 's translation , as he had criticised many previous ( and later ) translations there are at least a dozen published translations of onegin in german the first two versions were published in 1921 , but the most popular version was a prose translation by kentaro ikeda in 1964 in 1958 , lenfilm produced a tv film eugene onegin , which was not in fact a screen version of the novel , but a screen version of the opera eugene onegin by

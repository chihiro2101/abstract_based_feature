major literary works pushkin , in the final chapter , fuses his muse and tatyana 's new 'form ' in society after a lengthy description of how she has guided him in his works in the dream , she is chased over a frozen winter landscape by a terrifying bear ( representing the ferocity of onegin 's inhuman persona ) and confronted by demons and goblins in a hut she hopes will provide shelter many changes , some small and some large , were made from the first appearance to the final edition during pushkin 's lifetime the following dates mostly come from nabokov 's study of the photographs of pushkin 's drafts that were available at the time , as well as other people 's work on the subject the first stanza of chapter 1 was started on may 9 , 1823 , and except for three stanzas ( xxxiii , xviii , and xix ) , the chapter was finished on october 22 chapter 1 was first published as a whole in a booklet on february 16 , 1825 , with a foreword which suggests that pushkin had no clear plan on how ( or even whether ) he would continue the novel chapter 2 was started on october 22 , 1823 ( the date when most of chapter 1 had been finished ) , and finished by december 8 , except for stanzas xl and xxxv , which were added sometime over the next three months many events occurred which interrupted the writing of chapter 3 in january 1824 , pushkin stopped work on onegin to work on the gypsies the first separate edition of chapter 4 appeared with chapter 5 in a publication produced between january 31 and february 2 , 1828 the writing of chapter 5 began on january 4 , 1826 , and 24 stanzas were complete before the start of his trip to petition the tsar for his freedom he left for this trip on september 4 and returned on november 2 , 1826 the first separate edition of chapter 5 appeared with chapter 4 in a publication produced between january 31 and february 2 , 1828 when nabokov carried out his study on the writing of onegin , the manuscript of chapter 6 was lost , but it is known that pushkin started chapter 6 before finishing chapter 5 pushkin intended to write a chapter called '' onegin 's journey '' , which occurred between the events of chapters 7 and 8 , and in fact was supposed to be the eighth chapter when pushkin completed chapter 8 , he published it as the final chapter and included within its denouement the line nine cantos i have written , still intending to complete this missing chapter during this time , he produced what nabokov describes as an '' incredible number of masterpieces '' and finished copying out chapter 8 on september 25 , 1830 during the summer of 1831 , pushkin revised and completed chapter 8 apart from '' onegin 's letter '' , which was completed on october 5 , 1831 zaretsky is described as '' classical and pedantic in duels '' ( chapter 6 , stanza xxvi ) , and this seems very out of character for a nobleman zaretsky 's first chance to end the duel is when he delivers lensky 's written challenge to onegin ( chapter 6 , stanza ix ) instead of asking onegin if he would like to apologise , he apologises for having much to do at home and leaves as soon as onegin ( obligatorily ) accepts the challenge however , onegin oversleeps ( chapter 6 , stanza xxiv ) , and arrives on the scene more than an hour late when onegin finally arrives , zaretsky is supposed to ask him a final time if he would like to apologise by his actions , zaretsky does not act as a nobleman should ; in the end onegin wins the duel instead , he tried to minimize his chances of hitting lensky by shooting without precise aiming , from the maximal possible distance , not even trying to come closer and get a clear shot this particular challenge and the importance of eugene onegin in russian literature have resulted in an impressive number of competing translations arndt 's 1963 translation was written keeping to the strict rhyme scheme of the onegin stanza and won the bollingen prize it is still considered one of the best translations carl friedrich von der borg , eugenius onegin , of which the first part was published in '' der refraktor the 1879 opera eugene onegin , by tchaikovsky , based on the story , is perhaps the version that most people are familiar with the film compresses the events of the novel somewhat : for example , the name day celebrations take place on the same day as onegin 's speech to tatyana

the major chinese text that introduced hanja to koreans , however , was not a religious text but the chinese text cheonjamun ; thousand character classic ) although koreans had to learn classical chinese to be properly literate for the most part , some additional systems were developed which used simplified forms of chinese characters that phonetically transcribe korean , including hyangchal , gugyeol , and idu one way of adapting hanja to write korean in such systems ( such as gugyeol ) was to represent native korean grammatical particles and other words solely according to their pronunciation for example , gugyeol uses the characters to transcribe the korean word '' hăni '' , which in modern korean means '' does , and so '' in chinese , however , the same characters are read in mandarin as the expression '' wéi ní '' , meaning '' becoming a nun '' hanja were the sole means of writing korean until king sejong the great promoted the invention of hangul in the 15th century even after the invention of hangul , however , most korean scholars continued to write in hanmun since june 1949 , hanja have not officially been used in north korea , and , in addition , most texts are now most commonly written horizontally instead of vertically many words borrowed from chinese have also been replaced in the north with native korean words nevertheless , a large number of chinese-borrowed words are still widely used in the north ( although written in hangul ) , and hanja still appear in special contexts , such as recent north korean dictionaries the vast majority of hanja use the additional elements to indicate the sound of the character , but a few hanja are purely pictographic , and some were formed in other ways thus the hanja being used came from the characters already being used by the chinese at the time since hanja was primarily used by the elite and scholars , it was hard for others to learn , thus much character development was limited scholars in the 4th century used this to study and write confucian classics , which were written with these traditional characters as opposed to the not yet invented simplified characters hanja uses traditional characters that came before the invention of simplified characters hanja is rarely used today , which could be used as an explanation as to why hanja did not have the chance to adapt to simplified characters the historical use of hanja in korea has had a change over time martin taylor , the authors explain that from the 1920s to 1990 the use of hanja as a social idea and political idea has decreased drastically this shows that hanja would not be able to gain the use of simplified characters due to the decrease of usage thus , to the knowledge that is still being used traditional characters would remain the traditional style of hanja being used hanja 's language of origin , chinese , has many homophones , and hanja words became even more homophonic when they came into korean , since korean lacks a tonal system , which is how chinese distinguishes many words that would otherwise be homophonic korean name are generally based on hanja , although some exceptions exist due to standardization efforts during goryeo and joseon eras , native korean placenames were converted to hanja , and most names used today are hanja-based the pronunciation of hanja in korean is by no means identical to the way they are pronounced in modern chinese , particularly mandarin , although some chinese dialects and korean share similar pronunciations for some characters when learning how to write hanja , students are taught to memorize the native korean pronunciation for the hanja 's meaning and the sino-korean pronunciations ( the pronunciation based on the chinese pronunciation of the characters ) for each hanja respectively so that students know what the syllable and meaning is for a particular hanja for example , the name for the hanja is ( mul-su ) in which ( mul ) is the native korean pronunciation for '' water '' , while ( su ) is the sino-korean pronunciation of the character

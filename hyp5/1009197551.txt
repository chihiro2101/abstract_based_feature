a major motivation for the introduction of chinese characters into korea was the spread of buddhism the major chinese text that introduced hanja to koreans , however , was not a religious text but the chinese text cheonjamun ; thousand character classic ) one way of adapting hanja to write korean in such systems ( such as gugyeol ) was to represent native korean grammatical particles and other words solely according to their pronunciation for example , gugyeol uses the characters to transcribe the korean word '' hăni '' , which in modern korean means '' does , and so '' in chinese , however , the same characters are read in mandarin as the expression '' wéi ní '' , meaning '' becoming a nun '' hanja were the sole means of writing korean until king sejong the great promoted the invention of hangul in the 15th century since june 1949 , hanja have not officially been used in north korea , and , in addition , most texts are now most commonly written horizontally instead of vertically many words borrowed from chinese have also been replaced in the north with native korean words the replacement has been less total in south korea where , although usage has declined over time , some hanja remain in common usage in some contexts thus the hanja being used came from the characters already being used by the chinese at the time since hanja was primarily used by the elite and scholars , it was hard for others to learn , thus much character development was limited character formation is also coined to the idu form which was a buddhist writing system for chinese characters character development of hanja can be traced further back then when the use in korea had begun hanja uses traditional characters that came before the invention of simplified characters hanja is rarely used today , which could be used as an explanation as to why hanja did not have the chance to adapt to simplified characters however , this also brings up the discussion of whether or not hanja should still be in use today or not this shows that hanja would not be able to gain the use of simplified characters due to the decrease of usage thus , to the knowledge that is still being used traditional characters would remain the traditional style of hanja being used the word or words used to denote the meaning are often & mdash ; though hardly always & mdash ; words of native korean ( i.e south korean primary schools abandoned the teaching of hanja in 1971 , although they are still taught as part of the mandatory curriculum in grade 6 hannas 1997 : 68-69 the 1972 promulgation of basic hanja for educational use changed on december 31 , 2000 , to replace 44 hanja with 44 others '' the number of hanja taught in primary and secondary schools is actually greater than the 1,800 taught in south korea as an example of how hanja can help to clear up ambiguity , many homophones can be distinguished by using hanja nevertheless , on official documents , people 's names are still recorded in both hangul and in hanja ( if the name is composed of hanja ) most atlases of korea today are published in two versions : one in hangul ( sometimes with some english as well ) , and one in hanja when learning how to write hanja , students are taught to memorize the native korean pronunciation for the hanja 's meaning and the sino-korean pronunciations ( the pronunciation based on the chinese pronunciation of the characters ) for each hanja respectively so that students know what the syllable and meaning is for a particular hanja

a major motivation for the introduction of chinese characters into korea was the spread of buddhism the major chinese text that introduced hanja to koreans , however , was not a religious text but the chinese text cheonjamun ; thousand character classic ) although koreans had to learn classical chinese to be properly literate for the most part , some additional systems were developed which used simplified forms of chinese characters that phonetically transcribe korean , including hyangchal , gugyeol , and idu one way of adapting hanja to write korean in such systems ( such as gugyeol ) was to represent native korean grammatical particles and other words solely according to their pronunciation for example , gugyeol uses the characters to transcribe the korean word '' hăni '' , which in modern korean means '' does , and so '' in chinese , however , the same characters are read in mandarin as the expression '' wéi ní '' , meaning '' becoming a nun '' this is a typical example of gugyeol words where the radical is read in korean for its meaning ( hă— '' to do '' ) , whereas the suffix , ni ( meaning '' nun '' ) , is used phonetically hanja were the sole means of writing korean until king sejong the great promoted the invention of hangul in the 15th century hangul effectively replaced hanja only in the 20th century since june 1949 , hanja have not officially been used in north korea , and , in addition , most texts are now most commonly written horizontally instead of vertically many words borrowed from chinese have also been replaced in the north with native korean words thus the hanja being used came from the characters already being used by the chinese at the time scholars in the 4th century used this to study and write confucian classics , which were written with these traditional characters as opposed to the not yet invented simplified characters in writing and literacy in chinese , korean , and japanese by insup taylor and m martin taylor , the authors explain that from the 1920s to 1990 the use of hanja as a social idea and political idea has decreased drastically thus , to the knowledge that is still being used traditional characters would remain the traditional style of hanja being used the word or words used to denote the meaning are often & mdash ; though hardly always & mdash ; words of native korean ( i.e they are taught in separate courses in education in south korea , separately from the normal korean-language curriculum '' a balance was struck in august 1976 , when the ministry of education agreed to keep chinese characters out of the elementary schools and teach the 1,800 characters in special courses , not as part of korean language or any other substantive curricula '' although north korea has removed chinese characters from its written materials , it has , paradoxically , ended up with an educational program that teachers more characters than either south korea or japan , as table 2 shows '' but by the 1960s , he had reversed his stance ; he was quoted as saying in 1966 , '' while we should use as few sinitic terms as possible , students must be exposed to the necessary chinese characters and taught how to write them '' hannas 1997 : 67 as a result , a chinese-character textbook was designed for north korean schools for use in grades 5–9 , teaching 1,500 characters , with another 500 for high school students in modern korean dictionaries , all entry words of sino-korean origin are printed in hangul and listed in hangul order , with the hanja given in parentheses immediately following the entry word nevertheless , on official documents , people 's names are still recorded in both hangul and in hanja ( if the name is composed of hanja ) the pronunciation of hanja in korean is by no means identical to the way they are pronounced in modern chinese , particularly mandarin , although some chinese dialects and korean share similar pronunciations for some characters when learning how to write hanja , students are taught to memorize the native korean pronunciation for the hanja 's meaning and the sino-korean pronunciations ( the pronunciation based on the chinese pronunciation of the characters ) for each hanja respectively so that students know what the syllable and meaning is for a particular hanja

a major motivation for the introduction of chinese characters into korea was the spread of buddhism the major chinese text that introduced hanja to koreans , however , was not a religious text but the chinese text cheonjamun ; thousand character classic ) although koreans had to learn classical chinese to be properly literate for the most part , some additional systems were developed which used simplified forms of chinese characters that phonetically transcribe korean , including hyangchal , gugyeol , and idu one way of adapting hanja to write korean in such systems ( such as gugyeol ) was to represent native korean grammatical particles and other words solely according to their pronunciation for example , gugyeol uses the characters to transcribe the korean word '' hăni '' , which in modern korean means '' does , and so '' this is a typical example of gugyeol words where the radical is read in korean for its meaning ( hă— '' to do '' ) , whereas the suffix , ni ( meaning '' nun '' ) , is used phonetically hanja were the sole means of writing korean until king sejong the great promoted the invention of hangul in the 15th century since june 1949 , hanja have not officially been used in north korea , and , in addition , most texts are now most commonly written horizontally instead of vertically many words borrowed from chinese have also been replaced in the north with native korean words nevertheless , a large number of chinese-borrowed words are still widely used in the north ( although written in hangul ) , and hanja still appear in special contexts , such as recent north korean dictionaries the vast majority of hanja use the additional elements to indicate the sound of the character , but a few hanja are purely pictographic , and some were formed in other ways thus the hanja being used came from the characters already being used by the chinese at the time since hanja was primarily used by the elite and scholars , it was hard for others to learn , thus much character development was limited scholars in the 4th century used this to study and write confucian classics , which were written with these traditional characters as opposed to the not yet invented simplified characters character formation is also coined to the idu form which was a buddhist writing system for chinese characters hanja uses traditional characters that came before the invention of simplified characters hanja is rarely used today , which could be used as an explanation as to why hanja did not have the chance to adapt to simplified characters however , this also brings up the discussion of whether or not hanja should still be in use today or not thus , to the knowledge that is still being used traditional characters would remain the traditional style of hanja being used to aid in understanding the meaning of a character , or to describe it orally to distinguish it from other characters with the same pronunciation , character dictionaries and school textbooks refer to each character with a combination of its sound and a word indicating its meaning '' a balance was struck in august 1976 , when the ministry of education agreed to keep chinese characters out of the elementary schools and teach the 1,800 characters in special courses , not as part of korean language or any other substantive curricula hannas 1997 : 68-69 the 1972 promulgation of basic hanja for educational use changed on december 31 , 2000 , to replace 44 hanja with 44 others hanja 's language of origin , chinese , has many homophones , and hanja words became even more homophonic when they came into korean , since korean lacks a tonal system , which is how chinese distinguishes many words that would otherwise be homophonic nevertheless , on official documents , people 's names are still recorded in both hangul and in hanja ( if the name is composed of hanja ) hanja terms are also expressed through hangul , the standard script in the korean language the pronunciation of hanja in korean is by no means identical to the way they are pronounced in modern chinese , particularly mandarin , although some chinese dialects and korean share similar pronunciations for some characters

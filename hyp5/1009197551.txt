the major chinese text that introduced hanja to koreans , however , was not a religious text but the chinese text cheonjamun ; thousand character classic ) although koreans had to learn classical chinese to be properly literate for the most part , some additional systems were developed which used simplified forms of chinese characters that phonetically transcribe korean , including hyangchal , gugyeol , and idu one way of adapting hanja to write korean in such systems ( such as gugyeol ) was to represent native korean grammatical particles and other words solely according to their pronunciation for example , gugyeol uses the characters to transcribe the korean word '' hăni '' , which in modern korean means '' does , and so '' this is a typical example of gugyeol words where the radical is read in korean for its meaning ( hă— '' to do '' ) , whereas the suffix , ni ( meaning '' nun '' ) , is used phonetically hanja were the sole means of writing korean until king sejong the great promoted the invention of hangul in the 15th century even after the invention of hangul , however , most korean scholars continued to write in hanmun many words borrowed from chinese have also been replaced in the north with native korean words nevertheless , a large number of chinese-borrowed words are still widely used in the north ( although written in hangul ) , and hanja still appear in special contexts , such as recent north korean dictionaries the replacement has been less total in south korea where , although usage has declined over time , some hanja remain in common usage in some contexts each hanja is composed of one of 214 radicals plus in most cases one or more additional elements the vast majority of hanja use the additional elements to indicate the sound of the character , but a few hanja are purely pictographic , and some were formed in other ways thus the hanja being used came from the characters already being used by the chinese at the time since hanja was primarily used by the elite and scholars , it was hard for others to learn , thus much character development was limited this practice however was limited due to the opinion of buddhism whether it was favorable at the time or not even before the creation of simplified characters , hanja was already losing ground to the newly invented hangul system hanja is rarely used today , which could be used as an explanation as to why hanja did not have the chance to adapt to simplified characters thus , to the knowledge that is still being used traditional characters would remain the traditional style of hanja being used south korean primary schools abandoned the teaching of hanja in 1971 , although they are still taught as part of the mandatory curriculum in grade 6 '' a balance was struck in august 1976 , when the ministry of education agreed to keep chinese characters out of the elementary schools and teach the 1,800 characters in special courses , not as part of korean language or any other substantive curricula hannas 1997 : 68-69 the 1972 promulgation of basic hanja for educational use changed on december 31 , 2000 , to replace 44 hanja with 44 others because many different hanja—and thus , many different words written using hanja—often share the homophone , two distinct hanja words ( hanjaeo ) may be spelled identically in the phonetic hangul alphabet the most notable exception is the name of the capital , seoul , a native korean word meaning '' capital '' with no direct hanja conversion ; the hanja gyeong , '' capital '' ) is sometimes used as a back-rendering for the traditional creative arts such as calligraphy and painting , a knowledge of hanja is needed to write and understand the various scripts and inscriptions , as is the same in china and japan the pronunciation of hanja in korean is by no means identical to the way they are pronounced in modern chinese , particularly mandarin , although some chinese dialects and korean share similar pronunciations for some characters for example , the name for the hanja is ( mul-su ) in which ( mul ) is the native korean pronunciation for '' water '' , while ( su ) is the sino-korean pronunciation of the character

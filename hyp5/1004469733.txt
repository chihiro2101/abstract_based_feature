the william jolly bridge was constructed between 1928 and 1932 following the formation of greater brisbane in 1925 , and was one of the first major capital works of the new brisbane city council and bears the name of its first mayor , william jolly at the time of construction , the only traffic bridge linking the brisbane cbd and south brisbane was the second victoria bridge , built in 1897 to replace an earlier bridge washed away in the flood of 1893 the william jolly bridge crosses the brisbane river at the tip of the south brisbane peninsula between grey street , south brisbane , and at north quay at the intersection of skew and saul streets on the northern bank a sandy beach marked the point of crossing for aboriginal tribes from the moreton region , then later for europeans who crossed the river near this point on the north quay ferry , and then from the 1930s via the william jolly bridge on the south bank , aboriginal and later european pathways and land use patterns formed the basis for subsequent traffic networks ( the riverfront park adjacent to the bridge at south brisbane is now called kurilpa point those en route to the outstations at cowper 's ( coopers ) plains , limestone hill and cleveland crossed the area in 1846 brisbane was brought within the provisions of the police towns act of 1839 , and boundaries to the town were set for over 30 years this was the only vehicular ferry crossing to north brisbane ( as the brisbane cbd was then known ) in this area , except for a brief period from june 1865-november 1867 when a temporary timber bridge , which was rapidly destroyed by marine borer , spanned the river the extension on the main line railway from ipswich to brisbane in 1875 isolated the strip of riverfront residences from the working-class houses in milton and paddington , and this contributed to the relative lack of development along the northern bank of the milton reach of the river in subsequent years the opening of the victoria bridge on 15 june 1874 provided an important transport and communications link between the north and south banks of the river , and provided further impetus to the development of the south bank eventually , responsibility for the bridge was taken over by the queensland government the south brisbane dry dock was opened in 1881 , coal wharves at woolloongabba and associated rail links were established c.1885 , and south brisbane railway station was established as the passenger terminus for suburban and country lines built during the 1880s the development of the civic centre focused on the stanley and vulture street intersection , with the construction of the south brisbane town hall , fire station , post office and south brisbane railway station a report in the telegraph on 8 february 1893 described the event as : '' what a terrible hiatus in the course of business alone has been caused by the collapse of victoria bridge on 3 october 1903 , the queensland government gazetted the proclamation which constituted the city of south brisbane from 1908 the city of south brisbane tried to bring all the wharves in the south brisbane reach under its control and encouraged further commercial and industrial development along the river front in the immediate period after world war i , residential growth created continued demand for public transport , particularly through and from the south brisbane peninsula land resumption for road widening was enacted in both stanley and melbourne streets , and in september 1925 , south brisbane city council is noted as having a population of 40,000 persons in 1930 the completion of the sydneyâ€“brisbane rail corridor benefited the local economy with a demand for factory and manufacturing sites as a result , when the time came to resume land in connection with the construction of the grey street bridge , there was scant opposition the victoria bridge also contributed to traffic congestion in the brisbane cbd as all traffic between the suburbs on the north and south sides of the river had to pass through the cbd the 1897 victoria bridge had a paved deck with bituminous surfacing on wrought iron troughing in 1922 , the need for additional traffic on victoria bridge was identified , and the mayor of brisbane noted the need for cross river traffic as pressing and urgent a bridge at grey street would be a bypass for motor traffic between the southern suburbs and western suburbs of brisbane to avoid increasing traffic congestion on the victoria bridge and on cbd streets such as george street a crossing at kangaroo point ( where the story bridge was later built ) was estimated to cost 6 times the grey street crossing , and further reports were commissioned from william john earle , the city planner , and eneas fraser gilchrist , the city engineer on 7 june 1926 council decided to build a bridge from grey street , south brisbane the council called applications for a bridge engineer to design a steel or reinforced concrete bridge on 10 july 1926 alison eavis harding frew ( 1883-1952 ) , a local but prominent civil engineer , was appointed engineer for the bridge on 12 november 1926 problems were encountered with the design of the bridge due to the depth of rock below the river bed increasing from approximately on the southern bank the maintenance requirements for , and performance of , steel bridges was also noted as a concern the final decision of the type of bridge , from the five under consideration , was essentially aesthetic , and was influenced by the so-called rainbow arch bridge , carrying robert street , st paul , minnesota across the mississippi river '' the selected bridge design differed from the st paul bridge in that it has three major spans whereas the st paul bridge only has one , and this has been suggested as possibly making the william jolly bridge unique the council resumed large areas of land bounded by roma , saul and skew streets , and between skew street , eagle terrace and north quay on the northern side , and on the southern side , east of grey street between montague road and melbourne street an artist 's impression at the time of construction shows trams crossing the bridge with overhead cables , a monument of some kind at the intersection of skew and saul streets , and a different number of viaducts on southern side to those actually built the southern approach spans piers founded on timber piles all driven to rock , or to such depths as it was possible to drive them without damage , and the river piers are founded on reinforced concrete caissons the foundations for the bridge were very deep , and the experience gained in the construction of this bridge , and later the story bridge , was considered of great value and to be a major achievement the william jolly bridge crosses the brisbane river at the tip of the south brisbane peninsula between grey street , south brisbane , and north quay at the intersection of skew and saul streets on the northern bank william jolly bridge was listed on the queensland heritage register on 6 august 1996 having satisfied the following criteria it was brisbane 's second traffic bridge and provided an important transport and communications link between both sides of the river , as well as further impetus for the development of the south brisbane peninsula the william jolly bridge demonstrates a high degree of technical achievement in its design , its use of gunite ( sprayed dry mix concrete ) , and in the development of the sand island method used for the construction of its river piers

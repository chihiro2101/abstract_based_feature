the william jolly bridge was constructed between 1928 and 1932 following the formation of greater brisbane in 1925 , and was one of the first major capital works of the new brisbane city council and bears the name of its first mayor , william jolly at the time of construction , the only traffic bridge linking the brisbane cbd and south brisbane was the second victoria bridge , built in 1897 to replace an earlier bridge washed away in the flood of 1893 the william jolly bridge crosses the brisbane river at the tip of the south brisbane peninsula between grey street , south brisbane , and at north quay at the intersection of skew and saul streets on the northern bank the tip of the south brisbane peninsula is traditionally a point of crossing the first european use of the south bank occurred soon after the establishment of the moreton bay penal settlement in 1825 when convicts cleared the flats across the river in order to grow grain to feed the settlement in 1846 brisbane was brought within the provisions of the police towns act of 1839 , and boundaries to the town were set for over 30 years this was the only vehicular ferry crossing to north brisbane ( as the brisbane cbd was then known ) in this area , except for a brief period from june 1865-november 1867 when a temporary timber bridge , which was rapidly destroyed by marine borer , spanned the river first brisbane burial ground had been established on the northern bank where skew street is now located , ( later moved to hale street where it became known as paddington cemetery , site now partially occupied by suncorp stadium ) , and to the rear of the burial ground a new gaol was established by 1860 and military barracks in 1864 farming was established along the banks of the river , and development concentrated on petrie terrace the north quay ferry , a row boat , crossed the river where the bridge now stands , and the river road ( now coronation drive ) was established as a track which serviced properties towards toowong the victoria bridge was funded by the brisbane municipal council and a toll was imposed to recover costs the south brisbane dry dock was opened in 1881 , coal wharves at woolloongabba and associated rail links were established c.1885 , and south brisbane railway station was established as the passenger terminus for suburban and country lines built during the 1880s a series of 1893 brisbane flood resulted in the collapse of the albert rail bridge at indooroopilly in 1893 , which diverted all rail traffic to south brisbane , and the collapse of victoria bridge on 6 february 1893 which cut vital transport and communications links with the central city a report in the telegraph on 8 february 1893 described the event as : '' what a terrible hiatus in the course of business alone has been caused by the collapse of victoria bridge no bridge , no telephone , no telegraph , and vastly inadequate ferry accommodation '' urban expansion on both sides of the river continued with the opening of the new victoria bridge in 1897 and the trams in brisbane on 3 october 1903 , the queensland government gazetted the proclamation which constituted the city of south brisbane from 1908 the city of south brisbane tried to bring all the wharves in the south brisbane reach under its control and encouraged further commercial and industrial development along the river front health factors , noise and nuisance associated with industry and proximity to wharves and docks all contributed to the changing perception of the area bounded by grey and boundary streets , montague road and the river as a result , when the time came to resume land in connection with the construction of the grey street bridge , there was scant opposition the grey street bridge was conceived as a bypass for motor traffic between the southern suburbs and western suburbs of brisbane to avoid increasing traffic congestion on the victoria bridge and on cbd streets such as george street the victoria bridge also contributed to traffic congestion in the brisbane cbd as all traffic between the suburbs on the north and south sides of the river had to pass through the cbd the 1897 victoria bridge had a paved deck with bituminous surfacing on wrought iron troughing a bridge at grey street would be a bypass for motor traffic between the southern suburbs and western suburbs of brisbane to avoid increasing traffic congestion on the victoria bridge and on cbd streets such as george street a crossing at kangaroo point ( where the story bridge was later built ) was estimated to cost 6 times the grey street crossing , and further reports were commissioned from william john earle , the city planner , and eneas fraser gilchrist , the city engineer on 7 june 1926 council decided to build a bridge from grey street , south brisbane alison eavis harding frew ( 1883-1952 ) , a local but prominent civil engineer , was appointed engineer for the bridge on 12 november 1926 harding frew considered five bridge types , each a variation on a theme , stating in his report that : '' it is frankly admitted that the purely economical aspect alone has not been given as much weight the chosen bridge design was to be of concrete-encased steel with arched ribs which rise through the deck the final decision of the type of bridge , from the five under consideration , was essentially aesthetic , and was influenced by the so-called rainbow arch bridge , carrying robert street , st paul , minnesota across the mississippi river harding frew acknowledged this in his report , including photographs of the bridge , and stated that : '' the time has come when some improvement in the appearance of our city bridges should be looked for in queensland the questions of utility and aesthetics should also be weighed carefully , especially in relation to a city 's importance , its civic pride , and its future '' the selected bridge design differed from the st paul bridge in that it has three major spans whereas the st paul bridge only has one , and this has been suggested as possibly making the william jolly bridge unique the final position of the bridge was determined by harding frew 's recommendations ( earle and gilchrist 's were slightly upstream from the present site ) and was accepted by council in late 1926 nevertheless , council called tenders and mr hornibrook ltd submitted the lowest of Â£384,850 and this was accepted on 8 may 1928 an incident occurred on 17 february 1927 which highlighted the potentially disastrous situation of having only one bridge across the brisbane river as mentioned , the depth-to-rock over much of the length of the william jolly bridge posed a major problem in the design of the foundations originally the bridge , roadways and footpaths were illuminated by spherical glass light fittings on cast metal mountings on both sides of the arches and the decorative arches of the tower-like elements the william jolly bridge crosses the brisbane river at the tip of the south brisbane peninsula between grey street , south brisbane , and north quay at the intersection of skew and saul streets on the northern bank the william jolly bridge is located at the tip of the south brisbane peninsula , a location which traditionally has been a point of crossing of the brisbane river from pre-european settlement it was brisbane 's second traffic bridge and provided an important transport and communications link between both sides of the river , as well as further impetus for the development of the south brisbane peninsula

the william jolly bridge was constructed between 1928 and 1932 following the formation of greater brisbane in 1925 , and was one of the first major capital works of the new brisbane city council and bears the name of its first mayor , william jolly at the time of construction , the only traffic bridge linking the brisbane cbd and south brisbane was the second victoria bridge , built in 1897 to replace an earlier bridge washed away in the flood of 1893 the william jolly bridge crosses the brisbane river at the tip of the south brisbane peninsula between grey street , south brisbane , and at north quay at the intersection of skew and saul streets on the northern bank the tip of the south brisbane peninsula is traditionally a point of crossing a sandy beach marked the point of crossing for aboriginal tribes from the moreton region , then later for europeans who crossed the river near this point on the north quay ferry , and then from the 1930s via the william jolly bridge on the south bank , aboriginal and later european pathways and land use patterns formed the basis for subsequent traffic networks prior to european settlement , the whole of the south brisbane peninsula was known as kurilpa , meaning the place of rats , due to the large number of bush rats to be found in the lush vegetation of the area in 1830 the cultivation of the flats on the south bank was ordered to cease by the commandant ; however throughout the 1830s timber was being exported to sydney from the south bank for over 30 years this was the only vehicular ferry crossing to north brisbane ( as the brisbane cbd was then known ) in this area , except for a brief period from june 1865-november 1867 when a temporary timber bridge , which was rapidly destroyed by marine borer , spanned the river the north quay ferry , a row boat , crossed the river where the bridge now stands , and the river road ( now coronation drive ) was established as a track which serviced properties towards toowong the development of the civic centre focused on the stanley and vulture street intersection , with the construction of the south brisbane town hall , fire station , post office and south brisbane railway station a series of 1893 brisbane flood resulted in the collapse of the albert rail bridge at indooroopilly in 1893 , which diverted all rail traffic to south brisbane , and the collapse of victoria bridge on 6 february 1893 which cut vital transport and communications links with the central city a report in the telegraph on 8 february 1893 described the event as : '' what a terrible hiatus in the course of business alone has been caused by the collapse of victoria bridge '' urban expansion on both sides of the river continued with the opening of the new victoria bridge in 1897 and the trams in brisbane on 3 october 1903 , the queensland government gazetted the proclamation which constituted the city of south brisbane in the immediate period after world war i , residential growth created continued demand for public transport , particularly through and from the south brisbane peninsula land resumption for road widening was enacted in both stanley and melbourne streets , and in september 1925 , south brisbane city council is noted as having a population of 40,000 persons in 1930 the completion of the sydney–brisbane rail corridor benefited the local economy with a demand for factory and manufacturing sites as a result , when the time came to resume land in connection with the construction of the grey street bridge , there was scant opposition the grey street bridge was conceived as a bypass for motor traffic between the southern suburbs and western suburbs of brisbane to avoid increasing traffic congestion on the victoria bridge and on cbd streets such as george street traffic across the victoria bridge had increased 76 % from 1912–1925 , and in 1923 it was noted that traffic tonnage had increased 49.5 % in 15 months the victoria bridge also contributed to traffic congestion in the brisbane cbd as all traffic between the suburbs on the north and south sides of the river had to pass through the cbd between 1920-1922 this paving was replaced by concrete , causing traffic congestion the victoria bridge structure was investigated in 1923 to determine its strength for further loading , and walter james doak , bridge engineer of the queensland railways , noted that the bridge is now loaded to rather more than its orthodox capacity under live load , but it was considered that there was no immediate danger of collapse mayor william alfred jolly was chairman of the bridges and ferries committee , and recommended that three experts be employed a bridge at grey street would be a bypass for motor traffic between the southern suburbs and western suburbs of brisbane to avoid increasing traffic congestion on the victoria bridge and on cbd streets such as george street a crossing at kangaroo point ( where the story bridge was later built ) was estimated to cost 6 times the grey street crossing , and further reports were commissioned from william john earle , the city planner , and eneas fraser gilchrist , the city engineer these reports proposed the grey street bridge be two level for road and rail traffic , and a second bridge from wellington road to sydney street , new farm , with a major ring road called the main parkway boulevard , be constructed on 7 june 1926 council decided to build a bridge from grey street , south brisbane the council called applications for a bridge engineer to design a steel or reinforced concrete bridge on 10 july 1926 the final decision of the type of bridge , from the five under consideration , was essentially aesthetic , and was influenced by the so-called rainbow arch bridge , carrying robert street , st paul , minnesota across the mississippi river '' the selected bridge design differed from the st paul bridge in that it has three major spans whereas the st paul bridge only has one , and this has been suggested as possibly making the william jolly bridge unique the council resumed large areas of land bounded by roma , saul and skew streets , and between skew street , eagle terrace and north quay on the northern side , and on the southern side , east of grey street between montague road and melbourne street the final position of the bridge was determined by harding frew 's recommendations ( earle and gilchrist 's were slightly upstream from the present site ) and was accepted by council in late 1926 the bridge was to have a north quay underpass , and the estimated total cost was £700,000 including viaducts , compulsory acquisitions , roadways , approaches and contingencies an incident occurred on 17 february 1927 which highlighted the potentially disastrous situation of having only one bridge across the brisbane river the cargo steamer chronos was taken upstream by a rising tide and the bow was wedged under the victoria bridge the opening booklet for the bridge states : '' the encasing of broad flange beams with concrete applied under pressure introduces new methods to brisbane to achieve this , the bridge was constructed with three major spans of arched ribs across the river , with two smaller arches at the northern embankment and a single arch at the southern embankment , and a viaduct consisting of 16 spans ramping down to grey street to the south the william jolly bridge is located at the tip of the south brisbane peninsula , a location which traditionally has been a point of crossing of the brisbane river from pre-european settlement the william jolly bridge was designed by ae harding frew , a distinguished brisbane engineer , and was a major work by queensland contractors evans deakin and co and mr hornibrook ltd

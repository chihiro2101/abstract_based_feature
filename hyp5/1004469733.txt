the william jolly bridge was constructed between 1928 and 1932 following the formation of greater brisbane in 1925 , and was one of the first major capital works of the new brisbane city council and bears the name of its first mayor , william jolly at the time of construction , the only traffic bridge linking the brisbane cbd and south brisbane was the second victoria bridge , built in 1897 to replace an earlier bridge washed away in the flood of 1893 the william jolly bridge crosses the brisbane river at the tip of the south brisbane peninsula between grey street , south brisbane , and at north quay at the intersection of skew and saul streets on the northern bank the tip of the south brisbane peninsula is traditionally a point of crossing a sandy beach marked the point of crossing for aboriginal tribes from the moreton region , then later for europeans who crossed the river near this point on the north quay ferry , and then from the 1930s via the william jolly bridge ( the riverfront park adjacent to the bridge at south brisbane is now called kurilpa point farming was established along the banks of the river , and development concentrated on petrie terrace the north quay ferry , a row boat , crossed the river where the bridge now stands , and the river road ( now coronation drive ) was established as a track which serviced properties towards toowong the victoria bridge was funded by the brisbane municipal council and a toll was imposed to recover costs the south brisbane dry dock was opened in 1881 , coal wharves at woolloongabba and associated rail links were established c.1885 , and south brisbane railway station was established as the passenger terminus for suburban and country lines built during the 1880s the spread of housing included the development of large residences located along the ridges with views of the river , and industry developed along the southern bank of the milton reach the development of the civic centre focused on the stanley and vulture street intersection , with the construction of the south brisbane town hall , fire station , post office and south brisbane railway station a series of 1893 brisbane flood resulted in the collapse of the albert rail bridge at indooroopilly in 1893 , which diverted all rail traffic to south brisbane , and the collapse of victoria bridge on 6 february 1893 which cut vital transport and communications links with the central city a report in the telegraph on 8 february 1893 described the event as : '' what a terrible hiatus in the course of business alone has been caused by the collapse of victoria bridge '' urban expansion on both sides of the river continued with the opening of the new victoria bridge in 1897 and the trams in brisbane from 1908 the city of south brisbane tried to bring all the wharves in the south brisbane reach under its control and encouraged further commercial and industrial development along the river front as finance permitted , provision of services such as gas , electricity , road sealing , water supply and an adequate system of drainage and sanitation improved the living and working conditions in the area and generated a demand for residential accommodation and improved cross-river communication land resumption for road widening was enacted in both stanley and melbourne streets , and in september 1925 , south brisbane city council is noted as having a population of 40,000 persons as a result , when the time came to resume land in connection with the construction of the grey street bridge , there was scant opposition the grey street bridge was conceived as a bypass for motor traffic between the southern suburbs and western suburbs of brisbane to avoid increasing traffic congestion on the victoria bridge and on cbd streets such as george street traffic across the victoria bridge had increased 76 % from 1912â€“1925 , and in 1923 it was noted that traffic tonnage had increased 49.5 % in 15 months the victoria bridge also contributed to traffic congestion in the brisbane cbd as all traffic between the suburbs on the north and south sides of the river had to pass through the cbd mayor william alfred jolly was chairman of the bridges and ferries committee , and recommended that three experts be employed a bridge at grey street would be a bypass for motor traffic between the southern suburbs and western suburbs of brisbane to avoid increasing traffic congestion on the victoria bridge and on cbd streets such as george street these reports proposed the grey street bridge be two level for road and rail traffic , and a second bridge from wellington road to sydney street , new farm , with a major ring road called the main parkway boulevard , be constructed on 7 june 1926 council decided to build a bridge from grey street , south brisbane the council called applications for a bridge engineer to design a steel or reinforced concrete bridge on 10 july 1926 due to the costly foundation work , a bridge type with long spans was chosen harding frew acknowledged this in his report , including photographs of the bridge , and stated that : '' the time has come when some improvement in the appearance of our city bridges should be looked for in queensland an incident occurred on 17 february 1927 which highlighted the potentially disastrous situation of having only one bridge across the brisbane river tugs managed to pull it out eventually , but the rising tide could have dislodged a span of the bridge and dumped it in the river , and this was highlighted in the press at the time as mentioned , the depth-to-rock over much of the length of the william jolly bridge posed a major problem in the design of the foundations the original design had the piers supported on timber piles , with inclined piles to resist the thrust from the small arch piles were driven immediately to the south of the pier , but it became impossible to drive them into the rock and the design was changed to utilise reinforced concrete caissons ( heavy , hollow , vertical reinforced concrete cylinders ) , and the contractor was noted as being completely in accord with this decision the sand island is an artificial island constructed by placing sand within a closed ring of sheet piles driven into the bed of the river the pier on the sloping mud bank also used this method with rectangular caissons it is noted that those living in brisbane tend to regard this as normal for a bridge of this type ; however this is in fact most unusual and few bridges around the world , including the sydney harbour bridge , have this feature the william jolly bridge was constructed between 1928 and 1932 following the formation of greater brisbane in 1925 , and was one of the first major capital works of the new city council being part of a bold policy of civic improvements under the provisions of the greater brisbane act aboriginal and later european pathways and land use patterns formed the basis for subsequent traffic networks which are reflected in the location of the bridge and associated traffic systems it was brisbane 's second traffic bridge and provided an important transport and communications link between both sides of the river , as well as further impetus for the development of the south brisbane peninsula the william jolly bridge demonstrates a high degree of technical achievement in its design , its use of gunite ( sprayed dry mix concrete ) , and in the development of the sand island method used for the construction of its river piers

the william jolly bridge was constructed between 1928 and 1932 following the formation of greater brisbane in 1925 , and was one of the first major capital works of the new brisbane city council and bears the name of its first mayor , william jolly at the time of construction , the only traffic bridge linking the brisbane cbd and south brisbane was the second victoria bridge , built in 1897 to replace an earlier bridge washed away in the flood of 1893 the william jolly bridge crosses the brisbane river at the tip of the south brisbane peninsula between grey street , south brisbane , and at north quay at the intersection of skew and saul streets on the northern bank a sandy beach marked the point of crossing for aboriginal tribes from the moreton region , then later for europeans who crossed the river near this point on the north quay ferry , and then from the 1930s via the william jolly bridge on the south bank , aboriginal and later european pathways and land use patterns formed the basis for subsequent traffic networks prior to european settlement , the whole of the south brisbane peninsula was known as kurilpa , meaning the place of rats , due to the large number of bush rats to be found in the lush vegetation of the area the first european use of the south bank occurred soon after the establishment of the moreton bay penal settlement in 1825 when convicts cleared the flats across the river in order to grow grain to feed the settlement for over 30 years this was the only vehicular ferry crossing to north brisbane ( as the brisbane cbd was then known ) in this area , except for a brief period from june 1865-november 1867 when a temporary timber bridge , which was rapidly destroyed by marine borer , spanned the river land between the new burial ground and barracks was put up for auction in 1861 , and from 1863 the auctioning of suburban allotments ( now paddington ) encouraged the spread of the settlement along the ridges the north quay ferry , a row boat , crossed the river where the bridge now stands , and the river road ( now coronation drive ) was established as a track which serviced properties towards toowong the opening of the victoria bridge on 15 june 1874 provided an important transport and communications link between the north and south banks of the river , and provided further impetus to the development of the south bank the south brisbane dry dock was opened in 1881 , coal wharves at woolloongabba and associated rail links were established c.1885 , and south brisbane railway station was established as the passenger terminus for suburban and country lines built during the 1880s the spread of housing included the development of large residences located along the ridges with views of the river , and industry developed along the southern bank of the milton reach a series of 1893 brisbane flood resulted in the collapse of the albert rail bridge at indooroopilly in 1893 , which diverted all rail traffic to south brisbane , and the collapse of victoria bridge on 6 february 1893 which cut vital transport and communications links with the central city a report in the telegraph on 8 february 1893 described the event as : '' what a terrible hiatus in the course of business alone has been caused by the collapse of victoria bridge '' urban expansion on both sides of the river continued with the opening of the new victoria bridge in 1897 and the trams in brisbane the residential enclave was further reduced when the morrow-rankin ( later arnott 's biscuits ) biscuit factory was established upstream from the helidon spa works in 1913 health factors , noise and nuisance associated with industry and proximity to wharves and docks all contributed to the changing perception of the area bounded by grey and boundary streets , montague road and the river as a result , when the time came to resume land in connection with the construction of the grey street bridge , there was scant opposition the grey street bridge was conceived as a bypass for motor traffic between the southern suburbs and western suburbs of brisbane to avoid increasing traffic congestion on the victoria bridge and on cbd streets such as george street traffic across the victoria bridge had increased 76 % from 1912–1925 , and in 1923 it was noted that traffic tonnage had increased 49.5 % in 15 months the victoria bridge also contributed to traffic congestion in the brisbane cbd as all traffic between the suburbs on the north and south sides of the river had to pass through the cbd in 1922 , the need for additional traffic on victoria bridge was identified , and the mayor of brisbane noted the need for cross river traffic as pressing and urgent the victoria bridge structure was investigated in 1923 to determine its strength for further loading , and walter james doak , bridge engineer of the queensland railways , noted that the bridge is now loaded to rather more than its orthodox capacity under live load , but it was considered that there was no immediate danger of collapse his recommendations included various repairs , and that a second bridge should be built mayor william alfred jolly was chairman of the bridges and ferries committee , and recommended that three experts be employed a bridge at grey street would be a bypass for motor traffic between the southern suburbs and western suburbs of brisbane to avoid increasing traffic congestion on the victoria bridge and on cbd streets such as george street these reports proposed the grey street bridge be two level for road and rail traffic , and a second bridge from wellington road to sydney street , new farm , with a major ring road called the main parkway boulevard , be constructed on 7 june 1926 council decided to build a bridge from grey street , south brisbane problems were encountered with the design of the bridge due to the depth of rock below the river bed increasing from approximately on the southern bank the final decision of the type of bridge , from the five under consideration , was essentially aesthetic , and was influenced by the so-called rainbow arch bridge , carrying robert street , st paul , minnesota across the mississippi river harding frew acknowledged this in his report , including photographs of the bridge , and stated that : '' the time has come when some improvement in the appearance of our city bridges should be looked for in queensland '' the selected bridge design differed from the st paul bridge in that it has three major spans whereas the st paul bridge only has one , and this has been suggested as possibly making the william jolly bridge unique the council resumed large areas of land bounded by roma , saul and skew streets , and between skew street , eagle terrace and north quay on the northern side , and on the southern side , east of grey street between montague road and melbourne street the bridge was to have a north quay underpass , and the estimated total cost was £700,000 including viaducts , compulsory acquisitions , roadways , approaches and contingencies nevertheless , council called tenders and mr hornibrook ltd submitted the lowest of £384,850 and this was accepted on 8 may 1928 however , the concrete is also used in a decorative manner to represent oversized coursing on the main piers and voussoirs on the arched ribs a stair is also located within the north quay retaining wall on the northeastern side of the bridge connecting north quay and coronation drive the go between bridge , opened in 2010 , was intended to relieve some of the congestion on the william jolly bridge ; however it has not achieve the level of use anticipated and operates under capacity , possibly because the go between bridge is a toll bridge while the nearby william jolly bridge remains free to use the design of the bridge is unusual in its use of three major spans of arched ribs which rise through the deck , which give the bridge a distinctive appearance and a landmark quality the design of the william jolly bridge was intended to reflect the city 's importance and its civic pride

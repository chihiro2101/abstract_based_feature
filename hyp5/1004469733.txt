the william jolly bridge was constructed between 1928 and 1932 following the formation of greater brisbane in 1925 , and was one of the first major capital works of the new brisbane city council and bears the name of its first mayor , william jolly at the time of construction , the only traffic bridge linking the brisbane cbd and south brisbane was the second victoria bridge , built in 1897 to replace an earlier bridge washed away in the flood of 1893 the william jolly bridge crosses the brisbane river at the tip of the south brisbane peninsula between grey street , south brisbane , and at north quay at the intersection of skew and saul streets on the northern bank a sandy beach marked the point of crossing for aboriginal tribes from the moreton region , then later for europeans who crossed the river near this point on the north quay ferry , and then from the 1930s via the william jolly bridge on the south bank , aboriginal and later european pathways and land use patterns formed the basis for subsequent traffic networks prior to european settlement , the whole of the south brisbane peninsula was known as kurilpa , meaning the place of rats , due to the large number of bush rats to be found in the lush vegetation of the area ( the riverfront park adjacent to the bridge at south brisbane is now called kurilpa point the first european use of the south bank occurred soon after the establishment of the moreton bay penal settlement in 1825 when convicts cleared the flats across the river in order to grow grain to feed the settlement for over 30 years this was the only vehicular ferry crossing to north brisbane ( as the brisbane cbd was then known ) in this area , except for a brief period from june 1865-november 1867 when a temporary timber bridge , which was rapidly destroyed by marine borer , spanned the river first brisbane burial ground had been established on the northern bank where skew street is now located , ( later moved to hale street where it became known as paddington cemetery , site now partially occupied by suncorp stadium ) , and to the rear of the burial ground a new gaol was established by 1860 and military barracks in 1864 the north quay ferry , a row boat , crossed the river where the bridge now stands , and the river road ( now coronation drive ) was established as a track which serviced properties towards toowong the extension on the main line railway from ipswich to brisbane in 1875 isolated the strip of riverfront residences from the working-class houses in milton and paddington , and this contributed to the relative lack of development along the northern bank of the milton reach of the river in subsequent years the opening of the victoria bridge on 15 june 1874 provided an important transport and communications link between the north and south banks of the river , and provided further impetus to the development of the south bank the victoria bridge was funded by the brisbane municipal council and a toll was imposed to recover costs in the 1880s , the south bank experienced a development boom the development of the civic centre focused on the stanley and vulture street intersection , with the construction of the south brisbane town hall , fire station , post office and south brisbane railway station a series of 1893 brisbane flood resulted in the collapse of the albert rail bridge at indooroopilly in 1893 , which diverted all rail traffic to south brisbane , and the collapse of victoria bridge on 6 february 1893 which cut vital transport and communications links with the central city '' urban expansion on both sides of the river continued with the opening of the new victoria bridge in 1897 and the trams in brisbane on 3 october 1903 , the queensland government gazetted the proclamation which constituted the city of south brisbane from 1908 the city of south brisbane tried to bring all the wharves in the south brisbane reach under its control and encouraged further commercial and industrial development along the river front as a result , when the time came to resume land in connection with the construction of the grey street bridge , there was scant opposition the grey street bridge was conceived as a bypass for motor traffic between the southern suburbs and western suburbs of brisbane to avoid increasing traffic congestion on the victoria bridge and on cbd streets such as george street the victoria bridge also contributed to traffic congestion in the brisbane cbd as all traffic between the suburbs on the north and south sides of the river had to pass through the cbd the 1897 victoria bridge had a paved deck with bituminous surfacing on wrought iron troughing in 1922 , the need for additional traffic on victoria bridge was identified , and the mayor of brisbane noted the need for cross river traffic as pressing and urgent the first meeting of the greater brisbane council in march 1925 passed a motion concerning the employment of experts to investigate what cross river facilities were required and their best locations a motion was passed on 20 may 1925 to appoint a cross river commission , which reported on 11 january 1926 ( chairman roger hawken , professor of engineering at the university of queensland , william muir nelson and ronald martin wilson ) the report showed 11 proposed river crossings , and considered costs and savings made due to the reduction in haulage costs etc a bridge at grey street would be a bypass for motor traffic between the southern suburbs and western suburbs of brisbane to avoid increasing traffic congestion on the victoria bridge and on cbd streets such as george street these reports proposed the grey street bridge be two level for road and rail traffic , and a second bridge from wellington road to sydney street , new farm , with a major ring road called the main parkway boulevard , be constructed the council called applications for a bridge engineer to design a steel or reinforced concrete bridge on 10 july 1926 '' harding frew recommended bridge type a and the council adopted his recommendation , of which some of the details of approaches etc the final decision of the type of bridge , from the five under consideration , was essentially aesthetic , and was influenced by the so-called rainbow arch bridge , carrying robert street , st paul , minnesota across the mississippi river harding frew acknowledged this in his report , including photographs of the bridge , and stated that : '' the time has come when some improvement in the appearance of our city bridges should be looked for in queensland the questions of utility and aesthetics should also be weighed carefully , especially in relation to a city 's importance , its civic pride , and its future '' the selected bridge design differed from the st paul bridge in that it has three major spans whereas the st paul bridge only has one , and this has been suggested as possibly making the william jolly bridge unique an incident occurred on 17 february 1927 which highlighted the potentially disastrous situation of having only one bridge across the brisbane river the william jolly bridge crosses the brisbane river at the tip of the south brisbane peninsula between grey street , south brisbane , and north quay at the intersection of skew and saul streets on the northern bank william jolly bridge was listed on the queensland heritage register on 6 august 1996 having satisfied the following criteria it was brisbane 's second traffic bridge and provided an important transport and communications link between both sides of the river , as well as further impetus for the development of the south brisbane peninsula the design of the bridge is unusual in its use of three major spans of arched ribs which rise through the deck , which give the bridge a distinctive appearance and a landmark quality

with the line-up of muir , louiche mayorga , george , and herrera , the band released their second album , join the army , in 1987 the album was met with a mixed reaction from long-time fans due to its considerably more metal-oriented sound ( an element brought to the table by rocky george ) , as they were expecting another punk album the stylistic changes and signing to a major label outraged a few long-time fans , but suicidal tendencies began to pick up more fans from the heavy metal community as well the band 's first release with epic was how will i laugh tomorrow when i ca n't even smile today , released in 1988 however , the album was considerably more melodic than most thrash metal albums , perhaps a lasting influence of the band 's punk past singles and music videos were released for '' trip at the brain '' and the title track , which were successful and helped expand the bands audience in early 1989 , bassist bob heathcote ( who at the time was a father of one child ) left the band to support his family and was replaced by robert trujillo , who joined suicidal tendencies right before their summer european tour with anthrax later that year , suicidal tendencies released their fourth album ( also referred to as a compilation of two eps ) , controlled by hatred/feel like shit.déjà vu featured two versions of '' how will i laugh tomorrow '' : the video version ( the original song cut down for radio/video airplay ) and the '' heavy emotion '' version ( a semi-unplugged , more mellow version of the song ) the rest of the songs on the album came from previously released eps , except '' just another love song '' and '' feel like shit.deja vu '' , with the remaining songs being no mercy and los cycos covers the album featured the hit '' waking the dead '' , which at seven minutes was one of the most progressive tracks the band had released to date in 1990 suicidal tendencies released the album that many fans consider to be their masterpiece , and the album that almost broke them into the rock mainstream , lights.camera.revolution ! the songs were much more complex than on any other suicidal album , some songs bordering on progressive metal , but also showed a new influence courtesy of trujillo , funk muir eventually became interested in the funk music that trujillo had brought to the table of suicidal tendencies 's influences this helped expand suicidal tendencies ' fan base into a wider audience that included members of the alternative rock community ( funk-metal was a popular alternative-metal style at the time ) the album was very different from anything suicidal tendencies had done before , but it was actually their most melodic , accessible album to date by the end of the year suicidal tendencies had found a permanent replacement for herrera , former white lion and y & t drummer jimmy degrasso now at their commercial peak , suicidal tendencies released still cyco after all these years in 1993 the album was a re-recording of suicidal tendencies 's self-titled debut album with three additional songs ( two re-recordings of join the army tracks , and the b-side to the 1990 single '' send me your money '' ) the album was intended by the band to be the least accessible album they had released , starting out by having four consecutive songs with the word '' fuck '' in the title , and switching to a more aggressive style than on their previous studio album suicidal for life was widely considered to be a disappointing album by critics , many of which claimed muir had '' dumbed down '' his lyrical approach from previous albums the album did not sell nearly as well as the past four suicidal tendencies records ( although it did sell decently on the band 's reputation alone ) and the only major single , '' love vs loneliness '' , featured a gloomy music video that hurt the song 's airplay rocky george formed the group samsara and played in 40 cycle hum and cro-mags after suicidal tendencies 's breakup , eventually joining fishbone wackerman ( who had just joined bad religion ) had left suicidal tendencies by 2001 while the band was on tour during this tour year of the cycos – a compilation album featuring suicidal tendencies , infectious grooves , cyco miko and no mercy – was available for the first time for purchase at the concerts or from their official website suicidal tendencies released 13 , their first album with new material in 13 years , on march 26 , 2013 '' in an april 2015 interview with metalhead blog , guitarist dean pleasants revealed that suicidal tendencies had been working on new material for a possible compilation album mike muir revealed in june 2016 interviews that the album would be called the world gone mad , and that the band planned to release a new ep in january 2017 '' the ep , get your fight on !

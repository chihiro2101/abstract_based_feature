the geology of the swabian jura is mostly limestone , which formed the seabed during the jurassic period three layers of different limestones are stacked over each other to form the range : black jurassic , brown jurassic , and white jurassic thus there are hardly any rivers , lakes or other forms of surface water on the plateau in the west , the zollerngraben ( a geological depression in a tectonically active region ) sometimes causes mild earthquakes tertiary relicts can be found at the southern part of swabian jura constant rain and other weather influences are slowly dissolving the entire range the achalm or the hohenstaufen ) which testify to the former territory of the range the omnipresent caves are great tourist spots , beautiful and not very crowded also because of the porous limestone , the danube nearly disappears near immendingen ( in 1911 , 1921 , 1928 and 1943 it disappeared completely ) , only to reappear several kilometers further down most of the water lost by the danube resurfaces in the aachtopf , a spring for a tributary to the rhine much of the swabian jura consists of gentle to moderate hills often covered with forest or cleared for small-scale agriculture lemberg , highest point of the swabian jura ) oberhohenberg hochberg wandbühl rainen montschenloch plettenberg bol hochwald hummelsberg kehlen schafberg fossils can be found everywhere in the swabian jura many large and important fossils were found here the urwelt-museum hauff houses the world 's largest petrified crinoid ( sea-lily ) colony with a size of and an age of about 180 million years here too , the roman ruins are being excavated and a museum has been open to the public since the late 1980s life was extremely hard in the swabian jura a modern water supply system ( outstanding for its time ) was built in the late 1880s , which eased the situation the dialect at the top of the plateau is markedly different from , and stronger than , even the broadest swabian of the lowland areas the pleißne was spoken by hawkers selling items such as baskets , brushes , and whips , and belongs to rotwelsch it is also often the case that , while in one town a strong tradition of celebrating fasnet has survived , the neighboring town will have almost no tradition the swabian jura and the neighbouring region have developed from one of the poorest regions of germany to one of its richest within the past 150 & nbsp ; years the name ( related to jurassic ) derives from the jura mountains , of which the swabian and franconian plateaux are geographically part it is perhaps for this reason that schwäbische alb has sometimes been translated into english as 'swabian alps ' , thus avoiding the lesser-known name jura

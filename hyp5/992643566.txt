the geology of the swabian jura is mostly limestone , which formed the seabed during the jurassic period the sea receded 50 & nbsp ; million years ago three layers of different limestones are stacked over each other to form the range : black jurassic , brown jurassic , and white jurassic since limestone is soluble in water , rain seeps through cracks everywhere and forms subterranean rivers which flow through a large system of caves until they emerge thus there are hardly any rivers , lakes or other forms of surface water on the plateau in the west , the zollerngraben ( a geological depression in a tectonically active region ) sometimes causes mild earthquakes the nördlinger ries is a large meteorite crater ( 15 & nbsp ; million years old ) tertiary relicts can be found at the southern part of swabian jura many different types can be found , from dry dripstone caves to caves that can only be entered by boat sometimes the discharge of the water from subterranean rivers can be spectacular , too , e.g much of the swabian jura consists of gentle to moderate hills often covered with forest or cleared for small-scale agriculture they are all in the southwestern part of the jura , in the region of the großer heuberg fossils can be found everywhere in the swabian jura the urwelt-museum hauff houses the world 's largest petrified crinoid ( sea-lily ) colony with a size of and an age of about 180 million years this region , located south of the limes , was part of the roman empire from around the first to third century a.d life was extremely hard in the swabian jura the lack of water and the poor quality of the soil made it a backward region for many villages fetching water required a long journey by horse since water often needed to be stored over a long time , it was often stagnant thus disinfection via alcohol was very popular : '' most '' ( cider ) was mixed with water and even given to babies in the 1950s , reutlingen was the german town with the highest number of millionaires , until the decline of the german textile industry hit them as well on the münsingen training ground which existed for over 100 & nbsp ; years , a biosphere reserve is in the making the name ( related to jurassic ) derives from the jura mountains , of which the swabian and franconian plateaux are geographically part it is perhaps for this reason that schwäbische alb has sometimes been translated into english as 'swabian alps ' , thus avoiding the lesser-known name jura

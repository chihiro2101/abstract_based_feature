the geology of the swabian jura is mostly limestone , which formed the seabed during the jurassic period the sea receded 50 & nbsp ; million years ago three layers of different limestones are stacked over each other to form the range : black jurassic , brown jurassic , and white jurassic thus there are hardly any rivers , lakes or other forms of surface water on the plateau in the west , the zollerngraben ( a geological depression in a tectonically active region ) sometimes causes mild earthquakes tertiary relicts can be found at the southern part of swabian jura famous locations are known in the ulm area ( e.g some millions of years ago , the mountains reached as far as stuttgart the omnipresent caves are great tourist spots , beautiful and not very crowded many different types can be found , from dry dripstone caves to caves that can only be entered by boat sometimes the discharge of the water from subterranean rivers can be spectacular , too , e.g many small limestone pebbles are found on the surface much of the swabian jura consists of gentle to moderate hills often covered with forest or cleared for small-scale agriculture they are all in the southwestern part of the jura , in the region of the großer heuberg fossils can be found everywhere in the swabian jura this region , located south of the limes , was part of the roman empire from around the first to third century a.d a roman road ran along the neckar river and over the plateau life was extremely hard in the swabian jura the lack of water and the poor quality of the soil made it a backward region the '' swabian–alemannic '' carnival is an important tradition in many of the villages , called variously '' fastnacht '' , '' fasnacht '' , '' fasnet '' , or '' fasching '' in the 1950s , reutlingen was the german town with the highest number of millionaires , until the decline of the german textile industry hit them as well the swabian jura are not densely populated by german standards brenntar , was a swabian staple foodstuff , particularly prominent in the swabian jura and in the allgäu it is perhaps for this reason that schwäbische alb has sometimes been translated into english as 'swabian alps ' , thus avoiding the lesser-known name jura

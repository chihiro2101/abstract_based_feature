the geology of the swabian jura is mostly limestone , which formed the seabed during the jurassic period thus there are hardly any rivers , lakes or other forms of surface water on the plateau in some places , former volcanic activity has left traces , such as maars and hills in the west , the zollerngraben ( a geological depression in a tectonically active region ) sometimes causes mild earthquakes the nördlinger ries is a large meteorite crater ( 15 & nbsp ; million years old ) tertiary relicts can be found at the southern part of swabian jura famous locations are known in the ulm area ( e.g constant rain and other weather influences are slowly dissolving the entire range the achalm or the hohenstaufen ) which testify to the former territory of the range most of the water lost by the danube resurfaces in the aachtopf , a spring for a tributary to the rhine much of the swabian jura consists of gentle to moderate hills often covered with forest or cleared for small-scale agriculture today this has become a comparatively rare sight they are all in the southwestern part of the jura , in the region of the großer heuberg there are many other peaks in the alb , such as the hornau , ochsenberg , and achalm fossils can be found everywhere in the swabian jura many large and important fossils were found here a roman road ran along the neckar river and over the plateau life was extremely hard in the swabian jura since water often needed to be stored over a long time , it was often stagnant zu pleißne burladingen siehe werner metzger : festrede 125 jahre schwäbischer albverein the '' neckar-alb '' region is the third largest industrial zone in germany , and the most stable skiing is sometimes possible ( though the hills are not steep or high ) brenntar , was a swabian staple foodstuff , particularly prominent in the swabian jura and in the allgäu it is perhaps for this reason that schwäbische alb has sometimes been translated into english as 'swabian alps ' , thus avoiding the lesser-known name jura

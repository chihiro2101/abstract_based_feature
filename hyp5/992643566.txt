the geology of the swabian jura is mostly limestone , which formed the seabed during the jurassic period the sea receded 50 & nbsp ; million years ago three layers of different limestones are stacked over each other to form the range : black jurassic , brown jurassic , and white jurassic since limestone is soluble in water , rain seeps through cracks everywhere and forms subterranean rivers which flow through a large system of caves until they emerge thus there are hardly any rivers , lakes or other forms of surface water on the plateau in the west , the zollerngraben ( a geological depression in a tectonically active region ) sometimes causes mild earthquakes the nördlinger ries is a large meteorite crater ( 15 & nbsp ; million years old ) tertiary relicts can be found at the southern part of swabian jura famous locations are known in the ulm area ( e.g some millions of years ago , the mountains reached as far as stuttgart in some places , the limestone was more resistant to decay and thus the recession of the main range has left small mountains ( called '' zeugenberge '' — '' witness mountains '' or outliers ; e.g much of the swabian jura consists of gentle to moderate hills often covered with forest or cleared for small-scale agriculture lemberg , highest point of the swabian jura ) oberhohenberg hochberg wandbühl rainen montschenloch plettenberg bol hochwald hummelsberg kehlen schafberg fossils can be found everywhere in the swabian jura this region , located south of the limes , was part of the roman empire from around the first to third century a.d the lack of water and the poor quality of the soil made it a backward region locals in the areas speak the distinct german dialect known as swabian german , which varies even throughout the jura and is difficult to understand for speakers of standard german the dialect at the top of the plateau is markedly different from , and stronger than , even the broadest swabian of the lowland areas the '' swabian–alemannic '' carnival is an important tradition in many of the villages , called variously '' fastnacht '' , '' fasnacht '' , '' fasnet '' , or '' fasching '' still , many high quality textile companies can be found , such as hugo boss , merz b the swabian jura are not densely populated by german standards the region has several larger and many small nature reserves the name ( related to jurassic ) derives from the jura mountains , of which the swabian and franconian plateaux are geographically part it is perhaps for this reason that schwäbische alb has sometimes been translated into english as 'swabian alps ' , thus avoiding the lesser-known name jura

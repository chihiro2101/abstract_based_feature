a stamen typically consists of a stalk called the filament and an anther which contains sporangium most commonly anthers are two-lobed and are attached to the filament either at the base or in the middle area of the anther the sterile tissue between the lobes is called the connective , an extension of the filament containing conducting strands a pollen grain develops from a microspore in the microsporangium and contains the male gametophyte the stamens in a flower are collectively called the androecium the androecium can consist of as few as one-half stamen ( i.e a single locule ) as in canna species or as many as 3,482 stamens which have been counted in the saguaro ( carnegiea gigantea ) the androecium in various species of plants forms a great variety of patterns , some of them highly complex university of toronto press a comprehensive etymological dictionary of the english language from classical latin anthera , meaning '' medicine extracted from the flower '' siebenhaar , f.j depending on the species of plant , some or all of the stamens in a flower may be attached to the petals or to the floral axis the filaments may be fused and the anthers free , or the filaments free and the anthers fused the spores may remain attached to each other in a tetrad or separate after meiosis in the typical flower ( that is , in the majority of flowering plant species ) each flower has both carpels and stamens a flower with only stamens is called androecious a flower having only functional stamens and lacking functional carpels is called a staminate flower , or ( inaccurately ) male where the connective separates the anther lobes , it is called divaricate , e.g

a stamen typically consists of a stalk called the filament and an anther which contains sporangium most commonly anthers are two-lobed and are attached to the filament either at the base or in the middle area of the anther the sterile tissue between the lobes is called the connective , an extension of the filament containing conducting strands a pollen grain develops from a microspore in the microsporangium and contains the male gametophyte the stamens in a flower are collectively called the androecium the androecium can consist of as few as one-half stamen ( i.e a single locule ) as in canna species or as many as 3,482 stamens which have been counted in the saguaro ( carnegiea gigantea ) bessey in science vol the androecium in various species of plants forms a great variety of patterns , some of them highly complex it generally surrounds the gynoecium and is surrounded by the perianth from classical latin anthera , meaning '' medicine extracted from the flower '' siebenhaar , f.j they also may be free-standing or fused to one another in many different ways , including fusion of some but not all stamens the microsporangia form sacs or pockets ( locules ) in the anther ( anther sacs or pollen sacs ) in some species , however , the flowers are unisexual with only carpels or stamens a flower having only functional stamens and lacking functional carpels is called a staminate flower , or ( inaccurately ) male where the connective separates the anther lobes , it is called divaricate , e.g ; filament a column formed from the fusion of multiple filaments is known as an androphore stamens can be connate ( fused or joined in the same whorl ) as follows : extrorse : anther dehiscence directed away from the centre of the flower

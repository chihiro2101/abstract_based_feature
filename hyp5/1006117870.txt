most commonly anthers are two-lobed and are attached to the filament either at the base or in the middle area of the anther the sterile tissue between the lobes is called the connective , an extension of the filament containing conducting strands a pollen grain develops from a microspore in the microsporangium and contains the male gametophyte the stamens in a flower are collectively called the androecium the androecium can consist of as few as one-half stamen ( i.e a single locule ) as in canna species or as many as 3,482 stamens which have been counted in the saguaro ( carnegiea gigantea ) university of toronto press a dynamic multidimensional approach to floral morphology it generally surrounds the gynoecium and is surrounded by the perianth a few members of the family triuridaceae , particularly lacandonia schismatica , are exceptional in that their gynoecia surround their androecia stamen is the latin word meaning '' thread '' ( originally thread of the warp , in weaving ) filament derives from classical latin filum , meaning '' thread '' lewis , c.t depending on the species of plant , some or all of the stamens in a flower may be attached to the petals or to the floral axis the microsporangia form sacs or pockets ( locules ) in the anther ( anther sacs or pollen sacs ) the two separate locules on each side of an anther may fuse into a single locule a flower having only functional stamens and lacking functional carpels is called a staminate flower , or ( inaccurately ) male the connective may also be a long and stalk-like , crosswise on the filament , this is a distractile connective , e.g stamens can be connate ( fused or joined in the same whorl ) as follows : extrorse : anther dehiscence directed away from the centre of the flower

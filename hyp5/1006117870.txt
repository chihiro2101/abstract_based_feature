a stamen typically consists of a stalk called the filament and an anther which contains sporangium most commonly anthers are two-lobed and are attached to the filament either at the base or in the middle area of the anther the sterile tissue between the lobes is called the connective , an extension of the filament containing conducting strands it can be seen as an extension on the dorsal side of the anther the stamens in a flower are collectively called the androecium the androecium can consist of as few as one-half stamen ( i.e the androecium in various species of plants forms a great variety of patterns , some of them highly complex ( eds ) aspects of floral development it generally surrounds the gynoecium and is surrounded by the perianth filament derives from classical latin filum , meaning '' thread '' lewis , c.t anther derives from french anthère , klein , e wien : druck und verlag von carl gerold 's sohn , buchhändler der kaiserl depending on the species of plant , some or all of the stamens in a flower may be attached to the petals or to the floral axis these undergo meiosis to form haploid spores in some species , however , the flowers are unisexual with only carpels or stamens ( monoecious both types of flowers found on the same plant ; dioecious the two types of flower found only on different plants ) a flower with only stamens is called androecious stamens can be connate ( fused or joined in the same whorl ) as follows : extrorse : anther dehiscence directed away from the centre of the flower

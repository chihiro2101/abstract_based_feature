a stamen typically consists of a stalk called the filament and an anther which contains sporangium most commonly anthers are two-lobed and are attached to the filament either at the base or in the middle area of the anther a pollen grain develops from a microspore in the microsporangium and contains the male gametophyte the stamens in a flower are collectively called the androecium a single locule ) as in canna species or as many as 3,482 stamens which have been counted in the saguaro ( carnegiea gigantea ) the androecium in various species of plants forms a great variety of patterns , some of them highly complex ( eds ) aspects of floral development stamen is the latin word meaning '' thread '' ( originally thread of the warp , in weaving ) filament derives from classical latin filum , meaning '' thread '' lewis , c.t wien : druck und verlag von carl gerold 's sohn , buchhändler der kaiserl in turn from ancient greek ἀνθηρά , feminine of ἀνθηρός meaning '' flowery '' , liddell , h.g depending on the species of plant , some or all of the stamens in a flower may be attached to the petals or to the floral axis they also may be free-standing or fused to one another in many different ways , including fusion of some but not all stamens the filaments may be fused and the anthers free , or the filaments free and the anthers fused the two separate locules on each side of an anther may fuse into a single locule in the typical flower ( that is , in the majority of flowering plant species ) each flower has both carpels and stamens a flower having only functional stamens and lacking functional carpels is called a staminate flower , or ( inaccurately ) male stamens can be connate ( fused or joined in the same whorl ) as follows : extrorse : anther dehiscence directed away from the centre of the flower

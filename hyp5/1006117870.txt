a stamen typically consists of a stalk called the filament and an anther which contains sporangium most commonly anthers are two-lobed and are attached to the filament either at the base or in the middle area of the anther the sterile tissue between the lobes is called the connective , an extension of the filament containing conducting strands the stamens in a flower are collectively called the androecium the androecium can consist of as few as one-half stamen ( i.e a single locule ) as in canna species or as many as 3,482 stamens which have been counted in the saguaro ( carnegiea gigantea ) the androecium in various species of plants forms a great variety of patterns , some of them highly complex stamen is the latin word meaning '' thread '' ( originally thread of the warp , in weaving ) filament derives from classical latin filum , meaning '' thread '' lewis , c.t from classical latin anthera , meaning '' medicine extracted from the flower '' siebenhaar , f.j wien : druck und verlag von carl gerold 's sohn , buchhändler der kaiserl they also may be free-standing or fused to one another in many different ways , including fusion of some but not all stamens in some plants , notably members of orchidaceae and asclepiadoideae , the pollen remains in masses called pollinia , which are adapted to attach to particular pollinating agents such as birds or insects it may grow a pollen tube and undergoing mitosis to produce two sperm nuclei encyclopædia britannica.com a plant with only functional carpels is called pistillate , or ( inaccurately ) female the top part of the column is formed by the anther , which is covered by an anther cap the connective may also be a long and stalk-like , crosswise on the filament , this is a distractile connective , e.g stamens can be connate ( fused or joined in the same whorl ) as follows : extrorse : anther dehiscence directed away from the centre of the flower

glycogen is a branched biopolymer consisting of linear chains of glucose residues with an average chain length of approximately 8–12 glucose units and 2,000-60,000 & nbsp ; residues per one molecule of glycogen glucose units are linked together linearly by α ( 1→4 ) glycosidic bonds from one glucose to the next due to the way glycogen is synthesised , every glycogen granule has at its core a glycogenin protein glycogen is in muscle , liver , and fat cells is stored in a hydrated form , composed of three or four parts of water per part of glycogen associated with 0.45 & nbsp ; millimoles ( 18 & nbsp ; mg ) of potassium per gram of glycogen glycogen phosphorylase is the primary enzyme of glycogen breakdown for the next 8–12 hours , glucose derived from liver glycogen is the primary source of blood glucose used by the rest of the body for fuel muscle cell glycogen appears to function as an immediate reserve source of available glucose for muscle cells as muscle cells lack glucose-6-phosphatase , which is required to pass glucose into the blood , the glycogen they store is available solely for internal use and is not shared with other cells this is in contrast to liver cells , which , on demand , readily do break down their stored glycogen into glucose and send it through the blood stream as fuel for other organs after about eight glucose molecules have been added to a tyrosine residue , the enzyme glycogen synthase progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using udp-glucose , adding α ( 1→4 ) -bonded glucose to the reducing end of the glycogen chain glycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase to produce monomers of glucose-1 & nbsp ; phosphate : in vivo , phosphorolysis proceeds in the direction of glycogen breakdown because the ratio of phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate is usually greater than 100 glycogen depletion can be forestalled in three possible ways : first , during exercise , carbohydrates with the highest possible rate of conversion to blood glucose ( high glycemic index ) are ingested continuously third , by consuming large quantities of carbohydrates after depleting glycogen stores as a result of exercise or diet , the body can increase storage capacity of intramuscular glycogen stores

glycogen is a branched biopolymer consisting of linear chains of glucose residues with an average chain length of approximately 8–12 glucose units and 2,000-60,000 & nbsp ; residues per one molecule of glycogen glucose units are linked together linearly by α ( 1→4 ) glycosidic bonds from one glucose to the next branches are linked to the chains from which they are branching off by α ( 1→6 ) glycosidic bonds between the first glucose of the new branch and a glucose on the stem chain glycogen is in muscle , liver , and fat cells is stored in a hydrated form , composed of three or four parts of water per part of glycogen associated with 0.45 & nbsp ; millimoles ( 18 & nbsp ; mg ) of potassium per gram of glycogen glucose molecules are added to the chains of glycogen as long as both insulin and glucose remain plentiful after a meal has been digested and glucose levels begin to fall , insulin secretion is reduced , and glycogen synthesis stops for the next 8–12 hours , glucose derived from liver glycogen is the primary source of blood glucose used by the rest of the body for fuel in response to insulin levels being below normal ( when blood levels of glucose begin to fall below the normal range ) , glucagon is secreted in increasing amounts and stimulates both glycogenolysis ( the breakdown of glycogen ) and gluconeogenesis ( the production of glucose from other sources ) after about eight glucose molecules have been added to a tyrosine residue , the enzyme glycogen synthase progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using udp-glucose , adding α ( 1→4 ) -bonded glucose to the reducing end of the glycogen chain the branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 & nbsp ; residues , and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains in hypoglycemia caused by excessive insulin , liver glycogen levels are high , but the high insulin levels prevent the glycogenolysis necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels long-distance athletes , such as marathon runners , cross-country skiing , and cyclists , often experience glycogen depletion , where almost all of the athlete 's glycogen stores are depleted after long periods of exertion without sufficient carbohydrate consumption glycogen depletion can be forestalled in three possible ways : first , during exercise , carbohydrates with the highest possible rate of conversion to blood glucose ( high glycemic index ) are ingested continuously

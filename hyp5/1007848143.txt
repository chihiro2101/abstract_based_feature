glycogen is a branched biopolymer consisting of linear chains of glucose residues with an average chain length of approximately 8–12 glucose units and 2,000-60,000 & nbsp ; residues per one molecule of glycogen glucose units are linked together linearly by α ( 1→4 ) glycosidic bonds from one glucose to the next glycogen is in muscle , liver , and fat cells is stored in a hydrated form , composed of three or four parts of water per part of glycogen associated with 0.45 & nbsp ; millimoles ( 18 & nbsp ; mg ) of potassium per gram of glycogen glucose is an osmotic molecule , and can have profound effects on osmotic pressure in high concentrations possibly leading to cell damage or death if stored in the cell without being modified glucose molecules are added to the chains of glycogen as long as both insulin and glucose remain plentiful after a meal has been digested and glucose levels begin to fall , insulin secretion is reduced , and glycogen synthesis stops for the next 8–12 hours , glucose derived from liver glycogen is the primary source of blood glucose used by the rest of the body for fuel muscle cell glycogen appears to function as an immediate reserve source of available glucose for muscle cells as muscle cells lack glucose-6-phosphatase , which is required to pass glucose into the blood , the glycogen they store is available solely for internal use and is not shared with other cells this is in contrast to liver cells , which , on demand , readily do break down their stored glycogen into glucose and send it through the blood stream as fuel for other organs after about eight glucose molecules have been added to a tyrosine residue , the enzyme glycogen synthase progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using udp-glucose , adding α ( 1→4 ) -bonded glucose to the reducing end of the glycogen chain the glycogen branching enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the c-6 & nbsp ; hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule third , by consuming large quantities of carbohydrates after depleting glycogen stores as a result of exercise or diet , the body can increase storage capacity of intramuscular glycogen stores

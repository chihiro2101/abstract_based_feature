due to the way glycogen is synthesised , every glycogen granule has at its core a glycogenin protein glycogen is in muscle , liver , and fat cells is stored in a hydrated form , composed of three or four parts of water per part of glycogen associated with 0.45 & nbsp ; millimoles ( 18 & nbsp ; mg ) of potassium per gram of glycogen glucose is an osmotic molecule , and can have profound effects on osmotic pressure in high concentrations possibly leading to cell damage or death if stored in the cell without being modified glucose molecules are added to the chains of glycogen as long as both insulin and glucose remain plentiful in this postprandial or '' fed '' state , the liver takes in more glucose from the blood than it releases for the next 8â€“12 hours , glucose derived from liver glycogen is the primary source of blood glucose used by the rest of the body for fuel in response to insulin levels being below normal ( when blood levels of glucose begin to fall below the normal range ) , glucagon is secreted in increasing amounts and stimulates both glycogenolysis ( the breakdown of glycogen ) and gluconeogenesis ( the production of glucose from other sources ) muscle cell glycogen appears to function as an immediate reserve source of available glucose for muscle cells as muscle cells lack glucose-6-phosphatase , which is required to pass glucose into the blood , the glycogen they store is available solely for internal use and is not shared with other cells this is in contrast to liver cells , which , on demand , readily do break down their stored glycogen into glucose and send it through the blood stream as fuel for other organs & nbsp ; sanson found that muscular tissue also contains glycogen third , by consuming large quantities of carbohydrates after depleting glycogen stores as a result of exercise or diet , the body can increase storage capacity of intramuscular glycogen stores

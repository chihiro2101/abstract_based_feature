regulatory limits in many countries allow for this efficient use of radio bandwidth , and enable high-data-rate personal area network ( pan ) wireless connectivity , longer-range low-data-rate applications , and radar and imaging systems , transparently with existing communications systems ultra-wideband was formerly known as pulse radio , but the fcc and the international telecommunication union radiocommunication sector ( itu-r ) currently define uwb as an antenna transmission for which emitted signal bandwidth exceeds the lesser of 500 & nbsp ; mhz or 20 % of the arithmetic center frequency characteristics of ultra-wideband technology thus , pulse-based systems—where each transmitted pulse occupies the uwb bandwidth ( or an aggregate of at least 500 & nbsp ; mhz of narrow-band carrier ; for example , orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing ( ofdm ) ) —can access the uwb spectrum under the rules a significant difference between conventional radio transmissions and uwb is that conventional systems transmit information by varying the power level , frequency , and/or phase of a sinusoidal wave uwb transmissions transmit information by generating radio energy at specific time intervals and occupying a large bandwidth , thus enabling pulse-position or time modulation the information can also be modulated on uwb signals ( pulses ) by encoding the polarity of the pulse , its amplitude and/or by using orthogonal pulses uwb pulses can be sent sporadically at relatively low pulse rates to support time or position modulation , but can also be sent at rates up to the inverse of the uwb pulse bandwidth pulse-uwb systems have been demonstrated at channel pulse rates in excess of 1.3 gigapulses per second using a continuous stream of uwb pulses ( continuous pulse uwb or c-uwb ) , supporting forward error correction encoded data rates in excess of 675 mbit/s the samsung galaxy note 20 ultra and galaxy s21 ultra and s21+ also support uwb , along with the samsung galaxy smarttag+ while a 2013 report highlighted the issue with the use of uwb waveforms due to target range migration during the integration interval , more recent studies have suggested that uwb waveforms can demonstrate better performance compared to conventional doppler processing as long as a correct matched filter is used ultra-wideband is also used in '' see-through-the-wall '' precision radar-imaging technology , thales group 's through-the-wall imaging system michal aftanas through-wall imaging with uwb radar system dissertation thesis , 2009 precision locating and tracking ( using distance measurements between radios ) , and precision time-of-arrival-based localization approaches however , the emission limit for uwb emitters may be significantly lower ( as low as −75 & nbsp ; dbm/mhz ) in other segments of the spectrum narrowband signals that exist in the uwb range such as the ieee802.11a transmitters may exhibit a high power spectral density ( psd ) levels compared to the psd of uwb signals as seen by a uwb receiver

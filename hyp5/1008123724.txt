this allows for the transmission of a large amount of signal energy without interfering with conventional narrowband and carrier wave transmission in the same frequency band regulatory limits in many countries allow for this efficient use of radio bandwidth , and enable high-data-rate personal area network ( pan ) wireless connectivity , longer-range low-data-rate applications , and radar and imaging systems , transparently with existing communications systems ultra-wideband was formerly known as pulse radio , but the fcc and the international telecommunication union radiocommunication sector ( itu-r ) currently define uwb as an antenna transmission for which emitted signal bandwidth exceeds the lesser of 500 & nbsp ; mhz or 20 % of the arithmetic center frequency characteristics of ultra-wideband technology thus , pulse-based systems—where each transmitted pulse occupies the uwb bandwidth ( or an aggregate of at least 500 & nbsp ; mhz of narrow-band carrier ; for example , orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing ( ofdm ) ) —can access the uwb spectrum under the rules a significant difference between conventional radio transmissions and uwb is that conventional systems transmit information by varying the power level , frequency , and/or phase of a sinusoidal wave uwb transmissions transmit information by generating radio energy at specific time intervals and occupying a large bandwidth , thus enabling pulse-position or time modulation the information can also be modulated on uwb signals ( pulses ) by encoding the polarity of the pulse , its amplitude and/or by using orthogonal pulses uwb pulses can be sent sporadically at relatively low pulse rates to support time or position modulation , but can also be sent at rates up to the inverse of the uwb pulse bandwidth uwb is also used for peer-to-peer fine ranging , which allows many applications based on relative distance between two entities while a 2013 report highlighted the issue with the use of uwb waveforms due to target range migration during the integration interval , more recent studies have suggested that uwb waveforms can demonstrate better performance compared to conventional doppler processing as long as a correct matched filter is used slow progress in uwb standards development , the cost of initial implementation , and performance significantly lower than initially expected are several reasons for the limited use of uwb in consumer products ( which caused several uwb vendors to cease operations in 2008 and 2009 ) however , the emission limit for uwb emitters may be significantly lower ( as low as −75 & nbsp ; dbm/mhz ) in other segments of the spectrum narrowband signals that exist in the uwb range such as the ieee802.11a transmitters may exhibit a high power spectral density ( psd ) levels compared to the psd of uwb signals as seen by a uwb receiver

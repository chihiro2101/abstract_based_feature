this allows for the transmission of a large amount of signal energy without interfering with conventional narrowband and carrier wave transmission in the same frequency band regulatory limits in many countries allow for this efficient use of radio bandwidth , and enable high-data-rate personal area network ( pan ) wireless connectivity , longer-range low-data-rate applications , and radar and imaging systems , transparently with existing communications systems characteristics of ultra-wideband technology thus , pulse-based systems—where each transmitted pulse occupies the uwb bandwidth ( or an aggregate of at least 500 & nbsp ; mhz of narrow-band carrier ; for example , orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing ( ofdm ) ) —can access the uwb spectrum under the rules a significant difference between conventional radio transmissions and uwb is that conventional systems transmit information by varying the power level , frequency , and/or phase of a sinusoidal wave uwb transmissions transmit information by generating radio energy at specific time intervals and occupying a large bandwidth , thus enabling pulse-position or time modulation uwb pulses can be sent sporadically at relatively low pulse rates to support time or position modulation , but can also be sent at rates up to the inverse of the uwb pulse bandwidth uwb is also used for peer-to-peer fine ranging , which allows many applications based on relative distance between two entities the samsung galaxy note 20 ultra and galaxy s21 ultra and s21+ also support uwb , along with the samsung galaxy smarttag+ arl has also investigated the feasibility of whether uwb radar technology can incorporate doppler processing to estimate the velocity of a moving target when the platform is stationary uwb radar has been proposed as the active sensor component in an automatic target recognition application , designed to detect humans or objects that have fallen onto subway tracks this limit also applies to unintentional emitters in the uwb band ( the '' part 15 '' limit ) and in the meetings relating to uwb of the itu-r leading to its report and recommendations on uwb technology narrowband signals that exist in the uwb range such as the ieee802.11a transmitters may exhibit a high power spectral density ( psd ) levels compared to the psd of uwb signals as seen by a uwb receiver

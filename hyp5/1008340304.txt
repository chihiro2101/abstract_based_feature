lichens as a group have received less attention in classical treatises on botany than other groups although the relationship between humans and some species has been documented from early times several species have appeared in the works of dioscorides , pliny the elder and theophrastus although the studies are not very deep during the first centuries of the modern age they were usually put forward as examples of spontaneous generation and their reproductive mechanisms were totally ignored a popular history of british lichens p 22 for centuries naturalists had included lichens in diverse groups until in the early 18th century a french researcher joseph pitton de tournefort in his institutiones rei herbariae grouped them into their own genus a popular history of british lichens p after the revolution in taxonomy brought in by linnaeus and his new system of classification lichens are retained in the plant kingdom forming a single group lichen with eight divisions within the group according to the morphology of the thallus the taxonomy of lichens was first intensively investigated by the sweden botanist erik acharius ( 1757â€“1819 ) , who is therefore sometimes named the '' father of lichenology '' over the years research is shedding new light into the nature of these organisms still classified as plants it was anton de bary a german mycologist who specialised in phytopathology who first suggested in 1865 that lichens were merely the result of parasitism of various fungi of the ascomycetes group by nostoc type algae and others successive studies such as those carried out by andrei famintsyn and baranetzky in 1867 showed no dependence of the algal component upon the lichen thallus and that the algal component could live independently of the thallus this researcher was the first to recognise the dual nature of lichens as a result of the capture of the algal component by the fungal component in 1873 jean-baptiste edouard bornet concluded form studying many different lichen species that the relationship between fungi and algae was purely symbiotic these new ideas can be studied today under the title of the theory of endosymbiosis despite the above studies the dual nature of lichens remained no more than a theory until in 1939 the swiss researcher eugen a thomas species : eugen a during the 20th century botany and mycology were still attempting to solve the two main problems surrounding lichens on the one hand the definition of lichens and the relationship between the two symbionts and the taxonomic position of these organisms within the plant and fungal kingdoms in 1982 the international association for lichenology convened a meeting to adopt a single definition of lichen drawing on the proposals of a committee the definition finally adopted was that lichen could be considered as the association between a fungus and a photosynthetic symbiont resulting in a thallus of specific structure these studies revealed some in vitro antitumour activity by substances identified in two common lichens peltigera leucophlebia and collema flaccidum sloof ( 1993 ) the journal of the hattori botanical laboratory : devoted to bryology and lichenology , zennosuke iwatsuki ( 1983 ) contemporary lichenology and lichens of western oregon , w sipman ( 1995 ) swedish lichenology : dedicated to roland moberg , jan erik mattsson , mats wedin and inga hedberg ( sep 1999 ) index of collectors in knowles the lichens of ireland ( 1929 ) and porter 's supplement : with a conspectus of lichen , m

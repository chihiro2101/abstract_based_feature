lichens as a group have received less attention in classical treatises on botany than other groups although the relationship between humans and some species has been documented from early times several species have appeared in the works of dioscorides , pliny the elder and theophrastus although the studies are not very deep during the first centuries of the modern age they were usually put forward as examples of spontaneous generation and their reproductive mechanisms were totally ignored he adopted the latin term lichen , which had already been used by pliny who had imported it from theophrastus but up until then this term had not been widely employed 23 the original meaning of the greek word λειχήν ( leichen ) was moss that in its turn derives from the greek verb λείχω ( liekho ) to suck because of the great ability of these organisms to absorb water some forty years later dillenius in his historia muscorum made the first division of the group created by tournefort separating the sub-families usnea , coralloides and lichens in response to the morphological characteristics of the lichen thallus after the revolution in taxonomy brought in by linnaeus and his new system of classification lichens are retained in the plant kingdom forming a single group lichen with eight divisions within the group according to the morphology of the thallus the taxonomy of lichens was first intensively investigated by the sweden botanist erik acharius ( 1757–1819 ) , who is therefore sometimes named the '' father of lichenology '' over the years research is shedding new light into the nature of these organisms still classified as plants a controversial issue surrounding lichens since the early 19th century is their reproduction these studies and classifications are the cornerstone of subsequent investigations in the french publication annales des sciences naturelles in an article of 1852 '' memorie pour servir a l'histoire des lichens organographique et physiologique '' by edmond tulasne , the reproductive organs or apothecia of lichens was identified the apothecium reproductive organ being unique to fungi but absent in other photosynthetic organisms it was anton de bary a german mycologist who specialised in phytopathology who first suggested in 1865 that lichens were merely the result of parasitism of various fungi of the ascomycetes group by nostoc type algae and others on the one hand the definition of lichens and the relationship between the two symbionts and the taxonomic position of these organisms within the plant and fungal kingdoms the difficulty of giving a definition applicable to every known lichen has been debated since lichenologists first recognised the dual nature of lichens with these investigations the number of antibacterial substances and possible drug targets known to be produced by lichens increased ergosterol , usnic acid etc interest in the potential of substances synthesised by lichens increased with the end of world war ii along with the growing interest in all antibiotic substances in 1947 antibacterial action was identified in extracts of cetraria islandica and the compounds identified as responsible for bacterial inhibition were shown to be d-protolichosteric acid and d-1-usnic acid seaward ( dec 1977 ) '' lichenology : progress and problems '' ( special volumes/systematics association ) denis hunter brown et al sloof ( 1993 ) the journal of the hattori botanical laboratory : devoted to bryology and lichenology , zennosuke iwatsuki ( 1983 ) contemporary lichenology and lichens of western oregon , w sipman ( 1995 ) swedish lichenology : dedicated to roland moberg , jan erik mattsson , mats wedin and inga hedberg ( sep 1999 ) index of collectors in knowles the lichens of ireland ( 1929 ) and porter 's supplement : with a conspectus of lichen , m

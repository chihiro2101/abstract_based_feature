lichens as a group have received less attention in classical treatises on botany than other groups although the relationship between humans and some species has been documented from early times several species have appeared in the works of dioscorides , pliny the elder and theophrastus although the studies are not very deep a popular history of british lichens p a popular history of british lichens p some forty years later dillenius in his historia muscorum made the first division of the group created by tournefort separating the sub-families usnea , coralloides and lichens in response to the morphological characteristics of the lichen thallus after the revolution in taxonomy brought in by linnaeus and his new system of classification lichens are retained in the plant kingdom forming a single group lichen with eight divisions within the group according to the morphology of the thallus the taxonomy of lichens was first intensively investigated by the sweden botanist erik acharius ( 1757â€“1819 ) , who is therefore sometimes named the '' father of lichenology '' in these years a group of researchers faithful to the tenets of linnaeus considered that lichens reproduced sexually and had sexual reproductive organs , as in other plants , independent of whether asexual reproduction also occurred at first the presence of algae was taken as being due to contamination due to collection of samples in damp conditions and they were not considered as being in a symbiotic relation with the fungal part of the thallus in 1873 jean-baptiste edouard bornet concluded form studying many different lichen species that the relationship between fungi and algae was purely symbiotic despite the above studies the dual nature of lichens remained no more than a theory until in 1939 the swiss researcher eugen a thomas species : eugen a during the 20th century botany and mycology were still attempting to solve the two main problems surrounding lichens on the one hand the definition of lichens and the relationship between the two symbionts and the taxonomic position of these organisms within the plant and fungal kingdoms lichenology has found applications beyond biology itself in the field of geology in a technique known as lichenometry where the age of an exposed surface can be found by studying the age of lichens growing on them the technique provides an average age of the older individual lichens providing a minimum age of the medium being studied the difficulty of giving a definition applicable to every known lichen has been debated since lichenologists first recognised the dual nature of lichens the definition finally adopted was that lichen could be considered as the association between a fungus and a photosynthetic symbiont resulting in a thallus of specific structure from the 1940s there appeared various works by the noted microbiologist rufus paul burkholder who demonstrated antibacterial action of lichens of the genus usnea against bacillus subtilis and sarcina lutea antibacterial action of substances produced by lichens is related to their ability to disrupt bacterial proteins with a subsequent loss of bacterial metabolic capacity these studies revealed some in vitro antitumour activity by substances identified in two common lichens peltigera leucophlebia and collema flaccidum seaward ( dec 1977 ) '' lichenology : progress and problems '' ( special volumes/systematics association ) denis hunter brown et al sloof ( 1993 ) the journal of the hattori botanical laboratory : devoted to bryology and lichenology , zennosuke iwatsuki ( 1983 ) contemporary lichenology and lichens of western oregon , w

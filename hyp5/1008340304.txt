lichens as a group have received less attention in classical treatises on botany than other groups although the relationship between humans and some species has been documented from early times during the first centuries of the modern age they were usually put forward as examples of spontaneous generation and their reproductive mechanisms were totally ignored a popular history of british lichens p 22 for centuries naturalists had included lichens in diverse groups until in the early 18th century a french researcher joseph pitton de tournefort in his institutiones rei herbariae grouped them into their own genus a popular history of british lichens p some forty years later dillenius in his historia muscorum made the first division of the group created by tournefort separating the sub-families usnea , coralloides and lichens in response to the morphological characteristics of the lichen thallus after the revolution in taxonomy brought in by linnaeus and his new system of classification lichens are retained in the plant kingdom forming a single group lichen with eight divisions within the group according to the morphology of the thallus a popular history of british lichens the taxonomy of lichens was first intensively investigated by the sweden botanist erik acharius ( 1757â€“1819 ) , who is therefore sometimes named the '' father of lichenology '' in these years a group of researchers faithful to the tenets of linnaeus considered that lichens reproduced sexually and had sexual reproductive organs , as in other plants , independent of whether asexual reproduction also occurred in these early years of structuring the new discipline various works of outstanding scientific importance appeared such as lichenographia europaea reformata published in 1831 by elias fries or enumeratio critico lichenum europaeorum 1850 by ludwig schaerer in germany in the french publication annales des sciences naturelles in an article of 1852 '' memorie pour servir a l'histoire des lichens organographique et physiologique '' by edmond tulasne , the reproductive organs or apothecia of lichens was identified successive studies such as those carried out by andrei famintsyn and baranetzky in 1867 showed no dependence of the algal component upon the lichen thallus and that the algal component could live independently of the thallus on the one hand the definition of lichens and the relationship between the two symbionts and the taxonomic position of these organisms within the plant and fungal kingdoms the difficulty of giving a definition applicable to every known lichen has been debated since lichenologists first recognised the dual nature of lichens in 1982 the international association for lichenology convened a meeting to adopt a single definition of lichen drawing on the proposals of a committee although several species of lichen have been used in traditional medicine it was not until the early 20th century that modern science became interested in them with these investigations the number of antibacterial substances and possible drug targets known to be produced by lichens increased ergosterol , usnic acid etc interest in the potential of substances synthesised by lichens increased with the end of world war ii along with the growing interest in all antibiotic substances vertika , upreti and bajpai , rajesh ( aug 2013 ) lichenology and bryology in the galapagos islands with checklists of the lichens and bryophytes thus far reported , william a henssen ( 1990 ) studies in lichenology with emphasis on chemotaxonomy , geography and phytochemistry : festschrift christian leuckert , johannes gunther knoph , kunigunda schrufer and harry j sipman ( 1995 ) swedish lichenology : dedicated to roland moberg , jan erik mattsson , mats wedin and inga hedberg ( sep 1999 ) index of collectors in knowles the lichens of ireland ( 1929 ) and porter 's supplement : with a conspectus of lichen , m

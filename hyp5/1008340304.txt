lichens as a group have received less attention in classical treatises on botany than other groups although the relationship between humans and some species has been documented from early times several species have appeared in the works of dioscorides , pliny the elder and theophrastus although the studies are not very deep a popular history of british lichens p 22 for centuries naturalists had included lichens in diverse groups until in the early 18th century a french researcher joseph pitton de tournefort in his institutiones rei herbariae grouped them into their own genus a popular history of british lichens p after the revolution in taxonomy brought in by linnaeus and his new system of classification lichens are retained in the plant kingdom forming a single group lichen with eight divisions within the group according to the morphology of the thallus the taxonomy of lichens was first intensively investigated by the sweden botanist erik acharius ( 1757â€“1819 ) , who is therefore sometimes named the '' father of lichenology '' over the years research is shedding new light into the nature of these organisms still classified as plants a controversial issue surrounding lichens since the early 19th century is their reproduction a popular history of british lichens at first the presence of algae was taken as being due to contamination due to collection of samples in damp conditions and they were not considered as being in a symbiotic relation with the fungal part of the thallus it was in 1869 that simon schwendener demonstrated that all lichens were the result of fungal attack on the cells of algal cells and that all these algae also exist free in nature this researcher was the first to recognise the dual nature of lichens as a result of the capture of the algal component by the fungal component in 1873 jean-baptiste edouard bornet concluded form studying many different lichen species that the relationship between fungi and algae was purely symbiotic it was also established that algae could associate with many different fungi to form different lichen phenotypes lichenology has found applications beyond biology itself in the field of geology in a technique known as lichenometry where the age of an exposed surface can be found by studying the age of lichens growing on them such a simple a priori definition soon brought criticism from various lichenologists and there soon emerged reviews and suggestions for amendments this researcher represents one of the main trends among lichenologists who consider it impossible to give a single definition to lichens since they are a unique type of organism although several species of lichen have been used in traditional medicine it was not until the early 20th century that modern science became interested in them antibacterial action of substances produced by lichens is related to their ability to disrupt bacterial proteins with a subsequent loss of bacterial metabolic capacity seaward ( dec 1977 ) '' lichenology : progress and problems '' ( special volumes/systematics association ) denis hunter brown et al sloof ( 1993 ) the journal of the hattori botanical laboratory : devoted to bryology and lichenology , zennosuke iwatsuki ( 1983 ) contemporary lichenology and lichens of western oregon , w

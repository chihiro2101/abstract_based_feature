lichens as a group have received less attention in classical treatises on botany than other groups although the relationship between humans and some species has been documented from early times several species have appeared in the works of dioscorides , pliny the elder and theophrastus although the studies are not very deep a popular history of british lichens p 22 for centuries naturalists had included lichens in diverse groups until in the early 18th century a french researcher joseph pitton de tournefort in his institutiones rei herbariae grouped them into their own genus he adopted the latin term lichen , which had already been used by pliny who had imported it from theophrastus but up until then this term had not been widely employed a popular history of british lichens p 23 the original meaning of the greek word λειχήν ( leichen ) was moss that in its turn derives from the greek verb λείχω ( liekho ) to suck because of the great ability of these organisms to absorb water some forty years later dillenius in his historia muscorum made the first division of the group created by tournefort separating the sub-families usnea , coralloides and lichens in response to the morphological characteristics of the lichen thallus after the revolution in taxonomy brought in by linnaeus and his new system of classification lichens are retained in the plant kingdom forming a single group lichen with eight divisions within the group according to the morphology of the thallus the taxonomy of lichens was first intensively investigated by the sweden botanist erik acharius ( 1757–1819 ) , who is therefore sometimes named the '' father of lichenology '' a controversial issue surrounding lichens since the early 19th century is their reproduction in the french publication annales des sciences naturelles in an article of 1852 '' memorie pour servir a l'histoire des lichens organographique et physiologique '' by edmond tulasne , the reproductive organs or apothecia of lichens was identified at first the presence of algae was taken as being due to contamination due to collection of samples in damp conditions and they were not considered as being in a symbiotic relation with the fungal part of the thallus it was anton de bary a german mycologist who specialised in phytopathology who first suggested in 1865 that lichens were merely the result of parasitism of various fungi of the ascomycetes group by nostoc type algae and others successive studies such as those carried out by andrei famintsyn and baranetzky in 1867 showed no dependence of the algal component upon the lichen thallus and that the algal component could live independently of the thallus it was in 1869 that simon schwendener demonstrated that all lichens were the result of fungal attack on the cells of algal cells and that all these algae also exist free in nature this researcher was the first to recognise the dual nature of lichens as a result of the capture of the algal component by the fungal component despite the above studies the dual nature of lichens remained no more than a theory until in 1939 the swiss researcher eugen a thomas species : eugen a the difficulty of giving a definition applicable to every known lichen has been debated since lichenologists first recognised the dual nature of lichens today studies in lichenology are not restricted to the description and taxonomy of lichens but have application in various scientific fields these studies revealed some in vitro antitumour activity by substances identified in two common lichens peltigera leucophlebia and collema flaccidum sloof ( 1993 ) the journal of the hattori botanical laboratory : devoted to bryology and lichenology , zennosuke iwatsuki ( 1983 ) contemporary lichenology and lichens of western oregon , w

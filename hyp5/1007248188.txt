sinkholes may capture surface drainage from running or standing water , but may also form in high and dry places in specific locations sinkholes that capture drainage can hold it in large limestone caves the formation of sinkholes involves natural processes of erosion or gradual removal of slightly soluble bedrock ( such as limestone ) by percolation water , the collapse of a cave roof , or a lowering of the water table sinkholes often form through the process of suffosion sinkholes are common where the rock below the land surface is limestone or other carbonate rock , halite , or in other soluble rocks , such as gypsum , that can be dissolved naturally by circulating ground water sinkholes also occur in sandstone and quartzite terrains then , a sudden collapse of the land surface can occur on 2 july 2015 , scientists reported that active pits , related to sinkhole collapses and possibly associated with outbursts , were found on the comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko by the rosetta space probe sinkholes can also form when natural water-drainage patterns are changed and new water-diversion systems are developed cover-subsidence sinkholes form where voids in the underlying limestone allow more settling of the soil to create larger surface depressions cover-collapse sinkholes or '' dropouts '' form where so much soil settles down into voids in the limestone that the ground surface collapses new sinkhole collapses can also form when human activity changes the natural water-drainage patterns in karst areas pseudokarst sinkholes resemble karst sinkholes but formed by processes other than the natural dissolution of rock soil-collapse sinkholes , which are characterized by the collapse of cavities in soil that have developed where soil falls down into underlying rock cavities , pose the most serious hazards to life and property flowing water in karst conduits carries the soil away , preventing soil from accumulating in rock cavities and allowing the collapse process to continue induced sinkholes occur where human activity alters how surface water groundwater recharge activities that can accelerate sinkhole collapses include timber removal , ditching , laying pipelines , sewers , water lines , storm drains , and drilling the increased runoff from the impervious surfaces of roads , roofs , and parking lots also accelerate man-induced sinkhole collapses some induced sinkholes are preceded by warning signs , such as cracks , sagging , jammed doors , or cracking noises , but others develop with little or no warning however , karst development is well understood , and proper site characterization can avoid karst disasters the american society of civil engineers has declared that the potential for sinkhole collapse must be a part of land-use planning in karst areas the most likely locations for sinkhole collapse are areas where there is already a high density of existing sinkholes where large cavities exist in the limestone large surface collapses can occur , such the winter park , florida sinkhole collapse the areas most susceptible to sinkhole collapse can be identified and avoided the greatest amount of karst sinkhole damage in the united states occurs in florida , texas , alabama , missouri , kentucky , tennessee , and pennsylvania sinkholes tend to occur in karst landscapes the largest known sinkholes formed in sandstone are sima humboldt and sima martel in venezuela powerful underground rivers may form on the contact between limestone and underlying insoluble rock , creating large underground voids in such conditions , the largest known sinkholes of the world have formed , like the deep xiaozhai tiankeng ( chongqing , china ) , giant sótanos in querétaro and san luis potosí states in mexico and others this has produced not only the formation of the deepest water-filled sinkhole in the world—zacatón—but also unique processes of travertine sedimentation in upper parts of sinkholes , leading to sealing of these sinkholes with travertine lids state of florida in north america is known for having frequent sinkhole collapses , especially in the central part of the state black holes – this term refers to a group of unique , round , water-filled pits in the bahamas the dark color of the water is caused by a layer of phototropic microorganisms concentrated in a dense , purple colored layer at depth ; this layer '' swallows '' the light tiankengs – these are extremely large sinkholes , typically deeper and wider than , with mostly vertical walls , most often created by the collapse of caverns tomo – this term is used in new zealand karst country to describe pot holes at the bottom of an conical pit , and approximately deep , it is among the deepest sinkholes in the world ( see sótano del barro below ) the sinkhole , which is located in an area of karst bedrock , is approximately in diameter and deep with many mature trees growing on the floor of the hole green banana hole - a blue hole located off the coast of sarasota , florida

sinkholes may capture surface drainage from running or standing water , but may also form in high and dry places in specific locations sinkholes that capture drainage can hold it in large limestone caves sinkholes often form through the process of suffosion occasionally a sinkhole may exhibit a visible opening into a cave below sinkholes are common where the rock below the land surface is limestone or other carbonate rock , halite , or in other soluble rocks , such as gypsum , that can be dissolved naturally by circulating ground water these sinkholes can be dramatic , because the surface land usually stays intact until there is not enough support sinkholes can also form when natural water-drainage patterns are changed and new water-diversion systems are developed solution or dissolution sinkholes form where water dissolves limestone under a soil covering soil settles down into the enlarged openings forming a small depression at the ground surface cover-subsidence sinkholes form where voids in the underlying limestone allow more settling of the soil to create larger surface depressions cover-collapse sinkholes or '' dropouts '' form where so much soil settles down into voids in the limestone that the ground surface collapses new sinkhole collapses can also form when human activity changes the natural water-drainage patterns in karst areas pseudokarst sinkholes resemble karst sinkholes but formed by processes other than the natural dissolution of rock fluctuation of the water level accelerates this collapse process later , as the water level moves downward , the softened soil seeps downwards into rock cavities flowing water in karst conduits carries the soil away , preventing soil from accumulating in rock cavities and allowing the collapse process to continue induced sinkholes occur where human activity alters how surface water groundwater recharge many human-induced sinkholes occur where natural diffused recharge is disturbed and surface water becomes concentrated activities that can accelerate sinkhole collapses include timber removal , ditching , laying pipelines , sewers , water lines , storm drains , and drilling the increased runoff from the impervious surfaces of roads , roofs , and parking lots also accelerate man-induced sinkhole collapses the most likely locations for sinkhole collapse are areas where there is already a high density of existing sinkholes since water level changes accelerate sinkhole collapse , measures must be taken to minimize water level changes in karst areas the traditional foundation evaluations ( bearing capacity and settlement ) of the ability of soil to support a structure must be supplemented by geotechnical site investigation for cavities and defects in the underlying rock these sinkholes drain all the water , so there are only subterranean rivers in these areas the largest known sinkholes formed in sandstone are sima humboldt and sima martel in venezuela some sinkholes form in thick layers of homogenous limestone this has produced not only the formation of the deepest water-filled sinkhole in the world—zacatón—but also unique processes of travertine sedimentation in upper parts of sinkholes , leading to sealing of these sinkholes with travertine lids the murge area in southern italy also has numerous sinkholes large and visually unusual sinkholes have been well known to local people since ancient times aven - in the south of france this name means pit cave in occitan black holes – this term refers to a group of unique , round , water-filled pits in the bahamas this large vertical hole is not a true sinkhole , as it did not form via the dissolution of limestone , dolomite , marble , or any other water-soluble rock instead , they are examples of '' piping pseudokarst '' , created by the collapse of large cavities that had developed in the weak , crumbly quaternary volcanic deposits underlying the city although weak and crumbly , these volcanic deposits have enough cohesion to allow them to stand in vertical faces and to develop large subterranean voids within them the second deepest known sinkhole under the sea , depth at the bottom of an conical pit , and approximately deep , it is among the deepest sinkholes in the world ( see sótano del barro below ) green banana hole - a blue hole located off the coast of sarasota , florida largest sinkhole in sandstone , deep , with vertical walls

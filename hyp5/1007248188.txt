sinkholes may capture surface drainage from running or standing water , but may also form in high and dry places in specific locations sinkholes that capture drainage can hold it in large limestone caves the formation of sinkholes involves natural processes of erosion or gradual removal of slightly soluble bedrock ( such as limestone ) by percolation water , the collapse of a cave roof , or a lowering of the water table sinkholes are common where the rock below the land surface is limestone or other carbonate rock , halite , or in other soluble rocks , such as gypsum , that can be dissolved naturally by circulating ground water these sinkholes can be dramatic , because the surface land usually stays intact until there is not enough support more commonly , collapses occur in urban areas due to water main breaks or sewer collapses when old pipes give way they can also occur from the overpumping and extraction of groundwater and subsurface fluids sinkholes can also form when natural water-drainage patterns are changed and new water-diversion systems are developed soil settles down into the enlarged openings forming a small depression at the ground surface cover-collapse sinkholes or '' dropouts '' form where so much soil settles down into voids in the limestone that the ground surface collapses new sinkhole collapses can also form when human activity changes the natural water-drainage patterns in karst areas pseudokarst sinkholes resemble karst sinkholes but formed by processes other than the natural dissolution of rock when water rises up through fissures in the rock , it reduces soil cohesion flowing water in karst conduits carries the soil away , preventing soil from accumulating in rock cavities and allowing the collapse process to continue many human-induced sinkholes occur where natural diffused recharge is disturbed and surface water becomes concentrated activities that can accelerate sinkhole collapses include timber removal , ditching , laying pipelines , sewers , water lines , storm drains , and drilling these activities can increase the downward movement of water beyond the natural rate of groundwater recharge however , karst development is well understood , and proper site characterization can avoid karst disasters the american society of civil engineers has declared that the potential for sinkhole collapse must be a part of land-use planning in karst areas the most likely locations for sinkhole collapse are areas where there is already a high density of existing sinkholes where large cavities exist in the limestone large surface collapses can occur , such the winter park , florida sinkhole collapse since water level changes accelerate sinkhole collapse , measures must be taken to minimize water level changes the areas most susceptible to sinkhole collapse can be identified and avoided since the soil/rock surface in karst areas are very irregular the number of subsurface samples ( borings and core samples ) required per unit area is usually much greater than in non-karst areas the greatest amount of karst sinkhole damage in the united states occurs in florida , texas , alabama , missouri , kentucky , tennessee , and pennsylvania the largest recent sinkhole in the usa is possibly one that formed in 1972 in montevallo , alabama as a result of man-made lowering of the water level in a nearby rock quarry karst landscapes can have up to thousands of sinkholes within a small area , giving the landscape a pock-marked appearance examples of karst landscapes with numerous massive sinkholes include khammouan mountains ( laos ) and mamo plateau ( papua new guinea ) the largest known sinkholes formed in sandstone are sima humboldt and sima martel in venezuela some sinkholes form in thick layers of homogenous limestone powerful underground rivers may form on the contact between limestone and underlying insoluble rock , creating large underground voids state of florida in north america is known for having frequent sinkhole collapses , especially in the central part of the state a consequence of this is the pollution of groundwater resources , with serious health implications in such areas the 2010 guatemala city sinkhole formed suddenly in may of that year ; torrential rains from tropical storm agatha and a bad drainage system were blamed for its creation double nested sinkhole with vertical walls , deep the sinkhole , which is located in an area of karst bedrock , is approximately in diameter and deep with many mature trees growing on the floor of the hole several sinkholes have formed , the most recent in 2008 with a maximum diameter of and maximum depth of largest sinkhole in sandstone , deep , with vertical walls

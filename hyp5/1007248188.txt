sinkholes may capture surface drainage from running or standing water , but may also form in high and dry places in specific locations the formation of sinkholes involves natural processes of erosion or gradual removal of slightly soluble bedrock ( such as limestone ) by percolation water , the collapse of a cave roof , or a lowering of the water table sinkholes often form through the process of suffosion sinkholes are common where the rock below the land surface is limestone or other carbonate rock , halite , or in other soluble rocks , such as gypsum , that can be dissolved naturally by circulating ground water sinkholes can also form when natural water-drainage patterns are changed and new water-diversion systems are developed some sinkholes form when the land surface is changed , such as when industrial and runoff-storage ponds are created ; the substantial weight of the new material can trigger a collapse of the roof of an existing void or cavity in the subsurface , resulting in development of a sinkhole solution or dissolution sinkholes form where water dissolves limestone under a soil covering cover-subsidence sinkholes form where voids in the underlying limestone allow more settling of the soil to create larger surface depressions cover-collapse sinkholes or '' dropouts '' form where so much soil settles down into voids in the limestone that the ground surface collapses the surface collapses may occur abruptly and cause catastrophic damages new sinkhole collapses can also form when human activity changes the natural water-drainage patterns in karst areas pseudokarst sinkholes resemble karst sinkholes but formed by processes other than the natural dissolution of rock geological survey notes that '' it is a frightening thought to imagine the ground below your feet or house suddenly collapsing and forming a big hole in the ground later , as the water level moves downward , the softened soil seeps downwards into rock cavities thus most sinkhole disasters are predictable and preventable rather than “ acts of god ” the american society of civil engineers has declared that the potential for sinkhole collapse must be a part of land-use planning in karst areas the most likely locations for sinkhole collapse are areas where there is already a high density of existing sinkholes where large cavities exist in the limestone large surface collapses can occur , such the winter park , florida sinkhole collapse recommendations for land uses in karst areas should avoid or minimize alterations of the land surface and natural drainage since the soil/rock surface in karst areas are very irregular the number of subsurface samples ( borings and core samples ) required per unit area is usually much greater than in non-karst areas geological survey estimated the cost for repairs of damage arising from karst-related processes as at least 300 million per year over the preceding 15 years , but noted that this may be a gross underestimate based on inadequate data the largest recent sinkhole in the usa is possibly one that formed in 1972 in montevallo , alabama as a result of man-made lowering of the water level in a nearby rock quarry this '' december giant '' or '' golly hole '' sinkhole measures 425 feet long , 350 feet wide and 150 feet deep karst landscapes can have up to thousands of sinkholes within a small area , giving the landscape a pock-marked appearance some sinkholes form in thick layers of homogenous limestone powerful underground rivers may form on the contact between limestone and underlying insoluble rock , creating large underground voids unusual processes have formed the enormous sinkholes of sistema zacatón in tamaulipas ( mexico ) , where more than 20 sinkholes and other karst formations have been shaped by volcanically heated , acidic groundwater this has produced not only the formation of the deepest water-filled sinkhole in the world—zacatón—but also unique processes of travertine sedimentation in upper parts of sinkholes , leading to sealing of these sinkholes with travertine lids sinkholes that form in coral reefs and islands that collapse to enormous depths are known as blue holes and often become popular diving spots the dark color of the water is caused by a layer of phototropic microorganisms concentrated in a dense , purple colored layer at depth ; this layer '' swallows '' the light one of them is the black hole of andros blue holes – this name was initially given to the deep underwater sinkholes of the bahamas but is often used for any deep water-filled pits formed in carbonate rocks many cenotes have formed in limestone deposited in shallow seas created by the chicxulub meteorite 's impact tiankengs – these are extremely large sinkholes , typically deeper and wider than , with mostly vertical walls , most often created by the collapse of caverns the term means sky holes in chinese ; many of this largest type of sinkhole are located in china dragon hole the deepest known underwater ocean sinkhole in the world the sinkhole , which is located in an area of karst bedrock , is approximately in diameter and deep with many mature trees growing on the floor of the hole deepest water-filled sinkhole in world , deep

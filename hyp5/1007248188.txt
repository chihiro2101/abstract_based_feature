sinkholes may capture surface drainage from running or standing water , but may also form in high and dry places in specific locations the formation of sinkholes involves natural processes of erosion or gradual removal of slightly soluble bedrock ( such as limestone ) by percolation water , the collapse of a cave roof , or a lowering of the water table sinkholes often form through the process of suffosion for example , groundwater may dissolve the carbonate cement holding the sandstone particles together and then carry away the lax particles , gradually forming a void sinkholes are common where the rock below the land surface is limestone or other carbonate rock , halite , or in other soluble rocks , such as gypsum , that can be dissolved naturally by circulating ground water then , a sudden collapse of the land surface can occur on 2 july 2015 , scientists reported that active pits , related to sinkhole collapses and possibly associated with outbursts , were found on the comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko by the rosetta space probe sinkholes can also form when natural water-drainage patterns are changed and new water-diversion systems are developed solution or dissolution sinkholes form where water dissolves limestone under a soil covering dissolution enlarges natural openings in the rock such as joints , fractures , and bedding planes soil settles down into the enlarged openings forming a small depression at the ground surface cover-subsidence sinkholes form where voids in the underlying limestone allow more settling of the soil to create larger surface depressions cover-collapse sinkholes or '' dropouts '' form where so much soil settles down into voids in the limestone that the ground surface collapses new sinkhole collapses can also form when human activity changes the natural water-drainage patterns in karst areas pseudokarst sinkholes resemble karst sinkholes but formed by processes other than the natural dissolution of rock flowing water in karst conduits carries the soil away , preventing soil from accumulating in rock cavities and allowing the collapse process to continue induced sinkholes occur where human activity alters how surface water groundwater recharge many human-induced sinkholes occur where natural diffused recharge is disturbed and surface water becomes concentrated activities that can accelerate sinkhole collapses include timber removal , ditching , laying pipelines , sewers , water lines , storm drains , and drilling the increased runoff from the impervious surfaces of roads , roofs , and parking lots also accelerate man-induced sinkhole collapses some induced sinkholes are preceded by warning signs , such as cracks , sagging , jammed doors , or cracking noises , but others develop with little or no warning however , karst development is well understood , and proper site characterization can avoid karst disasters the american society of civil engineers has declared that the potential for sinkhole collapse must be a part of land-use planning in karst areas where large cavities exist in the limestone large surface collapses can occur , such the winter park , florida sinkhole collapse this '' december giant '' or '' golly hole '' sinkhole measures 425 feet long , 350 feet wide and 150 feet deep karst landscapes can have up to thousands of sinkholes within a small area , giving the landscape a pock-marked appearance these sinkholes drain all the water , so there are only subterranean rivers in these areas powerful underground rivers may form on the contact between limestone and underlying insoluble rock , creating large underground voids in such conditions , the largest known sinkholes of the world have formed , like the deep xiaozhai tiankeng ( chongqing , china ) , giant sótanos in querétaro and san luis potosí states in mexico and others unusual processes have formed the enormous sinkholes of sistema zacatón in tamaulipas ( mexico ) , where more than 20 sinkholes and other karst formations have been shaped by volcanically heated , acidic groundwater this has produced not only the formation of the deepest water-filled sinkhole in the world—zacatón—but also unique processes of travertine sedimentation in upper parts of sinkholes , leading to sealing of these sinkholes with travertine lids some of the most spectacular are the zacatón cenote in mexico ( the world 's deepest water-filled sinkhole ) , the boesmansgat sinkhole in south africa , sarisariñama tepuy in venezuela , the sótano del barro in mexico , and in the town of mount gambier , south australia sinkholes that form in coral reefs and islands that collapse to enormous depths are known as blue holes and often become popular diving spots large and visually unusual sinkholes have been well known to local people since ancient times tiankengs – these are extremely large sinkholes , typically deeper and wider than , with mostly vertical walls , most often created by the collapse of caverns dragon hole the deepest known underwater ocean sinkhole in the world '' nation 's largest sinkhole may be near montevallo '' ( 29 march 1973 ) the tuscaloosa news grassy cove – tennessee it was notable as one of the largest recent sinkholes to form in the united states

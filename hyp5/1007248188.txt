sinkholes may capture surface drainage from running or standing water , but may also form in high and dry places in specific locations sinkholes often form through the process of suffosion for example , groundwater may dissolve the carbonate cement holding the sandstone particles together and then carry away the lax particles , gradually forming a void occasionally a sinkhole may exhibit a visible opening into a cave below sinkholes are common where the rock below the land surface is limestone or other carbonate rock , halite , or in other soluble rocks , such as gypsum , that can be dissolved naturally by circulating ground water sinkholes also occur in sandstone and quartzite terrains these sinkholes can be dramatic , because the surface land usually stays intact until there is not enough support some sinkholes form when the land surface is changed , such as when industrial and runoff-storage ponds are created ; the substantial weight of the new material can trigger a collapse of the roof of an existing void or cavity in the subsurface , resulting in development of a sinkhole solution or dissolution sinkholes form where water dissolves limestone under a soil covering cover-subsidence sinkholes form where voids in the underlying limestone allow more settling of the soil to create larger surface depressions cover-collapse sinkholes or '' dropouts '' form where so much soil settles down into voids in the limestone that the ground surface collapses new sinkhole collapses can also form when human activity changes the natural water-drainage patterns in karst areas geological survey notes that '' it is a frightening thought to imagine the ground below your feet or house suddenly collapsing and forming a big hole in the ground '' human activities can accelerate collapses of karst sinkholes , causing collapse within a few years that would normally evolve over thousands of years under natural conditions later , as the water level moves downward , the softened soil seeps downwards into rock cavities flowing water in karst conduits carries the soil away , preventing soil from accumulating in rock cavities and allowing the collapse process to continue induced sinkholes occur where human activity alters how surface water groundwater recharge many human-induced sinkholes occur where natural diffused recharge is disturbed and surface water becomes concentrated these activities can increase the downward movement of water beyond the natural rate of groundwater recharge the american society of civil engineers has declared that the potential for sinkhole collapse must be a part of land-use planning in karst areas where sinkhole collapse of structures could cause loss of life , the public should be made aware of the risks the most likely locations for sinkhole collapse are areas where there is already a high density of existing sinkholes where large cavities exist in the limestone large surface collapses can occur , such the winter park , florida sinkhole collapse recommendations for land uses in karst areas should avoid or minimize alterations of the land surface and natural drainage the greatest amount of karst sinkhole damage in the united states occurs in florida , texas , alabama , missouri , kentucky , tennessee , and pennsylvania sinkholes tend to occur in karst landscapes karst landscapes can have up to thousands of sinkholes within a small area , giving the landscape a pock-marked appearance these sinkholes drain all the water , so there are only subterranean rivers in these areas examples of karst landscapes with numerous massive sinkholes include khammouan mountains ( laos ) and mamo plateau ( papua new guinea ) unusual processes have formed the enormous sinkholes of sistema zacatón in tamaulipas ( mexico ) , where more than 20 sinkholes and other karst formations have been shaped by volcanically heated , acidic groundwater this has produced not only the formation of the deepest water-filled sinkhole in the world—zacatón—but also unique processes of travertine sedimentation in upper parts of sinkholes , leading to sealing of these sinkholes with travertine lids on the fringes of the state , sinkholes are rare or non-existent ; limestone there is around 120,000 years old when sinkholes are very deep or connected to caves , they may offer challenges for experienced cavers or , when water-filled , divers the name originates from the deep blue color of water in these sinkholes , which is created by the high clarity of the water and the great depth of the sinkholes ; only the deep blue color of the visible spectrum can penetrate such depth and return after reflection many cenotes have formed in limestone deposited in shallow seas created by the chicxulub meteorite 's impact teiq sinkhole ( taiq , teeq , tayq ) in oman is one of the largest sinkholes in the world by volume : the sinkhole , which is located in an area of karst bedrock , is approximately in diameter and deep with many mature trees growing on the floor of the hole it was notable as one of the largest recent sinkholes to form in the united states

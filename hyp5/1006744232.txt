gauquelin 's work was not limited to the mars effect : his calculations led him first to reject most of the conventions of natal astrology as it is practised in the modern west but he singled out '' highly significant statistical correlations between planetary positions and the birth times of eminently successful people however , partly because eminence in sport is more quantifiable , later research , publicity and controversy has tended to single out the '' mars effect '' in 1956 gauquelin invited the belgian comité para to review his findings but it was not until 1962 that jean dath corroborated the statistics gauquelin had presented and suggested an attempt at duplication using belgian athletes by this time gauquelin had published les hommes et les astres ( men and the stars , 1960 ) , offering further data the comité para tested the mars effect in 1967 and replicated it , though most of the data ( 473 of 535 ) were still collected by gauquelin himself in 1983 abell , kurtz and zelen ( see below ) published a reappraisal , rejecting the idea of demographic errors , saying , “ gauquelin adequately allowed for demographic and astronomical factors in predicting the expected distribution of mars sectors for birth times in the general population however the subsequent article by zelen , abell and kurtz did not clearly state this outcome but rather questioned the original data before and after publication of zelen 's results astronomer and charter csicop member dennis rawlins , the csicop council 's only astronomer at the time , repeatedly objected to the procedure and to csicop 's subsequent reportage of it rawlins privately urged that the gauquelins ' results were valid and the “ zelen test ” could only uphold this and that zelen had diverted from the original purpose of the control test , which was to check the base rate of births with mars in the '' key '' sectors sportsmen display the mars effect , skeptical inquirer , vol 4 2 , winter 1979/80 , 31–43 the cfepp stated that its experiment showed no effect and concluded that the effect was attributable to bias in gauquelin ’ s data selection , pointing to the suggestions made by gauquelin to the committee for changes in their list of athletes some researchers argued that gauquelin did not adjust the statistical significance of the mars effect for multiple comparisons and did not address the issue in his publications there is about a 25 % chance to find at least one such combination ( of one planet and two sectors ) for a random dataset of the same size as gauquelin ’ s that would yield a result with apparent statistical significance like the one obtained by gauquelin the mars effect in retrospect , skeptical inquirer , vol 21 6 , nov 1997 , 24–29

gauquelin 's work was not limited to the mars effect : his calculations led him first to reject most of the conventions of natal astrology as it is practised in the modern west but he singled out '' highly significant statistical correlations between planetary positions and the birth times of eminently successful people '' this claim concerned not only mars but five planets , correlated with eminence in fields broadly compatible with the planets in astrology of astrology however , partly because eminence in sport is more quantifiable , later research , publicity and controversy has tended to single out the '' mars effect '' in 1956 gauquelin invited the belgian comité para to review his findings but it was not until 1962 that jean dath corroborated the statistics gauquelin had presented and suggested an attempt at duplication using belgian athletes by this time gauquelin had published les hommes et les astres ( men and the stars , 1960 ) , offering further data the comité para tested the mars effect in 1967 and replicated it , though most of the data ( 473 of 535 ) were still collected by gauquelin himself unpublished internal analyses contradicted this and one committee member , luc de marré , resigned in protest the gauquelins also performed the test that professor zelen had proposed and carried out and found that the chance mars-in-key-sector expectation for the general population ( i.e however the subsequent article by zelen , abell and kurtz did not clearly state this outcome but rather questioned the original data they had had difficulty finding sufficient same-week and same-village births to compare with champions born in rural areas and so had chosen only champions born in larger cities the gauquelins ' original total list of about 2,088 champions had included 42 parisians and their subsample of 303 athletes also included 42 parisians gauquelin contended the kza group demonstrated an overall preference for mediocre athletes and ignored his criteria of eminence and that they included basketball players and people born after 1950 nienhuys and several letters from gauquelin to the committee , was published in book form as the mars effect – a french test of over 1,000 sports champions the mars effect in retrospect , skeptical inquirer , vol 21 6 , nov 1997 , 24–29

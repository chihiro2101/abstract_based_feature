gauquelin 's work was not limited to the mars effect : his calculations led him first to reject most of the conventions of natal astrology as it is practised in the modern west but he singled out '' highly significant statistical correlations between planetary positions and the birth times of eminently successful people however , partly because eminence in sport is more quantifiable , later research , publicity and controversy has tended to single out the '' mars effect '' in 1956 gauquelin invited the belgian comité para to review his findings but it was not until 1962 that jean dath corroborated the statistics gauquelin had presented and suggested an attempt at duplication using belgian athletes by this time gauquelin had published les hommes et les astres ( men and the stars , 1960 ) , offering further data the comité para tested the mars effect in 1967 and replicated it , though most of the data ( 473 of 535 ) were still collected by gauquelin himself the committee , suspecting that the results might have been an artifact , withheld its findings for a further eight years , then cited unspecified “ demography errors ” in its findings in 1975 paul kurtz 's journal the humanist published an article on astrology criticizing gauquelin , to which the latter and his wife françoise responded however the subsequent article by zelen , abell and kurtz did not clearly state this outcome but rather questioned the original data rawlins privately urged that the gauquelins ' results were valid and the “ zelen test ” could only uphold this and that zelen had diverted from the original purpose of the control test , which was to check the base rate of births with mars in the '' key '' sectors test of the '' mars effect '' are negative , skeptical inquirer , vol 4 2 , winter 1979/80 , 19–26 showed a negative result nienhuys and several letters from gauquelin to the committee , was published in book form as the mars effect – a french test of over 1,000 sports champions there is about a 25 % chance to find at least one such combination ( of one planet and two sectors ) for a random dataset of the same size as gauquelin ’ s that would yield a result with apparent statistical significance like the one obtained by gauquelin the abell-kurtz-zelen '' mars effect '' experiments : a reappraisal , skeptical inquirer vol 7 3 , fall 1983 , 77–82 the mars effect in retrospect , skeptical inquirer , vol 21 6 , nov 1997 , 24–29

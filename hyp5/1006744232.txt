gauquelin 's work was not limited to the mars effect : his calculations led him first to reject most of the conventions of natal astrology as it is practised in the modern west but he singled out '' highly significant statistical correlations between planetary positions and the birth times of eminently successful people however , partly because eminence in sport is more quantifiable , later research , publicity and controversy has tended to single out the '' mars effect '' in 1956 gauquelin invited the belgian comité para to review his findings but it was not until 1962 that jean dath corroborated the statistics gauquelin had presented and suggested an attempt at duplication using belgian athletes by this time gauquelin had published les hommes et les astres ( men and the stars , 1960 ) , offering further data the comité para tested the mars effect in 1967 and replicated it , though most of the data ( 473 of 535 ) were still collected by gauquelin himself in 1983 abell , kurtz and zelen ( see below ) published a reappraisal , rejecting the idea of demographic errors , saying , “ gauquelin adequately allowed for demographic and astronomical factors in predicting the expected distribution of mars sectors for birth times in the general population in 1975 paul kurtz 's journal the humanist published an article on astrology criticizing gauquelin , to which the latter and his wife françoise responded the gauquelins also performed the test that professor zelen had proposed and carried out and found that the chance mars-in-key-sector expectation for the general population ( i.e however the subsequent article by zelen , abell and kurtz did not clearly state this outcome but rather questioned the original data in a rebuttal of the gauquelins ' published conclusion , marvin zelen analysed the composition , not of the 17,000 non-champions of the control group , but of the 303 champions , splitting this secondary subsample ( which was already nearly too small to test 22 % vs 17 % ) by eliminating female athletes , a subgroup that gave the results most favourable to gauquelin , and dividing the remaining athletes into city/rural sections and parisian/non-parisian sections rawlins privately urged that the gauquelins ' results were valid and the “ zelen test ” could only uphold this and that zelen had diverted from the original purpose of the control test , which was to check the base rate of births with mars in the '' key '' sectors in 1994 the results of a major study undertaken by the committee for the study of paranormal phenomena ( comité pour l ’ étude des phénomènes paranormaux , or cfepp ) in france found no evidence whatsoever of a '' mars effect '' in the births of athletes nienhuys and several letters from gauquelin to the committee , was published in book form as the mars effect – a french test of over 1,000 sports champions the mars effect in retrospect , skeptical inquirer , vol 21 6 , nov 1997 , 24–29

in an effort to offset the depletion of resources , theorists have come up with the concept of depletion accounting better known as 'green accounting , ' depletion accounting aims to account for nature 's value on an equal footing with the market economy resource depletion accounting uses data provided from countries to estimate the adjustments needed due to their use and depletion of the natural capital available to them natural capital are natural resources such as mineral deposits or timber stocks depletion accounting factors in several different influences such as the number of years until resource exhaustion , the cost of resource extraction and the demand of the resource resource extraction industries make up a large part of the economic activity in developing countries this , in turn , leads to higher levels of resource depletion and environmental degradation in developing countries theorists argue that implementation of resource depletion accounting is necessary in developing countries depletion accounting also seeks to measure the social value of natural resources and ecosystems environmentalists are interested in depletion accounting as a way to track the use of natural resources over time , hold governments accountable or to compare their environmental conditions to those of another country economists want to measure resource depletion to understand how financially reliant countries or corporations are on non-renewable resources , whether this use can be sustained and the financial drawbacks of switching to renewable resources in light of the depleting resources for depletion accounting to work , appropriate units of natural resources must be established so that natural resources can be viable in the market economy globally , environmental economics has not been able to provide a consensus of measurement units of nature 's services materials flow and sustainability , us geological survey.fact sheet fs-068-98 , june 1998 ) , as well as rare earth minerals , face production output limitations from time to time , because supply involves large up-front investments and is therefore slow to respond to rapid increases in demand minerals projected by some to enter production decline during the next 20 years : gasoline ( 2023 ) valero & valero ( 2010 ) による『physical geonomics : combining the exergy and hubbert peak analysis for predicting mineral resources depletion』から copper ( 2024 ) as the population of developing areas , especially near rainforests , increases , the need for land for farming becomes more and more important in some countries ranchers have also moved their property onto wetlands for grazing due to the nutrient rich vegetation . groundwater as a non-renewable resource there are two different perspectives to groundwater depletion , the first is that depletion is considered literally and simply as a reduction in the volume of water in the saturated zone , regardless of water quality considerations depletion due to quality considerations can be overcome by treatment , whereas large volume metric depletion can only be alleviated by decreasing discharge or increasing recharge

in an effort to offset the depletion of resources , theorists have come up with the concept of depletion accounting better known as 'green accounting , ' depletion accounting aims to account for nature 's value on an equal footing with the market economy resource depletion accounting uses data provided from countries to estimate the adjustments needed due to their use and depletion of the natural capital available to them natural capital are natural resources such as mineral deposits or timber stocks depletion accounting factors in several different influences such as the number of years until resource exhaustion , the cost of resource extraction and the demand of the resource resource extraction industries make up a large part of the economic activity in developing countries this , in turn , leads to higher levels of resource depletion and environmental degradation in developing countries theorists argue that implementation of resource depletion accounting is necessary in developing countries depletion accounting also seeks to measure the social value of natural resources and ecosystems measurement of social value is sought through ecosystem services , which are defined as the benefits of nature to households , communities and economies environmentalists are interested in depletion accounting as a way to track the use of natural resources over time , hold governments accountable or to compare their environmental conditions to those of another country economists want to measure resource depletion to understand how financially reliant countries or corporations are on non-renewable resources , whether this use can be sustained and the financial drawbacks of switching to renewable resources in light of the depleting resources for depletion accounting to work , appropriate units of natural resources must be established so that natural resources can be viable in the market economy some economists want to include measurement of the benefits arising from public goods provided by nature , but currently there are no market indicators of value globally , environmental economics has not been able to provide a consensus of measurement units of nature 's services minerals projected by some to enter production decline during the next 20 years : gasoline ( 2023 ) valero & valero ( 2010 ) による『physical geonomics : combining the exergy and hubbert peak analysis for predicting mineral resources depletion』から copper ( 2024 ) peak oil is the period when the maximum rate of global petroleum extraction is reached , after which the rate of production will undergo a long-term decline it is estimated that 80 % of the world 's known biodiversity lives in the rainforests , and the destruction of these rainforests is accelerating extinction at an alarming rate due to this increase in depletion , in some of the most depleted areas use of groundwater for irrigation has become impossible or cost prohibitive there are two different perspectives to groundwater depletion , the first is that depletion is considered literally and simply as a reduction in the volume of water in the saturated zone , regardless of water quality considerations depletion due to quality considerations can be overcome by treatment , whereas large volume metric depletion can only be alleviated by decreasing discharge or increasing recharge

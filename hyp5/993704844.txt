in an effort to offset the depletion of resources , theorists have come up with the concept of depletion accounting better known as 'green accounting , ' depletion accounting aims to account for nature 's value on an equal footing with the market economy resource depletion accounting uses data provided from countries to estimate the adjustments needed due to their use and depletion of the natural capital available to them natural capital are natural resources such as mineral deposits or timber stocks depletion accounting factors in several different influences such as the number of years until resource exhaustion , the cost of resource extraction and the demand of the resource resource extraction industries make up a large part of the economic activity in developing countries this , in turn , leads to higher levels of resource depletion and environmental degradation in developing countries theorists argue that implementation of resource depletion accounting is necessary in developing countries depletion accounting also seeks to measure the social value of natural resources and ecosystems environmentalists are interested in depletion accounting as a way to track the use of natural resources over time , hold governments accountable or to compare their environmental conditions to those of another country economists want to measure resource depletion to understand how financially reliant countries or corporations are on non-renewable resources , whether this use can be sustained and the financial drawbacks of switching to renewable resources in light of the depleting resources depletion accounting is complex to implement as nature is not as quantifiable like cars , houses or bread for depletion accounting to work , appropriate units of natural resources must be established so that natural resources can be viable in the market economy large-scale exploitation of minerals began in the industrial revolution around 1760 in england and has grown rapidly ever since minerals projected by some to enter production decline during the next 20 years : gasoline ( 2023 ) valero & valero ( 2010 ) による『physical geonomics : combining the exergy and hubbert peak analysis for predicting mineral resources depletion』から copper ( 2024 ) zinc depletion developments in hydrometallurgy have transformed non-sulfide zinc deposits ( largely ignored until now ) into large low cost reserves minerals projected by some to enter production decline during the present century : aluminium ( 2057 ) coal ( 2060 ) iron ( 2068 ) such projections may change , as new discoveries are made and typically misinterpret available data on mineral resources and mineral reserves as peaking is approached , liquid fuel prices and price volatility will increase dramatically , and , without timely mitigation , the social , economic and political costs will be unprecedented for most people , a forest has no value when its resources are not being used , so the incentives to deforest these areas outweigh the incentives to preserve the forests wetlands act as natural water filters , when runoff from either natural or man-made processes pass through , wetlands can have a neutralizing effect there are two different perspectives to groundwater depletion , the first is that depletion is considered literally and simply as a reduction in the volume of water in the saturated zone , regardless of water quality considerations

in an effort to offset the depletion of resources , theorists have come up with the concept of depletion accounting better known as 'green accounting , ' depletion accounting aims to account for nature 's value on an equal footing with the market economy resource depletion accounting uses data provided from countries to estimate the adjustments needed due to their use and depletion of the natural capital available to them depletion accounting factors in several different influences such as the number of years until resource exhaustion , the cost of resource extraction and the demand of the resource resource extraction industries make up a large part of the economic activity in developing countries this , in turn , leads to higher levels of resource depletion and environmental degradation in developing countries theorists argue that implementation of resource depletion accounting is necessary in developing countries depletion accounting also seeks to measure the social value of natural resources and ecosystems environmentalists are interested in depletion accounting as a way to track the use of natural resources over time , hold governments accountable or to compare their environmental conditions to those of another country economists want to measure resource depletion to understand how financially reliant countries or corporations are on non-renewable resources , whether this use can be sustained and the financial drawbacks of switching to renewable resources in light of the depleting resources for depletion accounting to work , appropriate units of natural resources must be established so that natural resources can be viable in the market economy large-scale exploitation of minerals began in the industrial revolution around 1760 in england and has grown rapidly ever since data from the united states geological survey ( usgs ) suggest that it is very unlikely that copper production will peak before 2040 zinc depletion developments in hydrometallurgy have transformed non-sulfide zinc deposits ( largely ignored until now ) into large low cost reserves for most people , a forest has no value when its resources are not being used , so the incentives to deforest these areas outweigh the incentives to preserve the forests randerson , co2 emissions from forest loss , nature geoscience , volume 2 ( november 2009 ) pp wetlands are a nonrenewable resource on a human timescale and in some environments can not ever be renewed wetlands provide environmental services for : food and habitat improving water quality commercial fishing floodwater reduction shoreline stabilization recreation groundwater is water that is in saturated zones underground , the upper surface of the saturated zone is called the water table people are already using non-renewable water that is thousands of years old , in areas like egypt they are using water that may have been renewed a million years ago which is not renewable on human timescales there are two different perspectives to groundwater depletion , the first is that depletion is considered literally and simply as a reduction in the volume of water in the saturated zone , regardless of water quality considerations

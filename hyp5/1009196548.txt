there are generally four types of toxic entities ; chemical , biological , physical and radiation : chemical toxicants include inorganic substances such as , lead , mercury , hydrofluoric acid , and chlorine gas , and organic compounds such as methanol , most medications , and toxins while some weakly radioactive substances , such as uranium , are also chemical toxicants , more strongly radioactive materials like radium are not , their harmful effects ( radiation poisoning ) being caused by the ionizing radiation produced by the substance rather than chemical interactions with the substance itself the biological toxicity of pathogens can be difficult to measure because the '' threshold dose '' may be a single organism however , in a host with an intact immune system , the inherent toxicity of the organism is balanced by the host 's ability to fight back ; the effective toxicity is then a combination of both parts of the relationship physical toxicants are substances that , due to their physical nature , interfere with biological processes it is more difficult to determine the toxicity of chemical mixtures than a pure chemical because each component displays its own toxicity , and components may interact to produce enhanced or diminished effects the preclinical toxicity testing on various biological systems reveals the species- , organ- and dose-specific toxic effects of an investigational product the toxicity of substances can be observed by ( a ) studying the accidental exposures to a substance ( b ) in vitro studies using cells/ cell lines ( c ) in vivo exposure on experimental animals agency for toxic substances and disease registry whole effluent , aquatic toxicity testing faq toxmap environmental health e-maps from the united states national library of medicine toxseek : meta-search engine in toxicology and environmental health

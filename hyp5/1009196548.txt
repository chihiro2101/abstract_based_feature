the biological toxicity of pathogens can be difficult to measure because the '' threshold dose '' may be a single organism however , in a host with an intact immune system , the inherent toxicity of the organism is balanced by the host 's ability to fight back ; the effective toxicity is then a combination of both parts of the relationship physical toxicants are substances that , due to their physical nature , interfere with biological processes water can act as a physical toxicant if taken in extremely high doses because the concentration of vital ions decreases dramatically if there 's too much water in the body toxicity can be measured by its effects on the target ( organism , organ , tissue or cell ) because individuals typically have different levels of response to the same dose of a toxic substance , a population-level measure of toxicity is often used which relates the probabilities of an outcome for a given individual in a population it is more difficult to determine the toxicity of chemical mixtures than a pure chemical because each component displays its own toxicity , and components may interact to produce enhanced or diminished effects the preclinical toxicity testing on various biological systems reveals the species- , organ- and dose-specific toxic effects of an investigational product toxicity testing also helps calculate the no observed adverse effect level ( noael ) dose and is helpful for clinical studies

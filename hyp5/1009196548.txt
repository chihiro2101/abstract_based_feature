while some weakly radioactive substances , such as uranium , are also chemical toxicants , more strongly radioactive materials like radium are not , their harmful effects ( radiation poisoning ) being caused by the ionizing radiation produced by the substance rather than chemical interactions with the substance itself the biological toxicity of pathogens can be difficult to measure because the '' threshold dose '' may be a single organism however , in a host with an intact immune system , the inherent toxicity of the organism is balanced by the host 's ability to fight back ; the effective toxicity is then a combination of both parts of the relationship cholera , the disease is chiefly caused by a nonliving substance secreted by the organism , rather than the organism itself corrosive chemicals possess physical toxicity because they destroy tissues , but they 're not directly poisonous unless they interfere directly with biological activity water can act as a physical toxicant if taken in extremely high doses because the concentration of vital ions decreases dramatically if there 's too much water in the body toxicity can be measured by its effects on the target ( organism , organ , tissue or cell ) it is more difficult to determine the toxicity of chemical mixtures than a pure chemical because each component displays its own toxicity , and components may interact to produce enhanced or diminished effects the preclinical toxicity testing on various biological systems reveals the species- , organ- and dose-specific toxic effects of an investigational product

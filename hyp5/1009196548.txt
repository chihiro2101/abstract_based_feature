there are generally four types of toxic entities ; chemical , biological , physical and radiation : chemical toxicants include inorganic substances such as , lead , mercury , hydrofluoric acid , and chlorine gas , and organic compounds such as methanol , most medications , and toxins while some weakly radioactive substances , such as uranium , are also chemical toxicants , more strongly radioactive materials like radium are not , their harmful effects ( radiation poisoning ) being caused by the ionizing radiation produced by the substance rather than chemical interactions with the substance itself disease-causing microorganisms and parasites are toxic in a broad sense but are generally called pathogens rather than toxicants such nonliving biological toxicants are generally called toxins if produced by a microorganism , plant , or fungus , and venoms if produced by an animal toxicity can be measured by its effects on the target ( organism , organ , tissue or cell ) because individuals typically have different levels of response to the same dose of a toxic substance , a population-level measure of toxicity is often used which relates the probabilities of an outcome for a given individual in a population similarly , an extra protection factor may be used for individuals believed to be more susceptible to toxic effects such as in pregnancy or with certain diseases it is more difficult to determine the toxicity of chemical mixtures than a pure chemical because each component displays its own toxicity , and components may interact to produce enhanced or diminished effects the toxicity of substances can be observed by ( a ) studying the accidental exposures to a substance ( b ) in vitro studies using cells/ cell lines ( c ) in vivo exposure on experimental animals

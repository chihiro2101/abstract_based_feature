there are generally four types of toxic entities ; chemical , biological , physical and radiation : chemical toxicants include inorganic substances such as , lead , mercury , hydrofluoric acid , and chlorine gas , and organic compounds such as methanol , most medications , and toxins while some weakly radioactive substances , such as uranium , are also chemical toxicants , more strongly radioactive materials like radium are not , their harmful effects ( radiation poisoning ) being caused by the ionizing radiation produced by the substance rather than chemical interactions with the substance itself the biological toxicity of pathogens can be difficult to measure because the '' threshold dose '' may be a single organism however , in a host with an intact immune system , the inherent toxicity of the organism is balanced by the host 's ability to fight back ; the effective toxicity is then a combination of both parts of the relationship water can act as a physical toxicant if taken in extremely high doses because the concentration of vital ions decreases dramatically if there 's too much water in the body because individuals typically have different levels of response to the same dose of a toxic substance , a population-level measure of toxicity is often used which relates the probabilities of an outcome for a given individual in a population it is more difficult to determine the toxicity of chemical mixtures than a pure chemical because each component displays its own toxicity , and components may interact to produce enhanced or diminished effects the preclinical toxicity testing on various biological systems reveals the species- , organ- and dose-specific toxic effects of an investigational product agency for toxic substances and disease registry whole effluent , aquatic toxicity testing faq toxmap environmental health e-maps from the united states national library of medicine toxseek : meta-search engine in toxicology and environmental health

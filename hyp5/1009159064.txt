'' the name is thought to derive from the chinese word for silk , '' sī '' / sīnae was an ancient greek and roman name for some people who dwelt south of the seres ( serica ) in the eastern extremity of the inhabitable world references to the sinae include mention of a city that the romans called sēra mētropolis , which may be modern chang'an it is generally thought that chīna , sīna and thīna are variants that ultimately derived from qin , which was the westernmost state in china that eventually formed the qin dynasty there are however other opinions on its etymology ( see section on china above ) henry yule thought that this term may have come to europe through the arabs , who made the china of the farther east into sin , and perhaps sometimes into thin hence the thin of the author of the periplus of the erythraean sea , who appears to be the first extant writer to employ the name in this form ; hence also the sinæ and thinae of ptolemy marcian of heraclea ( a condenser of ptolemy ) tells us that the '' nations of the sinae lie at the extremity of the habitable world , and adjoin the eastern terra incognita '' the 6th century cosmas indicopleustes refers to a '' country of silk '' called tzinista , which is understood as referring to china , beyond which '' there is neither navigation nor any land to inhabit '' in english and in several other european languages , the name '' cathay '' was used in the translations of the adventures of marco polo , which used this word for northern china however , its use by turkic speakers within china , such as the uyghurs , is considered pejorative by the chinese authority who tried to ban it chinese , travelled officially to europe , but it is possible that some did , in unofficial capacities , at least in the 13th century while northern china was called cathay , southern china was referred to as mangi the word manzi reached the western world as mangi ( as used by marco polo ) , which is a name commonly found on medieval maps

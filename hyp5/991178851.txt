because of a malformed spine , malebranche received his elementary education from a private tutor he eventually left the sorbonne , having rejected scholasticism , and entered the oratory in 1660 there , he devoted himself to ecclesiastical history , linguistics , the bible , and the works of saint augustine in 1664 , malebranche first read descartes ' treatise on man , an account of the physiology of the human body in 1674–75 , malebranche published the two volumes of his first and most extensive philosophical work most importantly , in the third book , which discussed pure understanding , he defended a claim that the ideas through which we perceive objects exist in god malebranche 's first critic was the abbé simon foucher , who attacked the search even before its second volume had been published in the tenth elucidation , for instance , malebranche introduced his theory of '' intelligible extension '' , a single , archetypal idea of extension into which the ideas of all particular kinds of bodies could be jointly resolved malebranche expanded on this last point in 1680 when he published treatise on nature and grace over the next few years , the two men wrote enough polemics against one another to fill four volumes of malebranche 's collected works and three of arnauld 's 1638 - born in paris to nicolas malebranche and catherine de lauzon 1660 - ordained as a member of the french oratory but whereas descartes believed ideas are mental entities , malebranche argued that all ideas exist only in god these ideas , therefore , are uncreated and independent of finite minds when we access them intellectually , we apprehend objective truth malebranche divided these relations between ideas into two categories : relations of magnitude and relations of quality or perfection ethics , for malebranche , are therefore divine in their foundation , universal in their application , and to be discovered by intellectual contemplation , just as geometrical principles are with regard to this account of intellectual knowledge , malebranche was more or less following saint augustine the problem there is that the divine ideas are universal , whereas all perception seems to be of particulars to a different mind , one with a different sensation , the same idea could represent a different individual of the same general kind in the dialogues on metaphysics and religion ( dialogue 1 ) , malebranche added that the same basic structure can also account for ( the mental as opposed to the physiological element in ) imagination , in this case where the idea only '' lightly touches '' the mind malebranche was strongly influenced by descartes but did not accept his philosophy uncritically he is noted particularly for his view that we see all things in god and for his adoption of psycho-physical parallelism and 'occasionalism ' to deal with the problem of interaction between mind and body ( 1 ) if we see all things in god in the sense that he puts the ideas into our minds we can have no direct knowledge of the external world ( this may be a misrepresentation of malebranche 's view ; see the first chapter of the search for truth , where he specifies that while we can not but desire the good in general , we are free to apply that love to particulars , and can do so in a disordered fashion that leads to sin ) ( 3 ) in so far as god is not to be identified with the archetypal eternal truths in his mind , malebranche is not a pantheist although he conceded that god had the power to create a more perfect world , free from all defects , such a world would have necessitated a greater complexity in divine ways whereas malebranche followed augustine in his description of intellectual knowledge , in his approach to mind–body problems he began as a follower of descartes this leads theodore to declare that ' i am not my own light to myself ' ; the nature of our own minds is highly obscure what is more , with regard to psycho-physical interaction , malebranche argues that body could not act on mind , nor mind on body the only active power ( hence the only efficient cause of change in the world ) is god in note h to his '' zeno of elea '' article , bayle discussed malebranche 's views on material substance with particular approval in addition , berkeley agreed with malebranche , against descartes , that we could not achieve a clear idea of the mind itself the standard edition of malebranche 's works in french is the oeuvres complètes , ed

malebranche was born in paris in 1638 , the youngest child of nicolas malebranche , secretary to king louis xiii of france , and catherine de lauzon , sister of jean de lauson , a governor of new france he left home at the age of sixteen to pursue a course of philosophy at the collège de la marche , and subsequently to study theology at the collège de sorbonne , both colleges from the university of paris he eventually left the sorbonne , having rejected scholasticism , and entered the oratory in 1660 in 1664 , malebranche first read descartes ' treatise on man , an account of the physiology of the human body malebranche ’ s biographer , father yves andré reported that malebranche was influenced by descartes ’ book because it allowed him to view the natural world without aristotle scholasticism malebranche spent the next decade studying the cartesian system in which is treated the nature of the human mind and the use that must be made of it to avoid error in the sciences , the book laid the foundation for malebranche ’ s philosophical reputation and ideas most importantly , in the third book , which discussed pure understanding , he defended a claim that the ideas through which we perceive objects exist in god malebranche replied in a short preface added to that second volume , and then , in the 1678 third edition , he added 50 % to the already considerable size of the book with a sequence of ( eventually ) seventeen elucidations in the tenth elucidation , for instance , malebranche introduced his theory of '' intelligible extension '' , a single , archetypal idea of extension into which the ideas of all particular kinds of bodies could be jointly resolved here , he made it explicit that the generality of the laws whereby god regulated his behaviour extended not only to his activity in the natural world but also applied to his gift of grace to human beings the book was attacked by fellow cartesian philosopher antoine arnauld , and , although arnauld 's initial concerns were theological ones , the bitter dispute which ensued very quickly branched out into most other areas of their respective systems over the next few years , the two men wrote enough polemics against one another to fill four volumes of malebranche 's collected works and three of arnauld 's arnauld 's supporters managed to persuade the roman catholic church to place nature and grace on its index of prohibited books in 1690 , and it was followed there by the search nineteen years later ( ironically , the index already contained several works by the jansenist arnauld himself ) other critics with whom malebranche entered into significant discussion include another fellow cartesian , pierre sylvain regis , as well as dortous de mairan de mairan was sympathetic to the views of baruch spinoza , and felt that he had found similar views in his reading of malebranche : malebranche assiduously resisted such an association 1664 - first reads descartes ' treatise on man and spends the next ten years studying philosophy like rené descartes , malebranche held that humans attain knowledge through ideas – immaterial representations present to the mind but whereas descartes believed ideas are mental entities , malebranche argued that all ideas exist only in god malebranche defined '' truth '' as a relation between ideas : since these ideas are in god , they are eternal and immutable , and consequently the only truths worthy of the name will themselves be eternal and immutable malebranche divided these relations between ideas into two categories : relations of magnitude and relations of quality or perfection with regard to this account of intellectual knowledge , malebranche was more or less following saint augustine his great innovation was to explain how these same divine ideas could also serve as the immediate objects of human minds in sensual perception malebranche 's solution was to suggest that , whereas the mind 's intellectual conception of these ideas is pure and direct , its sensual perception of them will be modified by '' sensations '' the latter will limit the mind 's apprehension of the former in such a manner as to make it represent a particular individual to that mind in the dialogues on metaphysics and religion ( dialogue 1 ) , malebranche added that the same basic structure can also account for ( the mental as opposed to the physiological element in ) imagination , in this case where the idea only '' lightly touches '' the mind he is noted particularly for his view that we see all things in god and for his adoption of psycho-physical parallelism and 'occasionalism ' to deal with the problem of interaction between mind and body we can appeal to clear and distinct ideas as a criterion for the veridicality of judgements about physical things , but it is god who is ultimately responsible for our ideas ( this may be a misrepresentation of malebranche 's view ; see the first chapter of the search for truth , where he specifies that while we can not but desire the good in general , we are free to apply that love to particulars , and can do so in a disordered fashion that leads to sin whereas malebranche followed augustine in his description of intellectual knowledge , in his approach to mind–body problems he began as a follower of descartes when malebranche revised his 1699 paper for inclusion as the sixteenth elucidation of the 1712 edition of the search after truth , he inserted a number of references to '' newton 's excellent work '' john locke had also argued for this , but he had made no distinction between minds and bodies on this point , whereas both berkeley and malebranche maintained ( each in his own way ) that we could have ideas of bodies but not of minds gottfried leibniz ( who met malebranche in paris in about 1675 and corresponded with him thereafter ) also rejected the vision in god , and his theory of pre-established harmony was designed as a new alternative to occasionalism as well as to the more traditional theory of efficient causal interaction

malebranche was born in paris in 1638 , the youngest child of nicolas malebranche , secretary to king louis xiii of france , and catherine de lauzon , sister of jean de lauson , a governor of new france in 1664 , malebranche first read descartes ' treatise on man , an account of the physiology of the human body malebranche ’ s biographer , father yves andré reported that malebranche was influenced by descartes ’ book because it allowed him to view the natural world without aristotle scholasticism in 1674–75 , malebranche published the two volumes of his first and most extensive philosophical work in which is treated the nature of the human mind and the use that must be made of it to avoid error in the sciences , the book laid the foundation for malebranche ’ s philosophical reputation and ideas malebranche 's first critic was the abbé simon foucher , who attacked the search even before its second volume had been published malebranche replied in a short preface added to that second volume , and then , in the 1678 third edition , he added 50 % to the already considerable size of the book with a sequence of ( eventually ) seventeen elucidations in the tenth elucidation , for instance , malebranche introduced his theory of '' intelligible extension '' , a single , archetypal idea of extension into which the ideas of all particular kinds of bodies could be jointly resolved in others , malebranche placed a greater emphasis than he had previously done on his occasionalist account of causation , and particularly on his contention that god acted for the most part through '' general volitions '' and only rarely , as in the case of miracles , through '' particular volitions '' malebranche expanded on this last point in 1680 when he published treatise on nature and grace here , he made it explicit that the generality of the laws whereby god regulated his behaviour extended not only to his activity in the natural world but also applied to his gift of grace to human beings arnauld 's supporters managed to persuade the roman catholic church to place nature and grace on its index of prohibited books in 1690 , and it was followed there by the search nineteen years later ) other critics with whom malebranche entered into significant discussion include another fellow cartesian , pierre sylvain regis , as well as dortous de mairan de mairan was sympathetic to the views of baruch spinoza , and felt that he had found similar views in his reading of malebranche : malebranche assiduously resisted such an association 1638 - born in paris to nicolas malebranche and catherine de lauzon 1654 - enters the collège de la marche and later the sorbonne to study philosophy and theology like rené descartes , malebranche held that humans attain knowledge through ideas – immaterial representations present to the mind with regard to this account of intellectual knowledge , malebranche was more or less following saint augustine his great innovation was to explain how these same divine ideas could also serve as the immediate objects of human minds in sensual perception malebranche 's solution was to suggest that , whereas the mind 's intellectual conception of these ideas is pure and direct , its sensual perception of them will be modified by '' sensations '' these sensations , unlike the ideas , are indeed proper to individual created minds , and subsist as modes thereof to a different mind , one with a different sensation , the same idea could represent a different individual of the same general kind he is noted particularly for his view that we see all things in god and for his adoption of psycho-physical parallelism and 'occasionalism ' to deal with the problem of interaction between mind and body we can appeal to clear and distinct ideas as a criterion for the veridicality of judgements about physical things , but it is god who is ultimately responsible for our ideas ( 2 ) if all things are under the direct control of god , subject to his will , what of human freedom ? malebranche 's view that we have freedom to choose but only in relation to finite goods is not convincing , denying as it does the possibility of resistance of movement towards god as the universal good whereas malebranche followed augustine in his description of intellectual knowledge , in his approach to mind–body problems he began as a follower of descartes what is more , with regard to psycho-physical interaction , malebranche argues that body could not act on mind , nor mind on body the only active power ( hence the only efficient cause of change in the world ) is god that relation has some features of the causal relation ( it satisfies , for example , universal conditionals of the form '' whenever c occurs , e occurs '' ) although better known for his philosophical work , malebranche made some notable contributions to physics , working within a broadly cartesian framework but nevertheless prepared to depart from descartes where necessary his theory was presented as a corrective to descartes ' view , rather than a refutation thereof , but it has important parallels with the rival optical theory of isaac newton newton had already developed his position some thirty years earlier , but malebranche probably would not have been aware of it until it was finally published in the opticks of 1704 , or , more likely , in its latin translation of 1706 in addition , malebranche wrote on the laws of motion , a topic he discussed extensively with leibniz descartes had also maintained that matter was not directly perceivable , but he had argued that the veracity of god could support a proof of its certain existence

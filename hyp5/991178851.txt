malebranche was born in paris in 1638 , the youngest child of nicolas malebranche , secretary to king louis xiii of france , and catherine de lauzon , sister of jean de lauson , a governor of new france there , he devoted himself to ecclesiastical history , linguistics , the bible , and the works of saint augustine malebranche was ordained a priest in 1664 in 1664 , malebranche first read descartes ' treatise on man , an account of the physiology of the human body malebranche ’ s biographer , father yves andré reported that malebranche was influenced by descartes ’ book because it allowed him to view the natural world without aristotle scholasticism in 1674–75 , malebranche published the two volumes of his first and most extensive philosophical work in which is treated the nature of the human mind and the use that must be made of it to avoid error in the sciences , the book laid the foundation for malebranche ’ s philosophical reputation and ideas most importantly , in the third book , which discussed pure understanding , he defended a claim that the ideas through which we perceive objects exist in god malebranche 's first critic was the abbé simon foucher , who attacked the search even before its second volume had been published in others , malebranche placed a greater emphasis than he had previously done on his occasionalist account of causation , and particularly on his contention that god acted for the most part through '' general volitions '' and only rarely , as in the case of miracles , through '' particular volitions '' malebranche expanded on this last point in 1680 when he published treatise on nature and grace here , he made it explicit that the generality of the laws whereby god regulated his behaviour extended not only to his activity in the natural world but also applied to his gift of grace to human beings over the next few years , the two men wrote enough polemics against one another to fill four volumes of malebranche 's collected works and three of arnauld 's ) other critics with whom malebranche entered into significant discussion include another fellow cartesian , pierre sylvain regis , as well as dortous de mairan de mairan was sympathetic to the views of baruch spinoza , and felt that he had found similar views in his reading of malebranche : malebranche assiduously resisted such an association like rené descartes , malebranche held that humans attain knowledge through ideas – immaterial representations present to the mind malebranche defined '' truth '' as a relation between ideas : since these ideas are in god , they are eternal and immutable , and consequently the only truths worthy of the name will themselves be eternal and immutable with regard to this account of intellectual knowledge , malebranche was more or less following saint augustine he is noted particularly for his view that we see all things in god and for his adoption of psycho-physical parallelism and 'occasionalism ' to deal with the problem of interaction between mind and body ( 1 ) if we see all things in god in the sense that he puts the ideas into our minds we can have no direct knowledge of the external world we can appeal to clear and distinct ideas as a criterion for the veridicality of judgements about physical things , but it is god who is ultimately responsible for our ideas ( this may be a misrepresentation of malebranche 's view ; see the first chapter of the search for truth , where he specifies that while we can not but desire the good in general , we are free to apply that love to particulars , and can do so in a disordered fashion that leads to sin ) ( 3 ) in so far as god is not to be identified with the archetypal eternal truths in his mind , malebranche is not a pantheist but in contrast to descartes , who considered it possible to form a clear and distinct idea of the mind , malebranche argues in the dialogues on metaphysics , a dialogue between theodore and aristes , that we do not have a complete conception of the powers of the mind , and thus no clear conception of the nature of the mind what is more , with regard to psycho-physical interaction , malebranche argues that body could not act on mind , nor mind on body malebranche 's doctrine , which could be found in contemporary commentaries on aristotle , and which first appeared in certain arab philosophers , is therefore called '' occasionalism '' newton had already developed his position some thirty years earlier , but malebranche probably would not have been aware of it until it was finally published in the opticks of 1704 , or , more likely , in its latin translation of 1706 when malebranche revised his 1699 paper for inclusion as the sixteenth elucidation of the 1712 edition of the search after truth , he inserted a number of references to '' newton 's excellent work '' malebranche also developed an original theory related to preformationism , postulating that each embryo probably contained even smaller embryos ad infinitum , like an idealized matryoshka doll according to malebranche , '' an infinite series of plants and animals were contained within the seed or the egg , but only naturalists with sufficient skill and experience could detect their presence '' ( magner 158–9 ) aside , perhaps , from john norris ( who , in any case , drew at least as much from malebranche 's own sources , primarily saint augustine , as he did from malebranche himself ) , there are few if any philosophers who can be considered faithful followers of malebranche in all matters he was , however , held in widespread high regard within his own lifetime and for some time afterwards , and the influence of certain of his ideas can be discerned in the works of several important figures however , in his own theodicy , even if it was somewhat more elaborate than malebranche 's , he did at least agree with malebranche 's fundamental contention that the simplicity of god 's ways had to be given as much regard as the world 's perfection the standard edition of malebranche 's works in french is the oeuvres complètes , ed

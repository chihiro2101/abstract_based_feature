malebranche was born in paris in 1638 , the youngest child of nicolas malebranche , secretary to king louis xiii of france , and catherine de lauzon , sister of jean de lauson , a governor of new france in 1664 , malebranche first read descartes ' treatise on man , an account of the physiology of the human body malebranche ’ s biographer , father yves andré reported that malebranche was influenced by descartes ’ book because it allowed him to view the natural world without aristotle scholasticism in which is treated the nature of the human mind and the use that must be made of it to avoid error in the sciences , the book laid the foundation for malebranche ’ s philosophical reputation and ideas most importantly , in the third book , which discussed pure understanding , he defended a claim that the ideas through which we perceive objects exist in god malebranche 's first critic was the abbé simon foucher , who attacked the search even before its second volume had been published malebranche replied in a short preface added to that second volume , and then , in the 1678 third edition , he added 50 % to the already considerable size of the book with a sequence of ( eventually ) seventeen elucidations in the tenth elucidation , for instance , malebranche introduced his theory of '' intelligible extension '' , a single , archetypal idea of extension into which the ideas of all particular kinds of bodies could be jointly resolved malebranche expanded on this last point in 1680 when he published treatise on nature and grace here , he made it explicit that the generality of the laws whereby god regulated his behaviour extended not only to his activity in the natural world but also applied to his gift of grace to human beings arnauld 's supporters managed to persuade the roman catholic church to place nature and grace on its index of prohibited books in 1690 , and it was followed there by the search nineteen years later de mairan was sympathetic to the views of baruch spinoza , and felt that he had found similar views in his reading of malebranche : malebranche assiduously resisted such an association 1654 - enters the collège de la marche and later the sorbonne to study philosophy and theology 1713–14 - correspondence with jean-jacques d'ortous de mairan on spinozism just as all human action ( along with the action of any other creature ) is entirely dependent on god , so too is all human cognition malebranche argued that human knowledge is dependent on divine understanding in a way analogous to that in which the motion of bodies is dependent on divine will like rené descartes , malebranche held that humans attain knowledge through ideas – immaterial representations present to the mind but whereas descartes believed ideas are mental entities , malebranche argued that all ideas exist only in god malebranche defined '' truth '' as a relation between ideas : since these ideas are in god , they are eternal and immutable , and consequently the only truths worthy of the name will themselves be eternal and immutable malebranche divided these relations between ideas into two categories : relations of magnitude and relations of quality or perfection with regard to this account of intellectual knowledge , malebranche was more or less following saint augustine malebranche 's solution was to suggest that , whereas the mind 's intellectual conception of these ideas is pure and direct , its sensual perception of them will be modified by '' sensations '' the idea will represent only the geometrical or mechanical properties of bodies ( size , shape , motion ) , while the sensation will consist in colour or some other sensible quality the latter will limit the mind 's apprehension of the former in such a manner as to make it represent a particular individual to that mind to a different mind , one with a different sensation , the same idea could represent a different individual of the same general kind in the dialogues on metaphysics and religion ( dialogue 1 ) , malebranche added that the same basic structure can also account for ( the mental as opposed to the physiological element in ) imagination , in this case where the idea only '' lightly touches '' the mind whereas malebranche followed augustine in his description of intellectual knowledge , in his approach to mind–body problems he began as a follower of descartes but in contrast to descartes , who considered it possible to form a clear and distinct idea of the mind , malebranche argues in the dialogues on metaphysics , a dialogue between theodore and aristes , that we do not have a complete conception of the powers of the mind , and thus no clear conception of the nature of the mind what is more , with regard to psycho-physical interaction , malebranche argues that body could not act on mind , nor mind on body malebranche 's doctrine , which could be found in contemporary commentaries on aristotle , and which first appeared in certain arab philosophers , is therefore called '' occasionalism '' aside , perhaps , from john norris ( who , in any case , drew at least as much from malebranche 's own sources , primarily saint augustine , as he did from malebranche himself ) , there are few if any philosophers who can be considered faithful followers of malebranche in all matters however , in his own theodicy , even if it was somewhat more elaborate than malebranche 's , he did at least agree with malebranche 's fundamental contention that the simplicity of god 's ways had to be given as much regard as the world 's perfection hume 's empiricist epistemology led him to distrust malebranche 's confidence in discovering abstruse metaphysics truths through an intellectual union with god correspondence with dortous de mairan , in malebranche 's first and last critics , tr

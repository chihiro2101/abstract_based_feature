malebranche was born in paris in 1638 , the youngest child of nicolas malebranche , secretary to king louis xiii of france , and catherine de lauzon , sister of jean de lauson , a governor of new france he left home at the age of sixteen to pursue a course of philosophy at the collège de la marche , and subsequently to study theology at the collège de sorbonne , both colleges from the university of paris there , he devoted himself to ecclesiastical history , linguistics , the bible , and the works of saint augustine in 1664 , malebranche first read descartes ' treatise on man , an account of the physiology of the human body malebranche ’ s biographer , father yves andré reported that malebranche was influenced by descartes ’ book because it allowed him to view the natural world without aristotle scholasticism in 1674–75 , malebranche published the two volumes of his first and most extensive philosophical work in which is treated the nature of the human mind and the use that must be made of it to avoid error in the sciences , the book laid the foundation for malebranche ’ s philosophical reputation and ideas malebranche 's first critic was the abbé simon foucher , who attacked the search even before its second volume had been published malebranche replied in a short preface added to that second volume , and then , in the 1678 third edition , he added 50 % to the already considerable size of the book with a sequence of ( eventually ) seventeen elucidations in the tenth elucidation , for instance , malebranche introduced his theory of '' intelligible extension '' , a single , archetypal idea of extension into which the ideas of all particular kinds of bodies could be jointly resolved malebranche expanded on this last point in 1680 when he published treatise on nature and grace the book was attacked by fellow cartesian philosopher antoine arnauld , and , although arnauld 's initial concerns were theological ones , the bitter dispute which ensued very quickly branched out into most other areas of their respective systems over the next few years , the two men wrote enough polemics against one another to fill four volumes of malebranche 's collected works and three of arnauld 's ) other critics with whom malebranche entered into significant discussion include another fellow cartesian , pierre sylvain regis , as well as dortous de mairan de mairan was sympathetic to the views of baruch spinoza , and felt that he had found similar views in his reading of malebranche : malebranche assiduously resisted such an association 1638 - born in paris to nicolas malebranche and catherine de lauzon 1664 - first reads descartes ' treatise on man and spends the next ten years studying philosophy like rené descartes , malebranche held that humans attain knowledge through ideas – immaterial representations present to the mind but whereas descartes believed ideas are mental entities , malebranche argued that all ideas exist only in god malebranche defined '' truth '' as a relation between ideas : since these ideas are in god , they are eternal and immutable , and consequently the only truths worthy of the name will themselves be eternal and immutable these sensations , unlike the ideas , are indeed proper to individual created minds , and subsist as modes thereof the latter will limit the mind 's apprehension of the former in such a manner as to make it represent a particular individual to that mind to a different mind , one with a different sensation , the same idea could represent a different individual of the same general kind malebranche was strongly influenced by descartes but did not accept his philosophy uncritically we can appeal to clear and distinct ideas as a criterion for the veridicality of judgements about physical things , but it is god who is ultimately responsible for our ideas ) ( 3 ) in so far as god is not to be identified with the archetypal eternal truths in his mind , malebranche is not a pantheist what is more , with regard to psycho-physical interaction , malebranche argues that body could not act on mind , nor mind on body when i will that my arm should rise , my volition is the '' occasion '' or the '' occasional cause '' of the movement of my arm ; the efficient cause of both my volition and the movement of my arm is god malebranche 's doctrine , which could be found in contemporary commentaries on aristotle , and which first appeared in certain arab philosophers , is therefore called '' occasionalism '' that relation has some features of the causal relation ( it satisfies , for example , universal conditionals of the form '' whenever c occurs , e occurs '' ) aside , perhaps , from john norris ( who , in any case , drew at least as much from malebranche 's own sources , primarily saint augustine , as he did from malebranche himself ) , there are few if any philosophers who can be considered faithful followers of malebranche in all matters in addition , berkeley agreed with malebranche , against descartes , that we could not achieve a clear idea of the mind itself with regard to this second half of malebranche 's occasionalism , hume wrote : : we are got into fairy land , long ere we have reached the last steps of our theory the standard edition of malebranche 's works in french is the oeuvres complètes , ed

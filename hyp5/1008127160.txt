heat is defined in physics as the transfer of thermal energy across a well-defined boundary around a thermodynamic system enthalpy is a thermodynamic potential , designated by the letter '' h '' , that is the sum of the internal energy of the system ( u ) plus the product of pressure ( p ) and volume ( v ) joule is a unit to quantify energy , work , or the amount of heat heat transfer is a process function ( or path function ) , as opposed to functions of state ; therefore , the amount of heat transferred in a thermodynamic process that changes the state of a system depends on how that process occurs , not only the net difference between the initial and final states of the process thermodynamic and mechanical heat transfer is calculated with the heat transfer coefficient , the proportionality between the heat flux and the thermodynamic driving force for the flow of heat heat flux is a quantitative , vectorial representation of heat-flow through a surface in engineering contexts , the term heat is taken as synonymous to thermal energy this usage has its origin in the historical interpretation of heat as a fluid ( caloric ) that can be transferred by various causes , and that is also common in the language of laymen and everyday life thermal engineering concerns the generation , use , conversion , and exchange of heat transfer as such , heat transfer is involved in almost every sector of the economy heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms , such as thermal conduction , thermal convection , thermal radiation , and transfer of energy by phase changes the fundamental modes of heat transfer are : ; advection : advection is the transport mechanism of a fluid from one location to another , and is dependent on motion and momentum of that fluid ; conduction or diffusion : the transfer of energy between objects that are in physical contact thermal conductivity is the property of a material to conduct heat and evaluated primarily in terms of fourier 's law for heat conduction ; convection : the transfer of energy between an object and its environment , due to fluid motion the average temperature is a reference for evaluating properties related to convective heat transfer ; radiation : the transfer of energy by the emission of electromagnetic radiation by transferring matter , energy—including thermal energy—is moved by the physical transfer of a hot or cold object from one place to another this can be as simple as placing hot water in a bottle and heating a bed , or the movement of an iceberg in changing ocean currents in other words , heat is transferred by conduction when adjacent atoms vibrate against one another , or as electrons move from one atom to another conduction is the most significant means of heat transfer within a solid or between solid objects in thermal contact in steady state conduction , the amount of heat entering a section is equal to amount of heat coming out , since the change in temperature ( a measure of heat energy ) is zero the flow of fluid may be forced by external processes , or sometimes ( in gravitational fields ) by buoyancy forces caused when thermal energy expands the fluid ( for example in a fire plume ) , thus influencing its own transfer all convective processes also move heat partly by diffusion , as well convective heat transfer , or convection , is the transfer of heat from one place to another by the movement of fluids , a process that is essentially the transfer of heat via mass transfer in the case of heat transfer in fluids , where transport by advection in a fluid is always also accompanied by transport via heat diffusion ( also known as heat conduction ) the process of heat convection is understood to refer to the sum of heat transport by advection and diffusion/conduction in a body of fluid that is heated from underneath its container , conduction and convection can be considered to compete for dominance thermal radiation is energy emitted by matter as electromagnetic waves , due to the pool of thermal energy in all matter with a temperature above absolute zero phase transition or phase change , takes place in a thermodynamic system from one phase or state of matter to another one by heat transfer the mason equation explains the growth of a water droplet based on the effects of heat transport on evaporation and condensation at standard atmospheric pressure and low temperatures , no boiling occurs and the heat transfer rate is controlled by the usual single-phase mechanisms as the surface temperature is increased , local boiling occurs and vapor bubbles nucleate , grow into the surrounding cooler fluid , and collapse heat fluxes across the stable vapor layers are low , but rise slowly with temperature any contact between fluid and the surface that may be seen probably leads to the extremely rapid nucleation of a fresh vapor layer ( '' spontaneous nucleation '' ) dropwise condensation is when liquid drops are formed on the subcooled surface , and usually occurs when the liquid does not wet the surface : dropwise condensation is difficult to sustain reliably ; therefore , industrial equipment is normally designed to operate in filmwise condensation mode melting is a thermal process that results in the phase transition of a substance from a solid to a liquid this is a method of approximation that reduces one aspect of the transient conduction system—that within the object—to an equivalent steady state system for small biot numbers , the approximation of spatially uniform temperature within the object can be used : it can be presumed that heat transferred into the object has time to uniformly distribute itself , due to the lower resistance to doing so , as compared with the resistance to heat entering the object the internal-combustion engine and the gas turbine are examples of such devices , and calling these heat engines is an acceptable use of the term for heat transfer from the outer surface of the body , the convection mechanism is dependent on the surface area of the body , the velocity of the air , and the temperature gradient between the surface of the skin and the ambient air blood flowing through blood vessels acts as a convective fluid and helps to prevent any buildup of excess heat inside the tissues of the body when the core temperature of the body increases , the body triggers sweat glands in the skin to bring additional moisture to the surface of the skin latent heat describes the amount of heat that is needed to evaporate the liquid ; this heat comes from the liquid itself and the surrounding gas and surfaces magnetic evaporative cooling is a process for lowering the temperature of a group of atoms , after pre-cooled by methods such as laser cooling aspects of heat transfer , cambridge university thermal-fluids central energy2d : interactive heat transfer simulations for everyone

heat is defined in physics as the transfer of thermal energy across a well-defined boundary around a thermodynamic system enthalpy is a thermodynamic potential , designated by the letter '' h '' , that is the sum of the internal energy of the system ( u ) plus the product of pressure ( p ) and volume ( v ) thermodynamic and mechanical heat transfer is calculated with the heat transfer coefficient , the proportionality between the heat flux and the thermodynamic driving force for the flow of heat in engineering contexts , the term heat is taken as synonymous to thermal energy this usage has its origin in the historical interpretation of heat as a fluid ( caloric ) that can be transferred by various causes , and that is also common in the language of laymen and everyday life thermal engineering concerns the generation , use , conversion , and exchange of heat transfer heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms , such as thermal conduction , thermal convection , thermal radiation , and transfer of energy by phase changes the fundamental modes of heat transfer are : ; advection : advection is the transport mechanism of a fluid from one location to another , and is dependent on motion and momentum of that fluid ; conduction or diffusion : the transfer of energy between objects that are in physical contact thermal conductivity is the property of a material to conduct heat and evaluated primarily in terms of fourier 's law for heat conduction ; convection : the transfer of energy between an object and its environment , due to fluid motion by transferring matter , energy—including thermal energy—is moved by the physical transfer of a hot or cold object from one place to another this can be as simple as placing hot water in a bottle and heating a bed , or the movement of an iceberg in changing ocean currents in other words , heat is transferred by conduction when adjacent atoms vibrate against one another , or as electrons move from one atom to another in steady state conduction , the amount of heat entering a section is equal to amount of heat coming out , since the change in temperature ( a measure of heat energy ) is zero transient conduction ( see heat equation ) occurs when the temperature within an object changes as a function of time analysis of transient systems is more complex , and analytic solutions of the heat equation are only valid for idealized model systems the flow of fluid may be forced by external processes , or sometimes ( in gravitational fields ) by buoyancy forces caused when thermal energy expands the fluid ( for example in a fire plume ) , thus influencing its own transfer convective heat transfer , or convection , is the transfer of heat from one place to another by the movement of fluids , a process that is essentially the transfer of heat via mass transfer bulk motion of fluid enhances heat transfer in many physical situations , such as ( for example ) between a solid surface and the fluid convection is usually the dominant form of heat transfer in liquids and gases although sometimes discussed as a third method of heat transfer , convection is usually used to describe the combined effects of heat conduction within the fluid ( diffusion ) and heat transference by bulk fluid flow streaming in the case of heat transfer in fluids , where transport by advection in a fluid is always also accompanied by transport via heat diffusion ( also known as heat conduction ) the process of heat convection is understood to refer to the sum of heat transport by advection and diffusion/conduction free , or natural , convection occurs when bulk fluid motions ( streams and currents ) are caused by buoyancy forces that result from density variations due to variations of temperature in the fluid thermal radiation occurs through a vacuum or any transparent medium ( solid or fluid or gas ) it is the transfer of energy by means of photons in electromagnetic waves governed by the same laws thermal radiation is energy emitted by matter as electromagnetic waves , due to the pool of thermal energy in all matter with a temperature above absolute zero coming from a source much smaller than its distance – can be concentrated in a small spot by using reflecting mirrors , which is exploited in concentrating solar power generation or a burning glass the reachable temperature at the target is limited by the temperature of the hot source of radiation ) the ( on its surface ) somewhat 4000 k hot sun allows to reach coarsly 3000 k ( or 3000 & nbsp ;

therefore , industrial equipment is normally designed to operate in filmwise condensation mode molten substances generally have reduced viscosity with elevated temperature ; an exception to this maxim is the element sulfur , whose viscosity increases to a point due to polymerization and then decreases with higher temperatures in its molten state the heat equation is an important partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat ( or variation in temperature ) in a given region over time in this method , the ratio of the conductive heat resistance within the object to the convective heat transfer resistance across the object 's boundary , known as the biot number , is calculated a thermal diode or thermal rectifier is a device that causes heat to flow preferentially in one direction the principles of heat transfer in engineering systems can be applied to the human body in order to determine how the body transfers heat the body must then use additional methods to remove the additional heat produced in order to keep the internal temperature at a healthy level '' smart fibres , fabrics , and clothing '' , woodhead publishing , 2001 this thermal resistance causes the temperature on the surface of the clothing to be less than the temperature on the surface of the skin latent heat describes the amount of heat that is needed to evaporate the liquid ; this heat comes from the liquid itself and the surrounding gas and surfaces thermal energy storage includes technologies for collecting and energy storage for later use aspects of heat transfer , cambridge university thermal-fluids central energy2d : interactive heat transfer simulations for everyone

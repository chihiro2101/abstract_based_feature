heat is defined in physics as the transfer of thermal energy across a well-defined boundary around a thermodynamic system enthalpy is a thermodynamic potential , designated by the letter '' h '' , that is the sum of the internal energy of the system ( u ) plus the product of pressure ( p ) and volume ( v ) joule is a unit to quantify energy , work , or the amount of heat thermodynamic and mechanical heat transfer is calculated with the heat transfer coefficient , the proportionality between the heat flux and the thermodynamic driving force for the flow of heat in engineering contexts , the term heat is taken as synonymous to thermal energy this usage has its origin in the historical interpretation of heat as a fluid ( caloric ) that can be transferred by various causes , and that is also common in the language of laymen and everyday life thermal engineering concerns the generation , use , conversion , and exchange of heat transfer heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms , such as thermal conduction , thermal convection , thermal radiation , and transfer of energy by phase changes the fundamental modes of heat transfer are : ; advection : advection is the transport mechanism of a fluid from one location to another , and is dependent on motion and momentum of that fluid ; conduction or diffusion : the transfer of energy between objects that are in physical contact thermal conductivity is the property of a material to conduct heat and evaluated primarily in terms of fourier 's law for heat conduction ; convection : the transfer of energy between an object and its environment , due to fluid motion ; radiation : the transfer of energy by the emission of electromagnetic radiation on a microscopic scale , heat conduction occurs as hot , rapidly moving or vibrating atoms and molecules interact with neighboring atoms and molecules , transferring some of their energy ( heat ) to these neighboring particles conduction is the most significant means of heat transfer within a solid or between solid objects in thermal contact in steady state conduction , the amount of heat entering a section is equal to amount of heat coming out , since the change in temperature ( a measure of heat energy ) is zero transient conduction ( see heat equation ) occurs when the temperature within an object changes as a function of time analysis of transient systems is more complex , and analytic solutions of the heat equation are only valid for idealized model systems the flow of fluid may be forced by external processes , or sometimes ( in gravitational fields ) by buoyancy forces caused when thermal energy expands the fluid ( for example in a fire plume ) , thus influencing its own transfer the latter process is often called '' natural convection '' all convective processes also move heat partly by diffusion , as well convective heat transfer , or convection , is the transfer of heat from one place to another by the movement of fluids , a process that is essentially the transfer of heat via mass transfer although sometimes discussed as a third method of heat transfer , convection is usually used to describe the combined effects of heat conduction within the fluid ( diffusion ) and heat transference by bulk fluid flow streaming in the case of heat transfer in fluids , where transport by advection in a fluid is always also accompanied by transport via heat diffusion ( also known as heat conduction ) the process of heat convection is understood to refer to the sum of heat transport by advection and diffusion/conduction if heat conduction is too great , fluid moving down by convection is heated by conduction so fast that its downward movement will be stopped due to its buoyancy , while fluid moving up by convection is cooled by conduction so fast that its driving buoyancy will diminish it is a measure which determines the relative strength of conduction and convection convection occurs when the rayleigh number is above 1,000â€“2,000 thermal radiation occurs through a vacuum or any transparent medium ( solid or fluid or gas ) it is the transfer of energy by means of photons in electromagnetic waves governed by the same laws thermal radiation is energy emitted by matter as electromagnetic waves , due to the pool of thermal energy in all matter with a temperature above absolute zero thermal radiation propagates without the presence of matter through the vacuum of space the reachable temperature at the target is limited by the temperature of the hot source of radiation phase transition or phase change , takes place in a thermodynamic system from one phase or state of matter to another one by heat transfer any contact between fluid and the surface that may be seen probably leads to the extremely rapid nucleation of a fresh vapor layer ( '' spontaneous nucleation '' ) at higher temperatures still , a maximum in the heat flux is reached ( the critical heat flux , or chf ) the leidenfrost effect demonstrates how nucleate boiling slows heat transfer due to gas bubbles on the heater 's surface as mentioned , gas-phase thermal conductivity is much lower than liquid-phase thermal conductivity , so the outcome is a kind of '' gas thermal barrier '' condensation occurs when a vapor is cooled and changes its phase to a liquid the amount of the heat is the same as that absorbed during vaporization at the same fluid pressure system analysis by the lumped capacitance model is a common approximation in transient conduction that may be used whenever heat conduction within an object is much faster than heat conduction across the boundary of the object in this method , the ratio of the conductive heat resistance within the object to the convective heat transfer resistance across the object 's boundary , known as the biot number , is calculated climate models study the thermal radiation by using quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere , oceans , land surface , and ice radiant barriers are materials that reflect radiation , and therefore reduce the flow of heat from radiation sources the principles of heat transfer in engineering systems can be applied to the human body in order to determine how the body transfers heat for heat transfer from the outer surface of the body , the convection mechanism is dependent on the surface area of the body , the velocity of the air , and the temperature gradient between the surface of the skin and the ambient air hyperphysics article on heat transfer - overview interseasonal heat transfer - a practical

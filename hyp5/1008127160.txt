heat is defined in physics as the transfer of thermal energy across a well-defined boundary around a thermodynamic system thermodynamic and mechanical heat transfer is calculated with the heat transfer coefficient , the proportionality between the heat flux and the thermodynamic driving force for the flow of heat heat flux is a quantitative , vectorial representation of heat-flow through a surface in engineering contexts , the term heat is taken as synonymous to thermal energy this usage has its origin in the historical interpretation of heat as a fluid ( caloric ) that can be transferred by various causes , and that is also common in the language of laymen and everyday life the transport equations for thermal energy ( fourier 's law ) , mechanical momentum ( newtonian fluid ) , and mass transfer ( fick 's laws of diffusion ) are similar , and analogies among these three transport processes have been developed to facilitate prediction of conversion from any one to the others thermal engineering concerns the generation , use , conversion , and exchange of heat transfer as such , heat transfer is involved in almost every sector of the economy heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms , such as thermal conduction , thermal convection , thermal radiation , and transfer of energy by phase changes the fundamental modes of heat transfer are : ; advection : advection is the transport mechanism of a fluid from one location to another , and is dependent on motion and momentum of that fluid ; conduction or diffusion : the transfer of energy between objects that are in physical contact thermal conductivity is the property of a material to conduct heat and evaluated primarily in terms of fourier 's law for heat conduction ; convection : the transfer of energy between an object and its environment , due to fluid motion by transferring matter , energy—including thermal energy—is moved by the physical transfer of a hot or cold object from one place to another on a microscopic scale , heat conduction occurs as hot , rapidly moving or vibrating atoms and molecules interact with neighboring atoms and molecules , transferring some of their energy ( heat ) to these neighboring particles conduction is the most significant means of heat transfer within a solid or between solid objects in thermal contact in steady state conduction , the amount of heat entering a section is equal to amount of heat coming out , since the change in temperature ( a measure of heat energy ) is zero analysis of transient systems is more complex , and analytic solutions of the heat equation are only valid for idealized model systems bulk motion of fluid enhances heat transfer in many physical situations , such as ( for example ) between a solid surface and the fluid convection is usually the dominant form of heat transfer in liquids and gases although sometimes discussed as a third method of heat transfer , convection is usually used to describe the combined effects of heat conduction within the fluid ( diffusion ) and heat transference by bulk fluid flow streaming in a body of fluid that is heated from underneath its container , conduction and convection can be considered to compete for dominance if heat conduction is too great , fluid moving down by convection is heated by conduction so fast that its downward movement will be stopped due to its buoyancy , while fluid moving up by convection is cooled by conduction so fast that its driving buoyancy will diminish on the other hand , if heat conduction is very low , a large temperature gradient may be formed and convection might be very strong convection occurs when the rayleigh number is above 1,000–2,000 thermal radiation occurs through a vacuum or any transparent medium ( solid or fluid or gas ) it is the transfer of energy by means of photons in electromagnetic waves governed by the same laws radiation from the sun , or solar radiation , can be harvested for heat and power unlike conductive and convective forms of heat transfer , thermal radiation – arriving within a narrow angle i.e coming from a source much smaller than its distance – can be concentrated in a small spot by using reflecting mirrors , which is exploited in concentrating solar power generation or a burning glass image : lightning in arlington.jpg thumb right 300px lightning is a highly visible form of energy transfer and is an example of plasma present at earth 's surface as the surface temperature is increased , local boiling occurs and vapor bubbles nucleate , grow into the surrounding cooler fluid , and collapse at similar standard atmospheric pressure and high temperatures , the hydrodynamically-quieter regime of boiling film is reached the leidenfrost effect demonstrates how nucleate boiling slows heat transfer due to gas bubbles on the heater 's surface dropwise condensation is when liquid drops are formed on the subcooled surface , and usually occurs when the liquid does not wet the surface melting is a thermal process that results in the phase transition of a substance from a solid to a liquid heat transfer can be modeled in various ways the heat equation is an important partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat ( or variation in temperature ) in a given region over time heat transfer has broad application to the functioning of numerous devices and systems thermal insulation are materials specifically designed to reduce the flow of heat by limiting conduction , convection , or both 300px a heat engine is a system that performs the conversion of a flow of thermal energy ( heat ) to mechanical energy to perform mechanical work a heat sink is a component that transfers heat generated within a solid material to a fluid medium , such as air or a liquid examples of heat sinks are the heat exchangers used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems or the radiator in a car this smaller temperature gradient between the surface temperature and the ambient temperature will cause a lower rate of heat transfer than if the skin were not covered blood flowing through blood vessels acts as a convective fluid and helps to prevent any buildup of excess heat inside the tissues of the body hyperphysics article on heat transfer - overview interseasonal heat transfer - a practical example of how heat transfer is used to heat buildings without burning fossil fuels

heat is defined in physics as the transfer of thermal energy across a well-defined boundary around a thermodynamic system joule is a unit to quantify energy , work , or the amount of heat thermodynamic and mechanical heat transfer is calculated with the heat transfer coefficient , the proportionality between the heat flux and the thermodynamic driving force for the flow of heat in engineering contexts , the term heat is taken as synonymous to thermal energy thermal engineering concerns the generation , use , conversion , and exchange of heat transfer as such , heat transfer is involved in almost every sector of the economy heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms , such as thermal conduction , thermal convection , thermal radiation , and transfer of energy by phase changes the fundamental modes of heat transfer are : ; advection : advection is the transport mechanism of a fluid from one location to another , and is dependent on motion and momentum of that fluid ; conduction or diffusion : the transfer of energy between objects that are in physical contact ; convection : the transfer of energy between an object and its environment , due to fluid motion ; radiation : the transfer of energy by the emission of electromagnetic radiation by transferring matter , energy—including thermal energy—is moved by the physical transfer of a hot or cold object from one place to another on a microscopic scale , heat conduction occurs as hot , rapidly moving or vibrating atoms and molecules interact with neighboring atoms and molecules , transferring some of their energy ( heat ) to these neighboring particles in other words , heat is transferred by conduction when adjacent atoms vibrate against one another , or as electrons move from one atom to another conduction is the most significant means of heat transfer within a solid or between solid objects in thermal contact transient conduction ( see heat equation ) occurs when the temperature within an object changes as a function of time analysis of transient systems is more complex , and analytic solutions of the heat equation are only valid for idealized model systems the flow of fluid may be forced by external processes , or sometimes ( in gravitational fields ) by buoyancy forces caused when thermal energy expands the fluid ( for example in a fire plume ) , thus influencing its own transfer the latter process is often called '' natural convection '' all convective processes also move heat partly by diffusion , as well convective heat transfer , or convection , is the transfer of heat from one place to another by the movement of fluids , a process that is essentially the transfer of heat via mass transfer bulk motion of fluid enhances heat transfer in many physical situations , such as ( for example ) between a solid surface and the fluid convection is usually the dominant form of heat transfer in liquids and gases free , or natural , convection occurs when bulk fluid motions ( streams and currents ) are caused by buoyancy forces that result from density variations due to variations of temperature in the fluid if heat conduction is too great , fluid moving down by convection is heated by conduction so fast that its downward movement will be stopped due to its buoyancy , while fluid moving up by convection is cooled by conduction so fast that its driving buoyancy will diminish on the other hand , if heat conduction is very low , a large temperature gradient may be formed and convection might be very strong it is a measure which determines the relative strength of conduction and convection thermal radiation is energy emitted by matter as electromagnetic waves , due to the pool of thermal energy in all matter with a temperature above absolute zero since these atoms and molecules are composed of charged particles ( protons and electrons ) , their movement results in the emission of electromagnetic radiation , which carries energy away from the surface the stefan-boltzmann equation , which describes the rate of transfer of radiant energy , is as follows for an object in a vacuum : : \phi_q \epsilon \sigma t^4 radiation is typically only important for very hot objects , or for objects with a large temperature difference unlike conductive and convective forms of heat transfer , thermal radiation – arriving within a narrow angle i.e for example , the sunlight reflected from mirrors heats the ps10 solar power tower and during the day it can heat water to image : lightning in arlington.jpg thumb right 300px lightning is a highly visible form of energy transfer and is an example of plasma present at earth 's surface phase transition or phase change , takes place in a thermodynamic system from one phase or state of matter to another one by heat transfer the mason equation explains the growth of a water droplet based on the effects of heat transport on evaporation and condensation at standard atmospheric pressure and low temperatures , no boiling occurs and the heat transfer rate is controlled by the usual single-phase mechanisms as the surface temperature is increased , local boiling occurs and vapor bubbles nucleate , grow into the surrounding cooler fluid , and collapse heat fluxes across the stable vapor layers are low , but rise slowly with temperature the leidenfrost effect demonstrates how nucleate boiling slows heat transfer due to gas bubbles on the heater 's surface thermal resistance is a heat property and the measurement by which an object or material resists to heat flow ( heat per time unit or thermal resistance ) to temperature difference senf : '' heat engines are made to provide mechanical energy from thermal energy thermal transmittance is the rate of transfer of heat through a structure divided by the difference in temperature across the structure heat is produced in the body by the continuous metabolism of nutrients which provides energy for the systems of the body this smaller temperature gradient between the surface temperature and the ambient temperature will cause a lower rate of heat transfer than if the skin were not covered hyperphysics article on heat

heat is defined in physics as the transfer of thermal energy across a well-defined boundary around a thermodynamic system thermodynamic and mechanical heat transfer is calculated with the heat transfer coefficient , the proportionality between the heat flux and the thermodynamic driving force for the flow of heat in engineering contexts , the term heat is taken as synonymous to thermal energy this usage has its origin in the historical interpretation of heat as a fluid ( caloric ) that can be transferred by various causes , and that is also common in the language of laymen and everyday life thermal engineering concerns the generation , use , conversion , and exchange of heat transfer heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms , such as thermal conduction , thermal convection , thermal radiation , and transfer of energy by phase changes ; conduction or diffusion : the transfer of energy between objects that are in physical contact thermal conductivity is the property of a material to conduct heat and evaluated primarily in terms of fourier 's law for heat conduction ; convection : the transfer of energy between an object and its environment , due to fluid motion ; radiation : the transfer of energy by the emission of electromagnetic radiation this can be as simple as placing hot water in a bottle and heating a bed , or the movement of an iceberg in changing ocean currents in other words , heat is transferred by conduction when adjacent atoms vibrate against one another , or as electrons move from one atom to another conduction is the most significant means of heat transfer within a solid or between solid objects in thermal contact in steady state conduction , the amount of heat entering a section is equal to amount of heat coming out , since the change in temperature ( a measure of heat energy ) is zero the flow of fluid may be forced by external processes , or sometimes ( in gravitational fields ) by buoyancy forces caused when thermal energy expands the fluid ( for example in a fire plume ) , thus influencing its own transfer all convective processes also move heat partly by diffusion , as well another form of convection is forced convection in this case the fluid is forced to flow by using a pump , fan or other mechanical means convective heat transfer , or convection , is the transfer of heat from one place to another by the movement of fluids , a process that is essentially the transfer of heat via mass transfer bulk motion of fluid enhances heat transfer in many physical situations , such as ( for example ) between a solid surface and the fluid although sometimes discussed as a third method of heat transfer , convection is usually used to describe the combined effects of heat conduction within the fluid ( diffusion ) and heat transference by bulk fluid flow streaming the process of transport by fluid streaming is known as advection , but pure advection is a term that is generally associated only with mass transport in fluids , such as advection of pebbles in a river free , or natural , convection occurs when bulk fluid motions ( streams and currents ) are caused by buoyancy forces that result from density variations due to variations of temperature in the fluid forced convection is a term used when the streams and currents in the fluid are induced by external means—such as fans , stirrers , and pumps—creating an artificially induced convection current in a body of fluid that is heated from underneath its container , conduction and convection can be considered to compete for dominance thermal radiation occurs through a vacuum or any transparent medium ( solid or fluid or gas ) it is the transfer of energy by means of photons in electromagnetic waves governed by the same laws thermal radiation is a direct result of the random movements of atoms and molecules in matter unlike conductive and convective forms of heat transfer , thermal radiation – arriving within a narrow angle i.e phase transition or phase change , takes place in a thermodynamic system from one phase or state of matter to another one by heat transfer the mason equation explains the growth of a water droplet based on the effects of heat transport on evaporation and condensation in a closed system , saturation temperature and boiling point mean the same thing the saturation temperature is the temperature for a corresponding saturation pressure at which a liquid boils into its vapor phase any addition of thermal energy results in a phase transition at standard atmospheric pressure and low temperatures , no boiling occurs and the heat transfer rate is controlled by the usual single-phase mechanisms as the surface temperature is increased , local boiling occurs and vapor bubbles nucleate , grow into the surrounding cooler fluid , and collapse this is sub-cooled nucleate boiling , and is a very efficient heat transfer mechanism at high bubble generation rates , the bubbles begin to interfere and the heat flux no longer increases rapidly with surface temperature ( this is the departure from nucleate boiling , or dnb ) any contact between fluid and the surface that may be seen probably leads to the extremely rapid nucleation of a fresh vapor layer ( '' spontaneous nucleation '' ) as mentioned , gas-phase thermal conductivity is much lower than liquid-phase thermal conductivity , so the outcome is a kind of '' gas thermal barrier '' heat transfer methods are used in numerous disciplines , such as automotive engineering , thermal management of electronic devices and systems , hvac , insulation , materials processing , and power station engineering in the vacuum of space , satellites use multi-layer insulation , which consists of many layers of aluminized ( shiny ) mylar to greatly reduce radiation heat transfer and control satellite temperature the principles of heat transfer in engineering systems can be applied to the human body in order to determine how the body

in 1740 , ireland had a population of 2.4 million people , most of whom depended on grains ( oats , wheat , barley and rye ) and potatoes as their staple foods half their expenses for food went for grain , 35 % for animal products and the remainder for potatoes some survived only on oatmeal , buttermilk and potatoes over a year , daily consumption of potatoes was estimated at per person 64 diets varied according to village locations and individual income , with many people supplementing these staples with river , lake or sea fish , especially herring , and small game such as wild duck at the time social welfare was an entirely private initiative undertaken on a local level by the village or parish , with the government not being orientated for large-scale relief efforts an extraordinary climatic shock , known as the '' great frost '' , struck ireland and the rest of europe between december 1739 and september 1741 following a decade of relatively mild winters although no barometric or temperature readings for ireland survive from the great frost , a scattered few records survive from englishmen who made personal readings the one outdoor reading that has survived was stated as '' thirty-two degrees of frost this kind of weather was '' quite outside the irish experience , '' notes david dickson , author of arctic ireland : the extraordinary story of the great frost and forgotten famine of 1740–41 in the period before the crisis in january 1740 , the winds and terrible cold intensified , yet barely any snow fell ireland was locked into a stable and vast high-pressure system which affected most of europe in a broadly similar way , from scandinavia and russia to northern italy people who lived in the country were probably better off than city-dwellers , because , in ireland , country people had cabins sheltered by sod stacks , while the latter , especially the poor , dwelt in freezing basements and garrets the machinery was stilled that customarily ground wheat for the bakers , tucked cloth for the weavers , and pulped rags for the printers the church of ireland parish clergy solicited donations , which they converted into free rations in the city parishes , distributing nearly 80 tons of coal and ten tons of meal four weeks into the frost the lord lieutenant , the duke of devonshire , in an unprecedented move on 19 january 1740 , prohibited export of grain out of ireland to any destination except britain this action was in response to cork corporation ( city of cork ) , which remembered vividly the city events of eleven years earlier when serious food riots erupted and four people died in celbridge , county kildare , katherine , the widow of william conolly , commissioned the construction of the conolly folly in 1740 to give employment to local workers the great frost affected the potato , which was one of the two main staples ( the other was oatmeal ) in rural ireland illustrative potato clamp design they were put among layers of soil and straw that normally prevented frost from penetrating deeply enough to destroy the contents of the clamp the important corn crop also failed , which resulted in greater mortality in ireland than in britain or the continent 126 grains were so scarce that the irish hierarchy of the catholic church allowed catholics to eat meat four days each week during lent , but not everyone could afford meat , either dickson explains that the '' wholesale rise in the price of wheat , oats and barley reflected not just the current supply position , but the dealers ' assessment as to the state of things later in the year 25 by summer 1740 , the frost had decimated the potatoes , and the drought had decimated the grain harvest and herds of cattle and sheep great chunks of ice careened down the liffey river through the heart of dublin , overturning light vessels and causing larger vessels to break anchor ) the great irish famine ( 1955 ) , mercier press , pp as conditions eased , '' the population entered into a period of unprecedented growth , '' although additional famines occurred during the eighteenth century doi:10.1002/ajpa.22066 joe lee , the modernisation of irish society eamonn o ciardha : ireland and the jacobite cause , 1685–1766 : a fatal attachment , four courts press , dublin , 2002 ) the great irish famine , mercier press 1955 gary l

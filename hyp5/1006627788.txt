in 1740 , ireland had a population of 2.4 million people , most of whom depended on grains ( oats , wheat , barley and rye ) and potatoes as their staple foods half their expenses for food went for grain , 35 % for animal products and the remainder for potatoes 64 diets varied according to village locations and individual income , with many people supplementing these staples with river , lake or sea fish , especially herring , and small game such as wild duck an extraordinary climatic shock , known as the '' great frost '' , struck ireland and the rest of europe between december 1739 and september 1741 following a decade of relatively mild winters the mercury thermometer was invented 25 years earlier by the german pioneer daniel gabriel fahrenheit this kind of weather was '' quite outside the irish experience , '' notes david dickson , author of arctic ireland : the extraordinary story of the great frost and forgotten famine of 1740–41 in the period before the crisis in january 1740 , the winds and terrible cold intensified , yet barely any snow fell ireland was locked into a stable and vast high-pressure system which affected most of europe in a broadly similar way , from scandinavia and russia to northern italy people who lived in the country were probably better off than city-dwellers , because , in ireland , country people had cabins sheltered by sod stacks , while the latter , especially the poor , dwelt in freezing basements and garrets coal dealers and shippers during normal times ferried coal from cumbria and south wales to east and south-coast ports in ireland , but the ice-bound quays and frozen coal yards temporarily stopped such trade when in late january 1740 the traffic across the irish sea resumed , retail prices for coal soared desperate people stripped bare hedges , ornamental trees , and nurseries around dublin to obtain substitute fuel these leaders knew from experience that '' an unemployed or hungry town often became a sickly town and such sickness might be no respecter of class or wealth the propertied classes began to respond to fuel and food shortages when the frost was about two weeks old the church of ireland parish clergy solicited donations , which they converted into free rations in the city parishes , distributing nearly 80 tons of coal and ten tons of meal four weeks into the frost this action was in response to cork corporation ( city of cork ) , which remembered vividly the city events of eleven years earlier when serious food riots erupted and four people died the great frost affected the potato , which was one of the two main staples ( the other was oatmeal ) in rural ireland the important corn crop also failed , which resulted in greater mortality in ireland than in britain or the continent the potato crisis caused an increase in grain prices , resulting in smaller and smaller loaves of bread for the old price starving rural dwellers started a '' mass vagrancy '' towards the better-supplied towns , such as cork in southern ireland trying to restore order , troops from the royal barracks police brutality city officials tried to '' smoke out hoarders of grain and to police food markets , but prices remained stubbornly high throughout the summer the strange autumn of 1740 pushed food prices back up , e.g the widening wars in mid-december 1740 encouraged people with stored food to hold onto it by december 1740 , signs were growing that full-blown famine and epidemic were upon the citizens of ireland the normal death rate tripled in january and february 1740 , and burials averaged out about 50 % higher during the twenty-one-month crisis than for the years 1737–1739 , according to dickson ) the great irish famine ( 1955 ) , mercier press , pp ) , famine : the irish experience , edinburgh : john donald , 1989 david dickson , arctic ireland ( white row press , dublin 1997 ) 2762 , john scott , cork to thomas dillon & co , 25 jan 1739–40 : “ an express from corke , with an account of a blood battle fought between the mob of that city and the standing army… ( dublin , 1729 ) ) the great irish famine , mercier press 1955 gary l

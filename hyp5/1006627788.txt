in 1740 , ireland had a population of 2.4 million people , most of whom depended on grains ( oats , wheat , barley and rye ) and potatoes as their staple foods half their expenses for food went for grain , 35 % for animal products and the remainder for potatoes an extraordinary climatic shock , known as the '' great frost '' , struck ireland and the rest of europe between december 1739 and september 1741 following a decade of relatively mild winters charting its course sharply illuminates how climate events can result in famine and epidemic disease , and affect economies , energy sources , and politics although no barometric or temperature readings for ireland survive from the great frost , a scattered few records survive from englishmen who made personal readings this kind of weather was '' quite outside the irish experience , '' notes david dickson , author of arctic ireland : the extraordinary story of the great frost and forgotten famine of 1740–41 in the period before the crisis in january 1740 , the winds and terrible cold intensified , yet barely any snow fell rivers , lakes , and waterfalls froze and fish died in these first weeks of the great frost coal dealers and shippers during normal times ferried coal from cumbria and south wales to east and south-coast ports in ireland , but the ice-bound quays and frozen coal yards temporarily stopped such trade when in late january 1740 the traffic across the irish sea resumed , retail prices for coal soared desperate people stripped bare hedges , ornamental trees , and nurseries around dublin to obtain substitute fuel the propertied classes began to respond to fuel and food shortages when the frost was about two weeks old the lord lieutenant , the duke of devonshire , in an unprecedented move on 19 january 1740 , prohibited export of grain out of ireland to any destination except britain this action was in response to cork corporation ( city of cork ) , which remembered vividly the city events of eleven years earlier when serious food riots erupted and four people died in celbridge , county kildare , katherine , the widow of william conolly , commissioned the construction of the conolly folly in 1740 to give employment to local workers the great frost affected the potato , which was one of the two main staples ( the other was oatmeal ) in rural ireland potatoes typically were left in storage in gardens and in special storage in fields this disruption of the agricultural cycle created problems in ireland in the winter of 1740–1741 the drought killed off animals in the field , particularly sheep in connacht and black cattle in the south by the end of april , it destroyed much of the tillage crops ( wheat and barley ) sown the previous autumn , and grains were more important in the diet than were potatoes the important corn crop also failed , which resulted in greater mortality in ireland than in britain or the continent 126 grains were so scarce that the irish hierarchy of the catholic church allowed catholics to eat meat four days each week during lent , but not everyone could afford meat , either the potato crisis caused an increase in grain prices , resulting in smaller and smaller loaves of bread for the old price 27 the first '' flareup '' occurred at drogheda , north of dublin on the east coast of ireland , in mid-april a band of citizens boarded a vessel laden with oatmeal , which was preparing to depart for scotland linen , salted beef and pickled butter were ireland 's chief export earners , and the war endangered this trade as well the reports indicated a number of privately-held stocks , for instance county louth held over 85,000 barrels of grain , mainly oats , owned by some 1,655 farmers ) the great irish famine ( 1955 ) , mercier press , pp ) , famine : the irish experience , edinburgh : john donald , 1989 david dickson , arctic ireland ( white row press , dublin 1997 )

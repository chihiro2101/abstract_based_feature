the malayan economy relied on the export of tin and rubber , and was therefore vulnerable to any shifts in the world market when the british took control of the malayan economy , they imposed taxes on some malayan goods , affecting their traditional industries this led to an increase in poverty for the malayan people wendy khadijah moore , malaysia a pictorial history 1400–2004 , ed : archipelago press , 2004 ) , page 194 many chinese people found employment in tin mines or fields responsible for the trade of materials this forced many malays into the rubber industry , which in turn was heavily dependent upon volatile world prices the japanese occupation of malaya began in 1941 and from that point onwards the '' export of primary products was limited to the relatively small amounts required for the japanese economy '' this led to large areas of rubber plantations being abandoned and many mines closing imports of rice , which made up a large portion of the malayan diet , fell rapidly due to limited trade and thus the population was forced to focus their efforts on subsistence the withdrawal of japan at the end of world war ii left the british malayan economy disrupted the weak economy was a factor in the growth of trade union movements led by the communists eric stahl , '' doomed from the start : a new perspective on the malayan insurgency '' ( master 's thesis , 2003 ) during this time , the british administration was attempting to organise malaya 's economy , as revenue from malaya 's tin and rubber industries was important to britain 's own post-war recovery in 1947 alone , the communists in malaya organised 300 strikes immediately after the war , the british authorities had set up the malayan union , a state where all citizens , malay , chinese and indian , would have equal rights this was rejected by many ethnic malays and by the rulers of the various protected states under effective british control the first shots of the malayan emergency were fired at 8:30 am on 16 june 1948 , in the office of the elphil estate twenty miles east of the sungai siput , perak this attack failed as the target 's jeep broke down making him late for work under these measures many trade unions , the malayan communist party ( mcp ) and other leftist parties were outlawed peng was a veteran anti-fascist and trade unionist who had played an integral role in the mpaja communist resistance against the japanese occupation of malaya during wwii the mnla began their war for malayan independence by targeting the colonial resource extraction industries , namely the tin mines and rubber plantations which were the main sources of income for the british occupation of malaya the mnla attacked these industries in the hopes of bankrupting the british and winning independence by making the colonial administration too expensive to maintain the mnla was partly a re-formation of the malayan peoples ' anti-japanese army ( mpaja ) , the mcp-led guerrilla force which had been the principal resistance in malaya against the japanese occupation the british had secretly helped form the mpaja in 1942 and trained them in the use of explosives , firearms and radios support for the mnla mainly came from around 500,000 of the 3.12 million ethnic chinese then living in malaya this allowed the mnla to supply themselves with food , in particular , as well as providing a source of new recruits the mnla gained the support of the chinese because the chinese were denied the equal right to vote in elections , had no land rights to speak of , and were usually very poor the mnla also stipulated that their soldiers needed official permission for any romantic involvement with civilian women british planters and miners , who bore the brunt of the communist attacks , began to talk about government incompetence and being betrayed by whitehall the initial government strategy was primarily to guard important economic targets , such as mines and plantation estates the central tenet of the briggs plan was that the best way to defeat an insurgency , such as the government was facing , was to cut the insurgents off from their supporters amongst the population the briggs plan also recognised the inhospitable nature of the malayan jungle these villages were newly constructed in most cases , and were surrounded by barbed wire , police posts , and floodlit areas , designed to keep the inhabitants in and the guerrillas out at the start of the emergency , the british had 13 infantry battalions in malaya , including seven partly formed gurkha battalions , three british battalions , two battalions of the royal malay regiment and a british royal artillery regiment being used as infantry '' civil-military operations : joint doctrine and the malayan emergency '' , joint force quarterly , autumn 2002 , paragraph 3,4 on 6 october 1951 , the british high commissioner in malaya , sir henry gurney , was assassinated ( see below ) at the same time , british forces kept up pressure on the mnla by patrolling the jungle the mnla guerrillas were driven deeper into the jungle and denied resources in the end , the conflict involved a maximum of 40,000 british and other commonwealth troops , against a peak of about 7–8,000 communist guerrillas the police , military , and home guard representatives and the secretary formed the operations sub-committee responsible for the day-to-day direction of emergency operations a typical operation was '' nassau '' , carried out in the kuala langat swamp ( excerpt from the marine corps school 's the guerrilla – and how to fight him ) : the first australian ground forces , the 2nd battalion , royal australian regiment ( 2 rar ) , arrived in 1955 the royal australian air force contributed no

reserve forces for three to nine months at a time several of the destroyers fired on communist positions in johor state a total of 1,300 new zealanders served in the malayan emergency between 1948 and 1964 , and fifteen lost their lives 41 squadron rnzaf were attached to the royal air force 's far east air force new zealand became more directly involved in the conflict in 1955 ; from may , rnzaf de havilland vampires and venoms began to fly strike missions in november 1955 133 soldiers of what was to become the special air service of new zealand arrived from singapore , for training in-country with the british sas , beginning operations by april 1956 during the four years of fijian involvement , from 1952 to 1956 , some 1,600 fijian troops served twenty-five fijian troops died in combat in malaya on 6 october 1951 , the mnla ambushed and killed the british high commissioner , sir henry gurney tunku abdul rahman , as chief minister , made good the offer of an amnesty but promised there would be no negotiations with the mnla those who show that they are genuinely intent to be loyal to the government of malaya and to give up their communist activities will be helped to regain their normal position in society and be reunited with their families nik anuar nik mahmud , tunku abdul rahman and his role in the baling talks following the declaration , an intensive publicity campaign on an unprecedented scale was launched by the government alliance ministers in the federal government travelled extensively up and down the country exhorting the people to call upon the communists to lay down their arms and take advantage of the amnesty realising that the tide of the war was turning against him , chin peng indicated that he would be ready to meet with british officials alongside senior malayan politicians in 1955 chin ping walked out from the jungle and tried to negotiate with the leader of the federation , tunku abdul rahman , but the british intelligence service worried that the mcp would regain influence in society the meeting was intended to design an end to the conflict but the malayan government representatives , led by tunku abdul rahman , dismissed all of chin peng 's demands during the malayan conflict , there were instances during operations to find insurgents where british troops detained and tortured villagers who were suspected of aiding the insurgents many tactics used by the americans in vietnam were similar to those used by the british in malaya british forces thus faced a dual-threat : the insurgents and the silent network in villages who supported them in the late 1960s , the coverage of the my lai massacre during the vietnam war prompted the initiation of investigations in the uk concerning alleged war crimes perpetrated by british forces during the emergency , such as the batang kali massacre this portrayal also obscures the reality that the malayan communist party in its own way fought for independence from the metropole

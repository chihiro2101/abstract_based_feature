the malayan economy relied on the export of tin and rubber , and was therefore vulnerable to any shifts in the world market when the british took control of the malayan economy , they imposed taxes on some malayan goods , affecting their traditional industries : archipelago press , 2004 ) , page 194 many chinese people found employment in tin mines or fields responsible for the trade of materials this forced many malays into the rubber industry , which in turn was heavily dependent upon volatile world prices the japanese occupation of malaya began in 1941 and from that point onwards the '' export of primary products was limited to the relatively small amounts required for the japanese economy '' this led to large areas of rubber plantations being abandoned and many mines closing the withdrawal of japan at the end of world war ii left the british malayan economy disrupted the weak economy was a factor in the growth of trade union movements led by the communists protesters were dealt with harshly – measures included arrests and deportations in 1947 alone , the communists in malaya organised 300 strikes immediately after the war , the british authorities had set up the malayan union , a state where all citizens , malay , chinese and indian , would have equal rights this was rejected by many ethnic malays and by the rulers of the various protected states under effective british control the first shots of the malayan emergency were fired at 8:30 am on 16 june 1948 , in the office of the elphil estate twenty miles east of the sungai siput , perak these planned attacks were to include a fourth british on an estate near sungai siput nordic institute of asian studies monograph series , no two days later ( june 18 ) , the british enacted emergency measures into law , first in perak in response to the sungai siput incident led by chin peng the remaining malayan communists retreated to rural areas and formed the malayan national liberation army ( mnla ) , although their name has commonly been mistranslated as the malayan races liberation army ( mrla ) or the malayan people 's liberation army ( mpla ) peng was a veteran anti-fascist and trade unionist who had played an integral role in the mpaja communist resistance against the japanese occupation of malaya during wwii the mnla was partly a re-formation of the malayan peoples ' anti-japanese army ( mpaja ) , the mcp-led guerrilla force which had been the principal resistance in malaya against the japanese occupation the british had secretly helped form the mpaja in 1942 and trained them in the use of explosives , firearms and radios support for the mnla mainly came from around 500,000 of the 3.12 million ethnic chinese then living in malaya this allowed the mnla to supply themselves with food , in particular , as well as providing a source of new recruits most mnla guerrillas were ethnic chinese , though there were some malays , indonesians and indians among its members in the camps , the soldiers attended lectures on marxism–leninism , and produced political newsletters to be distributed to civilians on the military front , the security forces did not know how to fight an enemy moving freely in the jungle and enjoying support from the chinese rural population british planters and miners , who bore the brunt of the communist attacks , began to talk about government incompetence and being betrayed by whitehall the central tenet of the briggs plan was that the best way to defeat an insurgency , such as the government was facing , was to cut the insurgents off from their supporters amongst the population the briggs plan also recognised the inhospitable nature of the malayan jungle these villages were newly constructed in most cases , and were surrounded by barbed wire , police posts , and floodlit areas , designed to keep the inhabitants in and the guerrillas out karl hack , defense & decolonization in south-east asia , p this force was too small to fight the insurgents effectively , and more infantry battalions were needed in malaya the british brought in soldiers from units such as the royal marines and king 's african rifles another element in the strategy was the re-formation of the special air service in 1950 as a specialised reconnaissance , raiding , and counter-insurgency unit thompson 's in-depth experience of jungle warfare proved invaluable during this period as he was able to build effective civil-military relations and was one of the chief architects of the counter-insurgency plan in malaya ''

gurney , was assassinated ( see below ) later the same month , winston churchill 's conservative party was returned to power in a british general election among many new policies , templer encouraged a '' hearts and minds campaign '' to win over the insurgents by giving medical and food aid to malays and indigenous tribes the mnla guerrillas were driven deeper into the jungle and denied resources '' orthodox historiography suggests that templer changed the situation in the emergency and his actions and policies were a major part of british success during his period in command revisionist historians have challenged this view and frequently support the ideas of victor purcell , a sinologist who as early as 1954 claimed that templer merely continued policies begun by his predecessors in the end , the conflict involved a maximum of 40,000 british and other commonwealth troops , against a peak of about 7–8,000 communist guerrillas at all levels of the malayan government ( national ,

warfare had been established by the british through their use of aircraft to spray herbicide and thus destroy enemy crops and thin the thick jungle of northern malaya communist leader chin peng spent much of the 1990s and early 2000s working to promote his perspective of the emergency this portrayal also obscures the reality that the malayan communist party in its own way fought for independence

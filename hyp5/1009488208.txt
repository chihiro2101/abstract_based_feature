the malayan economy relied on the export of tin and rubber , and was therefore vulnerable to any shifts in the world market when the british took control of the malayan economy , they imposed taxes on some malayan goods , affecting their traditional industries this forced many malays into the rubber industry , which in turn was heavily dependent upon volatile world prices economic tension intensified during the second world war the japanese occupation of malaya began in 1941 and from that point onwards the '' export of primary products was limited to the relatively small amounts required for the japanese economy the withdrawal of japan at the end of world war ii left the british malayan economy disrupted problems included unemployment , low wages , and high levels of food inflation one example was a 24-hour general strike organised by the mcp on 29 january 1946 in turn , protesters became increasingly militant immediately after the war , the british authorities had set up the malayan union , a state where all citizens , malay , chinese and indian , would have equal rights this was rejected by many ethnic malays and by the rulers of the various protected states under effective british control in 1948 the british replaced the malayan union with the federation of malaya which reduced chinese influence and for many chinese this appeared as a betrayal after their community had borne the brunt of fighting the japanese occupation the first shots of the malayan emergency were fired at 8:30 am on 16 june 1948 , in the office of the elphil estate twenty miles east of the sungai siput , perak three british plantation managers , arthur walker ( aged 50 ) , john allison ( aged 55 ) and his young assistant , ian christian , were killed by three young chinese men these planned attacks were to include a fourth british on an estate near sungai siput more gunmen were sent to kill him but left after failing to find him the malayan emergency a small , distant war two days later ( june 18 ) , the british enacted emergency measures into law , first in perak in response to the sungai siput incident under these measures many trade unions , the malayan communist party ( mcp ) and other leftist parties were outlawed peng was a veteran anti-fascist and trade unionist who had played an integral role in the mpaja communist resistance against the japanese occupation of malaya during wwii the mnla began their war for malayan independence by targeting the colonial resource extraction industries , namely the tin mines and rubber plantations which were the main sources of income for the british occupation of malaya the mnla attacked these industries in the hopes of bankrupting the british and winning independence by making the colonial administration too expensive to maintain the mnla was partly a re-formation of the malayan peoples ' anti-japanese army ( mpaja ) , the mcp-led guerrilla force which had been the principal resistance in malaya against the japanese occupation the british had secretly helped form the mpaja in 1942 and trained them in the use of explosives , firearms and radios there was a particular component of the chinese community referred to as 'squatters ' , farmers living on the edge of the jungles where the mnla were based this allowed the mnla to supply themselves with food , in particular , as well as providing a source of new recruits the mnla gained the support of the chinese because the chinese were denied the equal right to vote in elections , had no land rights to speak of , and were usually very poor besides supplying material , especially food , it was also important to the mnla as a source of intelligence on the military front , the security forces did not know how to fight an enemy moving freely in the jungle and enjoying support from the chinese rural population british planters and miners , who bore the brunt of the communist attacks , began to talk about government incompetence and being betrayed by whitehall the malayan emergency a small distant war later , in april 1950 , general sir harold briggs , the british army 's director of operations was appointed to malaya the briggs plan also recognised the inhospitable nature of the malayan jungle this force was too small to fight the insurgents effectively , and more infantry battalions were needed in malaya the permanent secretary of defence for malaya , sir robert grainger ker thompson , had served in the chindits in burma during world war ii churchill took some time considering a replacement for gurney , eventually appointing general gerald templer as the new british high commissioner in january 1952 among many new policies , templer encouraged a '' hearts and minds campaign '' to win over the insurgents by giving medical and food aid to malays and indigenous tribes revisionist historians have challenged this view and frequently support the ideas of victor purcell , a sinologist who as early as 1954 claimed that templer merely continued policies begun by his predecessors in the end , the conflict involved a maximum of 40,000 british and other commonwealth troops , against a peak of about 7–8,000 communist guerrillas at all levels of the malayan government ( national , state , and district levels ) , the military and civil authority was assumed by a committee of military , police and civilian administration officials this allowed intelligence from all sources to be rapidly evaluated and disseminated and also allowed all anti-guerrilla measures to be co-ordinated the british army soon realised that clumsy sweeps by large formations were unproductive instead , platoons or sections carried out patrols and laid ambushes , based on intelligence from various sources , including informers , surrendered mnla personnel , aerial reconnaissance and so on in 1955 , the raaf extended butterworth air base , from which canberra bombers of no several of the destroyers fired on communist positions in johor state a total of 1,300 new zealanders served in the malayan emergency between 1948 and 1964 , and fifteen lost their lives new zealand 's first contribution came in 1949 , when c-47 dakotas of no 41 squadron rnzaf were attached to the royal air force 's far east air force new zealand became more directly involved in the conflict in 1955 ; from may , rnzaf de havilland vampires and venoms began to fly strike missions in november 1955 133 soldiers of what was to become the special air service of new zealand arrived from singapore , for training in-country with the british sas , beginning operations by april 1956 the royal new zealand air force continued to carry out strike missions with venoms of no southern rhodesia and its successor , the federation of rhodesia and nyasaland , contributed two units to malaya the 1st , 2nd , and 3rd battalions of the king 's african rifles from nyasaland , northern rhodesia and kenya respectively also served there suffering 23 losses on 6 october 1951 , the mnla ambushed and killed the british high commissioner , sir henry gurney '' later , mnla leader chin peng stated that the killing had little effect and that the communists were already altering their strategy , according to new guidelines enshrined in the so-called '' october resolutions '' gurney 's successor , lieutenant general gerald templer , was instructed by the british government to push for immediate measures to give chinese ethnic residents the right to vote tunku abdul rahman , as chief minister , made good the offer of an amnesty but promised there would be no negotiations with the mnla realising that the tide of the war was turning against him , chin peng indicated that he would be ready to meet with british officials alongside senior malayan politicians in 1955 decapitation of suspected insurgents by british forces was also common practice as a way to identify dead guerrillas when it was not possible to bring their corpses in from the jungle the role of the special branch in the malayan emergency cited at length in vietnam war essay on insurgency and counterinsurgency lessons from malaya , ehistory , ohio state university this strategy led to the infamous batang kali massacre where 24 unarmed villagers were executed by british troops no charges have yet been brought against the british forces involved and the claims have been repeatedly dismissed by the british government as propaganda , despite evidence suggestive of a cover-up the communist insurrection in malaya 1948–1960

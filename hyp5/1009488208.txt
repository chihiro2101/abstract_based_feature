found that ethnic chinese had replaced them in certain jobs and work became more difficult to find imports of rice , which made up a large portion of the malayan diet , fell rapidly due to limited trade and thus the population was forced to focus their efforts on subsistence the withdrawal of japan at the end of world war ii left the british malayan economy disrupted problems included unemployment , low wages , and high levels of food inflation the weak economy was a factor in the growth of trade union movements led by the communists immediately after the war , the british authorities had set up the malayan union , a state where all citizens , malay , chinese and indian , would have equal rights this was rejected by many ethnic malays and by the rulers of the various protected states under effective british control in 1948 the british replaced the malayan union with the federation of malaya which reduced chinese influence and for many chinese this appeared as a betrayal after their community had borne the brunt of fighting the japanese occupation the first shots of the malayan emergency were fired at 8:30 am on 16 june 1948 , in the office of the elphil estate twenty miles east of the sungai siput , perak three british plantation managers , arthur walker ( aged 50 ) , john allison ( aged 55 ) and his young assistant , ian christian , were killed by

, first in perak in response to the sungai siput incident these emergency measures then became country-wide in july under these measures many trade unions , the malayan communist party ( mcp ) and other leftist parties were outlawed peng was a veteran anti-fascist and trade unionist who had played an integral role in the mpaja communist resistance against the japanese occupation of malaya during wwii the mnla began their war for malayan independence by targeting the colonial resource extraction industries , namely the tin mines and rubber plantations which were the main sources of income for the british occupation of malaya the mnla attacked these industries in the hopes of bankrupting the british and winning independence by making the colonial administration too expensive to maintain the mnla launched their first guerrilla attacks in the gua musang district disbanded in december 1945 , the mpaja officially turned in its weapons to the british military administration , although many mpaja soldiers secretly hid stockpiles of weapons in jungle hideouts members who agreed to disband were offered economic incentives support for the mnla mainly came from around 500,000 of the 3.12 million ethnic chinese then living in malaya there was a particular component of the chinese community referred to as 'squatters ' , farmers living on the edge of the jungles where the mnla were based the mnla gained the support of the chinese because the chinese were denied the equal right to vote in elections , had no land rights to speak of , and were usually very poor most mnla guerrillas were ethnic chinese , though there were some malays , indonesians and indians among its members the mnla also stipulated that their soldiers needed official permission for any romantic involvement with civilian women on the military front , the security forces did not know how to fight an enemy moving freely in the jungle and enjoying support from the chinese rural population the

grainger ker thompson , had served in the chindits in burma during world war ii thompson 's in-depth experience of jungle warfare proved invaluable during this period as he was able to build effective civil-military relations and was one of the chief architects of the counter-insurgency plan in malaya churchill took some time considering a replacement for gurney , eventually appointing general gerald templer as the new british high commissioner in january 1952 it was templer who is widely credited with turning the situation in favour of the british forces among many new policies , templer encouraged a '' hearts and minds campaign '' to win over the insurgents by giving medical and food aid to malays and indigenous tribes the mnla extorted food from the sakai and thereby earned their enmity revisionist historians have challenged this view and frequently support the ideas of victor purcell , a sinologist who as early as 1954 claimed that templer merely continued policies begun by his predecessors in the end , the conflict involved a maximum of 40,000 british and other commonwealth troops , against a peak of about 7–8,000 communist guerrillas at all levels of the malayan government ( national , state , and district levels ) , the military and civil authority was assumed by a committee of military , police and civilian administration officials the police , military , and home guard representatives and the secretary formed the operations sub-committee responsible for the day-to-day direction of emergency operations a total of 1,300 new zealanders served in the

the mnla ambushed and killed the british high commissioner , sir henry gurney gurney 's successor , lieutenant general gerald templer , was instructed by the british government to push for immediate measures to give chinese ethnic residents the right to vote government 's declaration of amnesty on 8 september 1955 , the government of the federation of malaya issued a declaration of amnesty to the communists those who show that they are genuinely intent to be loyal to the government of malaya and to give up their communist activities will be helped to regain their normal position in society and be reunited with their families as regards the remainder , restrictions will have to be placed on their liberty but if any of them wish to go to china , their request will be given due consideration chin ping walked out from the jungle and tried to negotiate with the leader of the federation , tunku abdul rahman , but the british intelligence service worried that the mcp would regain influence in society some civilians and detainees were also shot , either because they attempted to flee from and potentially aid insurgents or simply because they refused to give intelligence to british forces many tactics used by the americans in vietnam were similar to those used by the british in malaya after the malayan conflict ended in 1960 , the us used the british precedent in deciding that the use of defoliants was a law of war no charges have yet been brought against the british forces involved and the claims have been repeatedly dismissed by the british government as propaganda , despite

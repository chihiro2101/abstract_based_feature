the malayan economy relied on the export of tin and rubber , and was therefore vulnerable to any shifts in the world market when the british took control of the malayan economy , they imposed taxes on some malayan goods , affecting their traditional industries wendy khadijah moore , malaysia a pictorial history 1400–2004 , ed : archipelago press , 2004 ) , page 194 many chinese people found employment in tin mines or fields responsible for the trade of materials this heightened inter-ethnic tensions as the malay people found that ethnic chinese had replaced them in certain jobs and work became more difficult to find this forced many malays into the rubber industry , which in turn was heavily dependent upon volatile world prices the japanese occupation of malaya began in 1941 and from that point onwards the '' export of primary products was limited to the relatively small amounts required for the japanese economy imports of rice , which made up a large portion of the malayan diet , fell rapidly due to limited trade and thus the population was forced to focus their efforts on subsistence the weak economy was a factor in the growth of trade union movements led by the communists immediately after the war , the british authorities had set up the malayan union , a state where all citizens , malay , chinese and indian , would have equal rights the first shots of the malayan emergency were fired at 8:30 am on 16 june 1948 , in the office of the elphil estate twenty miles east of the sungai siput , perak three british plantation managers , arthur walker ( aged 50 ) , john allison ( aged 55 ) and his young assistant , ian christian , were killed by three young chinese men this attack failed as the target 's jeep broke down making him late for work two days later ( june 18 ) , the british enacted emergency measures into law , first in perak in response to the sungai siput incident under these measures many trade unions , the malayan communist party ( mcp ) and other leftist parties were outlawed led by chin peng the remaining malayan communists retreated to rural areas and formed the malayan national liberation army ( mnla ) , although their name has commonly been mistranslated as the malayan races liberation army ( mrla ) or the malayan people 's liberation army ( mpla ) the mnla attacked these industries in the hopes of bankrupting the british and winning independence by making the colonial administration too expensive to maintain the mnla launched their first guerrilla attacks in the gua musang district the mnla was partly a re-formation of the malayan peoples ' anti-japanese army ( mpaja ) , the mcp-led guerrilla force which had been the principal resistance in malaya against the japanese occupation this allowed the mnla to supply themselves with food , in particular , as well as providing a source of new recruits the mnla gained the support of the chinese because the chinese were denied the equal right to vote in elections , had no land rights to speak of , and were usually very poor the mnla 's supply organisation was called '' min yuen '' ( mass organisation ) most mnla guerrillas were ethnic chinese , though there were some malays , indonesians and indians among its members the mnla was organised into regiments , although these had no fixed establishments and each included all communist forces operating in a particular region the regiments had political sections , commissars , instructors and secret service in the camps , the soldiers attended lectures on marxism–leninism , and produced political newsletters to be distributed to civilians in the early stages of the conflict , the guerrillas envisaged establishing control in '' liberated areas '' from which the government forces had been driven , but did not succeed in this british planters and miners , who bore the brunt of the communist attacks , began to talk about government incompetence and being betrayed by whitehall later , in april 1950 , general sir harold briggs , the british army 's director of operations was appointed to malaya the central tenet of the briggs plan was that the best way to defeat an insurgency , such as the government was facing , was to cut the insurgents off from their supporters amongst the population the briggs plan was multifaceted but one aspect has become particularly well known : the forced relocation of some 500,000 rural malayans , including 400,000 chinese , from squatter communities on the fringes of the forests into guarded camps called '' new villages '' the british brought in soldiers from units such as the royal marines and king 's african rifles another element in the strategy was the re-formation of the special air service in 1950 as a specialised reconnaissance , raiding , and counter-insurgency unit the permanent secretary of defence for malaya , sir robert grainger ker thompson , had served in the chindits in burma during world war ii churchill took some time considering a replacement for gurney , eventually appointing general gerald templer as the new british high commissioner in january 1952 among many new policies , templer encouraged a '' hearts and minds campaign '' to win over the insurgents by giving medical and food aid to malays and indigenous tribes at the same time , british forces kept up pressure on the mnla by patrolling the jungle revisionist historians have challenged this view and frequently support the ideas of victor purcell , a sinologist who as early as 1954 claimed that templer merely continued policies begun by his predecessors control of anti-guerrilla operations the police , military , and home guard representatives and the secretary formed the operations sub-committee responsible for the day-to-day direction of emergency operations the operations subcommittees as a whole made joint decisions conduct of anti-terrorist operations in malaya , director of operations , malaya , 1958 , chapter iii : own forces instead , platoons or sections carried out patrols and laid ambushes , based on intelligence from various sources , including informers , surrendered mnla personnel , aerial reconnaissance and so on in addition to british and malayan units and personnel , a range of commonwealth forces were also involved , including troops from australia , new zealand , fiji , kenya , nyasaland , and northern and southern rhodesia the first australian ground forces , the 2nd battalion , royal australian regiment ( 2 rar ) , arrived in 1955 the royal australian navy destroyers and joined the force in june 1955 new zealand 's first contribution came in 1949 , when c-47 dakotas of no 41 squadron rnzaf were attached to the royal air force 's far east air force new zealand became more directly involved in the conflict in 1955 ; from may , rnzaf de havilland vampires and venoms began to fly strike missions in november 1955 133 soldiers of what was to become the special air service of new zealand arrived from singapore , for training in-country with the british sas , beginning operations by april 1956 during the four years of fijian involvement , from 1952 to 1956 , some 1,600 fijian troops served gurney 's successor , lieutenant general gerald templer , was instructed by the british government to push for immediate measures to give chinese ethnic residents the right to vote the terms of the amnesty were : those of you who come in and surrender will not be prosecuted for any offence connected with the emergency , which you have committed under communist direction , either before this date or in ignorance of this declaration nik anuar nik mahmud , tunku abdul rahman and his role in the baling talks following the declaration , an intensive publicity campaign on an unprecedented scale was launched by the government alliance ministers in the federal government travelled extensively up and down the country exhorting the people to call upon the communists to lay down their arms and take advantage of the amnesty leading officials of the labour party had , as part of the settlement , not excluded the possibility of recognition of the mcp as a political organisation 75 squadron rnzaf ; other commonwealth members also sent troops to aid the british macgillivray to the secretary of state for the colonies , 15 march 1956 , co1030/22 despite the failure of the talks , the mcp made every effort to resume peace talks with the malayan government , without success meanwhile , discussions began in the new emergency operations council to intensify the '' people 's war '' against the guerillas after the malayan conflict ended in 1960 , the us used the british precedent in deciding that the use of defoliants was a law of war the british reported that bombing jungles was largely a waste of effort due to inaccurate targeting and the inability to confirm if a target was hostile or not the new conflict coincided with renewed tensions between ethnic malays and chinese following the 13 may incident of 1969 , and the ongoing conflict of the vietnam war the malayan trilogy series of novels ( 1956-1959 ) by anthony burgess is set during the malayan emergency

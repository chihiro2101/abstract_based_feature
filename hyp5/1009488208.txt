the malayan economy relied on the export of tin and rubber , and was therefore vulnerable to any shifts in the world market when the british took control of the malayan economy , they imposed taxes on some malayan goods , affecting their traditional industries : archipelago press , 2004 ) , page 194 many chinese people found employment in tin mines or fields responsible for the trade of materials this forced many malays into the rubber industry , which in turn was heavily dependent upon volatile world prices economic tension intensified during the second world war the japanese occupation of malaya began in 1941 and from that point onwards the '' export of primary products was limited to the relatively small amounts required for the japanese economy '' this led to large areas of rubber plantations being abandoned and many mines closing imports of rice , which made up a large portion of the malayan diet , fell rapidly due to limited trade and thus the population was forced to focus their efforts on subsistence the withdrawal of japan at the end of world war ii left the british malayan economy disrupted problems included unemployment , low wages , and high levels of food inflation immediately after the war , the british authorities had set up the malayan union , a state where all citizens , malay , chinese and indian , would have equal rights this was rejected by many ethnic malays and by the rulers of the various protected states under effective british control in 1948 the british replaced the malayan union with the federation of malaya which reduced chinese influence and for many chinese this appeared as a betrayal after their community had borne the brunt of fighting the japanese occupation the first shots of the malayan emergency were fired at 8:30 am on 16 june 1948 , in the office of the elphil estate twenty miles east of the sungai siput , perak three british plantation managers , arthur walker ( aged 50 ) , john allison ( aged 55 ) and his young assistant , ian christian , were killed by three young chinese men two days later ( june 18 ) , the british enacted emergency measures into law , first in perak in response to the sungai siput incident led by chin peng the remaining malayan communists retreated to rural areas and formed the malayan national liberation army ( mnla ) , although their name has commonly been mistranslated as the malayan races liberation army ( mrla ) or the malayan people 's liberation army ( mpla ) the mnla began their war for malayan independence by targeting the colonial resource extraction industries , namely the tin mines and rubber plantations which were the main sources of income for the british occupation of malaya the mnla attacked these industries in the hopes of bankrupting the british and winning independence by making the colonial administration too expensive to maintain the mnla was partly a re-formation of the malayan peoples ' anti-japanese army ( mpaja ) , the mcp-led guerrilla force which had been the principal resistance in malaya against the japanese occupation the british had secretly helped form the mpaja in 1942 and trained them in the use of explosives , firearms and radios disbanded in december 1945 , the mpaja officially turned in its weapons to the british military administration , although many mpaja soldiers secretly hid stockpiles of weapons in jungle hideouts the mnla commonly employed guerrilla tactics , sabotaging installations , attacking rubber plantations and destroying transportation and infrastructure the mnla was organised into regiments , although these had no fixed establishments and each included all communist forces operating in a particular region on the military front , the security forces did not know how to fight an enemy moving freely in the jungle and enjoying support from the chinese rural population later , in april 1950 , general sir harold briggs , the british army 's director of operations was appointed to malaya these villages were newly constructed in most cases , and were surrounded by barbed wire , police posts , and floodlit areas , designed to keep the inhabitants in and the guerrillas out at the start of the emergency , the british had 13 infantry battalions in malaya , including seven partly formed gurkha battalions , three british battalions , two battalions of the royal malay regiment and a british royal artillery regiment being used as infantry the british brought in soldiers from units such as the royal marines and king 's african rifles thompson 's in-depth experience of jungle warfare proved invaluable during this period as he was able to build effective civil-military relations and was one of the chief architects of the counter-insurgency plan in malaya '' civil-military operations : joint doctrine and the malayan emergency '' , joint force quarterly , autumn 2002 , paragraph 3,4 on 6 october 1951 , the british high commissioner in malaya , sir henry gurney , was assassinated ( see below ) churchill took some time considering a replacement for gurney , eventually appointing general gerald templer as the new british high commissioner in january 1952 '' orthodox historiography suggests that templer changed the situation in the emergency and his actions and policies were a major part of british success during his period in command in the end , the conflict involved a maximum of 40,000 british and other commonwealth troops , against a peak of about 7â€“8,000 communist guerrillas at all levels of the malayan government ( national , state , and district levels ) , the military and civil authority was assumed by a committee of military , police and civilian administration officials the british army soon realised that clumsy sweeps by large formations were unproductive instead , platoons or sections carried out patrols and laid ambushes , based on intelligence from various sources , including informers , surrendered mnla personnel , aerial reconnaissance and so on several of the destroyers fired on communist positions in johor state new zealand 's first contribution came in 1949 , when c-47 dakotas of no new zealand became more directly involved in the conflict in 1955 ; from may , rnzaf de havilland vampires and venoms began to fly strike missions 75 squadron english electric canberras , as well as supply-dropping operations in support of anti-guerrilla forces , using the bristol freighter between 1951 and 1953 , white southern rhodesian volunteers formed '' c '' squadron of the special air service during the four years of fijian involvement , from 1952 to 1956 , some 1,600 fijian troops served the first to arrive were the 1st battalion , fiji infantry regiment twenty-five fijian troops died in combat in malaya the 1st , 2nd , and 3rd battalions of the king 's african rifles from nyasaland , northern rhodesia and kenya respectively also served there suffering 23 losses on 6 october 1951 , the mnla ambushed and killed the british high commissioner , sir henry gurney the killing has been described as a major factor in causing the malayan population to roundly reject the mnla campaign , and also as leading to widespread fear due to the perception that '' if even the high commissioner was no longer safe , there was little hope of protection and safety for the man-in-the-street in malaya '' later , mnla leader chin peng stated that the killing had little effect and that the communists were already altering their strategy , according to new guidelines enshrined in the so-called '' october resolutions '' gurney 's successor , lieutenant general gerald templer , was instructed by the british government to push for immediate measures to give chinese ethnic residents the right to vote the terms of the amnesty were : those of you who come in and surrender will not be prosecuted for any offence connected with the emergency , which you have committed under communist direction , either before this date or in ignorance of this declaration there will be no general '' ceasefire '' but the security forces will be on alert to help those who wish to accept this offer and for this purpose local '' ceasefire '' will be arranged as regards the remainder , restrictions will have to be placed on their liberty but if any of them wish to go to china , their request will be given due consideration some critics in the political circles commented that the amnesty was too restrictive and little more than a restatement of the surrender terms which had been in force for a long period chin ping walked out from the jungle and tried to negotiate with the leader of the federation , tunku abdul rahman , but the british intelligence service worried that the mcp would regain influence in society the meeting was intended to design an end to the conflict but the malayan government representatives , led by tunku abdul rahman , dismissed all of chin peng 's demands as a result , the conflict heightened , and , in response , new zealand sent nzsas soldiers , no 75 squadron rnzaf ; other commonwealth members also sent troops to aid the british the role of the special branch in the malayan emergency cited at length in vietnam war essay on insurgency and counterinsurgency lessons from malaya , ehistory , ohio state university during the emergency , most of mnla members ethnically chinese and drew support from sections of the chinese community however , after this strategy failed , the use of herbicides and defoliants in effort to fight the insurgents was restarted under the command of british general gerald templer in february 1953 , as a means of destroying food crops grown by communist forces in jungle clearings in the late 1960s , the coverage of the my lai massacre during the vietnam war prompted the initiation of investigations in the uk concerning alleged war crimes perpetrated by british forces during the emergency , such as the batang kali massacre throughout the series porridge , there are references to fletcher having served in malaya , probably as a result of national service

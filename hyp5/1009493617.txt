the details of rameau 's life are generally obscure , especially concerning his first forty years , before he moved to paris for good early years , 1683–1732 rameau 's early years are particularly obscure the couple had eleven children ( five girls and six boys ) , of whom jean-philippe was the seventh rameau was taught music before he could read or write 207–08 initially intended for the law , rameau decided he wanted to be a musician , and his father sent him to italy , where he stayed for a short while in milan on his return , he worked as a violinist in travelling companies and then as an organist in provincial cathedrals before moving to paris for the first time 3 here , in 1706 , he published his earliest known compositions : the harpsichord works that make up his first book of pièces de clavecin , which show the influence of his friend louis marchand 87 in 1709 , he moved back to dijon to take over his father 's job as organist in the main church the contract was for six years , but rameau left before then and took up similar posts in lyon and clermont-ferrand new grove rameau took his first tentative steps into composing stage music when the writer alexis piron asked him to provide songs for his popular comic plays written for the paris fairs four collaborations followed , beginning with l'endriague in 1723 ; none of the music has survived 215 on 25 february 1726 rameau married the 19-year-old marie-louise mangot , who came from a musical family from lyon and was a good singer and instrumentalist the couple would have four children , two boys and two girls , and the marriage is said to have been a happy one 8 in spite of his fame as a music theorist , rameau had trouble finding a post as an organist in paris it was not until he was approaching 50 that rameau decided to embark on the operatic career on which his fame as a composer mainly rests he had already approached writer antoine houdar de la motte for a libretto in 1727 , but nothing came of it ; he was finally inspired to try his hand at the prestigious genre of tragédie en musique after seeing montéclair 's jephté in 1732 rameau 's hippolyte et aricie premiered at the académie royale de musique on 1 october 1733 some , such as the composer andré campra , were stunned by its originality and wealth of invention ; others found its harmonic innovations discordant and saw the work as an attack on the french musical tradition 219 just before this time , rameau had made the acquaintance of the powerful financier alexandre le riche de la poupelinière , who became his patron until 1753 la poupelinière 's mistress ( and later , wife ) , thérèse des hayes , was rameau 's pupil and a great admirer of his music 221–23 their first project , the tragédie en musique samson , was abandoned because an opera on a religious theme by voltaire—a notorious critic of the church—was likely to be banned by the authorities 220 meanwhile , rameau had introduced his new musical style into the lighter genre of the opéra-ballet with the highly successful les indes galantes all these operas of the 1730s are among rameau 's most highly regarded works 256 however , the composer followed them with six years of silence , in which the only work he produced was a new version of dardanus ( 1744 ) though best known today as a thinker , rousseau had ambitions to be a composer he had written an opera , les muses galantes ( inspired by rameau 's indes galantes ) , but rameau was unimpressed by this musical tribute at the end of 1745 , voltaire and rameau , who were busy on other works , commissioned rousseau to turn la princesse de navarre into a new opera , with linking recitative , called les fêtes de ramire 232 rousseau was a major participant in the second great quarrel that erupted over rameau 's work , the so-called querelle des bouffons of 1752–54 , which pitted french tragédie en musique against italian opera buffa this time , rameau was accused of being out of date and his music too complicated in comparison with the simplicity and '' naturalness '' of a work like pergolesi 's la serva padrona 830 in the mid-1750s , rameau criticised rousseau 's contributions to the musical articles in the encyclopédie , which led to a quarrel with the leading philosophes d'alembert and diderot 236–38 as a result , jean-françois rameau became a character in diderot 's then-unpublished dialogue , le neveu de rameau ( rameau 's nephew ) the daughter of harpsichord maker jacques goermans , she went by the name of madame de saint-aubin , and her opportunistic husband pushed her into the arms of the rich financier rameau pursued his activities as a theorist and composer until his death after that , his rate of productivity dropped off , probably due to old age and ill health , although he was still able to write another comic opera , les paladins , in 1760 this was due to be followed by a final tragédie en musique , les boréades ; but for unknown reasons , the opera was never produced and had to wait until the late 20th century for a proper staging piron explained that '' his heart and soul were in his harpsichord ; once he had shut its lid , there was no one home 16 physically , rameau was tall and exceptionally thin , girdlestone p financial security came late to him , following the success of his stage works and the grant of a royal pension ( a few months before his death , he was also ennobled and made a knight of the ordre de saint-michel ) nevertheless , it is not solely addressed to the intelligence , and rameau himself claimed , '' i try to conceal art with art besides , no borrowings have been found from other composers , although his earliest works show the influence of other music , in les fêtes d'hébé , we find l'entretien des muses , the musette , and the tambourin , taken from the 1724 book of harpsichord pieces , as well as an aria from the cantata le berger fidèle only four motets have been attributed to rameau with any certainty : deus noster refugium , in convertendo , quam dilecta , and laboravi cantatas were rameau 's first contact with dramatic music five essential components may be discerned in rameau 's operatic scores : pieces of '' pure '' music ( overtures , ritornello , music which closes scenes ) for instance , both orfeo and the 1737 version of castor et pollux open with the funeral of one of the leading characters who later comes back to life '' his fame subsequently spread throughout all europe , and his treatise became the definitive authority on music theory , forming the foundation for instruction in western music that persists to this day rct 60 – zaïs ( 1748 ) rct 49 – naïs ( 1749 ) rct 29 – acante et céphise or la sympathie ( 1751 ) rct 34 – daphnis et eglé ( 1753 ) jordi savall , alia vox , avsa 9882 sheet music rameau free sheet music from the mutopia project

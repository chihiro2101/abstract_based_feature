the details of rameau 's life are generally obscure , especially concerning his first forty years , before he moved to paris for good he was a secretive man , and even his wife knew nothing of his early life , beaussant p rameau 's early years are particularly obscure rameau ( 1764 ) his father , jean , worked as an organist in several churches around dijon , and his mother , claudine demartinécourt , was the daughter of a notary rameau was taught music before he could read or write he was educated at the jesuit college at godrans , but he was not a good pupil and disrupted classes with his singing , later claiming that his passion for opera had begun at the age of twelve 207–08 initially intended for the law , rameau decided he wanted to be a musician , and his father sent him to italy , where he stayed for a short while in milan on his return , he worked as a violinist in travelling companies and then as an organist in provincial cathedrals before moving to paris for the first time 3 here , in 1706 , he published his earliest known compositions : the harpsichord works that make up his first book of pièces de clavecin , which show the influence of his friend louis marchand in 1722 , he returned to paris for good , and here he published his most important work of music theory , traité de l'harmonie ( treatise on harmony ) new grove rameau took his first tentative steps into composing stage music when the writer alexis piron asked him to provide songs for his popular comic plays written for the paris fairs 215 on 25 february 1726 rameau married the 19-year-old marie-louise mangot , who came from a musical family from lyon and was a good singer and instrumentalist the couple would have four children , two boys and two girls , and the marriage is said to have been a happy one 8 in spite of his fame as a music theorist , rameau had trouble finding a post as an organist in paris it was not until he was approaching 50 that rameau decided to embark on the operatic career on which his fame as a composer mainly rests rameau 's hippolyte et aricie premiered at the académie royale de musique on 1 october 1733 it was immediately recognised as the most significant opera to appear in france since the death of lully , but audiences were split over whether this was a good thing or a bad thing la poupelinière 's mistress ( and later , wife ) , thérèse des hayes , was rameau 's pupil and a great admirer of his music in 1731 , rameau became the conductor of la poupelinière 's private orchestra , which was of an extremely high quality 475 la poupelinière 's salon enabled rameau to meet some of the leading cultural figures of the day , including voltaire , who soon began collaborating with the composer 221–23 their first project , the tragédie en musique samson , was abandoned because an opera on a religious theme by voltaire—a notorious critic of the church—was likely to be banned by the authorities it was followed by two tragédies en musique , castor et pollux ( 1737 ) and dardanus ( 1739 ) , and another opéra-ballet , les fêtes d'hébé ( also 1739 ) he received several commissions from the court for works to celebrate the french victory at the battle of fontenoy and the marriage of the dauphin to infanta maria teresa rafaela of spain rameau produced his most important comic opera , platée , as well as two collaborations with voltaire : the opéra-ballet le temple de la gloire and the comédie-ballet la princesse de navarre 228–30 they gained rameau official recognition ; he was granted the title '' compositeur du cabinet du roi '' and given a substantial pension though best known today as a thinker , rousseau had ambitions to be a composer he had written an opera , les muses galantes ( inspired by rameau 's indes galantes ) , but rameau was unimpressed by this musical tribute rousseau then claimed the two had stolen the credit for the words and music he had contributed , though musicologists have been able to identify almost nothing of the piece as rousseau 's work nevertheless , the embittered rousseau nursed a grudge against rameau for the rest of his life 232 rousseau was a major participant in the second great quarrel that erupted over rameau 's work , the so-called querelle des bouffons of 1752–54 , which pitted french tragédie en musique against italian opera buffa this time , rameau was accused of being out of date and his music too complicated in comparison with the simplicity and '' naturalness '' of a work like pergolesi 's la serva padrona 830 in the mid-1750s , rameau criticised rousseau 's contributions to the musical articles in the encyclopédie , which led to a quarrel with the leading philosophes d'alembert and diderot rameau pursued his activities as a theorist and composer until his death 846 rameau died on 12 september 1764 after suffering from a fever , thirteen days before his 81st birthday eustache , paris on the same day of his death while the details of his biography are vague and fragmentary , the details of rameau 's personal and family life are almost completely obscure it is difficult to imagine him among the leading wits , including voltaire ( to whom he bears more than a passing physical resemblance ) , who frequented la poupelinière 's salon ; his music was his passport , and it made up for his lack of social graces he helped his nephew jean-françois when he came to paris and also helped establish the career of claude-bénigne balbastre in the capital rameau 's music is characterised by the exceptional technical knowledge of a composer who wanted above all to be renowned as a theorist of the art '' the paradox of this music was that it was new , using techniques never known before , but it took place within the framework of old-fashioned forms judging by the evidence , it was not his favourite field , but rather , simply a way of making reasonable money the french cantata , which should not be confused with the italian or the german cantata , was '' invented '' in 1706 by the poet jean-baptiste rousseau girdlestone p during his semiretirement ( 1740 to 1744 ) he wrote the pièces de clavecin en concert ( 1741 ) , which some musicologists consider the pinnacle of french baroque chamber music the italian opera of rameau 's day ( opera seria , opera buffa ) was essentially divided into musical sections ( da capo arias , duets , trios , etc even in his earliest works , where he uses the french overture , rameau—the born symphonist and master of orchestration—composes novel and unique pieces by the end of his life , rameau 's music had come under attack in france from theorists who favoured italian models 418 in 1894 , composer vincent d'indy founded the schola cantorum to promote french national music ; the society put on several revivals of works by rameau '' his fame subsequently spread throughout all europe , and his treatise became the definitive authority on music theory , forming the foundation for instruction in western music that persists to this day jordi savall , alia vox , avsa 9882 sheet music rameau free sheet music from the mutopia project

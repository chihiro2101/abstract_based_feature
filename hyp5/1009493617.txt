the details of rameau 's life are generally obscure , especially concerning his first forty years , before he moved to paris for good he was a secretive man , and even his wife knew nothing of his early life , beaussant p rameau 's early years are particularly obscure rameau ( 1764 ) his father , jean , worked as an organist in several churches around dijon , and his mother , claudine demartinécourt , was the daughter of a notary on his return , he worked as a violinist in travelling companies and then as an organist in provincial cathedrals before moving to paris for the first time 3 here , in 1706 , he published his earliest known compositions : the harpsichord works that make up his first book of pièces de clavecin , which show the influence of his friend louis marchand in 1722 , he returned to paris for good , and here he published his most important work of music theory , traité de l'harmonie ( treatise on harmony ) this soon won him a great reputation , and it was followed in 1726 by his nouveau système de musique théorique 7 in 1724 and 1729 ( or 1730 ) , he also published two more collections of harpsichord pieces new grove rameau took his first tentative steps into composing stage music when the writer alexis piron asked him to provide songs for his popular comic plays written for the paris fairs four collaborations followed , beginning with l'endriague in 1723 ; none of the music has survived 215 on 25 february 1726 rameau married the 19-year-old marie-louise mangot , who came from a musical family from lyon and was a good singer and instrumentalist the couple would have four children , two boys and two girls , and the marriage is said to have been a happy one some , such as the composer andré campra , were stunned by its originality and wealth of invention ; others found its harmonic innovations discordant and saw the work as an attack on the french musical tradition 219 just before this time , rameau had made the acquaintance of the powerful financier alexandre le riche de la poupelinière , who became his patron until 1753 la poupelinière 's mistress ( and later , wife ) , thérèse des hayes , was rameau 's pupil and a great admirer of his music in 1731 , rameau became the conductor of la poupelinière 's private orchestra , which was of an extremely high quality 221–23 their first project , the tragédie en musique samson , was abandoned because an opera on a religious theme by voltaire—a notorious critic of the church—was likely to be banned by the authorities 220 meanwhile , rameau had introduced his new musical style into the lighter genre of the opéra-ballet with the highly successful les indes galantes the reason for this interval in the composer 's creative life is unknown , although it is possible he had a falling-out with the authorities at the académie royale de la musique rameau produced his most important comic opera , platée , as well as two collaborations with voltaire : the opéra-ballet le temple de la gloire and the comédie-ballet la princesse de navarre though best known today as a thinker , rousseau had ambitions to be a composer he had written an opera , les muses galantes ( inspired by rameau 's indes galantes ) , but rameau was unimpressed by this musical tribute at the end of 1745 , voltaire and rameau , who were busy on other works , commissioned rousseau to turn la princesse de navarre into a new opera , with linking recitative , called les fêtes de ramire rousseau then claimed the two had stolen the credit for the words and music he had contributed , though musicologists have been able to identify almost nothing of the piece as rousseau 's work 232 rousseau was a major participant in the second great quarrel that erupted over rameau 's work , the so-called querelle des bouffons of 1752–54 , which pitted french tragédie en musique against italian opera buffa this time , rameau was accused of being out of date and his music too complicated in comparison with the simplicity and '' naturalness '' of a work like pergolesi 's la serva padrona she had la poupelinière engage the services of the bohemian composer johann stamitz , who succeeded rameau after a breach developed between rameau and his patron ; however , by then , rameau no longer needed la poupelinière 's financial support and protection after that , his rate of productivity dropped off , probably due to old age and ill health , although he was still able to write another comic opera , les paladins , in 1760 this was due to be followed by a final tragédie en musique , les boréades ; but for unknown reasons , the opera was never produced and had to wait until the late 20th century for a proper staging 240 although a bronze bust and red marble tombstone were erected in his memory there by the société de la compositeurs de musique in 1883 , the exact site of his burial remains unknown to this day while the details of his biography are vague and fragmentary , the details of rameau 's personal and family life are almost completely obscure '' his speech was difficult to understand , just like his handwriting , which was never fluent as a man , he was secretive , solitary , irritable , proud of his own achievements ( more as a theorist than as a composer ) , brusque with those who contradicted him , and quick to anger furthermore , he gave his daughter marie-louise a considerable dowry when she became a visitandine nun in 1750 , and he paid a pension to one of his sisters when she became ill rameau 's music is characterised by the exceptional technical knowledge of a composer who wanted above all to be renowned as a theorist of the art '' the paradox of this music was that it was new , using techniques never known before , but it took place within the framework of old-fashioned forms besides , no borrowings have been found from other composers , although his earliest works show the influence of other music for at least 26 years , rameau was a professional organist in the service of religious institutions , and yet the body of sacred music he composed is exceptionally small and his organ works nonexistent the cantata was a highly successful genre in the early 18th century the french cantata , which should not be confused with the italian or the german cantata , was '' invented '' in 1706 by the poet jean-baptiste rousseau girdlestone p rameau and couperin had different styles , and it seems they did not know one another : couperin was one of the official court musicians ; rameau , fifteen years his junior , achieved fame only after couperin 's death rameau published his first book of harpsichord pieces in 1706 '' ) rameau 's music includes pieces in the pure tradition of the french suite : imitative ( '' le rappel des oiseaux , '' '' la poule '' ) and characterful ( '' les tendres plaintes , '' '' l'entretien des muses '' ) this form of continuous music prefigures wagnerian drama even more than does the '' reform '' opera of gluck dance music : the danced interludes , which were obligatory even in tragédie en musique , allowed rameau to give free rein to his inimitable sense of rhythm , melody , and choreography , acknowledged by all his contemporaries , including the dancers themselves 563 choruses : padre martini , the erudite musicologist who corresponded with rameau , affirmed that '' the french are excellent at choruses , '' obviously thinking of rameau himself rameau , like so many others , was flung into the enemy 's face to bolster our courage and our faith in the national destiny of france rct 60 – zaïs ( 1748 ) rct 49 – naïs ( 1749 ) rct 29 – acante et céphise or la sympathie ( 1751 ) rct 34 – daphnis et eglé ( 1753 )

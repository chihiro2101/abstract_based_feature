the details of rameau 's life are generally obscure , especially concerning his first forty years , before he moved to paris for good rameau ( 1764 ) his father , jean , worked as an organist in several churches around dijon , and his mother , claudine demartinécourt , was the daughter of a notary rameau was taught music before he could read or write 3 here , in 1706 , he published his earliest known compositions : the harpsichord works that make up his first book of pièces de clavecin , which show the influence of his friend louis marchand the contract was for six years , but rameau left before then and took up similar posts in lyon and clermont-ferrand during this period , he composed motets for church performance as well as secular cantatas in 1722 , he returned to paris for good , and here he published his most important work of music theory , traité de l'harmonie ( treatise on harmony ) this soon won him a great reputation , and it was followed in 1726 by his nouveau système de musique théorique 7 in 1724 and 1729 ( or 1730 ) , he also published two more collections of harpsichord pieces new grove rameau took his first tentative steps into composing stage music when the writer alexis piron asked him to provide songs for his popular comic plays written for the paris fairs 215 on 25 february 1726 rameau married the 19-year-old marie-louise mangot , who came from a musical family from lyon and was a good singer and instrumentalist the couple would have four children , two boys and two girls , and the marriage is said to have been a happy one 8 in spite of his fame as a music theorist , rameau had trouble finding a post as an organist in paris it was not until he was approaching 50 that rameau decided to embark on the operatic career on which his fame as a composer mainly rests rameau 's hippolyte et aricie premiered at the académie royale de musique on 1 october 1733 it was immediately recognised as the most significant opera to appear in france since the death of lully , but audiences were split over whether this was a good thing or a bad thing some , such as the composer andré campra , were stunned by its originality and wealth of invention ; others found its harmonic innovations discordant and saw the work as an attack on the french musical tradition 219 just before this time , rameau had made the acquaintance of the powerful financier alexandre le riche de la poupelinière , who became his patron until 1753 la poupelinière 's mistress ( and later , wife ) , thérèse des hayes , was rameau 's pupil and a great admirer of his music 220 meanwhile , rameau had introduced his new musical style into the lighter genre of the opéra-ballet with the highly successful les indes galantes all these operas of the 1730s are among rameau 's most highly regarded works the reason for this interval in the composer 's creative life is unknown , although it is possible he had a falling-out with the authorities at the académie royale de la musique he received several commissions from the court for works to celebrate the french victory at the battle of fontenoy and the marriage of the dauphin to infanta maria teresa rafaela of spain he had written an opera , les muses galantes ( inspired by rameau 's indes galantes ) , but rameau was unimpressed by this musical tribute at the end of 1745 , voltaire and rameau , who were busy on other works , commissioned rousseau to turn la princesse de navarre into a new opera , with linking recitative , called les fêtes de ramire rousseau then claimed the two had stolen the credit for the words and music he had contributed , though musicologists have been able to identify almost nothing of the piece as rousseau 's work nevertheless , the embittered rousseau nursed a grudge against rameau for the rest of his life 232 rousseau was a major participant in the second great quarrel that erupted over rameau 's work , the so-called querelle des bouffons of 1752–54 , which pitted french tragédie en musique against italian opera buffa this time , rameau was accused of being out of date and his music too complicated in comparison with the simplicity and '' naturalness '' of a work like pergolesi 's la serva padrona 830 in the mid-1750s , rameau criticised rousseau 's contributions to the musical articles in the encyclopédie , which led to a quarrel with the leading philosophes d'alembert and diderot the daughter of harpsichord maker jacques goermans , she went by the name of madame de saint-aubin , and her opportunistic husband pushed her into the arms of the rich financier this was due to be followed by a final tragédie en musique , les boréades ; but for unknown reasons , the opera was never produced and had to wait until the late 20th century for a proper staging rameau 's music , so graceful and attractive , completely contradicts the man 's public image and what we know of his character as described ( or perhaps unfairly caricatured ) by diderot in his satirical novel rameau 's nephew piron explained that '' his heart and soul were in his harpsichord ; once he had shut its lid , there was no one home it is difficult to imagine him among the leading wits , including voltaire ( to whom he bears more than a passing physical resemblance ) , who frequented la poupelinière 's salon ; his music was his passport , and it made up for his lack of social graces furthermore , he gave his daughter marie-louise a considerable dowry when she became a visitandine nun in 1750 , and he paid a pension to one of his sisters when she became ill general character of rameau 's music rameau 's music is characterised by the exceptional technical knowledge of a composer who wanted above all to be renowned as a theorist of the art rameau appeared revolutionary to the lullyistes , disturbed by complex harmony of his music ; and reactionary to the '' philosophes , '' who only paid attention to its content and who either would not or could not listen to the sound it made for at least 26 years , rameau was a professional organist in the service of religious institutions , and yet the body of sacred music he composed is exceptionally small and his organ works nonexistent rameau 's few religious compositions are nevertheless remarkable and compare favourably to the works of specialists in the area only four motets have been attributed to rameau with any certainty : deus noster refugium , in convertendo , quam dilecta , and laboravi the french cantata , which should not be confused with the italian or the german cantata , was '' invented '' in 1706 by the poet jean-baptiste rousseau girdlestone p rameau and couperin had different styles , and it seems they did not know one another : couperin was one of the official court musicians ; rameau , fifteen years his junior , achieved fame only after couperin 's death five essential components may be discerned in rameau 's operatic scores : pieces of '' pure '' music ( overtures , ritornello , music which closes scenes ) 563 choruses : padre martini , the erudite musicologist who corresponded with rameau , affirmed that '' the french are excellent at choruses , '' obviously thinking of rameau himself 277 for most of the 19th century , rameau 's music remained unplayed , known only by reputation rct 53 – platée or junon jalouse ( 1745 ) , score rct 51 – les paladins or le vénitien ( 1760 ) rameau ( 1749 ) démonstration du principe de l'harmonie ( paris , 1750 ) nouvelles réflexions de m

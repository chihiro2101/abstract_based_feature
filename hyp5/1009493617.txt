the details of rameau 's life are generally obscure , especially concerning his first forty years , before he moved to paris for good he was a secretive man , and even his wife knew nothing of his early life , beaussant p rameau ( 1764 ) his father , jean , worked as an organist in several churches around dijon , and his mother , claudine demartinécourt , was the daughter of a notary on his return , he worked as a violinist in travelling companies and then as an organist in provincial cathedrals before moving to paris for the first time 3 here , in 1706 , he published his earliest known compositions : the harpsichord works that make up his first book of pièces de clavecin , which show the influence of his friend louis marchand 87 in 1709 , he moved back to dijon to take over his father 's job as organist in the main church the contract was for six years , but rameau left before then and took up similar posts in lyon and clermont-ferrand in 1722 , he returned to paris for good , and here he published his most important work of music theory , traité de l'harmonie ( treatise on harmony ) this soon won him a great reputation , and it was followed in 1726 by his nouveau système de musique théorique the couple would have four children , two boys and two girls , and the marriage is said to have been a happy one 8 in spite of his fame as a music theorist , rameau had trouble finding a post as an organist in paris he had already approached writer antoine houdar de la motte for a libretto in 1727 , but nothing came of it ; he was finally inspired to try his hand at the prestigious genre of tragédie en musique after seeing montéclair 's jephté in 1732 it was immediately recognised as the most significant opera to appear in france since the death of lully , but audiences were split over whether this was a good thing or a bad thing some , such as the composer andré campra , were stunned by its originality and wealth of invention ; others found its harmonic innovations discordant and saw the work as an attack on the french musical tradition the two camps , the so-called lullyistes and the rameauneurs , fought a pamphlet war over the issue for the rest of the decade 219 just before this time , rameau had made the acquaintance of the powerful financier alexandre le riche de la poupelinière , who became his patron until 1753 la poupelinière 's mistress ( and later , wife ) , thérèse des hayes , was rameau 's pupil and a great admirer of his music he held the post for 22 years ; he was succeeded by johann stamitz and then françois-joseph gossec 475 la poupelinière 's salon enabled rameau to meet some of the leading cultural figures of the day , including voltaire , who soon began collaborating with the composer 220 meanwhile , rameau had introduced his new musical style into the lighter genre of the opéra-ballet with the highly successful les indes galantes it was followed by two tragédies en musique , castor et pollux ( 1737 ) and dardanus ( 1739 ) , and another opéra-ballet , les fêtes d'hébé ( also 1739 ) all these operas of the 1730s are among rameau 's most highly regarded works the reason for this interval in the composer 's creative life is unknown , although it is possible he had a falling-out with the authorities at the académie royale de la musique he received several commissions from the court for works to celebrate the french victory at the battle of fontenoy and the marriage of the dauphin to infanta maria teresa rafaela of spain rameau produced his most important comic opera , platée , as well as two collaborations with voltaire : the opéra-ballet le temple de la gloire and the comédie-ballet la princesse de navarre 228–30 they gained rameau official recognition ; he was granted the title '' compositeur du cabinet du roi '' and given a substantial pension he had written an opera , les muses galantes ( inspired by rameau 's indes galantes ) , but rameau was unimpressed by this musical tribute at the end of 1745 , voltaire and rameau , who were busy on other works , commissioned rousseau to turn la princesse de navarre into a new opera , with linking recitative , called les fêtes de ramire in 1753 , la poupelinière took a scheming musician , jeanne-thérèse goermans , as his mistress the daughter of harpsichord maker jacques goermans , she went by the name of madame de saint-aubin , and her opportunistic husband pushed her into the arms of the rich financier rameau pursued his activities as a theorist and composer until his death he lived with his wife and two of his children in his large suite of rooms in rue des bons-enfants , which he would leave every day , lost in thought , to take a solitary walk in the nearby gardens of the palais-royal or the tuileries after that , his rate of productivity dropped off , probably due to old age and ill health , although he was still able to write another comic opera , les paladins , in 1760 240 although a bronze bust and red marble tombstone were erected in his memory there by the société de la compositeurs de musique in 1883 , the exact site of his burial remains unknown to this day rameau 's music , so graceful and attractive , completely contradicts the man 's public image and what we know of his character as described ( or perhaps unfairly caricatured ) by diderot in his satirical novel rameau 's nephew it occupied his entire thinking ; philippe beaussant calls him a monomaniac piron explained that '' his heart and soul were in his harpsichord ; once he had shut its lid , there was no one home 16 physically , rameau was tall and exceptionally thin , girdlestone p it is difficult to imagine him among the leading wits , including voltaire ( to whom he bears more than a passing physical resemblance ) , who frequented la poupelinière 's salon ; his music was his passport , and it made up for his lack of social graces but he did not change his way of life , keeping his worn-out clothes , his single pair of shoes , and his old furniture in his rooms in rue des bons-enfants , yet he also had a bag containing 1691 gold louis rameau 's music is characterised by the exceptional technical knowledge of a composer who wanted above all to be renowned as a theorist of the art in his last years , rameau returned to a renewed version of his early style in les paladins and les boréades among the audience was claude debussy , who especially cherished castor et pollux , revived in 1903 : '' gluck 's genius was deeply rooted in rameau 's works a detailed comparison allows us to affirm that gluck could replace rameau on the french stage only by assimilating the latter 's beautiful works and making them his own rct numbering refers to rameau catalogue thématique established by sylvie bouissou and denis herlin rct 17 – ah ! loin de rire , pleurons ( soprano , alto , tenor , bass ) ( pub rct 60 – zaïs ( 1748 ) rct 49 – naïs ( 1749 ) rct 29 – acante et céphise or la sympathie ( 1751 ) rct 34 – daphnis et eglé ( 1753 ) notes sources beaussant , philippe , rameau de a à z ( fayard , 1983 ) gibbons , william

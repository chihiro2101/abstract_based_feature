the details of rameau 's life are generally obscure , especially concerning his first forty years , before he moved to paris for good he was a secretive man , and even his wife knew nothing of his early life , beaussant p rameau ( 1764 ) his father , jean , worked as an organist in several churches around dijon , and his mother , claudine demartinécourt , was the daughter of a notary 207–08 initially intended for the law , rameau decided he wanted to be a musician , and his father sent him to italy , where he stayed for a short while in milan 3 here , in 1706 , he published his earliest known compositions : the harpsichord works that make up his first book of pièces de clavecin , which show the influence of his friend louis marchand the contract was for six years , but rameau left before then and took up similar posts in lyon and clermont-ferrand in 1722 , he returned to paris for good , and here he published his most important work of music theory , traité de l'harmonie ( treatise on harmony ) this soon won him a great reputation , and it was followed in 1726 by his nouveau système de musique théorique 7 in 1724 and 1729 ( or 1730 ) , he also published two more collections of harpsichord pieces new grove rameau took his first tentative steps into composing stage music when the writer alexis piron asked him to provide songs for his popular comic plays written for the paris fairs 8 in spite of his fame as a music theorist , rameau had trouble finding a post as an organist in paris it was not until he was approaching 50 that rameau decided to embark on the operatic career on which his fame as a composer mainly rests he had already approached writer antoine houdar de la motte for a libretto in 1727 , but nothing came of it ; he was finally inspired to try his hand at the prestigious genre of tragédie en musique after seeing montéclair 's jephté in 1732 rameau 's hippolyte et aricie premiered at the académie royale de musique on 1 october 1733 it was immediately recognised as the most significant opera to appear in france since the death of lully , but audiences were split over whether this was a good thing or a bad thing some , such as the composer andré campra , were stunned by its originality and wealth of invention ; others found its harmonic innovations discordant and saw the work as an attack on the french musical tradition 219 just before this time , rameau had made the acquaintance of the powerful financier alexandre le riche de la poupelinière , who became his patron until 1753 la poupelinière 's mistress ( and later , wife ) , thérèse des hayes , was rameau 's pupil and a great admirer of his music in 1731 , rameau became the conductor of la poupelinière 's private orchestra , which was of an extremely high quality he held the post for 22 years ; he was succeeded by johann stamitz and then françois-joseph gossec 475 la poupelinière 's salon enabled rameau to meet some of the leading cultural figures of the day , including voltaire , who soon began collaborating with the composer 220 meanwhile , rameau had introduced his new musical style into the lighter genre of the opéra-ballet with the highly successful les indes galantes 256 however , the composer followed them with six years of silence , in which the only work he produced was a new version of dardanus ( 1744 ) 228–30 they gained rameau official recognition ; he was granted the title '' compositeur du cabinet du roi '' and given a substantial pension though best known today as a thinker , rousseau had ambitions to be a composer he had written an opera , les muses galantes ( inspired by rameau 's indes galantes ) , but rameau was unimpressed by this musical tribute at the end of 1745 , voltaire and rameau , who were busy on other works , commissioned rousseau to turn la princesse de navarre into a new opera , with linking recitative , called les fêtes de ramire rousseau then claimed the two had stolen the credit for the words and music he had contributed , though musicologists have been able to identify almost nothing of the piece as rousseau 's work 232 rousseau was a major participant in the second great quarrel that erupted over rameau 's work , the so-called querelle des bouffons of 1752–54 , which pitted french tragédie en musique against italian opera buffa this time , rameau was accused of being out of date and his music too complicated in comparison with the simplicity and '' naturalness '' of a work like pergolesi 's la serva padrona 236–38 as a result , jean-françois rameau became a character in diderot 's then-unpublished dialogue , le neveu de rameau ( rameau 's nephew ) rameau pursued his activities as a theorist and composer until his death throughout his life , music was his consuming passion in fact , it seems that his thriftiness was the result of long years spent in obscurity ( when his income was uncertain and scanty ) rather than part of his character , because he could also be generous he helped his nephew jean-françois when he came to paris and also helped establish the career of claude-bénigne balbastre in the capital '' the paradox of this music was that it was new , using techniques never known before , but it took place within the framework of old-fashioned forms besides , no borrowings have been found from other composers , although his earliest works show the influence of other music for at least 26 years , rameau was a professional organist in the service of religious institutions , and yet the body of sacred music he composed is exceptionally small and his organ works nonexistent only four motets have been attributed to rameau with any certainty : deus noster refugium , in convertendo , quam dilecta , and laboravi the cantata was a highly successful genre in the early 18th century 55 and soon taken up by many famous composers of the day , such as montéclair , campra , and clérambault rameau and couperin had different styles , and it seems they did not know one another : couperin was one of the official court musicians ; rameau , fifteen years his junior , achieved fame only after couperin 's death rameau published his first book of harpsichord pieces in 1706 '' ) rameau 's music includes pieces in the pure tradition of the french suite : imitative ( '' le rappel des oiseaux , '' '' la poule '' ) and characterful ( '' les tendres plaintes , '' '' l'entretien des muses '' ) by the end of his life , rameau 's music had come under attack in france from theorists who favoured italian models rameau posited the discovery of the '' fundamental law '' or what he referred to as the '' fundamental bass '' of all western music '' his fame subsequently spread throughout all europe , and his treatise became the definitive authority on music theory , forming the foundation for instruction in western music that persists to this day 1713–1715 ) rct 16 – laboravi ( published in the traité de l'harmonie , 1722 ) rct 60 – zaïs ( 1748 ) rct 49 – naïs ( 1749 ) rct 29 – acante et céphise or la sympathie ( 1751 ) rct 34 – daphnis et eglé ( 1753 )

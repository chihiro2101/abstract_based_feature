today , some towers have as many as sixteen bells that can be rung together , though six or eight bells are more common for convenience , the bells are referred to by number , with the treble being number 1 and the other bells numbered by their pitch & mdash ; 2,3,4 , etc ) the bells are usually tuned to a diatonic major scale , with the tenor bell being the tonic ( or key ) note of the scale some towers contain additional bells so that different subsets of the full number can be rung , still to a diatonic scale a flat sixth in a 12-bell ring is in fact the flattened 7th of the scale which if rung instead of the normal number 6 bell allows 2 to 9 to be rung as light diatonic octave ; other variations are also possible dove entry for worcester cathedral , a twelve bell tower with 3 semi-tone bells the bells in a tower reside in the bell chamber or belfry usually with louver to enable the sound to escape each bell is suspended from a headstock fitted on trunnions ( plain or non-friction bearings ) mounted to the belfry framework so that the bell assembly can rotate within the bell the clapper is constrained to swing in the direction that the bell swings typically , the rope 's length is such that it falls close to or on to the floor of the ringing chamber a bell that is up is dangerous to be near , and only expert ringers should ever contemplate entering a bell chamber or touching a rope when the bells are up bellringers typically stand in a circle around the ringing chamber , each managing one rope bells and their attendant ropes are so mounted that the ropes are pulled in a circular sequence , usually clockwise , starting with the lightest ( treble ) bell and descending to the heaviest ( tenor ) as the bell swings downwards the rope unwinds from the wheel and the ringer adds enough pull to counteract friction and air resistance the bell winds the rope back onto the other side of the wheel as it rises and the ringer can slow ( or check ) the rise of the bell if required the ringer pulls on the sally and when the bell swings up it draws up more rope onto the wheel and the sally rises to , or beyond , the ceiling in english-style ringing the bell is rung up such that the clapper is resting on the lower edge of the bell when the bell is on the stay during each swing , the clapper travels faster than the bell , eventually striking the soundbow and making the bell sound to achieve this , the ringer must work with the bell 's momentum , applying just the right amount of effort during the pull that the bell swings as far as required and no further this allows two adjacent bells to reverse positions , the quicker bell passing the slower bell to establish a new pattern although ringing up certainly involves some physical exertion , actual ringing should rely more on practised skill than mere brute force despite this colossal weight , it can be safely rung by one ( experienced ) ringer ( whilst heavier bells exist—for example big ben—they are generally only chimed , either by swinging the bell slightly or having the bell hung dead and using a mechanical hammer this was the original sequence used before change ringing was developed , and change ringing always starts and ends with this sequence two forms of ringing changes have developed ; call changes : where the conductor of the ringing commands each change pub central council of church bell ringers , 1994 '' call change ringing requires one ringer to give commands to change the order of the bells , as distinct from method ringing , where the ringers memorise the course of bells as part of a continuous pattern bell ringing- the english art of change ringing in call change ringing each different sequence of the bells , known as a '' row '' , is specifically called out by one ringer , the '' conductor '' , who instructs the other ringers how to change their bells ' places from row to row the change is made at the next '' handstroke '' ( when the sally on the bell rope is pulled ) , after the call clapper – the metal ( usually cast iron ) rod/hammer hung from a pivot below the crown of the bell , that strikes the soundbow of the bell when the bell stops moving tenor ) ringing at the end of every row , while the other bells ring a method lead end – the change on which the treble is leading ( ringing first ) at its backstroke

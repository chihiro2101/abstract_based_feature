the term comes from the japanese word boke or , which means '' blur '' or '' haze '' , or boke-aji , the '' blur quality '' the spellings bokeh and boke have both been in use since at least 1996 , when merklinger had suggested '' or bokeh if you prefer '' the term bokeh has appeared in photography books as early as 1998 . bokeh and lens design good bokeh is also important for medium telephoto lenses ( typically 85â€“150 mm on 35 mm format ) bokeh characteristics may be quantified by examining the image 's circle of confusion in out-of-focus areas , each point of light becomes an image of the aperture , generally a more or less round disc this is most apparent when a lens produces hard-edged bokeh recently , photographers have exploited the shape of the bokeh by creating a simple mask out of card with shapes such as hearts or stars , that the photographer wishes the bokeh to be , and placing it over the lens lenses with 11 , 12 , or 15 blade iris diaphragms are often claimed to excel in bokeh quality today it is much easier to make an f/1.8 lens , and a 9-bladed lens at f/1.8 is enough for an 85mm lens to achieve great bokeh bokeh can be made with a combination of both lenses , and shots can be refocused even after they are captured , adding bokeh effects with different depths image : bokeh example.jpg an example of the bokeh produced by the canon 85 mm prime f/1.8 lens file : bokeh1 dsc 0959.jpg a bokeh created with nikon d3300 camera 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 g vr ii lens also , bokeh is not just any blur some advanced digital cameras have bokeh features which take several images with different apertures and focuses and then manually compose them afterward to one image by using barcodes as small as 3 & nbsp ; mm with a small lens over them , if the barcode is viewed out of focus through an ordinary camera focused at infinity , the resulting image is large enough to scan the information in the barcode

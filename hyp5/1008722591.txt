the term comes from the japanese word boke or , which means '' blur '' or '' haze '' , or boke-aji , the '' blur quality '' '' the term bokeh has appeared in photography books as early as 1998 . bokeh and lens design though difficult to quantify , some lenses have subjectively more pleasing out-of-focus areas '' good '' bokeh is especially important for macro lenses and long telephoto lenses , because they are typically used in situations that produce shallow depth of field good bokeh is also important for medium telephoto lenses ( typically 85â€“150 mm on 35 mm format ) bokeh characteristics may be quantified by examining the image 's circle of confusion the shape of the aperture has an influence on the subjective quality of bokeh as well this is most apparent when a lens produces hard-edged bokeh recently , photographers have exploited the shape of the bokeh by creating a simple mask out of card with shapes such as hearts or stars , that the photographer wishes the bokeh to be , and placing it over the lens today it is much easier to make an f/1.8 lens , and a 9-bladed lens at f/1.8 is enough for an 85mm lens to achieve great bokeh some lens manufacturers including nikon , minolta , and sony make lenses designed with specific controls to change the rendering of the out-of-focus areas the minolta stf 135mm f/2.8 t4.5 lens minolta/sony stf 135mm f/2.8 t4.5 ( with stf standing for smooth trans focus ) is a lens specifically designed to produce pleasing bokeh the first , a 20 mp lens , uses a 1/2.78 '' sensor with f/2.0 aperture , while the second , an 8 mp f/2.0 lens , captures depth information bokeh can be made with a combination of both lenses , and shots can be refocused even after they are captured , adding bokeh effects with different depths image : bokeh example.jpg an example of the bokeh produced by the canon 85 mm prime f/1.8 lens bokeh effect and refocusing can then be applied to an image after the photo is taken

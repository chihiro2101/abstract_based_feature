the term comes from the japanese word boke or , which means '' blur '' or '' haze '' , or boke-aji , the '' blur quality '' the spellings bokeh and boke have both been in use since at least 1996 , when merklinger had suggested '' or bokeh if you prefer image : circles of confusion lens diagram.svg thumb right 280px the depth of field is the region where the size of the circle of confusion is less than the resolution of the human eye '' good '' bokeh is especially important for macro lenses and long telephoto lenses , because they are typically used in situations that produce shallow depth of field good bokeh is also important for medium telephoto lenses ( typically 85â€“150 mm on 35 mm format ) bokeh characteristics may be quantified by examining the image 's circle of confusion lenses that are poorly corrected for spherical aberration will show one kind of disc for out-of-focus points in front of the plane of focus , and a different kind for points behind for this reason , some lenses have many aperture blades and/or blades with curved edges to make the aperture more closely approximate a circle rather than a polygon recently , photographers have exploited the shape of the bokeh by creating a simple mask out of card with shapes such as hearts or stars , that the photographer wishes the bokeh to be , and placing it over the lens lenses with 11 , 12 , or 15 blade iris diaphragms are often claimed to excel in bokeh quality today it is much easier to make an f/1.8 lens , and a 9-bladed lens at f/1.8 is enough for an 85mm lens to achieve great bokeh the use of anamorphic lenses will cause bokeh to appear differently along the horizontal and vertical axes of the lens , becoming ellipsoidal compared to those in a spherical lens the first , a 20 mp lens , uses a 1/2.78 '' sensor with f/2.0 aperture , while the second , an 8 mp f/2.0 lens , captures depth information image : bahnhof dortmund brackel spiegeltele dsc02359 smial wp.jpg the bokeh produced by a catadioptric lens ( also called a mirror lens ) image : bokeh example.jpg an example of the bokeh produced by the canon 85 mm prime f/1.8 lens file : bokeh1 dsc 0959.jpg a bokeh created with nikon d3300 camera 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 g vr ii lens bokeh effect and refocusing can then be applied to an image after the photo is taken

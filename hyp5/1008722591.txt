the term comes from the japanese word boke or , which means '' blur '' or '' haze '' , or boke-aji , the '' blur quality '' the spellings bokeh and boke have both been in use since at least 1996 , when merklinger had suggested '' or bokeh if you prefer '' the term bokeh has appeared in photography books as early as 1998 . bokeh and lens design image : circles of confusion lens diagram.svg thumb right 280px the depth of field is the region where the size of the circle of confusion is less than the resolution of the human eye '' good '' bokeh is especially important for macro lenses and long telephoto lenses , because they are typically used in situations that produce shallow depth of field good bokeh is also important for medium telephoto lenses ( typically 85–150 mm on 35 mm format ) in out-of-focus areas , each point of light becomes an image of the aperture , generally a more or less round disc the shape of the aperture has an influence on the subjective quality of bokeh as well for this reason , some lenses have many aperture blades and/or blades with curved edges to make the aperture more closely approximate a circle rather than a polygon lenses with 11 , 12 , or 15 blade iris diaphragms are often claimed to excel in bokeh quality both of these phones use dual cameras to detect edges and create a '' depth map '' of the image , which the phone uses to blur the out-of-focus portions of the photo bokeh can be made with a combination of both lenses , and shots can be refocused even after they are captured , adding bokeh effects with different depths both the front and back cameras have a 13mp main lens and a 2mp lens for capturing bokeh depth information file : bokeh1 dsc 0959.jpg a bokeh created with nikon d3300 camera 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 g vr ii lens unlike conventional convolution , this convolution has a kernel that depends on the distance of each image point and & nbsp ; – at least in principle & nbsp ; – has to include image points that are occluded by objects in the foreground bokeh effect and refocusing can then be applied to an image after the photo is taken

the term comes from the japanese word boke or , which means '' blur '' or '' haze '' , or boke-aji , the '' blur quality '' the spellings bokeh and boke have both been in use since at least 1996 , when merklinger had suggested '' or bokeh if you prefer . bokeh and lens design image : circles of confusion lens diagram.svg thumb right 280px the depth of field is the region where the size of the circle of confusion is less than the resolution of the human eye '' good '' bokeh is especially important for macro lenses and long telephoto lenses , because they are typically used in situations that produce shallow depth of field good bokeh is also important for medium telephoto lenses ( typically 85â€“150 mm on 35 mm format ) bokeh characteristics may be quantified by examining the image 's circle of confusion in out-of-focus areas , each point of light becomes an image of the aperture , generally a more or less round disc for conventional lens designs ( with bladed apertures ) , when a lens is stopped down smaller than its maximum aperture size ( minimum f-number ) , out-of-focus points are blurred into the polygonal shape formed by the aperture blades recently , photographers have exploited the shape of the bokeh by creating a simple mask out of card with shapes such as hearts or stars , that the photographer wishes the bokeh to be , and placing it over the lens today it is much easier to make an f/1.8 lens , and a 9-bladed lens at f/1.8 is enough for an 85mm lens to achieve great bokeh some lens manufacturers including nikon , minolta , and sony make lenses designed with specific controls to change the rendering of the out-of-focus areas the minolta stf 135mm f/2.8 t4.5 lens minolta/sony stf 135mm f/2.8 t4.5 ( with stf standing for smooth trans focus ) is a lens specifically designed to produce pleasing bokeh the use of anamorphic lenses will cause bokeh to appear differently along the horizontal and vertical axes of the lens , becoming ellipsoidal compared to those in a spherical lens image : bahnhof dortmund brackel spiegeltele dsc02359 smial wp.jpg the bokeh produced by a catadioptric lens ( also called a mirror lens ) file : bokeh1 dsc 0959.jpg a bokeh created with nikon d3300 camera 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 g vr ii lens image : faux-bokeh-comparison.jpg thumb 500px right bokeh can be simulated by convolving the image with a kernel that corresponds to the image of an out-of-focus point source taken with a real camera

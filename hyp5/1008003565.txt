tacitus , annals iv.1 the seii were romans of the equites ( or knights ) , the lower of the two upper social classes of the roman republic and the early roman empire sejanus ' grandfather maintained relations with senatorial families through his marriage with terentia , a sister of the wife of gaius maecenas , who was one of emperor augustus ' most powerful political allies sejanus was once thought to have possibly been a child of this marriage but ronald syme has asserted that sejanus ' mother was a junia blaesa , sister of junius blaesus sejanus was later adopted into the aelia gens , possibly by gaius aelius gallus the prefect , or sextus aelius catus his sibling , and by roman custom became known as lucius aelius seianus or simply as seianus sejanus ' uncle , junius blaesus , distinguished himself as a military commander ; he became proconsul of africa in ad 21 and earned roman triumph by crushing the rebellion of tacfarinas tacitus , annals iii.72 , iii.73 according to the ancient historian tacitus , sejanus was also a former favourite of the wealthy marcus gavius apicius , whose daughter may have been sejanus ' first wife apicata tacitus , annals iv.3 strabo was appointed praetorian prefect , one of the two most powerful positions a roman knight could attain in the empire little is known about the life sejanus led prior to this date , but according to tacitus , he accompanied gaius caesar , adopted son of augustus , during his campaigns in armenia in 1 bc upon the accession of tiberius in ad 14 , sejanus was appointed prefect of the praetorian guard as the colleague of his father strabo , and began his rise to prominence furthermore , their presence served as a constant reminder to the people and the senate of the substantial armed force which served as the basis for the imperial power when strabo was assigned to the governorship of egypt in ad 15 , sejanus became the sole commander of the praetorians and instigated reforms that helped shape the guard into a powerful tool of the principate cassius dio , roman history lvii.22 by ad 23 , he exerted a considerable influence over the decisions of the emperor , who referred to sejanus as '' socius laborum '' ( my partner in my toils ) a statue had been erected in his honor in the theatre of pompey , seneca the younger , essays , to marcia on consolation xxii.4–6 and in the senate , his followers were advanced with public offices and governorships however this privileged position caused resentment among the senatorial class and the imperial family , in particular earning him the enmity of tiberius ' son drusus julius caesar the history of sejanus and drusus dated back to at least ad 15 tacitus , annals i.29 , i.30 despite this success , the following years witnessed a growing animosity between drusus and sejanus tacitus , annals iii.31 in practice it was still sejanus who was the second man in the empire , and he was ambitious to further expand his power during an argument drusus had struck the prefect with his fist , and he openly lamented that '' a stranger was invited to assist in the government while the emperor 's son was alive '' to secure his position , sejanus secretly plotted against drusus and seduced his wife livilla tacitus , annals iii.56 with these hopes now dashed , tiberius left his administration more than ever in the care of sejanus and looked toward the sons of germanicus ( nero caesar , drusus caesar and caligula ) as possible heirs tacitus , annals ii.72 following his death , his wife agrippina the elder returned to rome with their six children and became increasingly involved with a group of senators who opposed the growing power of sejanus having divorced apicata two years earlier , he asked to marry drusus ' widow livilla in ad 25 , possibly with an eye towards placing himself , as an adopted julius , in the position of a potential successor tacitus , annals iv.39 the emperor denied this request , warning sejanus that he was in danger of overstepping his rank by fueling his paranoia towards agrippina and the senate , he induced the emperor to withdraw to the countryside of campania , which he did in ad 26 , and finally to the island of capri , where he lived until his death in ad 37 tacitus , annals v.3 sejanus began a series of purge trials of senators and wealthy equestrians in the city , removing those capable of opposing his power as well as extending the imperial ( and his own ) treasury cassius dio , roman history lviii.4 among those who perished were gaius asinius gallus , a prominent senator and opponent of tiberius who was linked to agrippina 's faction tiberius had not been seen in rome since ad 26 and senators and equestrians courted sejanus ' favour as if he were emperor the ancient historian cassius dio wrote : sejanus was so great a person by reason both of his excessive haughtiness and of his vast power , that , to put it briefly , he himself seemed to be the emperor and tiberius a kind of island potentate , inasmuch as the latter spent his time on the island of capreae cassius dio , roman history lviii.5 through years of crafty intrigues and indispensable service to the emperor , sejanus had worked himself up to become the most powerful man in the empire it appears that , when tiberius heard to what extent sejanus had already usurper his authority in rome , he immediately took steps to remove him from power cassius dio , roman history lviii.8 the ensuing confusion was successful in alienating sejanus from many of his followers when it became obvious to tiberius that support for sejanus was not as strong as the emperor had feared , his next step was to choose naevius sutorius macro , previously prefect of the vigiles ( roman police and fire department ) , to replace sejanus and effect his downfall the reality of this was seen in ad 31 , when tiberius was forced to rely upon the vigiles against the soldiers of his own guard cassius dio , roman history lii.24 cassius dio notes that after sejanus , no other prefect except gaius fulvius plautianus , who commanded the guard under septimius severus , would rise to such influence velleius paterculus , roman history , ii.127–128 ii.127–128 how much of paterculus ' writing is due to genuine admiration , prudence or fear remains an open question , but it has been conjectured that he was put to death as a friend of sejanus the play is seen as a topical reference to the fall of the former royal favourite , robert devereux , 2nd earl of essex , executed for treason two years before john forster , lives

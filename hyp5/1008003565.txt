sejanus was born in 20 bc at volsinii , etruria , into the family of lucius seius strabo tacitus , annals iv.1 the seii were romans of the equites ( or knights ) , the lower of the two upper social classes of the roman republic and the early roman empire sejanus ' grandfather maintained relations with senatorial families through his marriage with terentia , a sister of the wife of gaius maecenas , who was one of emperor augustus ' most powerful political allies sejanus was later adopted into the aelia gens , possibly by gaius aelius gallus the prefect , or sextus aelius catus his sibling , and by roman custom became known as lucius aelius seianus or simply as seianus the adoptive family of sejanus counted two consuls among their ranks : quintus aelius tubero ( consul in 11 bc ) and sextus aelius catus ( consul in ad 4 ) , who was the father of aelia paetina , the second wife of the future emperor claudius sejanus ' uncle , junius blaesus , distinguished himself as a military commander ; he became proconsul of africa in ad 21 and earned roman triumph by crushing the rebellion of tacfarinas tacitus , annals iii.72 , iii.73 according to the ancient historian tacitus , sejanus was also a former favourite of the wealthy marcus gavius apicius , whose daughter may have been sejanus ' first wife apicata sometime after 2 bc , according to the bingham dissertation , while the guard had been formally established by augustus in 27 bc , the first prefects were not appointed until 2 bc strabo was appointed praetorian prefect , one of the two most powerful positions a roman knight could attain in the empire little is known about the life sejanus led prior to this date , but according to tacitus , he accompanied gaius caesar , adopted son of augustus , during his campaigns in armenia in 1 bc upon the accession of tiberius in ad 14 , sejanus was appointed prefect of the praetorian guard as the colleague of his father strabo , and began his rise to prominence the praetorian guard was an elite unit of the roman army formed by augustus in 27 bc , with the specific function to serve as a bodyguard to the emperor and members of the imperial family when strabo was assigned to the governorship of egypt in ad 15 , sejanus became the sole commander of the praetorians and instigated reforms that helped shape the guard into a powerful tool of the principate in ad 20 the scattered encampments inside the city were centralized into castra praetoria just outside rome tacitus , annals iv.2 syme believes tacitus delayed mention of these reforms until the year 23 for stylistic reasons the actual date the castra praetoria was founded may have been ad 20 in his capacity as praetorian prefect , sejanus quickly became a trusted advisor to tiberius by ad 23 , he exerted a considerable influence over the decisions of the emperor , who referred to sejanus as '' socius laborum '' ( my partner in my toils ) as early as ad 20 , sejanus had sought to solidify his connection with the imperial family by betrothing his daughter junilla to the son of claudius , claudius drusus suetonius , the lives of twelve caesars , life of claudius 27 when this failed , it seems sejanus turned his attention toward eliminating drusus during an argument drusus had struck the prefect with his fist , and he openly lamented that '' a stranger was invited to assist in the government while the emperor 's son was alive '' to secure his position , sejanus secretly plotted against drusus and seduced his wife livilla tacitus , annals iii.56 with these hopes now dashed , tiberius left his administration more than ever in the care of sejanus and looked toward the sons of germanicus ( nero caesar , drusus caesar and caligula ) as possible heirs tacitus , annals iv.12 to sejanus , agrippina 's sons nero caesar , drusus caesar and caligula were a threat to his power by fueling his paranoia towards agrippina and the senate , he induced the emperor to withdraw to the countryside of campania , which he did in ad 26 , and finally to the island of capri , where he lived until his death in ad 37 tacitus , annals v.3 sejanus began a series of purge trials of senators and wealthy equestrians in the city , removing those capable of opposing his power as well as extending the imperial ( and his own ) treasury cassius dio , roman history lviii.3 agrippina and two of her sons , nero and drusus were arrested and exiled in ad 30 , and later starved to death in suspicious circumstances tacitus , annals , vi.23 â€“ vi.25 only caligula , the youngest son of germanicus , managed to survive the purges of sejanus , by moving to capri with tiberius in ad 31 tiberius had not been seen in rome since ad 26 and senators and equestrians courted sejanus ' favour as if he were emperor cassius dio , roman history lviii.5 through years of crafty intrigues and indispensable service to the emperor , sejanus had worked himself up to become the most powerful man in the empire but suddenly , at the end of ad 31 , he was arrested , summarily executed and his body unceremoniously cast down the gemonian stairs ancient historians disagree about the nature of his conspiracy , whether it was tiberius or sejanus who struck first and in which order subsequent events occurred when it became obvious to tiberius that support for sejanus was not as strong as the emperor had feared , his next step was to choose naevius sutorius macro , previously prefect of the vigiles ( roman police and fire department ) , to replace sejanus and effect his downfall tacitus , annals vi.2 although rome at first rejoiced at the demise of sejanus , the city was quickly plunged into more extensive trials as tiberius persecuted all those who could in any way be tied to the schemes of sejanus or had courted his friendship tacitus , annals vi.29 the political turmoil continued until the death of tiberius in ad 37 , after which he was succeeded by caligula the reforms of sejanus most significantly included the founding of the castra praetoria , which established the praetorian guard as the powerful political force , for which it is primarily known today the reality of this was seen in ad 31 , when tiberius was forced to rely upon the vigiles against the soldiers of his own guard upon the suicide of emperor nero in ad 68 , the guard prefect gaius nymphidius sabinus attempted to have himself declared emperor , on the pretence that he was the illegitimate son of caligula sejanus is also a leading figure in another roman history play of about this time , the anonymous tragedy of claudius tiberius nero ( 1607 ) and since pontius pilate was a nominee of sejanus and implicated in his anti-jewish policies , it encouraged the inclusion of sejanus in novels dealing with the circumstances of jesus christ 's crucifixion

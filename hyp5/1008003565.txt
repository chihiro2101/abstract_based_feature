sejanus was born in 20 bc at volsinii , etruria , into the family of lucius seius strabo tacitus , annals iv.1 the seii were romans of the equites ( or knights ) , the lower of the two upper social classes of the roman republic and the early roman empire sejanus ' grandfather maintained relations with senatorial families through his marriage with terentia , a sister of the wife of gaius maecenas , who was one of emperor augustus ' most powerful political allies sejanus was once thought to have possibly been a child of this marriage but ronald syme has asserted that sejanus ' mother was a junia blaesa , sister of junius blaesus sejanus was later adopted into the aelia gens , possibly by gaius aelius gallus the prefect , or sextus aelius catus his sibling , and by roman custom became known as lucius aelius seianus or simply as seianus the adoptive family of sejanus counted two consuls among their ranks : quintus aelius tubero ( consul in 11 bc ) and sextus aelius catus ( consul in ad 4 ) , who was the father of aelia paetina , the second wife of the future emperor claudius sejanus ' uncle , junius blaesus , distinguished himself as a military commander ; he became proconsul of africa in ad 21 and earned roman triumph by crushing the rebellion of tacfarinas tacitus , annals iii.72 , iii.73 according to the ancient historian tacitus , sejanus was also a former favourite of the wealthy marcus gavius apicius , whose daughter may have been sejanus ' first wife apicata sometime after 2 bc , according to the bingham dissertation , while the guard had been formally established by augustus in 27 bc , the first prefects were not appointed until 2 bc upon the accession of tiberius in ad 14 , sejanus was appointed prefect of the praetorian guard as the colleague of his father strabo , and began his rise to prominence the praetorian guard was an elite unit of the roman army formed by augustus in 27 bc , with the specific function to serve as a bodyguard to the emperor and members of the imperial family much more than a guard however , the praetorians also managed the day-to-day care of the city , such as general security and civil administration cassius dio , roman history lvii.19 bingham , p in ad 20 the scattered encampments inside the city were centralized into castra praetoria just outside rome tacitus , annals iv.2 syme believes tacitus delayed mention of these reforms until the year 23 for stylistic reasons with these changes in effect , sejanus now commanded the complete loyalty of a force of around 12,000 soldiers , all of which were at his immediate disposal in his capacity as praetorian prefect , sejanus quickly became a trusted advisor to tiberius by ad 23 , he exerted a considerable influence over the decisions of the emperor , who referred to sejanus as '' socius laborum '' ( my partner in my toils ) since the death of germanicus , drusus had been openly groomed as the successor of his father , successfully commanding legions in illyricum in ad 18 , tacitus , annals ii.44 , ii.62 and sharing the consulship with tiberius in ad 21 during an argument drusus had struck the prefect with his fist , and he openly lamented that '' a stranger was invited to assist in the government while the emperor 's son was alive '' tacitus , annals iv.7 tiberius was already in his sixties , thus the possibility of drusus succeeding his father in the near future loomed large over the years he had grown increasingly disillusioned with the position of princeps , and by sharing the tribunician powers with drusus in ad 22 he had prepared to relinquish some of his responsibilities in favour of his son her relations with tiberius became increasingly fraught , as she made it clear that she believed that he was responsible for the death of germanicus tacitus , annals iv.12 to sejanus , agrippina 's sons nero caesar , drusus caesar and caligula were a threat to his power tacitus , annals iv.39 the emperor denied this request , warning sejanus that he was in danger of overstepping his rank tacitus , annals iv.57 , iv.67 guarded by the praetorians , sejanus easily controlled all information that passed between tiberius and the capital tacitus , annals iv.41 despite the withdrawal of tiberius from rome 's political scene , the presence of livia seems to have checked sejanus ' overt power for a time tiberius had not been seen in rome since ad 26 and senators and equestrians courted sejanus ' favour as if he were emperor cassius dio , roman history lviii.5 through years of crafty intrigues and indispensable service to the emperor , sejanus had worked himself up to become the most powerful man in the empire modern historians consider it unlikely that sejanus plotted to seize power and , if he had planned so at all , rather might have aimed at overthrowing tiberius to serve as a regent to tiberius gemellus , son of drusus , or possibly caligula juvenal , satire x.67â€“72 further details concerning sejanus ' fall are provided by cassius dio , writing nearly 200 years later in his roman history instead , tiberius addressed a number of contradictory letters to the senate , some of which praised sejanus and his friends and some of which denounced them tiberius variously announced that he would arrive in rome the next day or that he was at the point of death cassius dio , roman history lviii.6 he stepped down as consul , forcing sejanus to do the same cassius dio , roman history lviii.7 and conferred an honorary priesthood upon caligula , rekindling popular support for the house of germanicus cassius dio , roman history lviii.8 the ensuing confusion was successful in alienating sejanus from many of his followers with the intentions of the emperor no longer clear , it was now deemed a safer course of action in rome to withdraw from overtly supporting sejanus until the matter was clearly resolved tacitus , annals vi.29 the political turmoil continued until the death of tiberius in ad 37 , after which he was succeeded by caligula suetonius , on the life of the caesars , life of tiberius 55 tacitus , on the other hand , attributes much of the decline of tiberius ' rule after ad 23 to the corrupting influence of sejanus , although he is generally also harsh on tiberius phaedrus , fables book iii , preface velleius paterculus was a historian and contemporary of sejanus , whose two-volume the roman history details a history of rome from the fall of troy until the death of livia augusta in ad 29 see the preface , pp.v-xiii later plays include a 5-act tragedy by a.arterton ( 1875 ) and the privately printed sejanus : a tragedy in five acts by p

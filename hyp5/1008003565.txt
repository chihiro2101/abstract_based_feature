sejanus was born in 20 bc at volsinii , etruria , into the family of lucius seius strabo tacitus , annals iv.1 the seii were romans of the equites ( or knights ) , the lower of the two upper social classes of the roman republic and the early roman empire sejanus ' grandfather maintained relations with senatorial families through his marriage with terentia , a sister of the wife of gaius maecenas , who was one of emperor augustus ' most powerful political allies sejanus was once thought to have possibly been a child of this marriage but ronald syme has asserted that sejanus ' mother was a junia blaesa , sister of junius blaesus sejanus was later adopted into the aelia gens , possibly by gaius aelius gallus the prefect , or sextus aelius catus his sibling , and by roman custom became known as lucius aelius seianus or simply as seianus the adoptive family of sejanus counted two consuls among their ranks : quintus aelius tubero ( consul in 11 bc ) and sextus aelius catus ( consul in ad 4 ) , who was the father of aelia paetina , the second wife of the future emperor claudius sejanus ' uncle , junius blaesus , distinguished himself as a military commander ; he became proconsul of africa in ad 21 and earned roman triumph by crushing the rebellion of tacfarinas tacitus , annals iii.72 , iii.73 according to the ancient historian tacitus , sejanus was also a former favourite of the wealthy marcus gavius apicius , whose daughter may have been sejanus ' first wife apicata strabo was appointed praetorian prefect , one of the two most powerful positions a roman knight could attain in the empire little is known about the life sejanus led prior to this date , but according to tacitus , he accompanied gaius caesar , adopted son of augustus , during his campaigns in armenia in 1 bc upon the accession of tiberius in ad 14 , sejanus was appointed prefect of the praetorian guard as the colleague of his father strabo , and began his rise to prominence the praetorian guard was an elite unit of the roman army formed by augustus in 27 bc , with the specific function to serve as a bodyguard to the emperor and members of the imperial family much more than a guard however , the praetorians also managed the day-to-day care of the city , such as general security and civil administration in ad 20 the scattered encampments inside the city were centralized into castra praetoria just outside rome tacitus , annals iv.2 syme believes tacitus delayed mention of these reforms until the year 23 for stylistic reasons in his capacity as praetorian prefect , sejanus quickly became a trusted advisor to tiberius by ad 23 , he exerted a considerable influence over the decisions of the emperor , who referred to sejanus as '' socius laborum '' ( my partner in my toils ) however this privileged position caused resentment among the senatorial class and the imperial family , in particular earning him the enmity of tiberius ' son drusus julius caesar the history of sejanus and drusus dated back to at least ad 15 since the death of germanicus , drusus had been openly groomed as the successor of his father , successfully commanding legions in illyricum in ad 18 , tacitus , annals ii.44 , ii.62 and sharing the consulship with tiberius in ad 21 tacitus , annals iii.31 in practice it was still sejanus who was the second man in the empire , and he was ambitious to further expand his power as early as ad 20 , sejanus had sought to solidify his connection with the imperial family by betrothing his daughter junilla to the son of claudius , claudius drusus tacitus , annals iii.56 with these hopes now dashed , tiberius left his administration more than ever in the care of sejanus and looked toward the sons of germanicus ( nero caesar , drusus caesar and caligula ) as possible heirs tacitus , annals iv.52 , iv.53 , iv.54 the climate was further poisoned by the hatred that tiberius ' mother livia drusilla ( the widow of augustus ) felt for her , since agrippina 's ambition , to be the mother of emperors and thus rome 's first woman , was an open secret having divorced apicata two years earlier , he asked to marry drusus ' widow livilla in ad 25 , possibly with an eye towards placing himself , as an adopted julius , in the position of a potential successor tacitus , annals iv.39 the emperor denied this request , warning sejanus that he was in danger of overstepping his rank tacitus , annals iv.40 alarmed by this sudden denigration , sejanus changed his plans and began to isolate tiberius from rome tacitus , annals iv.57 , iv.67 guarded by the praetorians , sejanus easily controlled all information that passed between tiberius and the capital tacitus , annals iv.41 despite the withdrawal of tiberius from rome 's political scene , the presence of livia seems to have checked sejanus ' overt power for a time tacitus , annals v.3 sejanus began a series of purge trials of senators and wealthy equestrians in the city , removing those capable of opposing his power as well as extending the imperial ( and his own ) treasury in ad 31 , despite his equestrian rank , sejanus shared the consulship with tiberius in absentia , suetonius , the lives of twelve caesars , life of tiberius 65 and finally became betrothed to livilla tiberius had not been seen in rome since ad 26 and senators and equestrians courted sejanus ' favour as if he were emperor cassius dio , roman history lviii.5 through years of crafty intrigues and indispensable service to the emperor , sejanus had worked himself up to become the most powerful man in the empire modern historians consider it unlikely that sejanus plotted to seize power and , if he had planned so at all , rather might have aimed at overthrowing tiberius to serve as a regent to tiberius gemellus , son of drusus , or possibly caligula josephus , antiquities of the jews xviii.6.6 according to juvenal , a letter was sent from capri with orders to execute sejanus without a trial cassius dio , roman history lviii.8 the ensuing confusion was successful in alienating sejanus from many of his followers while it is unproven that sejanus intended to overthrow tiberius , later prefects of the guard did aspire to become emperor suetonius , on the life of the caesars , life of tiberius 55 tacitus , on the other hand , attributes much of the decline of tiberius ' rule after ad 23 to the corrupting influence of sejanus , although he is generally also harsh on tiberius phaedrus , fables book iii , preface velleius paterculus was a historian and contemporary of sejanus , whose two-volume the roman history details a history of rome from the fall of troy until the death of livia augusta in ad 29 velleius paterculus , roman history , ii.127–128 ii.127–128 how much of paterculus ' writing is due to genuine admiration , prudence or fear remains an open question , but it has been conjectured that he was put to death as a friend of sejanus

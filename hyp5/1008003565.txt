sejanus was born in 20 bc at volsinii , etruria , into the family of lucius seius strabo tacitus , annals iv.1 the seii were romans of the equites ( or knights ) , the lower of the two upper social classes of the roman republic and the early roman empire sejanus ' grandfather maintained relations with senatorial families through his marriage with terentia , a sister of the wife of gaius maecenas , who was one of emperor augustus ' most powerful political allies one of his wives was cosconia gallita , sister of servius cornelius lentulus maluginensis ( suffect consul in ad 10 ) and publius cornelius lentulus scipio ( suffect consul in ad 2 ) sejanus was once thought to have possibly been a child of this marriage but ronald syme has asserted that sejanus ' mother was a junia blaesa , sister of junius blaesus sejanus was later adopted into the aelia gens , possibly by gaius aelius gallus the prefect , or sextus aelius catus his sibling , and by roman custom became known as lucius aelius seianus or simply as seianus the adoptive family of sejanus counted two consuls among their ranks : quintus aelius tubero ( consul in 11 bc ) and sextus aelius catus ( consul in ad 4 ) , who was the father of aelia paetina , the second wife of the future emperor claudius sejanus ' uncle , junius blaesus , distinguished himself as a military commander ; he became proconsul of africa in ad 21 and earned roman triumph by crushing the rebellion of tacfarinas tacitus , annals iii.72 , iii.73 according to the ancient historian tacitus , sejanus was also a former favourite of the wealthy marcus gavius apicius , whose daughter may have been sejanus ' first wife apicata little is known about the life sejanus led prior to this date , but according to tacitus , he accompanied gaius caesar , adopted son of augustus , during his campaigns in armenia in 1 bc upon the accession of tiberius in ad 14 , sejanus was appointed prefect of the praetorian guard as the colleague of his father strabo , and began his rise to prominence much more than a guard however , the praetorians also managed the day-to-day care of the city , such as general security and civil administration when strabo was assigned to the governorship of egypt in ad 15 , sejanus became the sole commander of the praetorians and instigated reforms that helped shape the guard into a powerful tool of the principate while his adopted son germanicus restored order in germania , tiberius ' biological son drusus was sent to quell the uprising in pannonia , accompanied by sejanus and two praetorian cohorts tacitus , annals i.29 , i.30 despite this success , the following years witnessed a growing animosity between drusus and sejanus since the death of germanicus , drusus had been openly groomed as the successor of his father , successfully commanding legions in illyricum in ad 18 , tacitus , annals ii.44 , ii.62 and sharing the consulship with tiberius in ad 21 tacitus , annals iii.31 in practice it was still sejanus who was the second man in the empire , and he was ambitious to further expand his power tacitus , annals iv.7 tiberius was already in his sixties , thus the possibility of drusus succeeding his father in the near future loomed large over the years he had grown increasingly disillusioned with the position of princeps , and by sharing the tribunician powers with drusus in ad 22 he had prepared to relinquish some of his responsibilities in favour of his son her relations with tiberius became increasingly fraught , as she made it clear that she believed that he was responsible for the death of germanicus tacitus , annals iv.12 to sejanus , agrippina 's sons nero caesar , drusus caesar and caligula were a threat to his power having divorced apicata two years earlier , he asked to marry drusus ' widow livilla in ad 25 , possibly with an eye towards placing himself , as an adopted julius , in the position of a potential successor tacitus , annals iv.39 the emperor denied this request , warning sejanus that he was in danger of overstepping his rank tacitus , annals iv.57 , iv.67 guarded by the praetorians , sejanus easily controlled all information that passed between tiberius and the capital according to tacitus , her death in ad 29 changed all that cassius dio , roman history lviii.3 agrippina and two of her sons , nero and drusus were arrested and exiled in ad 30 , and later starved to death in suspicious circumstances tiberius had not been seen in rome since ad 26 and senators and equestrians courted sejanus ' favour as if he were emperor the ancient historian cassius dio wrote : sejanus was so great a person by reason both of his excessive haughtiness and of his vast power , that , to put it briefly , he himself seemed to be the emperor and tiberius a kind of island potentate , inasmuch as the latter spent his time on the island of capreae cassius dio , roman history lviii.5 through years of crafty intrigues and indispensable service to the emperor , sejanus had worked himself up to become the most powerful man in the empire but suddenly , at the end of ad 31 , he was arrested , summarily executed and his body unceremoniously cast down the gemonian stairs modern historians consider it unlikely that sejanus plotted to seize power and , if he had planned so at all , rather might have aimed at overthrowing tiberius to serve as a regent to tiberius gemellus , son of drusus , or possibly caligula according to josephus , it was antonia , the mother of livilla , who finally alerted tiberius to the growing threat sejanus posed ( possibly with information provided by satrius secundus ) , in a letter she dispatched to capri in the care of her freedman pallas josephus , antiquities of the jews xviii.6.6 according to juvenal , a letter was sent from capri with orders to execute sejanus without a trial cassius dio , roman history lviii.8 the ensuing confusion was successful in alienating sejanus from many of his followers cassius dio , roman history lviii.9 on october 18 , ad 31 , sejanus was summoned to a senate meeting by a letter from tiberius , ostensibly to bestow the tribunician powers upon him the reforms of sejanus most significantly included the founding of the castra praetoria , which established the praetorian guard as the powerful political force , for which it is primarily known today phaedrus , fables book iii , preface velleius paterculus was a historian and contemporary of sejanus , whose two-volume the roman history details a history of rome from the fall of troy until the death of livia augusta in ad 29 sejanus is also a leading figure in another roman history play of about this time , the anonymous tragedy of claudius tiberius nero ( 1607 ) in this antonia sends the letter of accusation to tiberius via claudius , after discovering her daughter is plotting with sejanus

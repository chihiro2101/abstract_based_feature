the original dimensions of britannic were similar to those of her older sisters , but her dimensions were altered whilst still on the building stocks after the titanic disaster britannic had a layout very similar to her sister ships however following the loss of titanic and the subsequent inquiries , several design changes were made to the remaining olympic class liner the central watertight compartments were enhanced , allowing the ship to stay afloat with six compartments flooded additional lifeboats could be stored within reach of the davits on the deck house roof , and the gantry davits could reach lifeboats on the other side of the ship , providing that none of the funnels was obstructing the way this design enabled all the lifeboats to be launched , even if the ship developed a list that would normally prevent lifeboats being launched on the side opposite to the list the ship carried 55 lifeboats , capable of carrying at least 75 people each thus , 3,600 people could be carried by the lifeboats , more than the maximum number of people the ship could carry the names of the three vessels were decided at a later date and they showed the intention of the designer regarding their size : olympic , titanic and britannic construction of the olympic and the titanic began in 1908 and 1909 respectively their designed speed was approximately 22 knots , well below that of the lusitania and mauretania , but still allowing for a transatlantic crossing of less than one week although the white star line and the harland and wolff shipyard always denied it , some sources claim that the ship was to be named gigantic other sources are november 1911 american newspapers stating the white star order for gigantic being placed the keel for britannic was laid on 30 november 1911 at the harland and wolff shipyard in belfast , on the gantry slip previously occupied by the olympic , 13 months after the launch of that ship , and the arlanza , launched seven days before . due to improvements introduced as a consequence of the titanic disaster , britannic was not launched until 26 february 1914 , . reusing olympics space saved the shipyard time and money by not clearing out a third slip similar in size to those used for olympic and titanic immediately , all shipyards with admiralty contracts were given priority to use available raw materials the naval authorities requisitioned a large number of ships as armed merchant cruisers or for troop transport rms olympic returned to belfast on 3 november 1914 , while work on britannic continued slowly in may 1915 , britannic completed mooring trials of her engines , and was prepared for emergency entrance into service with as little as four weeks ' notice the same month also saw the first major loss of a civilian ocean liner when cunard 's was torpedoed near the irish coast by the following month , the admiralty decided to use recently requisitioned passenger liners as troop transports in the gallipoli campaign ( also called the dardanelles service ) as the gallipoli landings proved to be disastrous and the casualties mounted , the need for large hospital ships for treatment and evacuation of wounded became evident then on 13 november 1915 , britannic was requisitioned as a hospital ship from her storage location at belfast the common areas of the upper decks were transformed into rooms for the wounded the cabins of b deck were used to house doctors on 23 december , she left liverpool to join the port of mudros on the island of lemnos on the aegean sea to bring back sick and wounded soldiers « hmhs britannic » , webtitanic . the third voyage was from 20 march 1916 to 4 april the british government paid the white star line £75,000 to compensate for the conversion the admiralty recalled the britannic back into service as a hospital ship on 26 august 1916 , and the ship returned to the mediterranean sea for a fourth voyage on 24 september of that year at six o'clock , the patients were awakened and the premises were cleaned up breakfast was served at 6:30 am , then the captain toured the ship for an inspection britannic passed gibraltar around midnight on 15 november and arrived at naples on the morning of 17 november , for her usual coalling and water refuelling stop , completing the first stage of her mission . a storm kept the ship at naples until sunday afternoon , when captain bartlett decided to take advantage of a brief break in the weather and continue by next morning , the storms died and the ship passed the strait of messina without problems cape matapan was rounded in the first hours of 21 november there were 1,066 people on board : 673 crew , 315 royal army medical corps ( ramc ) , 77 nurses and the captain an sos signal was immediately sent out and was received by several other ships in the area , among them and hms heroic , but britannic heard nothing in reply unknown to either bartlett or the ship 's wireless operator , the force of the first explosion had caused the antenna wires slung between the ship 's masts to snap britannic had reached her flooding limit she could stay afloat ( motionless ) with her first six watertight compartments flooded the next crucial bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four and its door were undamaged and should have guaranteed the ship 's survival as the ship 's angle of list increased , water reached this level and began entering aft from the bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four on the bridge , captain bartlett was already considering efforts to save the ship fifteen minutes after the ship was struck , the open portholes on e deck were underwater while bartlett continued his desperate manoeuvre , the ship listed more and more before he could do so , two lifeboats were put onto the water on the port side the still-turning , partly surfaced propeller sucked the two lifeboats into it , mincing them , along with their passengers bartlett was then finally able to stop the propellers before they could suck in another lifeboat at this point , bartlett concluded that the rate at which britannic was sinking had slowed so he called a halt to the evacuation and ordered the engines restarted in the hope that he might still be able to beach the ship . at 09:00 bartlett was informed that the rate of flooding had increased due to the ship 's forward motion and that the flooding had reached d-deck « rms britannic : b deck » , hospital ship britannic on the internet archive in 2006 , an expedition , funded and filmed by the history channel , brought together fourteen skilled divers to help determine what caused the quick sinking of britannic « white star line mv britannic ( iii ) 1930–1960 the last wsl ship » , « titanic » and other white star ships the loss of

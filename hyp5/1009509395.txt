the original dimensions of britannic were similar to those of her older sisters , but her dimensions were altered whilst still on the building stocks after the titanic disaster with a gross tonnage of 48,158 , she surpassed the other olympic 's in terms of internal volume , but that did not make her the largest passenger ship in service at that time ; the german ss leviathan held this title with a significantly higher tonnage britannic had a layout very similar to her sister ships however following the loss of titanic and the subsequent inquiries , several design changes were made to the remaining olympic class liner additionally , a larger turbine was added instead of the units installed on the earlier vessels to make up for the increase in hull width the central watertight compartments were enhanced , allowing the ship to stay afloat with six compartments flooded additional lifeboats could be stored within reach of the davits on the deck house roof , and the gantry davits could reach lifeboats on the other side of the ship , providing that none of the funnels was obstructing the way this design enabled all the lifeboats to be launched , even if the ship developed a list that would normally prevent lifeboats being launched on the side opposite to the list the ship carried 55 lifeboats , capable of carrying at least 75 people each thus , 3,600 people could be carried by the lifeboats , more than the maximum number of people the ship could carry the names of the three vessels were decided at a later date and they showed the intention of the designer regarding their size : olympic , titanic and britannic the plan to build these three ships was realised by naval architects thomas andrews and alexander carlisle their sizes were so large that it was necessary to build the arrol gantry to shelter them , wide enough to span the two new building slips and allow two ships to be built at a time although the white star line and the harland and wolff shipyard always denied it , some sources claim that the ship was to be named gigantic one source is a poster of the ship with the name gigantic at the top other sources are november 1911 american newspapers stating the white star order for gigantic being placed tom mccluskie stated that in his capacity as archive manager and historian at harland and wolff , he '' never saw any official reference to the name 'gigantic ' being used or proposed for the third of the olympic class vessels '' at least one set of documentation exists , in which hingley 's discuss the order for the ship 's anchors ; this documentation states that the name of the ship is gigantic . due to improvements introduced as a consequence of the titanic disaster , britannic was not launched until 26 february 1914 , in august 1914 , before britannic could commence transatlantic service between new york and southampton , the world war i began the naval authorities requisitioned a large number of ships as armed merchant cruisers or for troop transport the admiralty paid the companies for the use of their ships but the risk of losing a ship in naval operations was high in may 1915 , britannic completed mooring trials of her engines , and was prepared for emergency entrance into service with as little as four weeks ' notice the following month , the admiralty decided to use recently requisitioned passenger liners as troop transports in the gallipoli campaign ( also called the dardanelles service ) then on 13 november 1915 , britannic was requisitioned as a hospital ship from her storage location at belfast the first-class dining room and the first-class reception room on d deck were transformed into operating rooms when declared fit for service on 12 december 1915 at liverpool , britannic was assigned a medical team consisting of 101 nurses , 336 non-commissioned officers and 52 commissioned officers as well as a crew of 675 persons and her sister ship olympic . the third voyage was from 20 march 1916 to 4 april the british government paid the white star line £75,000 to compensate for the conversion the transformation took place for several months before being interrupted by a recall of the ship back into military service . life aboard the ship followed a routine lunch was served at 12:30 pm and tea at 4:30 pm there were medical classes available for training the nurses after completing five successful voyages to the middle eastern theatre and back to the united kingdom transporting the sick and wounded , britannic departed southampton for lemnos at 14:23 on 12 november 1916 , her sixth voyage to the mediterranean sea britannic passed gibraltar around midnight on 15 november and arrived at naples on the morning of 17 november , for her usual coalling and water refuelling stop , completing the first stage of her mission by morning , britannic was steaming at full speed into the kea channel , between sounion ( the southernmost point of attica , the prefecture that includes athens ) and the island of kea there were 1,066 people on board : 673 crew , 315 royal army medical corps ( ramc ) , 77 nurses and the captain the first four watertight compartments were filling rapidly with water , the boiler-man 's tunnel connecting the firemen 's quarters in the bow with boiler room six was seriously damaged , and water was flowing into that boiler room an sos signal was immediately sent out and was received by several other ships in the area , among them and hms heroic , but britannic heard nothing in reply unknown to either bartlett or the ship 's wireless operator , the force of the first explosion had caused the antenna wires slung between the ship 's masts to snap this meant that , although the ship could still send out transmissions by radio , she could no longer receive them . along with the damaged watertight door of the firemen 's tunnel , the watertight door between boiler rooms six and five failed to close properly she could stay afloat ( motionless ) with her first six watertight compartments flooded as the ship 's angle of list increased , water reached this level and began entering aft from the bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four on the bridge , captain bartlett was already considering efforts to save the ship only two minutes after the blast , boiler rooms five and six had to be evacuated in about ten minutes , britannic was roughly in the same condition titanic had been in one hour after the collision with the iceberg fifteen minutes after the ship was struck , the open portholes on e deck were underwater with water also entering the ship 's aft section from the bulkhead between boiler rooms four and five , britannic quickly developed a serious list to starboard due to the weight of the water flooding into the starboard side realising that there was now no hope of reaching land in time , bartlett gave the final order to stop the engines and sounded two final long blasts of the whistle , the signal to abandon ship violet jessop ( who was also one of the survivors of britannics sister-ship titanic , and had also been on the olympic , when she collided with described the last seconds ;

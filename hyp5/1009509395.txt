the original dimensions of britannic were similar to those of her older sisters , but her dimensions were altered whilst still on the building stocks after the titanic disaster with a gross tonnage of 48,158 , she surpassed the other olympic 's in terms of internal volume , but that did not make her the largest passenger ship in service at that time ; the german ss leviathan held this title with a significantly higher tonnage britannic had a layout very similar to her sister ships however following the loss of titanic and the subsequent inquiries , several design changes were made to the remaining olympic class liner additionally , a larger turbine was added instead of the units installed on the earlier vessels to make up for the increase in hull width additional lifeboats could be stored within reach of the davits on the deck house roof , and the gantry davits could reach lifeboats on the other side of the ship , providing that none of the funnels was obstructing the way this design enabled all the lifeboats to be launched , even if the ship developed a list that would normally prevent lifeboats being launched on the side opposite to the list several of these davits were placed abreast of funnels , defeating that purpose the ship carried 55 lifeboats , capable of carrying at least 75 people each thus , 3,600 people could be carried by the lifeboats , more than the maximum number of people the ship could carry the names of the three vessels were decided at a later date and they showed the intention of the designer regarding their size : olympic , titanic and britannic construction of the olympic and the titanic began in 1908 and 1909 respectively although the white star line and the harland and wolff shipyard always denied it , some sources claim that the ship was to be named gigantic these only dealt with the ship 's moulded width , not her name at least one set of documentation exists , in which hingley 's discuss the order for the ship 's anchors ; this documentation states that the name of the ship is gigantic . due to improvements introduced as a consequence of the titanic disaster , britannic was not launched until 26 february 1914 , the admiralty paid the companies for the use of their ships but the risk of losing a ship in naval operations was high the big ocean liners were not initially taken for naval use , because smaller ships were easier to operate in may 1915 , britannic completed mooring trials of her engines , and was prepared for emergency entrance into service with as little as four weeks ' notice the same month also saw the first major loss of a civilian ocean liner when cunard 's was torpedoed near the irish coast by as the gallipoli landings proved to be disastrous and the casualties mounted , the need for large hospital ships for treatment and evacuation of wounded became evident then on 13 november 1915 , britannic was requisitioned as a hospital ship from her storage location at belfast repainted white with large red crosses and a horizontal green stripe , she was renamed hmhs ( his majesty 's hospital ship ) britannic and placed under the command of captain charles alfred bartlett ( 1868–1945 ) the common areas of the upper decks were transformed into rooms for the wounded the cabins of b deck were used to house doctors the first-class dining room and the first-class reception room on d deck were transformed into operating rooms the lower bridge was used to accommodate the lightly wounded on 23 december , she left liverpool to join the port of mudros on the island of lemnos on the aegean sea to bring back sick and wounded soldiers . at the end of her military service on 6 june 1916 , the britannic returned to belfast to undergo the necessary modifications for transforming her into a transatlantic passenger liner the british government paid the white star line £75,000 to compensate for the conversion the transformation took place for several months before being interrupted by a recall of the ship back into military service . on 29 september on her way to naples , she encountered a violent storm from which she emerged unscathed at six o'clock , the patients were awakened and the premises were cleaned up britannic passed gibraltar around midnight on 15 november and arrived at naples on the morning of 17 november , for her usual coalling and water refuelling stop , completing the first stage of her mission . a storm kept the ship at naples until sunday afternoon , when captain bartlett decided to take advantage of a brief break in the weather and continue by morning , britannic was steaming at full speed into the kea channel , between sounion ( the southernmost point of attica , the prefecture that includes athens ) and the island of kea there were 1,066 people on board : 673 crew , 315 royal army medical corps ( ramc ) , 77 nurses and the captain the reaction in the dining room was immediate ; doctors and nurses left instantly for their posts but not everybody reacted the same way , as further aft , the power of the explosion was less felt and many thought the ship had hit a smaller boat the explosion was on the starboard side , between holds two and three unknown to either bartlett or the ship 's wireless operator , the force of the first explosion had caused the antenna wires slung between the ship 's masts to snap . along with the damaged watertight door of the firemen 's tunnel , the watertight door between boiler rooms six and five failed to close properly she could stay afloat ( motionless ) with her first six watertight compartments flooded the next crucial bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four and its door were undamaged and should have guaranteed the ship 's survival as the ship 's angle of list increased , water reached this level and began entering aft from the bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four on the bridge , captain bartlett was already considering efforts to save the ship fifteen minutes after the ship was struck , the open portholes on e deck were underwater with water also entering the ship 's aft section from the bulkhead between boiler rooms four and five , britannic quickly developed a serious list to starboard due to the weight of the water flooding into the starboard side before he could do so , two lifeboats were put onto the water on the port side the still-turning , partly surfaced propeller sucked the two lifeboats into it , mincing them , along with their passengers . some 150 had made it to korissia , kea , where surviving doctors and nurses from britannic were trying to save the injured , using aprons and pieces of lifebuoy to make dressings a welte-mignon was planned to be installed on board britannic but because of the outbreak of war , the instrument never made its way to belfast in 1999 , gue , divers acclimated to cave diving and ocean discovery , led the first dive expedition to include extensive penetration into britannic video of the expedition was broadcast by national geographic , bbc , the history channel and the discovery channel diver leigh bishop brought back some of the first photographs from inside the wreck and his diver partner rich stevenson found that several watertight doors were open divers placed her samples on the britannic to look at the colonies of iron-eating bacteria on the wreck , which are responsible for the rusticles growing on titanic on sunday 29 september 2019 , a british technical diver - tim saville - died during a 120 m / 393 & nbsp ;

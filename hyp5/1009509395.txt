the original dimensions of britannic were similar to those of her older sisters , but her dimensions were altered whilst still on the building stocks after the titanic disaster with a gross tonnage of 48,158 , she surpassed the other olympic 's in terms of internal volume , but that did not make her the largest passenger ship in service at that time ; the german ss leviathan held this title with a significantly higher tonnage britannic had a layout very similar to her sister ships however following the loss of titanic and the subsequent inquiries , several design changes were made to the remaining olympic class liner the central watertight compartments were enhanced , allowing the ship to stay afloat with six compartments flooded additional lifeboats could be stored within reach of the davits on the deck house roof , and the gantry davits could reach lifeboats on the other side of the ship , providing that none of the funnels was obstructing the way this design enabled all the lifeboats to be launched , even if the ship developed a list that would normally prevent lifeboats being launched on the side opposite to the list the ship carried 55 lifeboats , capable of carrying at least 75 people each thus , 3,600 people could be carried by the lifeboats , more than the maximum number of people the ship could carry the names of the three vessels were decided at a later date and they showed the intention of the designer regarding their size : olympic , titanic and britannic construction of the olympic and the titanic began in 1908 and 1909 respectively their sizes were so large that it was necessary to build the arrol gantry to shelter them , wide enough to span the two new building slips and allow two ships to be built at a time the three ships were designed to be 270 metres long and to have a gross tonnage of 48,000 their designed speed was approximately 22 knots , well below that of the lusitania and mauretania , but still allowing for a transatlantic crossing of less than one week although the white star line and the harland and wolff shipyard always denied it , some sources claim that the ship was to be named gigantic other sources are november 1911 american newspapers stating the white star order for gigantic being placed tom mccluskie stated that in his capacity as archive manager and historian at harland and wolff , he '' never saw any official reference to the name 'gigantic ' being used or proposed for the third of the olympic class vessels '' these only dealt with the ship 's moulded width , not her name the keel for britannic was laid on 30 november 1911 at the harland and wolff shipyard in belfast , on the gantry slip previously occupied by the olympic , 13 months after the launch of that ship , and the arlanza , launched seven days before the admiralty paid the companies for the use of their ships but the risk of losing a ship in naval operations was high the big ocean liners were not initially taken for naval use , because smaller ships were easier to operate rms olympic returned to belfast on 3 november 1914 , while work on britannic continued slowly the same month also saw the first major loss of a civilian ocean liner when cunard 's was torpedoed near the irish coast by the following month , the admiralty decided to use recently requisitioned passenger liners as troop transports in the gallipoli campaign ( also called the dardanelles service ) repainted white with large red crosses and a horizontal green stripe , she was renamed hmhs ( his majesty 's hospital ship ) britannic and placed under the command of captain charles alfred bartlett ( 1868–1945 ) . she joined with several ships on the same route , including the mauretania , aquitania , . the third voyage was from 20 march 1916 to 4 april . at the end of her military service on 6 june 1916 , the britannic returned to belfast to undergo the necessary modifications for transforming her into a transatlantic passenger liner the transformation took place for several months before being interrupted by a recall of the ship back into military service . on 29 september on her way to naples , she encountered a violent storm from which she emerged unscathed at 8:30 pm , the patients went to bed and the captain made another inspection tour after completing five successful voyages to the middle eastern theatre and back to the united kingdom transporting the sick and wounded , britannic departed southampton for lemnos at 14:23 on 12 november 1916 , her sixth voyage to the mediterranean sea britannic passed gibraltar around midnight on 15 november and arrived at naples on the morning of 17 november , for her usual coalling and water refuelling stop , completing the first stage of her mission the seas rose once again as britannic left the port by next morning , the storms died and the ship passed the strait of messina without problems captain bartlett and chief officer hume were on the bridge at the time and the gravity of the situation was soon evident she could stay afloat ( motionless ) with her first six watertight compartments flooded the next crucial bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four and its door were undamaged and should have guaranteed the ship 's survival however , there were open portholes along the front lower decks , which tilted underwater within minutes of the explosion as the ship 's angle of list increased , water reached this level and began entering aft from the bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four with more than six compartments flooded , britannic could not stay afloat in about ten minutes , britannic was roughly in the same condition titanic had been in one hour after the collision with the iceberg fifteen minutes after the ship was struck , the open portholes on e deck were underwater with water also entering the ship 's aft section from the bulkhead between boiler rooms four and five , britannic quickly developed a serious list to starboard due to the weight of the water flooding into the starboard side with the shores of the greek island kea to the right , bartlett gave the order to navigate the ship towards the island in an attempt to beach the vessel major harold priestley gathered his detachments from the royal army medical corps to the back of the a deck and inspected the cabins to ensure no one was left behind while bartlett continued his desperate manoeuvre , the ship listed more and more before he could do so , two lifeboats were put onto the water on the port side the still-turning , partly surfaced propeller sucked the two lifeboats into it , mincing them , along with their passengers bartlett was then finally able to stop the propellers before they could suck in another lifeboat britannic gradually capsized to starboard , and the funnels collapsed one by one as it sank violet jessop ( who was also one of the survivors of britannics sister-ship titanic , and had also been on the olympic , when she collided

the original dimensions of britannic were similar to those of her older sisters , but her dimensions were altered whilst still on the building stocks after the titanic disaster with a gross tonnage of 48,158 , she surpassed the other olympic 's in terms of internal volume , but that did not make her the largest passenger ship in service at that time ; the german ss leviathan held this title with a significantly higher tonnage britannic had a layout very similar to her sister ships however following the loss of titanic and the subsequent inquiries , several design changes were made to the remaining olympic class liner additionally , a larger turbine was added instead of the units installed on the earlier vessels to make up for the increase in hull width the central watertight compartments were enhanced , allowing the ship to stay afloat with six compartments flooded this design enabled all the lifeboats to be launched , even if the ship developed a list that would normally prevent lifeboats being launched on the side opposite to the list thus , 3,600 people could be carried by the lifeboats , more than the maximum number of people the ship could carry the names of the three vessels were decided at a later date and they showed the intention of the designer regarding their size : olympic , titanic and britannic their designed speed was approximately 22 knots , well below that of the lusitania and mauretania , but still allowing for a transatlantic crossing of less than one week other sources are november 1911 american newspapers stating the white star order for gigantic being placed at least one set of documentation exists , in which hingley 's discuss the order for the ship 's anchors ; this documentation states that the name of the ship is gigantic the keel for britannic was laid on 30 november 1911 at the harland and wolff shipyard in belfast , on the gantry slip previously occupied by the olympic , 13 months after the launch of that ship , and the arlanza , launched seven days before . due to improvements introduced as a consequence of the titanic disaster , britannic was not launched until 26 february 1914 , in august 1914 , before britannic could commence transatlantic service between new york and southampton , the world war i began immediately , all shipyards with admiralty contracts were given priority to use available raw materials rms olympic returned to belfast on 3 november 1914 , while work on britannic continued slowly the same month also saw the first major loss of a civilian ocean liner when cunard 's was torpedoed near the irish coast by as the gallipoli landings proved to be disastrous and the casualties mounted , the need for large hospital ships for treatment and evacuation of wounded became evident rms aquitania was diverted to hospital ship duties in august ( her place as a troop transport would be taken by rms olympic in september ) then on 13 november 1915 , britannic was requisitioned as a hospital ship from her storage location at belfast repainted white with large red crosses and a horizontal green stripe , she was renamed hmhs ( his majesty 's hospital ship ) britannic and placed under the command of captain charles alfred bartlett ( 1868–1945 ) . in the interior , 3,309 beds and several operating rooms were installed the cabins of b deck were used to house doctors the lower bridge was used to accommodate the lightly wounded on 23 december , she left liverpool to join the port of mudros on the island of lemnos on the aegean sea to bring back sick and wounded soldiers after she returned , she spent four weeks as a floating hospital off the isle of wight . at the end of her military service on 6 june 1916 , the britannic returned to belfast to undergo the necessary modifications for transforming her into a transatlantic passenger liner the british government paid the white star line £75,000 to compensate for the conversion the transformation took place for several months before being interrupted by a recall of the ship back into military service breakfast was served at 6:30 am , then the captain toured the ship for an inspection after completing five successful voyages to the middle eastern theatre and back to the united kingdom transporting the sick and wounded , britannic departed southampton for lemnos at 14:23 on 12 november 1916 , her sixth voyage to the mediterranean sea britannic passed gibraltar around midnight on 15 november and arrived at naples on the morning of 17 november , for her usual coalling and water refuelling stop , completing the first stage of her mission . a storm kept the ship at naples until sunday afternoon , when captain bartlett decided to take advantage of a brief break in the weather and continue by morning , britannic was steaming at full speed into the kea channel , between sounion ( the southernmost point of attica , the prefecture that includes athens ) and the island of kea there were 1,066 people on board : 673 crew , 315 royal army medical corps ( ramc ) , 77 nurses and the captain it would later be revealed that the mines were planted in the kea channel on 21 october 1916 by under the command of gustav sieß captain bartlett and chief officer hume were on the bridge at the time and the gravity of the situation was soon evident the force of the explosion damaged the watertight bulkhead between hold one and the forepeak the first four watertight compartments were filling rapidly with water , the boiler-man 's tunnel connecting the firemen 's quarters in the bow with boiler room six was seriously damaged , and water was flowing into that boiler room . along with the damaged watertight door of the firemen 's tunnel , the watertight door between boiler rooms six and five failed to close properly she could stay afloat ( motionless ) with her first six watertight compartments flooded the next crucial bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four and its door were undamaged and should have guaranteed the ship 's survival on the bridge , captain bartlett was already considering efforts to save the ship in about ten minutes , britannic was roughly in the same condition titanic had been in one hour after the collision with the iceberg fifteen minutes after the ship was struck , the open portholes on e deck were underwater with water also entering the ship 's aft section from the bulkhead between boiler rooms four and five , britannic quickly developed a serious list to starboard due to the weight of the water flooding into the starboard side with the shores of the greek island kea to the right , bartlett gave the order to navigate the ship towards the island in an attempt to beach the vessel the captain ordered the port shaft driven at a higher speed than the starboard side , which helped the ship move towards the island scourge and heroic had no deck space for more survivors , and they left for piraeus signalling the presence of those left at korissia the a deck of the ship was devoted in its entirety to the first class , being fitted with a salon , two veranda cafes , a smoking room and a reading room a welte-mignon was planned to be installed on board britannic but because of the outbreak of war , the instrument never made its way to belfast in 1999 , gue , divers acclimated to cave diving and ocean discovery , led the first dive expedition to include extensive penetration into britannic « the wreck » , hospital ship britannic on the internet archive . her name was reused by white star line when it put mv britannic into service in 1930 the first , the bismarck , renamed majestic , replaced the britannic

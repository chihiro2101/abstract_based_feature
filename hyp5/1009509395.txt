the original dimensions of britannic were similar to those of her older sisters , but her dimensions were altered whilst still on the building stocks after the titanic disaster with a gross tonnage of 48,158 , she surpassed the other olympic 's in terms of internal volume , but that did not make her the largest passenger ship in service at that time ; the german ss leviathan held this title with a significantly higher tonnage britannic had a layout very similar to her sister ships however following the loss of titanic and the subsequent inquiries , several design changes were made to the remaining olympic class liner additionally , a larger turbine was added instead of the units installed on the earlier vessels to make up for the increase in hull width thus , 3,600 people could be carried by the lifeboats , more than the maximum number of people the ship could carry in 1907 , j the names of the three vessels were decided at a later date and they showed the intention of the designer regarding their size : olympic , titanic and britannic the three ships were designed to be 270 metres long and to have a gross tonnage of 48,000 although the white star line and the harland and wolff shipyard always denied it , some sources claim that the ship was to be named gigantic one source is a poster of the ship with the name gigantic at the top other sources are november 1911 american newspapers stating the white star order for gigantic being placed at least one set of documentation exists , in which hingley 's discuss the order for the ship 's anchors ; this documentation states that the name of the ship is gigantic the keel for britannic was laid on 30 november 1911 at the harland and wolff shipyard in belfast , on the gantry slip previously occupied by the olympic , 13 months after the launch of that ship , and the arlanza , launched seven days before . due to improvements introduced as a consequence of the titanic disaster , britannic was not launched until 26 february 1914 , retrieved 18 february 2013 several speeches were given in front of the press , and a dinner was organised in honour of the launching the ship entered dry dock in september and her propellers were installed . reusing olympics space saved the shipyard time and money by not clearing out a third slip similar in size to those used for olympic and titanic the naval authorities requisitioned a large number of ships as armed merchant cruisers or for troop transport rms olympic returned to belfast on 3 november 1914 , while work on britannic continued slowly in may 1915 , britannic completed mooring trials of her engines , and was prepared for emergency entrance into service with as little as four weeks ' notice the same month also saw the first major loss of a civilian ocean liner when cunard 's was torpedoed near the irish coast by the following month , the admiralty decided to use recently requisitioned passenger liners as troop transports in the gallipoli campaign ( also called the dardanelles service ) the first to sail were cunard 's and rms aquitania was diverted to hospital ship duties in august ( her place as a troop transport would be taken by rms olympic in september ) then on 13 november 1915 , britannic was requisitioned as a hospital ship from her storage location at belfast on 23 december , she left liverpool to join the port of mudros on the island of lemnos on the aegean sea to bring back sick and wounded soldiers . the four ships were joined a little later by statendam . the third voyage was from 20 march 1916 to 4 april the british government paid the white star line £75,000 to compensate for the conversion the transformation took place for several months before being interrupted by a recall of the ship back into military service the admiralty recalled the britannic back into service as a hospital ship on 26 august 1916 , and the ship returned to the mediterranean sea for a fourth voyage on 24 september of that year . on 29 september on her way to naples , she encountered a violent storm from which she emerged unscathed then , she made a fifth trip , which was marked by a quarantining of the crew when the ship arrived at mudros because of food-borne illness britannic passed gibraltar around midnight on 15 november and arrived at naples on the morning of 17 november , for her usual coalling and water refuelling stop , completing the first stage of her mission by next morning , the storms died and the ship passed the strait of messina without problems by morning , britannic was steaming at full speed into the kea channel , between sounion ( the southernmost point of attica , the prefecture that includes athens ) and the island of kea there were 1,066 people on board : 673 crew , 315 royal army medical corps ( ramc ) , 77 nurses and the captain the cause , whether it was a torpedo from an enemy submarine or a mine , was not apparent it would later be revealed that the mines were planted in the kea channel on 21 october 1916 by under the command of gustav sieß bartlett ordered the watertight doors closed , sent a distress signal , and ordered the crew to prepare the lifeboats an sos signal was immediately sent out and was received by several other ships in the area , among them and hms heroic , but britannic heard nothing in reply unknown to either bartlett or the ship 's wireless operator , the force of the first explosion had caused the antenna wires slung between the ship 's masts to snap she could stay afloat ( motionless ) with her first six watertight compartments flooded however , there were open portholes along the front lower decks , which tilted underwater within minutes of the explosion only two minutes after the blast , boiler rooms five and six had to be evacuated in about ten minutes , britannic was roughly in the same condition titanic had been in one hour after the collision with the iceberg the captain ordered the port shaft driven at a higher speed than the starboard side , which helped the ship move towards the island bartlett had given the order to prepare the lifeboats , but he did not allow them to be lowered into the water everyone took their most valuable belongings with them before they evacuated major harold priestley gathered his detachments from the royal army medical corps to the back of the a deck and inspected the cabins to ensure no one was left behind while bartlett continued his desperate manoeuvre , the ship listed more and more before he could do so , two lifeboats were put onto the water on the port side the plan of the britannic showed that she was intended to be more luxurious than her sister ships in order to compete with , ss leviathan and the a deck of the ship was devoted in its entirety to the first class , being fitted with a salon , two veranda cafes , a smoking room and a reading room « white star line mv britannic ( iii ) 1930–1960 the last wsl ship » , « titanic » and other white

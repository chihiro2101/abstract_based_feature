the republic of ireland act is itself quite short , running to just five brief sections , and is therefore set out in full as follows : section 1 of the act repealed the executive authority ( external relations ) act 1936 by doing so the act abolished the last remaining functions of the british monarch ( then george vi ) in relation to the irish state these functions had related to the issuance and acceptance of letters of credence of diplomatic and consular representatives and the conclusion of international agreements section 3 provides that the president of ireland may instead exercise these functions and any other functions in relation to the state 's external ( or foreign ) relations at the time the act came into force , the view of the irish taoiseach whose government brought in the act was that ireland did not have a king and had not been a member of the commonwealth since 1936 costello speaking in the dáil - the republic of ireland bill , 1948 — second stage ; wednesday , 24 november 1948 where he said '' '' we were not since 1936 a member of the commonwealth of nations '' his government 's view was that ireland was already a republic and that the act would not create a republic but rather achieve a '' clarification of ireland 's constitutional status until ireland brought the act into force , it was still regarded by the members as forming part of “ his majesty ’ s dominions ” with that irish act now being repealed , there was no longer any basis , however tenuous , to consider ireland as continuing to have a king or to be part of his majesty ’ s dominions and therefore within the commonwealth however , the irish government opted not to reapply for membership of the commonwealth , a decision that was criticised by then leader of the opposition éamon de valera , who considered applying for membership after being returned to power in the 1950s the constitution of ireland provides that éire ( or ireland in english ) is the official name of the state and , if the act had purported to change the name , it would have been unconstitutional as it was not a constitutional amendment costello , who introduced the republic of ireland bill in the oireachtas , explained the difference in the following way : the act repealed the external relations act , 1936 under that act , king george vi acted as the irish head of state in international relations by accredited ambassadors and on the state 's behalf accepted credentials appointing foreign ambassadors to the state the republic of ireland act removed this last remaining practical role from the king and vested it instead in the president of ireland , making the then president of ireland , seán t speaking in seanad éireann costello told senators that as a matter of law , the king was indeed '' king of ireland '' and irish head of state and the president of ireland was in effect no more than first citizen and a local notable , until the new law came into force ireland act 1949 , s lyons , ireland since the famine david gwynn morgan , constitutional law of ireland tim murphy and patrick twomey ( eds

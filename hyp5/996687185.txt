the republic of ireland act is itself quite short , running to just five brief sections , and is therefore set out in full as follows : section 1 of the act repealed the executive authority ( external relations ) act 1936 by doing so the act abolished the last remaining functions of the british monarch ( then george vi ) in relation to the irish state section 3 provides that the president of ireland may instead exercise these functions and any other functions in relation to the state 's external ( or foreign ) relations at the time the act came into force , the view of the irish taoiseach whose government brought in the act was that ireland did not have a king and had not been a member of the commonwealth since 1936 costello speaking in the dáil - the republic of ireland bill , 1948 — second stage ; wednesday , 24 november 1948 where he said '' '' we were not since 1936 a member of the commonwealth of nations '' his government 's view was that ireland was already a republic and that the act would not create a republic but rather achieve a '' clarification of ireland 's constitutional status opposition leader éamon de valera speaking in the dáil on the republic of ireland bill , 1948—second stage ; wednesday , 24 november 1948 indeed , irish leaders had on several previous occasions declared that ireland was a republic and not a commonwealth member , but that it was associated with the commonwealth until ireland brought the act into force , it was still regarded by the members as forming part of “ his majesty ’ s dominions ” when ireland adopted its 1937 constitution , which made no reference to the king , the united kingdom government announced that it and the other commonwealth governments were '' still prepared to treat.ireland , as a member of the british commonwealth of nations with that irish act now being repealed , there was no longer any basis , however tenuous , to consider ireland as continuing to have a king or to be part of his majesty ’ s dominions and therefore within the commonwealth the constitution of ireland provides that éire ( or ireland in english ) is the official name of the state and , if the act had purported to change the name , it would have been unconstitutional as it was not a constitutional amendment the act repealed the external relations act , 1936 the republic of ireland act removed this last remaining practical role from the king and vested it instead in the president of ireland , making the then president of ireland , seán t all treaties signed by the irish taoiseach or minister for external affairs were signed in the name of king george in october 1947 , de valera asked his attorney-general , cearbhall ó dálaigh , to draft a bill to repeal the external relations act this act formally asserted that the irish state had , when the republic of ireland act came into force , ceased “ to be part of his majesty ’ s dominions ” section 1 ( 1 ) of the ireland act 1949 and accordingly was no longer within the commonwealth the uk 's continued aversion to using '' ireland '' as the names of the irish state due to the fact it did not ( and does not ) comprise the entirety of ireland remained a source of diplomatic friction for several decades afterwards in 1996 , the constitution review group considered amending the constitution to declare that ireland should be named '' republic of ireland ''

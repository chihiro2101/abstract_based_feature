gaelic ireland consisted of as few as five and as many as nine primary kingdoms ( cúicide/cóicide 'fifths ' ) which were often subdivided into many minor smaller kingdoms ( tuatha , 'folkdoms ' ) until the end of gaelic ireland they continued to fluctuate , expand and contract in size , as well as dissolving entirely or being amalgamated into new entities máire herbert has noted that '' annal evidence from the late eighth century in ireland suggests that the larger provincial kingships were already accruing power at the expense of smaller political units leading kings appear in public roles at church-state proclamations & nbsp ; ruaidhrí , king of ireland upon the death of muirchertach mac lochlainn in early 1166 , ruaidhrí , king of connacht , proceeded to dublin where he was inaugurated king of ireland without opposition however , his caput remained in his home territory in central connacht ( county galway ) by the time of the arrival of henry ii in 1171 , ruaidrí 's position as king of ireland was increasingly untenable ruaidrí agreed to recognise henry as his lord ; in return , ruaidrí was allowed to keep all ireland as his personal kingdom outside the petty kingdoms of laigin ( leinster ) and mide as well as the city of waterford henry was unwilling or unable to enforce the terms of the treaty on his barons in ireland , who continued to gain territory in ireland he was twice briefly returned to power in 1185 and 1189 , but even within his home kingdom of connacht he had become politically marginalized by the time of ruaidrí 's death in 1198 , king henry ii of england had invaded ireland and given the part of it he controlled to his son john as a lordship when john was just ten years old in 1177 when john succeeded to the english throne in 1199 , he remained lord of ireland thereby bringing the kingdom of england and the lordship of ireland into personal union by the mid-13th century , while the island was nominally ruled by the king of england , from c.1260 the effective area of control began to recede john ( 1177–1216 ) first man to be made lord of ireland and established the precedent that that lord would also be king of england henry iii ( 1216–1272 ) henry iii granted ireland to his son , edward i , in 1254 on condition that it would never be separated from the crown edward iii ( 1327–1377 ) richard ii ( 1377–1399 ) robert de vere was created duke of ireland in 1386 , but forfeited his titles in 1388 the title '' king of ireland '' was created by an act of the irish parliament in 1541 , replacing the lordship of ireland , which had existed since 1171 , with the kingdom of ireland the crown of ireland act 1542 established a personal union between the english and irish crowns , providing that whoever was king of england was to be king of ireland as well , and so its first holder was henry viii of england last will and testament of dowager queen katherine parr this followed the failure of the plan to make the 1st duke of richmond and somerset ( 1519–1536 ) , henry viii 's illegitimate son , into the king of ireland although richmond was made lord lieutenant , the king 's counsellors feared that creating a separate kingdom of ireland , with a ruler other than that of england , would create another threat like the king of scotland however , in 1649 , the rump parliament , victorious in the english civil war , executed charles i , and made england a republic , or '' commonwealth '' the parliamentarian general oliver cromwell came across the irish sea to crush the irish royalists , temporarily uniting england , scotland , and ireland under one government , and styling himself '' lord protector '' of the three kingdoms ( see also cromwellian conquest of ireland ) the acts of union 1707 merged the kingdoms of england and scotland into the kingdom of great britain , under the sovereignty of the british crown by the terms of the acts of union 1800 , the kingdom of ireland merged with the kingdom of great britain , thus creating the united kingdom of great britain and ireland following the separation of most of ireland from that kingdom in 1922 , the remaining constituent parts were renamed the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland in 1927 , five years after the establishment of the irish free state the following year , a new constitution was ratified , changing the name of the free state to éire , or '' ireland '' in the english language , and establishing the office of president of ireland the position of the king in the irish state was finally and formally ended by the oireachtas with the repeal of the crown of ireland act 1542 by the statute law revision ( pre-union irish statutes ) act 1962 charles i was executed in 1649 and his son charles ii was recognised by some irish lords as king of ireland following the ireland act 1949 , only that part of ireland known as northern ireland remained part of a monarchy the kings successively and their advisers and governments in the united kingdom were fully aware that the republican intent of the representatives of the irish free state was in marked contrast to the intent of the governments of certain other dominions , such as canada in 1906 , patrick pearse , writing in the newspaper an claidheamh soluis , envisioned the ireland of 2006 as an independent irish-speaking kingdom with an '' ard rí '' or '' high king '' as head of state the new nationalism , 1916-18 , f s l lyons , in a new history of ireland : ireland under the union , ii , 1870-1921 , william edward vaughan , clarendon press , 1976 , page 233 michael laffan , the resurrection of ireland : the sinn féin party , 1916-1923 , p

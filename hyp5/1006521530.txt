gaelic ireland consisted of as few as five and as many as nine primary kingdoms ( cúicide/cóicide 'fifths ' ) which were often subdivided into many minor smaller kingdoms ( tuatha , 'folkdoms ' ) until the end of gaelic ireland they continued to fluctuate , expand and contract in size , as well as dissolving entirely or being amalgamated into new entities the role of high king of ireland was primarily titular and rarely ( if ever ) absolute the names of connacht , ulster , leinster and munster are still in use , now applied to the four modern provinces of ireland high kings of ireland , 846–1198 upon the death of muirchertach mac lochlainn in early 1166 , ruaidhrí , king of connacht , proceeded to dublin where he was inaugurated king of ireland without opposition he was arguably the first undisputed full king of ireland one of ruaidrí 's first acts as king was the subduing of leinster , which resulted in the exile of its king , diarmait mac murchada he then celebrated the oneach tailtann , a recognised prerogative of the high kings , and made a number of notable charitable gifts and donations henry was unwilling or unable to enforce the terms of the treaty on his barons in ireland , who continued to gain territory in ireland a low point came in 1177 with a successful raid into the heart of connacht by a party of anglo-normans , led by one of ruaidrí 's sons , prince muirchertach with the possible exception of the short reign of brian ua néill ( brian o'neill ) in 1258–60 , no other gaelic king was ever again recognised as king or high king of ireland when john succeeded to the english throne in 1199 , he remained lord of ireland thereby bringing the kingdom of england and the lordship of ireland into personal union as various cambro-norman noble families died out in the male line , the gaelic nobility began to reclaim lost territory king richard ii of england made two journeys to ireland during his reign to rectify the situation ; as a direct result of his second visit in 1399 he lost his throne to henry bolingbroke this was the last time that a medieval king of england visited ireland john ( 1177–1216 ) first man to be made lord of ireland and established the precedent that that lord would also be king of england brian ua néill claimed the title of high king of ireland from 1258 to 1260 , until his defeat and death in the battle of druim dearg ( also known as the battle of down ) edward iii ( 1327–1377 ) richard ii ( 1377–1399 ) robert de vere was created duke of ireland in 1386 , but forfeited his titles in 1388 henry viii ( 1509–1542 ) the title of lord of ireland was abolished by henry viii , who was made king of ireland by the parliament of ireland by the crown of ireland act 1542 kingdom of ireland , 1542–1800 the title '' king of ireland '' was created by an act of the irish parliament in 1541 , replacing the lordship of ireland , which had existed since 1171 , with the kingdom of ireland the crown of ireland act 1542 established a personal union between the english and irish crowns , providing that whoever was king of england was to be king of ireland as well , and so its first holder was henry viii of england although richmond was made lord lieutenant , the king 's counsellors feared that creating a separate kingdom of ireland , with a ruler other than that of england , would create another threat like the king of scotland the papal bull '' ilius '' of 1555 conferring the title of king of ireland upon philip ii for a brief period in the 17th century , during the wars of the three kingdoms from the impeachment and execution of charles i in 1649 to the irish restoration in may 1660 , there was no 'king of ireland ' the parliament of england at westminster voted to restore the monarchy , and in 1660 king charles ii returned from exile in france to become king of england , king of scotland and king of ireland following the separation of most of ireland from that kingdom in 1922 , the remaining constituent parts were renamed the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland in 1927 , five years after the establishment of the irish free state '' this ambiguity was eliminated with the enactment of the republic of ireland act 1948 , which came into force in april 1949 and declared the state to be a republic the external relations act was repealed , removing the remaining duties of the monarch , and ireland formally withdrew from the british commonwealth george i ( 1714–1727 ) george ii ( 1727–1760 ) george iii ( 1760–1800 ) the acts of union 1800 , instituted in reaction to the irish rebellion of 1798 , created the united kingdom of great britain and ireland following the ireland act 1949 , only that part of ireland known as northern ireland remained part of a monarchy the changes in the royal style in the 20th century took into account the emergence of independence for the dominions from the imperial parliament of the united kingdom 98 according to hugo o'donnell , 7th duke of tetuan , de valera raised the idea of an irish monarchy with his great-grandfather juan o'donnell

'' directive 2004/27/ec official journal of the european union 30 april 2004 l136 in the us , a '' drug '' is : a substance recognized by an official pharmacopeia or formulary a substance intended for use in the diagnosis , cure , mitigation , treatment , or prevention of disease a substance intended for use as a component of a medicine but not a device or a component , part or accessory of a device biological products are included within this definition and are generally covered by the same laws and regulations , but differences exist regarding their manufacturing processes ( chemical process versus biological process ) one of the key classifications is between traditional small molecule drugs ; usually derived from chemical synthesis , and biologic medical products ; which include recombinant proteins , vaccines , blood products used therapeutically ( such as ivig ) , gene therapy , and cell therapy ( for instance , stem cell therapies ) an elaborate and widely used classification system is the anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system ( atc system ) upper digestive tract : antacids , reflux suppressants , antiflatulents , antidopaminergics , proton pump inhibitors ( ppis ) , h2 antagonist , cytoprotectants , prostaglandin analogues general : beta blocker ( '' beta blockers '' ) , calcium channel blockers , diuretics , cardiac glycosides , antiarrhythmics , nitrate , antianginals , vasoconstriction , vasodilation affecting blood pressure/ ( antihypertensive drugs ) : ace inhibitors , angiotensin receptor blockers , beta-blockers , α blockers , calcium channel blockers , thiazide diuretics , loop diuretics , aldosterone inhibitors coagulation : anticoagulants , heparin , antiplatelet drugs , fibrinolysis , factor viii , antihemorrhagic , parkinson 's disease ) drugs , stimulants ( including amphetamines ) , benzodiazepines , cyclopyrrolones , dopamine antagonists , antihistamines , cholinergics , anticholinergics , emetics , cannabinoids , and serotonin antagonist the main classes of painkillers are nsaids , opioids and local anesthetics the main categories of drugs for musculoskeletal disorders are : nsaids ( including cox-2 selective inhibitors ) , muscle relaxants , neuromuscular drugs , and anticholinesterases anti-allergy : mast cell anti-glaucoma : adrenergic agonists , beta-blockers , carbonic anhydrase inhibitors/hyperosmotics , cholinergics , miotics , parasympathomimetics , prostaglandin agonists/prostaglandin inhibitors , nitroglycerin bronchodilators , antitussives , mucolytics , decongestants , inhaled and systemic corticosteroids , beta2-adrenergic agonists , anticholinergics , mast cell stabilizers , leukotriene antagonists for the reproductive system or urinary system antifungal , alkalinizing agents , quinolones , antibiotics , cholinergics , anticholinergics , antispasmodics , 5-alpha reductase inhibitor , selective alpha-1 blockers , sildenafils , fertility medications antibiotics , antifungals , antileprotics , antituberculous drugs , antimalarials , anthelmintics , amoebicides , antivirals , antiprotozoals , probiotics , prebiotics , antitoxins and antivenoms vaccines , immunoglobulins , immunosuppressants , interferons , monoclonal antibody anti-allergics , antihistamines , nsaids , corticosteroids administration is the process by which a patient takes a medicine there are three major categories of drug administration ; enteral ( via the human gastrointestinal tract ) , injection , and other ( dermis , nasal , ophthalmic , ear , and urogenital ) oral administration , the most common form of enteral administration , can be performed in various dosage forms including pills , tablets , or capsules , and other routes likewise have various forms frequencies are often abbreviated from latin , such as every 8 hours reading q8h from quaque viii hora in the fields of medicine , biotechnology and pharmacology , drug discovery is the process by which new drugs are discovered historically , drugs were discovered through identifying the active ingredient from traditional remedies or by serendipity discovery even more recently , scientists have been able to understand the shape of biological molecules at the atomic level , and to use that knowledge to design ( see drug design ) drug candidates modern drug discovery involves the identification of screening hits , medicinal chemistry and optimization of those hits to increase the affinity , selectivity ( to reduce the potential of side effects ) , efficacy/potency , metabolic stability ( to increase the half-life ) , and oral bioavailability once a compound that fulfills all of these requirements has been identified , it will begin the process of drug development prior to clinical trials despite advances in technology and understanding of biological systems , drug discovery is still a lengthy , '' expensive , difficult , and inefficient process '' with low rate of new therapeutic discovery the drug requires very expensive phase i , ii and iii clinical trials , and most of them fail drug development is the process of bringing a new drug to the market once a lead compound has been identified through the process of drug discovery doctors may also prescribe prescription drugs for off-label use – purposes which the drugs were not originally approved for by the regulatory agency in many jurisdictions drug prices are regulated in canada , the patented medicine prices review board examines drug pricing and determines if a price is excessive or not in india , drug prices are regulated by the national pharmaceutical pricing authority a blockbuster drug is a drug that generates more than 1 billion in revenue for a pharmaceutical company in a single year : : '' in the pharmaceutical industry , a blockbuster drug is one that achieves acceptance by prescribing physicians as a therapeutic standard for , most commonly , a highly prevalent chronic ( rather than acute ) condition the introduction of the sulfa drugs led to the mortality rate from pneumonia in the u.s lithium was discovered in the 19th century for nervous disorders and its possible mood-stabilizing or prophylactic effect ; it was cheap and easily produced in japan , during this time , the term tranquilizer produced the notion of a psyche-stabilizer and the term mood stabilizer vanished tone , andrea and elizabeth watkins , medicating modern america : prescription drugs in history as early as 1960 , oral contraceptives were available in several different strengths by every manufacturer significant growth in consumption was also evident in canada , new zealand , australia , and norway using plants and plant substances to treat all kinds of diseases and medical conditions is believed to date back to prehistoric medicine medicines commonly used by the late 1920s included aspirin , codeine , and morphine for pain ; digoxin , nitroglycerin , and quinine for heart disorders , and insulin for diabetes governments have been heavily involved in the regulation of drug development and drug sales drug prices are among the highest in the world , and drug innovation is correspondingly high ppcps comprise a diverse collection of thousands of chemical substances , including prescription and over-the-counter therapeutic drugs , veterinary drugs , fragrances , and cosmetics

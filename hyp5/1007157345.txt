30 april 2004 l136 in the us , a '' drug '' is : a substance recognized by an official pharmacopeia or formulary a substance intended for use in the diagnosis , cure , mitigation , treatment , or prevention of disease a substance ( other than food ) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body biological products are included within this definition and are generally covered by the same laws and regulations , but differences exist regarding their manufacturing processes ( chemical process versus biological process ) an elaborate and widely used classification system is the anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system ( atc system ) the world health organization keeps a list of essential medicines upper digestive tract : antacids , reflux suppressants , antiflatulents , antidopaminergics , proton pump inhibitors ( ppis ) , h2 antagonist , cytoprotectants , prostaglandin analogues affecting blood pressure/ ( antihypertensive drugs ) : ace inhibitors , angiotensin receptor blockers , beta-blockers , α blockers , calcium channel blockers , thiazide diuretics , loop diuretics , aldosterone inhibitors coagulation : anticoagulants , heparin , antiplatelet drugs , fibrinolysis , factor viii , antihemorrhagic the main classes of painkillers are nsaids , opioids and local anesthetics the main categories of drugs for musculoskeletal disorders are : nsaids ( including cox-2 selective inhibitors ) , muscle relaxants , neuromuscular drugs , and anticholinesterases antibacterial : antibiotics , topical antibiotics , sulfa drugs , aminoglycosides , fluoroquinolones anti-allergy : mast cell anti-glaucoma : adrenergic agonists , beta-blockers , carbonic anhydrase inhibitors/hyperosmotics , cholinergics , miotics , parasympathomimetics , prostaglandin agonists/prostaglandin inhibitors , nitroglycerin for the respiratory system for the reproductive system or urinary system tonics , electrolytes and mineral preparations ( including iron preparations and magnesium preparations ) , parenteral nutritions , vitamins , anti-obesity drugs , anabolic drugs , haematopoietic drugs , food product drugs cytotoxic drugs , therapeutic antibody , sex hormones , aromatase inhibitors , somatostatin inhibitors , recombinant interleukins , g-csf , erythropoietin euthanasia is not permitted by law in many countries , and consequently , medicines will not be licensed for this use in those countries oral administration , the most common form of enteral administration , can be performed in various dosage forms including pills , tablets , or capsules , and other routes likewise have various forms in the fields of medicine , biotechnology and pharmacology , drug discovery is the process by which new drugs are discovered later chemical library of synthetic small molecules , natural products or extracts were screened in intact cells or whole organisms to identify substances that have a desirable therapeutic effect in a process known as classical pharmacology even more recently , scientists have been able to understand the shape of biological molecules at the atomic level , and to use that knowledge to design ( see drug design ) drug candidates modern drug discovery involves the identification of screening hits , medicinal chemistry and optimization of those hits to increase the affinity , selectivity ( to reduce the potential of side effects ) , efficacy/potency , metabolic stability ( to increase the half-life ) , and oral bioavailability once a compound that fulfills all of these requirements has been identified , it will begin the process of drug development prior to clinical trials in 2010 , the research and development cost of each new molecular entity ( nme ) was approximately us 1.8 billion drug discovery is done by pharmaceutical companies , sometimes with research assistance from universities drug development is the process of bringing a new drug to the market once a lead compound has been identified through the process of drug discovery doctors may also prescribe prescription drugs for off-label use – purposes which the drugs were not originally approved for by the regulatory agency otc drugs are sold without restriction as they are considered safe enough that most people will not hurt themselves accidentally by taking it as instructed medical errors include overprescription and polypharmacy , misprescription , contraindication and lack of detail in dosage and administrations instructions in 2000 the definition of a prescription error was studied using a delphi method conference ; the conference was motivated by ambiguity in the what a prescription error and a need to use a uniform definition in studies in the uk , the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme is intended to ensure that the national health service is able to purchase drugs at reasonable prices in canada , the patented medicine prices review board examines drug pricing and determines if a price is excessive or not in brazil , the prices are regulated through a legislation under the name of medicamento genérico ( generic drugs ) since 1999 '' in european commission , pharmaceutical sector inquiry , preliminary report ( dg competition staff working paper ) , 28 november 2008 , page 17 ( pdf , 1.95 mb ) cimetidine was the first drug ever to reach more than 1 billion a year in sales , thus making it the first blockbuster drug : : '' in the pharmaceutical industry , a blockbuster drug is one that achieves acceptance by prescribing physicians as a therapeutic standard for , most commonly , a highly prevalent chronic ( rather than acute ) condition penicillin , introduced a few years later , provided a broader spectrum of activity compared to sulfa drugs and reduced side effects lithium was discovered in the 19th century for nervous disorders and its possible mood-stabilizing or prophylactic effect ; it was cheap and easily produced this antibiotic was the origin of the drug that eventually created the mood stabilizer category valpromide had distinct psychotrophic effects that were of benefit in both the treatment of acute manic states and in the maintenance treatment of manic depression illness soon arose the notion of a tranquilizer which was quite different from any sedative or stimulant in japan , during this time , the term tranquilizer produced the notion of a psyche-stabilizer and the term mood stabilizer vanished new york and london , new york university , 2007 enovid was known to be much more effective than alternatives including the condom and the diaphragm the kahun gynaecological papyrus , the oldest known medical text of any kind , dates to about 1800 bc and represents the first documented use of any kind of drug for most of the 19th century , drugs were not highly effective , leading oliver wendell holmes , sr within the united states , pre-approval demand is generally met through treatment ind ( investigational new drug ) applications ( inds ) , or single-patient inds through these programs , patients are able to access drugs in late-stage clinical trials or approved in other countries for a genuine , unmet medical need , before those drugs have been licensed in the patient 's home country ppcps comprise a diverse collection of thousands of chemical substances , including prescription and over-the-counter therapeutic drugs , veterinary drugs , fragrances , and cosmetics

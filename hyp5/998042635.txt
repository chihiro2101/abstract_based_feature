when division is explained at the elementary arithmetic level , it is often considered as splitting a set of objects into equal parts as an example , consider having ten cookies , and these cookies are to be distributed equally to five people at a table so , for dividing by zero , what is the number of cookies that each person receives when 10 cookies are evenly distributed amongst 0 people at a table ? certain words can be pinpointed in the question to highlight the problem in elementary algebra , another way of looking at division by zero is that division can always be checked using multiplication considering the example above , setting x , if x equals ten divided by zero , then x times zero equals ten , but there is no x that , when multiplied by zero , gives ten ( or any number other than zero ) according to brahmagupta , a positive or negative number when divided by zero is a fraction with the zero as denominator zero divided by a negative or positive number is either zero or is expressed as a fraction with zero as numerator and the finite quantity as denominator zero divided by zero is zero similarly , to support division of any integer by any other , the realm of numbers must expand to the rational numbers loosely speaking , since division by zero has no meaning ( is undefined ) in the whole number setting , this remains true as the setting expands to the real or even complex numbers asymptote well-defined division by zero , a short story by ted chiang indeterminate form zero divisor

when division is explained at the elementary arithmetic level , it is often considered as splitting a set of objects into equal parts so , for dividing by zero , what is the number of cookies that each person receives when 10 cookies are evenly distributed amongst 0 people at a table ? certain words can be pinpointed in the question to highlight the problem so , at least in elementary arithmetic , is said to be either meaningless , or undefined the problem with 5 cookies and 0 people , on the other hand , can not be solved in any way that preserves the meaning of '' divides '' in elementary algebra , another way of looking at division by zero is that division can always be checked using multiplication if instead of x , x , then every x satisfies the question 'what number x , multiplied by zero , gives zero ? ' 598–668 ) is the earliest text to treat zero as a number in its own right and to define operations involving zero according to brahmagupta , a positive or negative number when divided by zero is a fraction with the zero as denominator zero divided by a negative or positive number is either zero or is expressed as a fraction with zero as numerator and the finite quantity as denominator in 830 , mahāvīra unsuccessfully tried to correct brahmagupta 's mistake in his book in ganita sara samgraha : '' a number remains unchanged when divided by zero loosely speaking , since division by zero has no meaning ( is undefined ) in the whole number setting , this remains true as the setting expands to the real or even complex numbers

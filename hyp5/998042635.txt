when division is explained at the elementary arithmetic level , it is often considered as splitting a set of objects into equal parts so , for dividing by zero , what is the number of cookies that each person receives when 10 cookies are evenly distributed amongst 0 people at a table ? certain words can be pinpointed in the question to highlight the problem in elementary algebra , another way of looking at division by zero is that division can always be checked using multiplication if instead of x , x , then every x satisfies the question 'what number x , multiplied by zero , gives zero ? ' 598â€“668 ) is the earliest text to treat zero as a number in its own right and to define operations involving zero according to brahmagupta , a positive or negative number when divided by zero is a fraction with the zero as denominator zero divided by a negative or positive number is either zero or is expressed as a fraction with zero as numerator and the finite quantity as denominator zero divided by zero is zero loosely speaking , since division by zero has no meaning ( is undefined ) in the whole number setting , this remains true as the setting expands to the real or even complex numbers first , the natural numbers ( including zero ) are established on an axiomatic basis such as peano axioms and then this is expanded to the ring of integers asymptote well-defined division by zero , a short story by ted chiang indeterminate form zero divisor

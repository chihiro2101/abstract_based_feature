when division is explained at the elementary arithmetic level , it is often considered as splitting a set of objects into equal parts similarly , if there are ten cookies , and only one person at the table , that person would receive 10 cookies so , for dividing by zero , what is the number of cookies that each person receives when 10 cookies are evenly distributed amongst 0 people at a table ? certain words can be pinpointed in the question to highlight the problem in elementary algebra , another way of looking at division by zero is that division can always be checked using multiplication considering the example above , setting x , if x equals ten divided by zero , then x times zero equals ten , but there is no x that , when multiplied by zero , gives ten ( or any number other than zero ) if instead of x , x , then every x satisfies the question 'what number x , multiplied by zero , gives zero ? ' 598–668 ) is the earliest text to treat zero as a number in its own right and to define operations involving zero zero divided by zero is zero in 830 , mahāvīra unsuccessfully tried to correct brahmagupta 's mistake in his book in ganita sara samgraha : '' a number remains unchanged when divided by zero in keeping with this change of viewpoint , the question , '' why ca n't we divide by zero ? '' , becomes '' why ca n't a rational number have a zero denominator ? '' to be certain this definition does not lead to a contradiction , it should be preceded by the following theorem : there exists exactly one number x such that , for any number y , one has : y + x y ''

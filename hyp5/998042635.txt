as an example , consider having ten cookies , and these cookies are to be distributed equally to five people at a table similarly , if there are ten cookies , and only one person at the table , that person would receive 10 cookies so , for dividing by zero , what is the number of cookies that each person receives when 10 cookies are evenly distributed amongst 0 people at a table ? certain words can be pinpointed in the question to highlight the problem in elementary algebra , another way of looking at division by zero is that division can always be checked using multiplication considering the example above , setting x , if x equals ten divided by zero , then x times zero equals ten , but there is no x that , when multiplied by zero , gives ten ( or any number other than zero ) according to brahmagupta , a positive or negative number when divided by zero is a fraction with the zero as denominator the four basic operations – addition , subtraction , multiplication and division – as applied to whole numbers ( positive integers ) , with some restrictions , in elementary arithmetic are used as a framework to support the extension of the realm of numbers to which they apply for instance , to make it possible to subtract any whole number from another , the realm of numbers must be expanded to the entire set of integers in order to incorporate the negative integers similarly , to support division of any integer by any other , the realm of numbers must expand to the rational numbers similarly , when the realm of numbers expands to include the rational numbers , division is replaced by multiplication by certain rational numbers asymptote well-defined division by zero , a short story by ted chiang indeterminate form zero divisor

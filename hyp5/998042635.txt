so , for dividing by zero , what is the number of cookies that each person receives when 10 cookies are evenly distributed amongst 0 people at a table ? certain words can be pinpointed in the question to highlight the problem in any integer partition of 5 things into 2 parts , either one of the parts of the partition will have more elements than the other , or there will be a remainder ( written as 2 r1 ) in elementary algebra , another way of looking at division by zero is that division can always be checked using multiplication considering the example above , setting x , if x equals ten divided by zero , then x times zero equals ten , but there is no x that , when multiplied by zero , gives ten ( or any number other than zero ) if instead of x , x , then every x satisfies the question 'what number x , multiplied by zero , gives zero ? ' the author could not explain division by zero in his texts : his definition can be easily proven to lead to algebraic absurdities zero divided by a negative or positive number is either zero or is expressed as a fraction with zero as numerator and the finite quantity as denominator the four basic operations – addition , subtraction , multiplication and division – as applied to whole numbers ( positive integers ) , with some restrictions , in elementary arithmetic are used as a framework to support the extension of the realm of numbers to which they apply similarly , to support division of any integer by any other , the realm of numbers must expand to the rational numbers similarly , when the realm of numbers expands to include the rational numbers , division is replaced by multiplication by certain rational numbers suppes 's §8.5 the problem of division by zero begins this way : '' that everything is not for the best in this best of all possible worlds , even in mathematics , is well illustrated by the vexing problem of defining the operation of division in the elementary theory of arithmetic '' ( p

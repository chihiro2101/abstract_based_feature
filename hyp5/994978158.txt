the spatial distribution of the lens flare typically manifests as several starbursts , rings , or circles in a row across the image or view lens flare patterns typically spread widely across the scene and change location with the camera 's movement relative to light sources , tracking with the light position and fading as the camera points away from the bright light until it causes no flare at all for example , if the lens has a 6-bladed aperture , the flare may have a hexagonal pattern when a bright light source is shining on the lens but not in its field of view , lens flare appears as a haze that washes out the image and reduces contrast filters can be attached to the camera lens which will also minimise lens flare , which is especially useful for outdoor photographers a lens flare is also useful when added to an artificial or modified image composition because it adds a sense of realism , implying that the image is an un-edited original photograph of a '' real life '' scene abrams added numerous lens flares to his films star trek and super 8 by aiming powerful off-camera light sources at the lens file : high-quality lens flare rendering.png high-end lens flare rendering using a recent technique file : edinburgh-princesstreet2.jpg lens flare is extremely difficult to control when a bright light source like the sun is just outside the frame file:20100525 imbros marmaros turkey example of lens flare.jpg lens flare - the sun is outside the frame

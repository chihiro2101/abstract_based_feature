the spatial distribution of the lens flare typically manifests as several starbursts , rings , or circles in a row across the image or view lens flare patterns typically spread widely across the scene and change location with the camera 's movement relative to light sources , tracking with the light position and fading as the camera points away from the bright light until it causes no flare at all the specific spatial distribution of the flare depends on the shape of the aperture of the image formation elements such internal scattering is also present in the human eye , and manifests in an unwanted veiling glare most obvious when viewing very bright lights or highly reflective surfaces when a bright light source is shining on the lens but not in its field of view , lens flare appears as a haze that washes out the image and reduces contrast this can be avoided by shading the lens using a lens hood abrams added numerous lens flares to his films star trek and super 8 by aiming powerful off-camera light sources at the lens file : high-quality lens flare rendering.png high-end lens flare rendering using a recent technique file : edinburgh-princesstreet2.jpg lens flare is extremely difficult to control when a bright light source like the sun is just outside the frame file : firework with lens flare.jpg when the subject of a photo is the light source itself , lens flare can be a desirable and dramatic effect

lens flare patterns typically spread widely across the scene and change location with the camera 's movement relative to light sources , tracking with the light position and fading as the camera points away from the bright light until it causes no flare at all the specific spatial distribution of the flare depends on the shape of the aperture of the image formation elements for example , if the lens has a 6-bladed aperture , the flare may have a hexagonal pattern when a bright light source is shining on the lens but not in its field of view , lens flare appears as a haze that washes out the image and reduces contrast filters can be attached to the camera lens which will also minimise lens flare , which is especially useful for outdoor photographers lens flare was one of the first special effects developed for computer graphics because it can be imitated using relatively simple means abrams added numerous lens flares to his films star trek and super 8 by aiming powerful off-camera light sources at the lens file : lens flare.jpg photograph of nasa lunar lander containing lens flare file : firework with lens flare.jpg when the subject of a photo is the light source itself , lens flare can be a desirable and dramatic effect

this period contains the lanthanides , also known as the rare earths many period 6 transition metals are very valuable , such as gold , however many period 6 other metals are incredibly toxic , such as thallium period 6 contains the last stable element , lead all subsequent elements in the periodic table are radioactive after bismuth , which has a half-life or more than 10 19 years , polonium , astatine , and radon are some of the half-life and rarest elements known ; less than a gram of astatine is estimated to exist on earth at any given time : between initial xe and final 6s 2 electronic shells the lanthanide elements are the group of elements with atomic number increasing from 57 ( lanthanum ) to 71 ( lutetium ) however , both elements are often included in any general discussion of the chemistry of the lanthanide elements lutetium is a chemical element with the symbol lu and atomic number 71 it is the last element in the lanthanide series , which , along with the lanthanide contraction , explains several important properties of lutetium , such as it having the highest hardness or density among lanthanides unlike other lanthanides , which lie in the f-block of the periodic table , this element lies in the d-block ; however , lanthanum is sometimes placed on the d-block lanthanide position chemically , lutetium is a typical lanthanide : its only common oxidation state is +3 , seen in its oxide , halides and other compounds he chose the name lutecium for the new element but in 1949 the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium hafnium is a chemical element with the symbol hf and atomic number 72 hafnium was the penultimate stable isotope element to be discovered ( rhenium was identified two years later ) tantalum is a chemical element with the symbol ta and atomic number 73 euripides , orestes tantalum is a rare , hard , blue-gray , lustrous transition metal that is highly corrosion resistant tungsten , also known as wolfram , is a chemical element with the chemical symbol w and atomic number 74 a hard , rare metal under standard conditions when uncombined , tungsten is found naturally on earth only in chemical compounds also remarkable is its high density of 19.3 times that of water , comparable to that of uranium and gold , and much higher ( about 1.7 times ) than that of lead the unalloyed elemental form is used mainly in electrical applications tungsten is the only metal from the third transition series that is known to occur in biomolecules , where it is used in a few species of bacteria rhenium is a chemical element with the symbol re and atomic number 75 it is a silvery-white , heavy , third-row transition metal in group 7 of the periodic table with an estimated average concentration of 1 part per billion ( ppb ) , rhenium is one of the rarest elements in the earth 's crust rhenium resembles manganese chemically and is obtained as a by-product of molybdenum and copper ore 's extraction and refinement rhenium shows in its compounds a wide variety of oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7 it is a hard , brittle , blue-gray or blue-black transition metal in the platinum family and is the densest naturally occurring element , with a density of ( slightly greater than that of iridium and twice that of lead ) iridium is the chemical element with atomic number 77 , and is represented by the symbol ir a very hard , brittle , silvery-white transition metal of the platinum group , iridium is the second-density element ( after osmium ) and is the most corrosion-resistant metal , even at temperatures as high as 2000 & nbsp ; °c iridium is one of the rarest elements in the earth 's crust , with annual production and consumption of only three tonnes platinum is a chemical element with the chemical symbol pt and an atomic number of 78 being a heavy metal , it leads to health issues upon exposure to its salts , but due to its corrosion resistance , it is not as toxic as some metals its compounds , most notably cisplatin , are applied in chemotherapy against certain types of cancer it is a chemical element with the symbol au and atomic number 79 chemically , gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element less commonly , it occurs in minerals as gold compounds , usually with tellurium gold dissolves in mercury , forming amalgam alloys it is also known as quicksilver or hydrargyrum ( mercury occurs in deposits throughout the world mostly as cinnabar ( mercuric sulfide ) it is used in lighting : electricity passed through mercury vapor in a phosphor tube produces short-wave ultraviolet light which then causes the phosphor to fluoresce , making visible light astatine is a radioactive chemical element with the symbol at and atomic number 85 it occurs on the earth only as the result of decay of heavier elements , and decays away rapidly , so much less is known about this element than its upper neighbors in the periodic table most of the period 6 elements are toxic ( for instance lead ) and produce heavy-element poisoning

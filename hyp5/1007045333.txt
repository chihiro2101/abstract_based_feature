this period contains the lanthanides , also known as the rare earths many period 6 transition metals are very valuable , such as gold , however many period 6 other metals are incredibly toxic , such as thallium period 6 contains the last stable element , lead : between initial xe and final 6s 2 electronic shells the lanthanide elements are the group of elements with atomic number increasing from 57 ( lanthanum ) to 71 ( lutetium ) strictly speaking , both lanthanum and lutetium have been labeled as group 3 elements , because they both have a single valence electron in the d shell however , both elements are often included in any general discussion of the chemistry of the lanthanide elements lutetium is a chemical element with the symbol lu and atomic number 71 it is the last element in the lanthanide series , which , along with the lanthanide contraction , explains several important properties of lutetium , such as it having the highest hardness or density among lanthanides unlike other lanthanides , which lie in the f-block of the periodic table , this element lies in the d-block ; however , lanthanum is sometimes placed on the d-block lanthanide position chemically , lutetium is a typical lanthanide : its only common oxidation state is +3 , seen in its oxide , halides and other compounds he chose the name lutecium for the new element but in 1949 the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium like other lanthanides , lutetium is one of the elements that traditionally were included in the classification '' rare earths for example , a radioactive isotope lutetium-176 is used in nuclear technology to determine the age of meteorites lutetium usually occurs in association with the element yttrium and is sometimes used in metal alloys and as a catalyst in various chemical reactions hafnium is a chemical element with the symbol hf and atomic number 72 hafnium was the penultimate stable isotope element to be discovered ( rhenium was identified two years later ) hafnium is named for hafnia , the latin name for '' copenhagen '' , where it was discovered some superalloys used for special applications contain hafnium in combination with niobium , titanium , or tungsten tantalum is a chemical element with the symbol ta and atomic number 73 euripides , orestes tantalum is a rare , hard , blue-gray , lustrous transition metal that is highly corrosion resistant it is part of the refractory metals group , which are widely used as minor component in alloys a hard , rare metal under standard conditions when uncombined , tungsten is found naturally on earth only in chemical compounds the free element is remarkable for its robustness , especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all the non-alloyed metals and the second highest of all the elements after carbon also remarkable is its high density of 19.3 times that of water , comparable to that of uranium and gold , and much higher ( about 1.7 times ) than that of lead however , very pure tungsten , though still hard , is more ductile , and can be cut with a hard-steel hacksaw it is the heaviest element known to be used by any living organism rhenium is a chemical element with the symbol re and atomic number 75 it is a hard , brittle , blue-gray or blue-black transition metal in the platinum family and is the densest naturally occurring element , with a density of ( slightly greater than that of iridium and twice that of lead ) smithson tennant , the primary discoverer , named the iridium for the goddess iris , personification of the rainbow , because of the striking and diverse colors of its salts and are the only two naturally occurring isotopes of iridium as well as the only stable isotopes ; the latter is the more abundant of the two the most important iridium compounds in use are the salts and acids it forms with chlorine , though iridium also forms a number of organometallic compounds used in industrial catalysis , and in research platinum is a chemical element with the chemical symbol pt and an atomic number of 78 24 april 2012 it is a dense , malleable , ductile , precious , gray-white transition metal it is one of the rarest elements in the earth 's crust and has an average abundance of approximately 5 & nbsp ; Î¼g/kg as a member of the platinum group of elements , as well as of the group 10 of the periodic table of elements , platinum is generally non-reactive it exhibits a remarkable resistance to corrosion , even at high temperatures , and as such is considered a noble metal because only a few hundred tonnes are produced annually , it is a scarce material , and is highly valuable and is a major precious metal commodity it is a chemical element with the symbol au and atomic number 79 bismuth is a chemical element with symbol bi and atomic number 83 polonium is a chemical element with the symbol po and atomic number 84 , discovered in 1898 by marie curie and pierre curie radon is a chemical element with symbol rn and atomic number 86 however , gold , platinum , mercury , and some lanthanides such as gadolinium have applications as drugs

this period contains the lanthanides , also known as the rare earths many period 6 transition metals are very valuable , such as gold , however many period 6 other metals are incredibly toxic , such as thallium period 6 contains the last stable element , lead all subsequent elements in the periodic table are radioactive : between initial xe and final 6s 2 electronic shells the lanthanide elements are the group of elements with atomic number increasing from 57 ( lanthanum ) to 71 ( lutetium ) they are termed lanthanide because the lighter elements in the series are chemically similar to lanthanum however , both elements are often included in any general discussion of the chemistry of the lanthanide elements this convention is entirely a matter of aesthetics and formatting practicality ; a rarely used wide-formatted periodic table inserts the lanthanide and actinide series in their proper places , as parts of the table 's sixth and seventh rows ( periods ) unlike other lanthanides , which lie in the f-block of the periodic table , this element lies in the d-block ; however , lanthanum is sometimes placed on the d-block lanthanide position in an aqueous solution , like compounds of other late lanthanides , soluble lutetium compounds form a complex with nine water molecules all of these men found lutetium as an impurity in the mineral ytterbia , which was previously thought to consist entirely of ytterbium he chose the name lutecium for the new element but in 1949 the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium like other lanthanides , lutetium is one of the elements that traditionally were included in the classification '' rare earths hafnium is a chemical element with the symbol hf and atomic number 72 hafnium was the penultimate stable isotope element to be discovered ( rhenium was identified two years later ) some semiconductor fabrication processes use its oxide for integrated circuits at 45 & nbsp ; nm and smaller feature lengths some superalloys used for special applications contain hafnium in combination with niobium , titanium , or tungsten tantalum is a chemical element with the symbol ta and atomic number 73 previously known as tantalium , the name comes from tantalus , a character from greek mythology it is part of the refractory metals group , which are widely used as minor component in alloys tantalum , always together with the chemically similar niobium , occurs in the minerals tantalite , columbite and coltan ( a mix of columbite and tantalite ) tungsten , also known as wolfram , is a chemical element with the chemical symbol w and atomic number 74 a hard , rare metal under standard conditions when uncombined , tungsten is found naturally on earth only in chemical compounds the free element is remarkable for its robustness , especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all the non-alloyed metals and the second highest of all the elements after carbon tungsten with minor amounts of impurities is often brittle and hard , making it difficult to work tungsten interferes with molybdenum and copper metabolism , and is somewhat toxic to animal life rhenium is a chemical element with the symbol re and atomic number 75 with an estimated average concentration of 1 part per billion ( ppb ) , rhenium is one of the rarest elements in the earth 's crust rhenium shows in its compounds a wide variety of oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7 it is a hard , brittle , blue-gray or blue-black transition metal in the platinum family and is the densest naturally occurring element , with a density of ( slightly greater than that of iridium and twice that of lead ) iridium is one of the rarest elements in the earth 's crust , with annual production and consumption of only three tonnes and are the only two naturally occurring isotopes of iridium as well as the only stable isotopes ; the latter is the more abundant of the two it is one of the rarest elements in the earth 's crust and has an average abundance of approximately 5 & nbsp ; μg/kg it occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some native deposits , mostly in south africa , which accounts for 80 % of the world production as a member of the platinum group of elements , as well as of the group 10 of the periodic table of elements , platinum is generally non-reactive it is one of the least reactive chemical elements solid under standard conditions the last gold certificate and gold coin currencies were issued in the u.s mercury is a chemical element with the symbol hg and atomic number 80 bismuth is a chemical element with symbol bi and atomic number 83 bismuth has classically been considered to be the heaviest naturally occurring stable element , in terms of atomic mass intense radioactivity also hindered chemical studies of radon and only a few compounds are known of the period 6 elements , only tungsten is known to have any biological role in organisms

this period contains the lanthanides , also known as the rare earths many period 6 transition metals are very valuable , such as gold , however many period 6 other metals are incredibly toxic , such as thallium period 6 contains the last stable element , lead all subsequent elements in the periodic table are radioactive after bismuth , which has a half-life or more than 10 19 years , polonium , astatine , and radon are some of the half-life and rarest elements known ; less than a gram of astatine is estimated to exist on earth at any given time : between initial xe and final 6s 2 electronic shells the lanthanide elements are the group of elements with atomic number increasing from 57 ( lanthanum ) to 71 ( lutetium ) they are termed lanthanide because the lighter elements in the series are chemically similar to lanthanum strictly speaking , both lanthanum and lutetium have been labeled as group 3 elements , because they both have a single valence electron in the d shell however , both elements are often included in any general discussion of the chemistry of the lanthanide elements lutetium is a chemical element with the symbol lu and atomic number 71 unlike other lanthanides , which lie in the f-block of the periodic table , this element lies in the d-block ; however , lanthanum is sometimes placed on the d-block lanthanide position he chose the name lutecium for the new element but in 1949 the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium for example , a radioactive isotope lutetium-176 is used in nuclear technology to determine the age of meteorites hafnium was the penultimate stable isotope element to be discovered ( rhenium was identified two years later ) hafnium is named for hafnia , the latin name for '' copenhagen '' , where it was discovered it is part of the refractory metals group , which are widely used as minor component in alloys tantalum , always together with the chemically similar niobium , occurs in the minerals tantalite , columbite and coltan ( a mix of columbite and tantalite ) tungsten , also known as wolfram , is a chemical element with the chemical symbol w and atomic number 74 a hard , rare metal under standard conditions when uncombined , tungsten is found naturally on earth only in chemical compounds the free element is remarkable for its robustness , especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all the non-alloyed metals and the second highest of all the elements after carbon also remarkable is its high density of 19.3 times that of water , comparable to that of uranium and gold , and much higher ( about 1.7 times ) than that of lead tungsten with minor amounts of impurities is often brittle and hard , making it difficult to work tungsten 's many alloys have numerous applications , most notably in incandescent light bulb filaments , x-ray tubes ( as both the filament and target ) , electrodes in tig welding , and superalloys rhenium is a chemical element with the symbol re and atomic number 75 it is a silvery-white , heavy , third-row transition metal in group 7 of the periodic table with an estimated average concentration of 1 part per billion ( ppb ) , rhenium is one of the rarest elements in the earth 's crust the free element has the third-highest melting point and highest boiling point of any element rhenium shows in its compounds a wide variety of oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7 discovered in 1925 , rhenium was the last stable element to be discovered osmium is a chemical element with the symbol os and atomic number 76 a very hard , brittle , silvery-white transition metal of the platinum group , iridium is the second-density element ( after osmium ) and is the most corrosion-resistant metal , even at temperatures as high as 2000 & nbsp ; °c although only certain molten salts and halogens are corrosive to solid iridium , finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be flammable smithson tennant , the primary discoverer , named the iridium for the goddess iris , personification of the rainbow , because of the striking and diverse colors of its salts iridium radioisotopes are used in some radioisotope thermoelectric generators platinum is a chemical element with the chemical symbol pt and an atomic number of 78 24 april 2012 it is a dense , malleable , ductile , precious , gray-white transition metal it occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some native deposits , mostly in south africa , which accounts for 80 % of the world production because only a few hundred tonnes are produced annually , it is a scarce material , and is highly valuable and is a major precious metal commodity bismuth is a chemical element with symbol bi and atomic number 83 astatine is a radioactive chemical element with the symbol at and atomic number 85 intense radioactivity also hindered chemical studies of radon and only a few compounds are known promethium , polonium , astatine and radon are radioactive , and therefore present radioactive hazards

this period contains the lanthanides , also known as the rare earths many period 6 transition metals are very valuable , such as gold , however many period 6 other metals are incredibly toxic , such as thallium period 6 contains the last stable element , lead all subsequent elements in the periodic table are radioactive after bismuth , which has a half-life or more than 10 19 years , polonium , astatine , and radon are some of the half-life and rarest elements known ; less than a gram of astatine is estimated to exist on earth at any given time : between initial xe and final 6s 2 electronic shells the lanthanide elements are the group of elements with atomic number increasing from 57 ( lanthanum ) to 71 ( lutetium ) they are termed lanthanide because the lighter elements in the series are chemically similar to lanthanum strictly speaking , both lanthanum and lutetium have been labeled as group 3 elements , because they both have a single valence electron in the d shell however , both elements are often included in any general discussion of the chemistry of the lanthanide elements lutetium is a chemical element with the symbol lu and atomic number 71 chemically , lutetium is a typical lanthanide : its only common oxidation state is +3 , seen in its oxide , halides and other compounds like other lanthanides , lutetium is one of the elements that traditionally were included in the classification '' rare earths '' lutetium is rare and expensive ; consequently , it has few specific uses lutetium usually occurs in association with the element yttrium and is sometimes used in metal alloys and as a catalyst in various chemical reactions hafnium is a chemical element with the symbol hf and atomic number 72 hafnium was the penultimate stable isotope element to be discovered ( rhenium was identified two years later ) hafnium is named for hafnia , the latin name for '' copenhagen '' , where it was discovered previously known as tantalium , the name comes from tantalus , a character from greek mythology tantalum , always together with the chemically similar niobium , occurs in the minerals tantalite , columbite and coltan ( a mix of columbite and tantalite ) also remarkable is its high density of 19.3 times that of water , comparable to that of uranium and gold , and much higher ( about 1.7 times ) than that of lead however , very pure tungsten , though still hard , is more ductile , and can be cut with a hard-steel hacksaw tungsten 's hardness and high density give it military applications in penetrating projectiles tungsten compounds are most often used industrially as catalysts it is the heaviest element known to be used by any living organism rhenium is a chemical element with the symbol re and atomic number 75 discovered in 1925 , rhenium was the last stable element to be discovered iridium is one of the rarest elements in the earth 's crust , with annual production and consumption of only three tonnes iridium is found in meteorites with an abundance much higher than its average abundance in the earth 's crust platinum is a chemical element with the chemical symbol pt and an atomic number of 78 it is one of the rarest elements in the earth 's crust and has an average abundance of approximately 5 & nbsp ; Î¼g/kg it exhibits a remarkable resistance to corrosion , even at high temperatures , and as such is considered a noble metal platinum is used in catalytic converters , laboratory equipment , electrical contacts and electrodes , platinum-resistance thermometers , dentistry equipment , and jewelry because only a few hundred tonnes are produced annually , it is a scarce material , and is highly valuable and is a major precious metal commodity chemically , gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element it is one of the least reactive chemical elements solid under standard conditions gold resists attacks by individual acids , but it can be dissolved by the aqua regia ( nitro-hydrochloric acid ) , so named because it dissolves gold gold has been a valuable and highly sought-after precious metal for coinage , jewelry , and other arts since long before the beginning of recorded history gold standards have been a common basis for monetary policy throughout human history , later being supplanted by fiat currency starting in the 1930s lead has the highest atomic number of all of the stable elements , although the next higher element , bismuth , has a half-life that is so long ( much longer than the age of the universe ) that it can be considered stable bismuth is a chemical element with symbol bi and atomic number 83 it occurs on the earth only as the result of decay of heavier elements , and decays away rapidly , so much less is known about this element than its upper neighbors in the periodic table of the period 6 elements , only tungsten is known to have any biological role in organisms

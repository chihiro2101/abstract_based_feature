this period contains the lanthanides , also known as the rare earths many period 6 transition metals are very valuable , such as gold , however many period 6 other metals are incredibly toxic , such as thallium period 6 contains the last stable element , lead all subsequent elements in the periodic table are radioactive after bismuth , which has a half-life or more than 10 19 years , polonium , astatine , and radon are some of the half-life and rarest elements known ; less than a gram of astatine is estimated to exist on earth at any given time : between initial xe and final 6s 2 electronic shells the lanthanide elements are the group of elements with atomic number increasing from 57 ( lanthanum ) to 71 ( lutetium ) they are termed lanthanide because the lighter elements in the series are chemically similar to lanthanum however , both elements are often included in any general discussion of the chemistry of the lanthanide elements unlike other lanthanides , which lie in the f-block of the periodic table , this element lies in the d-block ; however , lanthanum is sometimes placed on the d-block lanthanide position chemically , lutetium is a typical lanthanide : its only common oxidation state is +3 , seen in its oxide , halides and other compounds all of these men found lutetium as an impurity in the mineral ytterbia , which was previously thought to consist entirely of ytterbium he chose the name lutecium for the new element but in 1949 the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium for example , a radioactive isotope lutetium-176 is used in nuclear technology to determine the age of meteorites lutetium usually occurs in association with the element yttrium and is sometimes used in metal alloys and as a catalyst in various chemical reactions 177 lu-dota-tate is used for radionuclide therapy ( see nuclear medicine ) on neuroendocrine tumours tantalum is a chemical element with the symbol ta and atomic number 73 euripides , orestes tantalum is a rare , hard , blue-gray , lustrous transition metal that is highly corrosion resistant its important ores include wolframite and scheelite however , very pure tungsten , though still hard , is more ductile , and can be cut with a hard-steel hacksaw the unalloyed elemental form is used mainly in electrical applications tungsten compounds are most often used industrially as catalysts tungsten is the only metal from the third transition series that is known to occur in biomolecules , where it is used in a few species of bacteria with an estimated average concentration of 1 part per billion ( ppb ) , rhenium is one of the rarest elements in the earth 's crust rhenium shows in its compounds a wide variety of oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7 osmium is a chemical element with the symbol os and atomic number 76 iridium is the chemical element with atomic number 77 , and is represented by the symbol ir a very hard , brittle , silvery-white transition metal of the platinum group , iridium is the second-density element ( after osmium ) and is the most corrosion-resistant metal , even at temperatures as high as 2000 & nbsp ; °c smithson tennant , the primary discoverer , named the iridium for the goddess iris , personification of the rainbow , because of the striking and diverse colors of its salts and are the only two naturally occurring isotopes of iridium as well as the only stable isotopes ; the latter is the more abundant of the two the most important iridium compounds in use are the salts and acids it forms with chlorine , though iridium also forms a number of organometallic compounds used in industrial catalysis , and in research it occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some native deposits , mostly in south africa , which accounts for 80 % of the world production as a member of the platinum group of elements , as well as of the group 10 of the periodic table of elements , platinum is generally non-reactive it exhibits a remarkable resistance to corrosion , even at high temperatures , and as such is considered a noble metal as a result , platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum it is a chemical element with the symbol au and atomic number 79 gold resists attacks by individual acids , but it can be dissolved by the aqua regia ( nitro-hydrochloric acid ) , so named because it dissolves gold mercury is a chemical element with the symbol hg and atomic number 80 lead has a shiny chrome-silver luster when it is melted into a liquid bismuth compounds ( accounting for about half the production of bismuth ) are used in cosmetics , pigments , and a few pharmaceuticals astatine is a radioactive chemical element with the symbol at and atomic number 85 radon gas from natural sources can accumulate in buildings , especially in confined areas such as attics and basements most of the period 6 elements are toxic ( for instance lead ) and produce heavy-element poisoning

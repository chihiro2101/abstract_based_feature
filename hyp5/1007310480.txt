robert was prior of the monastery of st ouen at rouen before he became abbot of the important jumièges abbey douglas william the conqueror p 193–194 robert 's alternate surname '' champart '' or '' chambert '' probably derived from champart , a term for the part of a crop paid as rent to a landlord cowdrey '' robert of jumièges '' oxford dictionary of national biography robert became friendly with edward the confessor , a claimant to the english throne , while edward was living in exile in normandy , probably in the 1030s edward was the son of æthelred the unready , king of england , who had been replaced by cnut the great in 1016 cnut subsequently married æthelred 's widow emma of normandy , edward 's mother , and had a son with her , harthacanute for their own safety , edward and his brother alfred were sent to emma 's relatives in normandy 306–310 after cnut 's death in 1035 , harold harefoot , his elder son by his first wife , acceded to the english throne 315–318 there is some evidence that edward spent some of his time in exile around jumièges , as after becoming king he gave gifts to the abbey left robert accompanied edward the confessor on edward 's recall to england in 1042 to become king following harthacanute 's death it was due to edward that in august 1044 robert was appointed bishop of london , fryde , et al 46–50 robert remained close to the king and was the leader of the party opposed to earl godwin , earl of wessex godwin , for his part , was attempting to expand the influence of his family , which had already acquired much land 51–53 the vita ædwardi regis , a hagiographical work on king edward 's life , claimed that robert '' was always the most powerful confidential adviser of the king '' 50 robert seems to have favoured closer relations with normandy , and its duke 29–30 in the end robert 's favoured candidate , william the norman , was consecrated instead of spearhafoc 42–43 these disputes over the estates and revenues of the archbishopric contributed to the friction between robert and godwin , campbell '' pre-conquest norman occupation of england '' speculum p robert 's election had disrupted godwin 's patronage powers in canterbury , and now robert 's efforts to recover lands godwin had seized from canterbury challenged the earl 's economic rights barlow edward the confessor p 111 godwin and his family were exiled ; afterwards robert claimed the office of sheriff of kent , probably on the strength of eadsige , his predecessor as archbishop , having held the office 115 although robert refused to consecrate spearhafoc , there is little evidence that he was interested in the growing movement towards church reform being promulgated by the papacy it may have been partly to appease leo that edward appointed robert instead of æthelric , hoping to signal to the papacy that the english crown was not totally opposed to the growing reform movement 177 if true , robert 's refusal to consecrate spearhafoc would have contributed to the growing rift between the archbishop and the earl william of jumièges says that robert went to tell duke william that edward wished william to be his heir robert journeyed to rome to complain to the pope about his own exile , barlow edward the confessor p however , this view is contradicted by david douglas , a historian and biographer of william the conqueror , who believes that robert merely relayed edward 's decision , probably while robert was on his way to rome to receive his pallium in notable contrast to his successor stigand , robert does not figure among the important benefactors to english churches , dodwell anglo-saxon art mentions many of these , but not robert 225–226 before he came to england , robert had begun the construction of a new abbey church at jumièges , in the new romanesque style which was then becoming popular , and introduced to normandy the westwork from the rhineland 219–222 robert probably influenced edward the confessor 's rebuilding of the church at westminster abbey , the first known building in the romanesque style in england , which is so described by william of malmesbury

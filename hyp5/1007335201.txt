in both europe and the far east , traditionally the artist only designed the woodcut , and the block-carving was left to specialist craftsmen , called block-cutters , some of whom became well-known in their own right there were various methods of transferring the artist 's drawn design onto the block for the cutter to follow either the drawing would be made directly onto the block ( often whitened first ) , or a drawing on paper was glued to the block in both europe and the far east in the early 20th century , some artists began to do the whole process themselves image : justso crabplay.jpg thumb left upright the crab that played with the sea , woodcut by rudyard kipling illustrating one of his just so stories ( 1902 ) compared to intaglio techniques like etching and engraving , only low pressure is required to print as a relief method , it is only necessary to ink the block and bring it into firm and even contact with the paper or cloth to achieve an acceptable print in europe , a variety of woods including boxwood and several nut and fruit woods like pear or cherry were commonly used ; landau & parshall , 21-22 ; uglow , 2006 there are three methods of printing to consider : stamping : used for many fabrics and most early european woodcuts ( 1400–40 ) these were printed by putting the paper/fabric on a table or other flat surface with the block on top , and pressing or hammering the back of the block used for european woodcuts and block-books later in the fifteenth century , and very widely for cloth the block goes face up on a table , with the paper or fabric on top the back is rubbed with a '' hard pad , a flat piece of wood , a burnisher , or a leather frotton '' printing in a press : presses only seem to have been used in asia in relatively recent times printing-presses were used from about 1480 for european prints and block-books , and before that for woodcut book illustrations main articles old master print for europe , woodblock printing in japan for japan , and lubok for russia image:88-minerali rena.jpg thumb upright a less sophisticated woodcut book illustration of the hortus sanitatis lapidary , venice , bernardino benaglio e giovanni de cereto ( 1511 ) woodcut originated in china in antiquity as a method of printing on textiles and later on paper the earliest woodblock printed fragments to survive are from china , from the han dynasty ( before 220 ) , and are of silk printed with flowers in three colours '' paper arrived in europe , also from china via al-andalus , slightly later , and was being manufactured in italy by the end of the thirteenth century , and in burgundy and germany by the end of the fourteenth in europe , woodcut is the oldest technique used for old master prints , developing about 1400 , by using , on paper , existing techniques for printing the explosion of sales of cheap woodcuts in the middle of the century led to a fall in standards , and many popular prints were very crude michael wolgemut was significant in making german woodcuts more sophisticated from about 1475 , and erhard reuwich was the first to use cross-hatching ( far harder to do than engraving or etching ) woodcut was used less often for individual ( '' single-leaf '' ) fine-art prints from about 1550 until the late nineteenth century , when interest revived it remained important for popular prints until the nineteenth century in most of europe , and later in some places japanese woodcut became a major artistic form , although at the time it was accorded a much lower status than painting the block is printed in the normal way , so that most of the print is black with the image created by white lines in europe and japan , colour woodcuts were normally only used for prints rather than book illustrations a number of different methods of colour printing using woodcut ( technically chromoxylography ) were developed in europe in the 19th century in the german style , one block usually had only lines and is called the '' line block '' , whilst the other block or blocks had flat areas of colour and are called '' tone blocks '' in europe , russia , and china , woodcut art was being used during this time as well to spread leftist politics such as socialism , communism , and anti-fascism the woodcut art served well because it was a popular style that many could understand block book chiaroscuro cordel literature linocut metalcut old master print printmaking rubber stamp shin hanga sōsaku hanga wood carving woodblock printing ukiyo-e

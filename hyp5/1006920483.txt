in its technical sense , ijtihad can be defined as a '' process of legal reasoning and hermeneutics through which the jurist-mujtahid derives or rationalizes law on the basis of the qur'an and the sunna '' the juristic meaning of ijtihād has several definitions according to scholars of islamic legal theory ” similarly the ijtihād is defined as “ the effort made by the mujtahid in seeking knowledge of the ahkam ( rulings ) of the sharī ‘ ah ( islamic canonical law ) through interpretation thus it excludes the extraction of a ruling from a clear text as well as rulings made without recourse to independent legal reasoning during the early period , ijtihad referred to the exercise of one 's discretionary opinion ( ra ' y ) on the basis of the knowledge of the precedent ( ‘ ilm ) jurists used ra ' y to help reach legal rulings , in cases where the qur'an and sunna did not provide clear direction for certain decisions as religious law continued to develop over time , ra ' y became insufficient in making sure that fair legal rulings were being derived in keeping with both the qur'an and sunna ” as the practice of ijtihad transformed over time , it became religious duty of a mujtahid to conduct legal rulings for the muslim society mujtahid is defined as a muslim scholar that has met certain requirements including a strong knowledge of the qur'an , sunna , and arabic , as well as a deep understanding of legal theory and the precedent ; all of which allows them to be considered fully qualified to practice ijtihad around the beginning of the 10th century , most sunni jurists argued that all major matters of religious law had been settled , allowing for taqlid ( تقليد ) , '' the established legal precedents and traditions , '' to take priority over ijtihād ( اجتهاد ) one such ranking placed the founders of maddhabs , who were credited with being '' absolute mujtahids '' ( mujtahid muṭlaq ) capable of methodological innovation , at the top , and jurists capable only of taqlīd at the bottom , with mujtahids and those who combined ijtihād and taqlīd given the middle ranks while more recent research has disproved the notion that the practice of ijtihad was abandoned in the 10th century — or even later — the extent of legal change during this period and its mechanisms remain a subject of scholarly debate during the turn of the 16th to 17th century , sunni muslim reformers began to criticize taqlid , and promoted greater use of ijtihad in legal matters starting in the middle of the 19th century , islamic modernisms such as sir sayyid ahmed khan , jamal al-din al-afghani , and muhammad abduh emerged seeking to revitalize islam by re-establish and reform sharia and its interpretations to accommodate islam with modern society one modernist argument for applying ijtihad to sharia law is that while '' the principles and values underlying sharia ( i.e they are very much not divine or immutable , and have no more legal justification to be part of the sharia than the adaat of muslims living beyond the home of the original muslim in the arab hejaz they criticize taqlid and believe ijtihad makes modern islam more authentic and will guide muslims back to the golden age of early islam in general mujtahids must have an extensive knowledge of arabic , the qur'an , the sunnah , and legal theory ( usul al-fiqh ) sunni islam and shia islam , due to their divergent beliefs regarding the persistence of divine authority , have different views on ijtihad and the qualifications required to achieve mujtahid in order to clarify how ijtihad differs in sunni and shia islam it is necessary to explore the historical development of this position in both branches however , with this introduction of common laws for each madhhab , legal scholars began to dismiss the practice of independent ijtihad and instead maintained the title of mujtahid only for the founders of the four main schools of islamic law ( hanafiyya , malikiyya , shafiyya , hanbaliyya ) therefore , from the 12th century onwards jurists could occupy the position of a mujtahid or access ijtihad in only two cases , when distinguishing between the manifest and the obscure views of their particular schools or when they served as '' imitators '' of mujtahids , expressing the views of the more qualified mujtahids before them ijtihad against the text two theories of ijtihad an introduction to islamic law by joseph schacht '' was the gate of ijtihad closed '' by wael b

in its technical sense , ijtihad can be defined as a '' process of legal reasoning and hermeneutics through which the jurist-mujtahid derives or rationalizes law on the basis of the qur'an and the sunna '' the juristic meaning of ijtihād has several definitions according to scholars of islamic legal theory ” similarly the ijtihād is defined as “ the effort made by the mujtahid in seeking knowledge of the ahkam ( rulings ) of the sharī ‘ ah ( islamic canonical law ) through interpretation the prophet thereupon asked what he would do if he did not find the solution to the problem in the quran , to which ma ’ adh said he would govern according to the sunnah during the early period , ijtihad referred to the exercise of one 's discretionary opinion ( ra ' y ) on the basis of the knowledge of the precedent ( ‘ ilm ) it was the duty of the educated jurists to come to a ruling that would be in the best interest of the muslim community and promote the public good as religious law continued to develop over time , ra ' y became insufficient in making sure that fair legal rulings were being derived in keeping with both the qur'an and sunna however , during this time , the meaning and process of ijtihad became more clearly constructed ” as the practice of ijtihad transformed over time , it became religious duty of a mujtahid to conduct legal rulings for the muslim society mujtahid is defined as a muslim scholar that has met certain requirements including a strong knowledge of the qur'an , sunna , and arabic , as well as a deep understanding of legal theory and the precedent ; all of which allows them to be considered fully qualified to practice ijtihad around the beginning of the 10th century , most sunni jurists argued that all major matters of religious law had been settled , allowing for taqlid ( تقليد ) , '' the established legal precedents and traditions , '' to take priority over ijtihād ( اجتهاد ) while more recent research has disproved the notion that the practice of ijtihad was abandoned in the 10th century — or even later — the extent of legal change during this period and its mechanisms remain a subject of scholarly debate during the turn of the 16th to 17th century , sunni muslim reformers began to criticize taqlid , and promoted greater use of ijtihad in legal matters they emphasized the use of ijtihad , but in contrast to its original use , they sought to '' apply contemporary intellectual methods '' such as academic or scientific thought '' to the task of reforming islam '' al-afghani proposed the new use of ijtihad that he believed would enable muslims to think critically and apply their own individual interpretations of the innovations of modernity in the context of islam they criticize taqlid and believe ijtihad makes modern islam more authentic and will guide muslims back to the golden age of early islam the muslim brotherhood traces its founding philosophies to al-afghani 's ijtihad the muslim brotherhood holds that the practice of ijtihad will strengthen the faith of believers by compelling them to better familiarize themselves with the quran and come to their own conclusions about its teachings but as a political group the muslim brotherhood faces a major paradox between ijtihad as a religious matter and as a political one beginning in the 9th century , jurists began to make more restrictions on who could practice ijtihad and the kinds of qualifications necessary from the declaration of these requirements of mujtahid onwards , legal scholars adopted these characteristics as being standard for anyone looking to practice ijtihad therefore , the mujtahids must be well prepared to perform ijtihad , as the community of muqallid are dependent on their rulings ijtihad against the text two theories of ijtihad an introduction to islamic law by joseph schacht '' was the gate of ijtihad closed '' by wael b

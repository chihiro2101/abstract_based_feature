in its technical sense , ijtihad can be defined as a '' process of legal reasoning and hermeneutics through which the jurist-mujtahid derives or rationalizes law on the basis of the qur'an and the sunna '' ” similarly the ijtihād is defined as “ the effort made by the mujtahid in seeking knowledge of the ahkam ( rulings ) of the sharī ‘ ah ( islamic canonical law ) through interpretation the prophet thereupon asked what he would do if he did not find the solution to the problem in the quran , to which ma ’ adh said he would govern according to the sunnah during the early period , ijtihad referred to the exercise of one 's discretionary opinion ( ra ' y ) on the basis of the knowledge of the precedent ( ‘ ilm ) jurists used ra ' y to help reach legal rulings , in cases where the qur'an and sunna did not provide clear direction for certain decisions it was the duty of the educated jurists to come to a ruling that would be in the best interest of the muslim community and promote the public good as religious law continued to develop over time , ra ' y became insufficient in making sure that fair legal rulings were being derived in keeping with both the qur'an and sunna however , during this time , the meaning and process of ijtihad became more clearly constructed ijtihad was “ limited to a systematic method of interpreting the law on the basis of authoritative texts , the quran and sunna , ” and the rulings could be “ extended to a new problem as long as the precedent and the new situation shared the same clause ” as the practice of ijtihad transformed over time , it became religious duty of a mujtahid to conduct legal rulings for the muslim society mujtahid is defined as a muslim scholar that has met certain requirements including a strong knowledge of the qur'an , sunna , and arabic , as well as a deep understanding of legal theory and the precedent ; all of which allows them to be considered fully qualified to practice ijtihad '' after the 11th century , sunni legal theory developed systems for ranking jurists according to their qualifications for ijtihad one such ranking placed the founders of maddhabs , who were credited with being '' absolute mujtahids '' ( mujtahid muṭlaq ) capable of methodological innovation , at the top , and jurists capable only of taqlīd at the bottom , with mujtahids and those who combined ijtihād and taqlīd given the middle ranks while more recent research has disproved the notion that the practice of ijtihad was abandoned in the 10th century — or even later — the extent of legal change during this period and its mechanisms remain a subject of scholarly debate hallaq , '' on the origin of the controversy about the existence of mutahids and the gate of ijtihad , '' studia islamica , 63 ( 1986 ) : 129 during the turn of the 16th to 17th century , sunni muslim reformers began to criticize taqlid , and promoted greater use of ijtihad in legal matters starting in the middle of the 19th century , islamic modernisms such as sir sayyid ahmed khan , jamal al-din al-afghani , and muhammad abduh emerged seeking to revitalize islam by re-establish and reform sharia and its interpretations to accommodate islam with modern society al-afghani proposed the new use of ijtihad that he believed would enable muslims to think critically and apply their own individual interpretations of the innovations of modernity in the context of islam the muslim brotherhood holds that the practice of ijtihad will strengthen the faith of believers by compelling them to better familiarize themselves with the quran and come to their own conclusions about its teachings therefore , sunni muslims began to find other ways and sources for ijtihad such as ra ' y , which allowed for personal judgment of islamic law sunni muslims justified this practice of ra ' y with a particular hadith , which cites muhammad 's approval of forming an individual sound legal opinion if the qur'an and sunnah contain no explicit text regarding that particular issue in order to produce perceptive mujtahids that could fulfill this important role , principles of shia jurisprudence were developed to provide a foundation for scholarly deduction of islamic law ijtihad against the text two theories of ijtihad an introduction to islamic law by joseph schacht '' was the gate of ijtihad closed '' by wael b

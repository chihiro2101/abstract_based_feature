in its technical sense , ijtihad can be defined as a '' process of legal reasoning and hermeneutics through which the jurist-mujtahid derives or rationalizes law on the basis of the qur'an and the sunna '' the juristic meaning of ijtihād has several definitions according to scholars of islamic legal theory ” similarly the ijtihād is defined as “ the effort made by the mujtahid in seeking knowledge of the ahkam ( rulings ) of the sharī ‘ ah ( islamic canonical law ) through interpretation a knowledgeable person who gives a ruling on the sharī ‘ ah , but is not able to exercise their judgement in the inference of the rulings from the sources , is not called a mujtahid but rather a muqallid islamic scholar asghar ali engineer cites a hadith related by a sahabi ( companion of the islamic prophet muhammad ) by the name of muadh ibn jabal ( also ma ’ adh bin jabal ) , as the basis for ijtihad the prophet thereupon asked what he would do if he did not find the solution to the problem in the quran , to which ma ’ adh said he would govern according to the sunnah as religious law continued to develop over time , ra ' y became insufficient in making sure that fair legal rulings were being derived in keeping with both the qur'an and sunna ijtihad was “ limited to a systematic method of interpreting the law on the basis of authoritative texts , the quran and sunna , ” and the rulings could be “ extended to a new problem as long as the precedent and the new situation shared the same clause ” as the practice of ijtihad transformed over time , it became religious duty of a mujtahid to conduct legal rulings for the muslim society mujtahid is defined as a muslim scholar that has met certain requirements including a strong knowledge of the qur'an , sunna , and arabic , as well as a deep understanding of legal theory and the precedent ; all of which allows them to be considered fully qualified to practice ijtihad around the beginning of the 10th century , most sunni jurists argued that all major matters of religious law had been settled , allowing for taqlid ( تقليد ) , '' the established legal precedents and traditions , '' to take priority over ijtihād ( اجتهاد ) '' after the 11th century , sunni legal theory developed systems for ranking jurists according to their qualifications for ijtihad during the turn of the 16th to 17th century , sunni muslim reformers began to criticize taqlid , and promoted greater use of ijtihad in legal matters one modernist argument for applying ijtihad to sharia law is that while '' the principles and values underlying sharia ( i.e they criticize taqlid and believe ijtihad makes modern islam more authentic and will guide muslims back to the golden age of early islam the muslim brotherhood holds that the practice of ijtihad will strengthen the faith of believers by compelling them to better familiarize themselves with the quran and come to their own conclusions about its teachings in order to clarify how ijtihad differs in sunni and shia islam it is necessary to explore the historical development of this position in both branches therefore , sunni muslims began to find other ways and sources for ijtihad such as ra ' y , which allowed for personal judgment of islamic law the interaction required by ijma allowed for mujtahids to circulate ideas and eventually merge to create particular islamic schools of law ( madhhabs ) therefore , from the 12th century onwards jurists could occupy the position of a mujtahid or access ijtihad in only two cases , when distinguishing between the manifest and the obscure views of their particular schools or when they served as '' imitators '' of mujtahids , expressing the views of the more qualified mujtahids before them therefore , the mujtahids must be well prepared to perform ijtihad , as the community of muqallid are dependent on their rulings wael hallaq : “ was the gate of ijtihad closed ? ” , international journal of middle east studies , 16 , 1 ( 1984 ) , 3–41 ijtihad against the text two theories of ijtihad an introduction to islamic law by joseph schacht '' was the gate of ijtihad closed '' by wael b

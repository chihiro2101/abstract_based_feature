the torii , a gateway erected on the approach to every shinto shrine , may be derived from the indian word torana shôzô yamaguchi , frederic de garis and atsuharu sakai , 1964 , we japanese : miyanushita , hakone , fujiya hotel , page 200 parul pandya dhar , 2010 , the toraṇa in the indian and southeast asian architecture , page 295 torii-a doorway into the japanese soul bernhard scheid wonders whether torii existed in japan before buddhism or arrived with it from india the function of a torii is to mark the entrance to a sacred space for this reason , the road leading to a shinto shrine ( sandō ) is almost always straddled by one or more torii , which are therefore the easiest way to distinguish a shrine from a buddhist temple if the sandō passes under multiple torii , the outer of them is called the following ones , closer to the shrine , are usually called , in order , and other torii can be found farther into the shrine to represent increasing levels of holiness as one nears the inner sanctuary ( honden ) , core of the shrine also , because of the strong relationship between shinto shrines and the japanese imperial family , a torii stands also in front of the tomb of each emperor in the past torii must have been used also at the entrance of buddhist temples even today , as prominent a temple as osaka 's shitennō-ji , founded in 593 by shōtoku taishi and the oldest state-built buddhist temple in the world ( and country ) , has a torii straddling one of its entrances ) many buddhist temples include one or more shinto shrines dedicated to their tutelary kami ( '' chinjusha '' ) , and in that case a torii marks the shrine 's entrance benzaiten is a syncretic goddess derived from the indian divinity sarasvati , who unites elements of both shinto and buddhism for this reason halls dedicated to her can be found at both temples and shrines , and in either case in front of the hall stands a torii finally , until the meiji period ( 1868–1912 ) torii were routinely adorned with plaques carrying buddhist sūtras the origins of the torii are unknown and there are several different theories on the subject , none of which has gained universal acceptance these structures however can assume a great variety of forms , only some of which actually somewhat resemble a torii this is based on the religious use of bird perches in asia , such as the korean sotdae ( 솟대 ) , which are poles with one or more wooden birds resting on their top '' bird perches '' similar in form and function to the sotdae exist also in other shamanism cultures in china , mongolia and siberia ancient japanese texts like the kojiki and the nihon shoki for example mention how yamato takeru after his death became a white bird and in that form chose a place for his own burial finally , the possibility that torii are a japanese invention can not be discounted this hypothetical stage corresponds to a type of torii in actual use , the so-called , an example of which can be seen in front of ōmiwa shrine 's haiden in nara ( see also the photo in the gallery ) very rarely torii can be found also in other colors at the center of the nuki there may be a supporting strut called , sometimes covered by a tablet carrying the name of the shrine ( see photo in the gallery ) the pillars often rest on a white stone ring called or probably one of the oldest types of torii , it consists of two posts with a sacred rope called shimenawa tied between them all other torii can be divided in two families , the and the file : hachiman torii.svg hachiman torii – a kasuga torii , but the two lintels have a downwards slant for this reason , they are also called jingū torii , from jingū , ise grand shrine 's official japanese name almost identical to a kasuga torii ( see illustration above ) , but with the two upper lintels at a slant , the first appeared during the heian period file : entrance to tsurugaoka hachiman shrine.jpg myōjin torii file : hiyoshi-taisha03s4592.jpg sannō torii file : hushimi-inari-taisha omotesando.jpg daiwa torii also called , or ( see illustration above ) , the is composed of three myōjin torii without inclination of the pillars file : yamasa kamaboko hq 04.jpg a row of torii file : nagasaki one legged torii c1946.jpg one-legged torii , sannō shrine , nagasaki , japan

the torii , a gateway erected on the approach to every shinto shrine , may be derived from the indian word torana shôzô yamaguchi , frederic de garis and atsuharu sakai , 1964 , we japanese : miyanushita , hakone , fujiya hotel , page 200 parul pandya dhar , 2010 , the toraṇa in the indian and southeast asian architecture , page 295 for this reason , the road leading to a shinto shrine ( sandō ) is almost always straddled by one or more torii , which are therefore the easiest way to distinguish a shrine from a buddhist temple other torii can be found farther into the shrine to represent increasing levels of holiness as one nears the inner sanctuary ( honden ) , core of the shrine also , because of the strong relationship between shinto shrines and the japanese imperial family , a torii stands also in front of the tomb of each emperor in the past torii must have been used also at the entrance of buddhist temples even today , as prominent a temple as osaka 's shitennō-ji , founded in 593 by shōtoku taishi and the oldest state-built buddhist temple in the world ( and country ) , has a torii straddling one of its entrances for this reason halls dedicated to her can be found at both temples and shrines , and in either case in front of the hall stands a torii finally , until the meiji period ( 1868–1912 ) torii were routinely adorned with plaques carrying buddhist sūtras yamabushi , japanese mountain ascetic hermits with a long tradition as mighty warriors endowed with supernatural powers , sometimes use as their symbol a torii because the use of symbolic gates is widespread in asia—such structures can be found for example in india , china , thailand , korea , and within nicobarese and shompen villages—historians believe they may be an imported tradition according to this theory , the torana was adopted by shingon buddhism founder kūkai , who used it to demarcate the sacred space used for the homa ceremony the hypothesis arose in the 19th and 20th centuries due to similarities in structure and name between the two gates in bangkok , thailand , a brahmin structure called giant swing strongly resembles a torii unlike its chinese counterpart , the hongsal-mun does not vary greatly in design and is always painted red , with '' arrowsticks '' located on the top of the structure ( hence the name ) this is based on the religious use of bird perches in asia , such as the korean sotdae ( 솟대 ) , which are poles with one or more wooden birds resting on their top torii used to be also called poles believed to have supported wooden bird figures very similar to the sotdae have been found together with wooden birds , and are believed by some historians to have somehow evolved into today 's torii in japan birds have also long had a connection with the dead , this may mean it was born in connection with some prehistorical funerary rite bird motifs from the yayoi and kofun periods associating birds with the dead have also been found in several archeological sites because the gate was structurally weak , it was reinforced with a tie-beam , and what is today called or ( see illustration at right ) was born iwanami japanese dictionary , 6th edition ( 2008 ) , dvd version kasagi and the shimaki may have an upward curve called probably one of the oldest types of torii , it consists of two posts with a sacred rope called shimenawa tied between them all other torii can be divided in two families , the and the file : hachiman torii.svg hachiman torii – a kasuga torii , but the two lintels have a downwards slant the ( see illustration above ) is a shinmei torii without korobi , with kusabi and a protruding nuki file : myoujin torii.svg myōjin torii – kasagi and shimaki are curved upwards file : usa torii.svg usa torii – a myōjin torii with no gakuzuka this example is the main torii of kashii shrine , saga prefecture the ( see illustration above ) is a myōjin torii with two rings called daiwa at the top of the two pillars the ( see photo below ) is myōjin torii with a gable over the two top lintels the famous torii rising from the water at itsukushima is a ryōbu torii , and the shrine used to be also a shingon buddhist temple , so much so that it still has a tō file : nikkotoriitablet5127.jpg a tablet on a torii at nikkō tōshō-gū covers the gakuzuka file : pentagonal kasagi.jpg the typical pentagonal profile of a torii 's kasagi

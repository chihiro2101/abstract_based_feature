the torii , a gateway erected on the approach to every shinto shrine , may be derived from the indian word torana the functions of all are similar , but they generally differ based on their respective architectural styles fosco maraini , 1960 , ore giapponesi , interpretive description of modern japan by an italian linguist and photographer who spent many years there , page 132 for this reason , the road leading to a shinto shrine ( sandō ) is almost always straddled by one or more torii , which are therefore the easiest way to distinguish a shrine from a buddhist temple other torii can be found farther into the shrine to represent increasing levels of holiness as one nears the inner sanctuary ( honden ) , core of the shrine also , because of the strong relationship between shinto shrines and the japanese imperial family , a torii stands also in front of the tomb of each emperor in the past torii must have been used also at the entrance of buddhist temples ( the original wooden torii burned in 1294 and was then replaced by one in stone ) many buddhist temples include one or more shinto shrines dedicated to their tutelary kami ( '' chinjusha '' ) , and in that case a torii marks the shrine 's entrance benzaiten is a syncretic goddess derived from the indian divinity sarasvati , who unites elements of both shinto and buddhism for this reason halls dedicated to her can be found at both temples and shrines , and in either case in front of the hall stands a torii finally , until the meiji period ( 1868–1912 ) torii were routinely adorned with plaques carrying buddhist sūtras the torii is also sometimes used as a symbol of japan in non-religious contexts for example , it is the symbol of the marine corps security force regiment and the 187th infantry regiment , 101st airborne division and of other us forces in japan the origins of the torii are unknown and there are several different theories on the subject , none of which has gained universal acceptance because the use of symbolic gates is widespread in asia—such structures can be found for example in india , china , thailand , korea , and within nicobarese and shompen villages—historians believe they may be an imported tradition another hypothesis takes the name literally : the gate would originally have been some kind of bird perch torii used to be also called the presence of the honorific mi- or go- makes it likely that by then their use was already associated with shrines poles believed to have supported wooden bird figures very similar to the sotdae have been found together with wooden birds , and are believed by some historians to have somehow evolved into today 's torii in japan birds have also long had a connection with the dead , this may mean it was born in connection with some prehistorical funerary rite bird motifs from the yayoi and kofun periods associating birds with the dead have also been found in several archeological sites this hypothetical stage corresponds to a type of torii in actual use , the so-called , an example of which can be seen in front of ōmiwa shrine 's haiden in nara ( see also the photo in the gallery ) very rarely torii can be found also in other colors at the center of the nuki there may be a supporting strut called , sometimes covered by a tablet carrying the name of the shrine ( see photo in the gallery ) probably one of the oldest types of torii , it consists of two posts with a sacred rope called shimenawa tied between them file : kashima torii.svg kashima torii – a shinmei torii with kusabi and a nuki protruding from the sides file : hachiman torii.svg hachiman torii – a kasuga torii , but the two lintels have a downwards slant file : nune torii.svg nune torii – a daiwa torii with a small gable above the gakuzuka file : sannou torii.svg sannō torii – a myōjin torii with a gable above the kasagi a myōjin torii can be made of wood , stone , concrete or other materials and be vermilion or unpainted . daiwa / inari torii the name '' inari torii '' comes from the fact that vermilion daiwa torii tend to be common at inari shrines , but even at the famous fushimi inari shrine not all torii are in this style the famous torii rising from the water at itsukushima is a ryōbu torii , and the shrine used to be also a shingon buddhist temple , so much so that it still has a tō

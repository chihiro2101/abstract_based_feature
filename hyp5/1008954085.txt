the torii , a gateway erected on the approach to every shinto shrine , may be derived from the indian word torana while the indian term denotes a gateway , the japanese characters can be translated as '' bird perch '' the functions of all are similar , but they generally differ based on their respective architectural styles parul pandya dhar , 2010 , the toraṇa in the indian and southeast asian architecture , page 295 fosco maraini , 1960 , ore giapponesi , interpretive description of modern japan by an italian linguist and photographer who spent many years there , page 132 parul pandya dhar , 2010 , the toraṇa in the indian and southeast asian architecture , page 295 torii-a doorway into the japanese soul bernhard scheid wonders whether torii existed in japan before buddhism or arrived with it from india the function of a torii is to mark the entrance to a sacred space for this reason , the road leading to a shinto shrine ( sandō ) is almost always straddled by one or more torii , which are therefore the easiest way to distinguish a shrine from a buddhist temple the following ones , closer to the shrine , are usually called , in order , and other torii can be found farther into the shrine to represent increasing levels of holiness as one nears the inner sanctuary ( honden ) , core of the shrine in the past torii must have been used also at the entrance of buddhist temples ( the original wooden torii burned in 1294 and was then replaced by one in stone ) many buddhist temples include one or more shinto shrines dedicated to their tutelary kami ( '' chinjusha '' ) , and in that case a torii marks the shrine 's entrance for this reason halls dedicated to her can be found at both temples and shrines , and in either case in front of the hall stands a torii finally , until the meiji period ( 1868–1912 ) torii were routinely adorned with plaques carrying buddhist sūtras the torii is also sometimes used as a symbol of japan in non-religious contexts for example , it is the symbol of the marine corps security force regiment and the 187th infantry regiment , 101st airborne division and of other us forces in japan the origins of the torii are unknown and there are several different theories on the subject , none of which has gained universal acceptance the hypothesis arose in the 19th and 20th centuries due to similarities in structure and name between the two gates in bangkok , thailand , a brahmin structure called giant swing strongly resembles a torii bird motifs from the yayoi and kofun periods associating birds with the dead have also been found in several archeological sites this relationship between birds and death would also explain why , in spite of their name , no visible trace of birds remains in today 's torii : birds were symbols of death , which in shinto brings defilement ( kegare ) finally , the possibility that torii are a japanese invention can not be discounted this hypothetical stage corresponds to a type of torii in actual use , the so-called , an example of which can be seen in front of ōmiwa shrine 's haiden in nara ( see also the photo in the gallery ) the pillars may have a slight inward inclination called or just torii may be unpainted or painted vermilion and black the shinmei torii and its variants are characterized by straight upper lintels note the presence of kasagi file : naiku 03.jpg ise torii , second type almost identical to a kasuga torii ( see illustration above ) , but with the two upper lintels at a slant , the first appeared during the heian period this example is the main torii of kashii shrine , saga prefecture also called , or ( see illustration above ) , the is composed of three myōjin torii without inclination of the pillars also called , or , the is a daiwa torii whose pillars are reinforced on both sides by square posts ( see illustration above ) the famous torii rising from the water at itsukushima is a ryōbu torii , and the shrine used to be also a shingon buddhist temple , so much so that it still has a tō

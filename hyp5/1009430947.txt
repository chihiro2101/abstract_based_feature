suicide by gunshot under the statue of anteros in piccadilly circus on 22 april 1922 , which was john 's birthday after this event , which transformed a private family tragedy into public scandal ,

the 'naven ' rite , an honorific ceremony among the iatmul , still continued today , that celebrates first-time cultural achievements silverman , eric kline ( 2001 ) masculinity , motherhood and mockery : psychoanalyzing culture and the iatmul naven rite in new guinea complementary relationships feature an unequal balance , such as dominance-submission ( parent-child ) , or

assumed a realist approach to studying culture , in which one simply described social reality bateson 's book argued that this approach was naive , since an anthropologist 's account of a culture was always and fundamentally shaped by whatever theory the anthropologist employed to define and analyse the data the sociological point of view sought to identify how the ritual helped bring about social integration the ethological point of view interpreted the ritual in terms of the conventional emotions associated with normative male and female behaviour , which bateson called ethos in iatmul culture , observed bateson , men and women lived different emotional lives in effect , naven allowed men and women to experience momentarily the emotional lives of each other , and thereby to achieve a level of psychological integration the third and final point of view , the eidological , was the least successful here bateson endeavoured to correlate the organisation structure of the naven ceremony with the habitual patterns of iatmul thought much later , bateson would harness the very same idea to the development of the double-bind theory of schizophrenia in the epilogue to the book , bateson was clear : '' the writing of this book has been an experiment , or rather a series of experiments , in methods of thinking about anthropological material in fact , the meaning of the ritual continues to inspire anthropological analysis bateson next travelled to bali with his new wife margaret mead to study the people of the village bajoeng gede instead of attention being paid to a child who was displaying a climax of emotion ( love or anger ) , balinese mothers would ignore them in western cultures , such sequences lead to small climaxes of love or anger , but not so in bali at the moment when a child throws its arms around the mother 's neck or bursts into tears , the mother 's attention wanders '' bateson felt mind was immanent in the messages and pathways of the supreme

men dress in women 's skirts , and women dress in men 's attire and ornaments mothers may drop to the ground so their celebrated 'child ' walks over them in short , the behaviour of person x affects person y , and the reaction of person y to person x 's behaviour will then affect person x 's behaviour , which in turn will affect person y , and so on the book proved to be a watershed in anthropology and modern social science instead , bateson analysed the rite from three unique points of view : sociology , ethology , and eidological marriage , in other words , could not guarantee that a marriage between two clans would at some definite point in the future recur instead , bateson continued , the naven rite filled this function by regularly ensuring exchanges of food , valuables , and sentiment between mothers ' brothers and their sisters ' children , or between separate lineages naven , from this angle , held together the different social groups of each village into a unified whole the ethological point of view interpreted the ritual in terms of the conventional emotions associated with normative male and female behaviour , which bateson called ethos in iatmul culture , observed bateson , men and women lived different emotional lives the third and final point of view , the eidological , was the least successful here bateson endeavoured to correlate the organisation structure of the naven ceremony with the habitual patterns of iatmul thought in the epilogue to the book , bateson was clear : '' the writing of this book has been an experiment , or rather a series of experiments , in methods of thinking about anthropological material not only did bateson 's approach re-shape fundamentally the anthropological approach to culture , but the naven rite itself has remained a locus classicus in the discipline here , lipset states , '' in the short history of ethnographic fieldwork , film was used both on a large scale and as the primary research tool bateson 's encounter with mead on the sepik river ( chapter 16 ) and their life together in bali ( chapter 17 ) is described in mead 's autobiography blackberry winter : my earlier years ( angus and robertson the purpose-driven accumulation of knowledge ignores the supreme cybernetic system and leads to the eventual breakdown of the entire system bateson argues for a position of humility and acceptance of the natural cybernetic system instead of scientific arrogance as a solution bateson argues for a culture that promotes the most general wisdom and is able to flexibly change within the supreme cybernetic system '' for bateson , information in fact mediated alfred korzybski 's map–territory relation , and thereby resolved , according to bateson , the mind-body problem bateson idea group bateson idea group ( facebook ) international bateson institute '' institute for intercultural studies ''

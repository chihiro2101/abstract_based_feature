men dress in women 's skirts , and women dress in men 's attire and ornaments additionally , some women smear mud in the faces of other relatives , beat them with sticks , and hurl bawdy insults conversely , there can be no doubt that the spectacular behavior is a stimulus which summons the audience together , promoting in the women the appropriate behavior until bateson published naven , most anthropologists assumed a realist approach to studying culture , in which one simply described social reality bateson 's book argued that this approach was naive , since an anthropologist 's account of a culture was always and fundamentally shaped by whatever theory the anthropologist employed to define and analyse the data instead , bateson analysed the rite from three unique points of view : sociology , ethology , and eidological the sociological point of view sought to identify how the ritual helped bring about social integration instead , bateson continued , the naven rite filled this function by regularly ensuring exchanges of food , valuables , and sentiment between mothers ' brothers and their sisters ' children , or between separate lineages naven , from this angle , held together the different social groups of each village into a unified whole for example , women were rather submissive and took delight in the achievement of others ;

bateson was born in grantchester in cambridgeshire , on 9 may 1904 he was the third and youngest son of ( caroline ) beatrice durham and the distinguished geneticist william bateson he was named gregory after gregor mendel , the austrian monk who founded the modern science of genetics the younger bateson attended charterhouse school from 1917 to 1921 , obtained a bachelor of arts in biology at st according to lipset ( 1982 ) , bateson 's life was greatly affected by the death of his two brothers john bateson ( 1898–1918 ) , the eldest of the three , was killed in world war i martin bateson ( 1900–1922 ) , the second brother , was then expected to follow in his father 's footsteps as a scientist , but came into conflict with his father over his ambition to become a poet and playwright after this event , which transformed a private family tragedy into public scandal , the parents ambitious expectations fell on gregory in 1928 , bateson lectured in linguistics at the university of sydney in the 1940s , he helped extend systems theory and cybernetics to the social and behavioral sciences gregory bateson and the oss : world war ii and bateson 's assessment of applied anthropology , by dr david h bateson used his theory of schismogenesis to help foster discord among enemy fighters he was upset by his wartime experience and disagreed with his wife over whether science should be applied to social planning or used only to foster understanding rather than action bateson was one of the original members of the core group of the macy conferences in cybernetics ( 1941–1960 ) , and the later set on group processes ( 1954–1960 ) , where he represented the social and behavioral sciences in the 1970s , he taught at the humanistic psychology institute in san francisco , renamed the saybrook university , and in 1972 joined the faculty of kresge college at the university of california , santa cruz per the jacket copy of the first edition of mind and nature ( 1979 ) in 1976 , he was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences bateson spent the last decade of his life developing a '' meta-science '' of epistemology to bring together the various early forms of systems theory developing in different fields of science retrieved from britannica concise , 5 august 2007 bateson and mead had a daughter , mary catherine bateson ( 1939–2021 ) , who also became an anthropologist bateson and sumner were divorced in 1957 , after which bateson was married a third time , to therapist and social worker lois cammack ( born 1928 ) , in 1961 in '' from versailles to cybernetics , '' bateson argues that the history of the twentieth century can be perceived as the history of a malfunctioning relationship in his view , the treaty of versailles exemplifies a whole pattern of human relationships based on betrayal and hate he therefore claims that the treaty of versailles and the development of cybernetics—which for him represented the possibility of improved relationships—are the only two anthropologically important events of the twentieth century bateson 's beginning years as an anthropologist were spent floundering , lost without a specific objective in mind unfortunately for bateson , his time spent with the baining of new guinea was halted and difficult although the sulka were very different from the baining and their culture more easily observed , he felt their culture was dying , which left him dispirited and discouraged the observations he made among the iatmul people allowed him to develop his concept of schismogenesis the ceremony entails behaviours that are otherwise forbidden during everyday social life for example , men and women reverse and exaggerate gender roles ; men dress in women 's skirts , and women dress in men 's attire and ornaments in fact , it is probable that the men are more exhibitionistic because the women admire their performances the book proved to be a watershed in anthropology and modern social science until bateson published naven , most anthropologists assumed a realist approach to studying culture , in which one simply described social reality bateson 's book argued that this approach was naive , since an anthropologist 's account of a culture was always and fundamentally shaped by whatever theory the anthropologist employed to define and analyse the data to think otherwise , stated bateson , was to be guilty of what alfred north whitehead called the '' fallacy of misplaced concreteness instead , bateson analysed the rite from three unique points of view : sociology , ethology , and eidological the sociological point of view sought to identify how the ritual helped bring about social integration marriage , in other words , could not guarantee that a marriage between two clans would at some definite point in the future recur in iatmul culture , observed bateson , men and women lived different emotional lives during the ritual , however , men celebrated the achievement of their nieces and nephews while women were given ritual license to act raucously here bateson endeavoured to correlate the organisation structure of the naven ceremony with the habitual patterns of iatmul thought in 1956 in palo alto , bateson and his colleagues donald jackson , jay haley , and john weakland articulated a related theory of schizophrenia as stemming from double bind situations the double bind was originally presented ( probably mainly under the influence of bateson 's psychiatric co-workers ) as an explanation of part of the etiology of schizophrenia the fifth theoretical position which bateson believes is supported by his data is that characteristics within an organism that have been modified due to environmental stresses may coincide with genetically determined attributes this supreme cybernetic system is beyond the self of the individual and could be equated to what many people refer to as god , though bateson referred to it as mind bateson idea group bateson idea group ( facebook ) international bateson institute '' institute for intercultural studies ''

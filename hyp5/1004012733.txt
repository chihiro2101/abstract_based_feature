little is known of his early years , but jacques de molay was probably born in molay , haute-saône , in the county of burgundy , at the time a territory ruled by otto iii as part of the holy roman empire , and in modern times in the area of franche-comté , northeastern france his year of birth is not known and alain demurger finds it probable that he was born in the period 1244/45 to 1248/49 or even between 1240 and 1250 in 1265 , as a young man , he was received into the order of the templars in a chapel at the beaune house , by humbert de pairaud , the visitor of france and england another prominent templar in attendance was amaury de la roche , templar master of the province of france around 1270 , de molay went to the east ( outremer ) , although little is recorded of his activities for the next twenty years templars in cyprus included jacques de molay and thibaud gaudin , their 22nd grand master during a meeting assembled on the island in the autumn of 1291 , molay spoke of reforming the order and put himself forward as an alternative to the current grand master developing relationships with european leaders such as pope boniface viii , edward i of england , james i of aragon and charles ii of naples , molay 's immediate goals were to strengthen the defence of cyprus and rebuild the templar forces it is known that molay held two general meetings of his order in southern france , at montpellier in 1293 and at arles in 1296 , where he tried to make reforms in the autumn of 1296 , molay was back in cyprus to defend his order against the interests of henry ii of cyprus , which conflict had its roots back in the days of guillaume de beaujeu in 1300 , molay and other forces from cyprus put together a small fleet of sixteen ships which committed raids along the egyptian and syrian coasts the ships left famagusta on 20 july 1300 , and under the leadership of admiral baudouin de picquigny , raided the coasts of egypt and syria : rosetta , demurger , p following the loss of ruad , molay abandoned the tactic of small advance forces , and instead put his energies into trying to raise support for a new major crusade , as well as strengthening templar authority in cyprus in 1305 , the newly elected pope clement v asked the leaders of the military orders for their opinions concerning a new crusade and the merging of their orders on 6 june , the leaders of both the templars and the hospitallers were officially asked to come to the papal offices in poitiers to discuss these matters , with the date of the meeting scheduled as all saints day in 1306 , though it later had to be postponed due to the pope 's illness with gastro-enteritis molay left cyprus on 15 october , arriving in france in late 1306 or early 1307 ; however , the meeting was again delayed until late may due to the pope 's illness king philip iv of france , deeply in debt to the templars , was in favor of merging the orders under his own command , thereby making himself rex bellator , or war king the grand master of the hospitallers , fulk de villaret , was also delayed in his travel to france , as he was engaged with a battle at rhodes he did not arrive until late summer , so while waiting for his arrival , molay met the pope to discuss other matters , one of which was the charges by one or more ousted templars who had made accusations of impropriety in the templars ' initiation ceremony returning to poitiers , molay asked the pope to set up an inquiry to quickly clear the order of the rumours and accusations surrounding it , and the pope convened an inquiry on 24 august subsequently , the charges would be increased and would become , according to the procedures , lists of articles 86 to 1273 in which will be added a few other charges , such as the prohibition to priests who do not belong to the order les templiers , une chevalerie chrétienne au moyen-âge , alain demurger on 14 september , philip took advantage of the rumors and inquiry to begin his move against the templars , sending out a secret order to his agents in all parts of france to implement a mass arrest of all templars at dawn on 13 october philip wanted the templars arrested and their possessions confiscated to incorporate their wealth into the royal treasury and to be free of the enormous debt he owed the templar order molay was in paris on 12 october , where he was a pallbearer at the funeral of catherine of courtenay , wife of count charles of valois , and sister-in-law of king philip during forced interrogation by royal agents at the university of paris on 24 , or 25 october , molay confessed that the templar initiation ritual included '' denying christ and trampling on the cross '' the sudden arrest of the templars , the conflicting stories about confessions , and the dramatic deaths by burning , generated many stories and legends about both the order , and its last grand master the stories of the templars ' secret initiation ceremonies also proved a tempting source for masonic writers who were creating new works of pseudohistory the modern masonic knights templar is an international philanthropic and chivalric order affiliated with freemasonry , and begun in ireland perhaps as long ago as 1780 the story of de molay 's brave defiance of his inquisitors has been incorporated in various forms into masonic lore ; most notably in the form of a youth group for young men aged 12 to 21 , sponsored by freemasonry , and named after the last grand master of the knights templar similar to what happens in freemasonry , new members are ceremoniously initiated using '' degrees '' that are part of the order 's secret ritual , authored , in the case of the order of demolay 's ritual , by frank a jacques de molay 's site of execution jacques de molay in medieval history of navarre demolay international , a freemason-sponsored youth group

little is known of his early years , but jacques de molay was probably born in molay , haute-saône , in the county of burgundy , at the time a territory ruled by otto iii as part of the holy roman empire , and in modern times in the area of franche-comté , northeastern france in 1265 , as a young man , he was received into the order of the templars in a chapel at the beaune house , by humbert de pairaud , the visitor of france and england another prominent templar in attendance was amaury de la roche , templar master of the province of france around 1270 , de molay went to the east ( outremer ) , although little is recorded of his activities for the next twenty years templars in cyprus included jacques de molay and thibaud gaudin , their 22nd grand master gaudin died around 1292 and , as there were no other serious contenders for the role at the time , molay was soon elected from his travels , he was able to secure authorization from some monarchs for the export of supplies to cyprus , but could obtain no firm commitment for a new crusade in the autumn of 1296 , molay was back in cyprus to defend his order against the interests of henry ii of cyprus , which conflict had its roots back in the days of guillaume de beaujeu in 1300 , molay and other forces from cyprus put together a small fleet of sixteen ships which committed raids along the egyptian and syrian coasts the ships left famagusta on 20 july 1300 , and under the leadership of admiral baudouin de picquigny , raided the coasts of egypt and syria : rosetta , demurger , p the intent was to establish a templar bridgehead to await assistance from ghazan 's mongols , but the mongols failed to appear in 1300 following the loss of ruad , molay abandoned the tactic of small advance forces , and instead put his energies into trying to raise support for a new major crusade , as well as strengthening templar authority in cyprus meanwhile , pressure increased in europe that the templars should be merged with the other military orders , perhaps all placed under the authority of one king , and that individual should become the new king of jerusalem when it was conquered molay was opposed to the merger , believing instead that having separate military orders was a stronger position , as the missions of each order were somewhat different molay left cyprus on 15 october , arriving in france in late 1306 or early 1307 ; however , the meeting was again delayed until late may due to the pope 's illness king philip iv of france , deeply in debt to the templars , was in favor of merging the orders under his own command , thereby making himself rex bellator , or war king for this , one of clement 's predecessors , pope boniface viii , had attempted to have philip excommunicated , but philip then had boniface abducted and charged with heresy clement moved the papacy from italy to poitiers , france , where philip continued to assert more dominance over the papacy and the templars he did not arrive until late summer , so while waiting for his arrival , molay met the pope to discuss other matters , one of which was the charges by one or more ousted templars who had made accusations of impropriety in the templars ' initiation ceremony returning to poitiers , molay asked the pope to set up an inquiry to quickly clear the order of the rumours and accusations surrounding it , and the pope convened an inquiry on 24 august the fourth was that the cord worn by the neophyte day and night was consecrated by wrapping it around an idol in the form of a human head with a great beard , and that this idol was adored in all chapters subsequently , the charges would be increased and would become , according to the procedures , lists of articles 86 to 1273 in which will be added a few other charges , such as the prohibition to priests who do not belong to the order philip wanted the templars arrested and their possessions confiscated to incorporate their wealth into the royal treasury and to be free of the enormous debt he owed the templar order molay was in paris on 12 october , where he was a pallbearer at the funeral of catherine of courtenay , wife of count charles of valois , and sister-in-law of king philip in a dawn raid on friday , 13 october 1307 , molay and sixty of his templar brother knights were arrested under pressure from philip iv , pope clement v ordered the arrest of all the templars throughout christendom '' this story of wishful thinking was so popular in france that in 1846 a large-scale painting was created by claude jacquand , titled molay prend jerusalem , 1299 ( '' molay takes jerusalem , 1299 '' ) , which depicts the supposed event regardless of what the mongols may or may not have done , there is no evidence that molay was ever a mongol commander , and he probably never set foot in jerusalem it has been claimed that jacques de molay cursed king philip iv of france and his descendants from his execution pyre demolay international , also known as '' the order of demolay , '' was founded in kansas city first demolay jacques de molay 's site of execution jacques de molay in medieval history of navarre demolay international , a freemason-sponsored youth group

little is known of his early years , but jacques de molay was probably born in molay , haute-saône , in the county of burgundy , at the time a territory ruled by otto iii as part of the holy roman empire , and in modern times in the area of franche-comté , northeastern france in 1265 , as a young man , he was received into the order of the templars in a chapel at the beaune house , by humbert de pairaud , the visitor of france and england another prominent templar in attendance was amaury de la roche , templar master of the province of france around 1270 , de molay went to the east ( outremer ) , although little is recorded of his activities for the next twenty years after the fall of acre to the egyptian mamluks in 1291 , the franks ( a name used in the levant for catholic europeans ) who were able to do so retreated to the island of cyprus templars in cyprus included jacques de molay and thibaud gaudin , their 22nd grand master during a meeting assembled on the island in the autumn of 1291 , molay spoke of reforming the order and put himself forward as an alternative to the current grand master gaudin died around 1292 and , as there were no other serious contenders for the role at the time , molay was soon elected developing relationships with european leaders such as pope boniface viii , edward i of england , james i of aragon and charles ii of naples , molay 's immediate goals were to strengthen the defence of cyprus and rebuild the templar forces in the autumn of 1296 , molay was back in cyprus to defend his order against the interests of henry ii of cyprus , which conflict had its roots back in the days of guillaume de beaujeu the mongols had been repeatedly mongol invasions of syria , each time either being forced back by the egyptian mamluks or having to retreat because of a civil war within the mongol empire , such as having to defend from attacks from the mongol golden horde to the north the force was commanded by king henry ii of jerusalem , the king of cyprus , accompanied by his brother , amalric , lord of tyre , and the heads of the military orders , with the ambassador of the mongol leader ghazan also in attendance the ships left famagusta on 20 july 1300 , and under the leadership of admiral baudouin de picquigny , raided the coasts of egypt and syria : rosetta , demurger , p the cypriots then prepared for an attack on tortosa in late 1300 , sending a joint force to a staging area on the island of ruad , from which raids were launched on the mainland when a power struggle erupted between king henry ii and his brother amalric , the templars supported amalric , who took the crown and had his brother exiled in 1306 in 1305 , the newly elected pope clement v asked the leaders of the military orders for their opinions concerning a new crusade and the merging of their orders he was also of the belief that if there were to be a new crusade , it needed to be a large one , as the smaller attempts were not effective possibly poisoned via philip 's councillor guillaume de nogaret he did not arrive until late summer , so while waiting for his arrival , molay met the pope to discuss other matters , one of which was the charges by one or more ousted templars who had made accusations of impropriety in the templars ' initiation ceremony molay had already spoken with the king in paris on 24 june 1307 about the accusations against his order and was partially reassured returning to poitiers , molay asked the pope to set up an inquiry to quickly clear the order of the rumours and accusations surrounding it , and the pope convened an inquiry on 24 august molay was in paris on 12 october , where he was a pallbearer at the funeral of catherine of courtenay , wife of count charles of valois , and sister-in-law of king philip in a dawn raid on friday , 13 october 1307 , molay and sixty of his templar brother knights were arrested philip then had the templars charged with heresy and many other trumped-up charges , most of which were identical to the charges which had previously been leveled by philip 's agents against pope boniface viii under pressure from philip iv , pope clement v ordered the arrest of all the templars throughout christendom molay was sentenced to death together with geoffroi de charney in 1314 as a direct result of cardinal legates ' decisions and actions rather than being ordered by king philip the fair the mongol mulay and the templar molay were entirely different people , but some historians regularly confused the two '' this story of wishful thinking was so popular in france that in 1846 a large-scale painting was created by claude jacquand , titled molay prend jerusalem , 1299 ( '' molay takes jerusalem , 1299 '' ) , which depicts the supposed event within fourteen years of the death of molay , the 300-year-old house of capet collapsed demolay international , also known as '' the order of demolay , '' was founded in kansas city

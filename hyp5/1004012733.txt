little is known of his early years , but jacques de molay was probably born in molay , haute-saône , in the county of burgundy , at the time a territory ruled by otto iii as part of the holy roman empire , and in modern times in the area of franche-comté , northeastern france in 1265 , as a young man , he was received into the order of the templars in a chapel at the beaune house , by humbert de pairaud , the visitor of france and england around 1270 , de molay went to the east ( outremer ) , although little is recorded of his activities for the next twenty years templars in cyprus included jacques de molay and thibaud gaudin , their 22nd grand master during a meeting assembled on the island in the autumn of 1291 , molay spoke of reforming the order and put himself forward as an alternative to the current grand master gaudin died around 1292 and , as there were no other serious contenders for the role at the time , molay was soon elected developing relationships with european leaders such as pope boniface viii , edward i of england , james i of aragon and charles ii of naples , molay 's immediate goals were to strengthen the defence of cyprus and rebuild the templar forces it is known that molay held two general meetings of his order in southern france , at montpellier in 1293 and at arles in 1296 , where he tried to make reforms in the autumn of 1296 , molay was back in cyprus to defend his order against the interests of henry ii of cyprus , which conflict had its roots back in the days of guillaume de beaujeu for generations , there had been communications between the mongols and europeans towards the possibility of forging a franco-mongol alliance against the mamluks , but without success the ships left famagusta on 20 july 1300 , and under the leadership of admiral baudouin de picquigny , raided the coasts of egypt and syria : rosetta , demurger , p the same happened in 1301 and 1302 , and the island was finally lost in the siege of ruad on 26 september 1302 , eliminating the crusaders ' last foothold near the mainland meanwhile , pressure increased in europe that the templars should be merged with the other military orders , perhaps all placed under the authority of one king , and that individual should become the new king of jerusalem when it was conquered molay left cyprus on 15 october , arriving in france in late 1306 or early 1307 ; however , the meeting was again delayed until late may due to the pope 's illness king philip iv of france , deeply in debt to the templars , was in favor of merging the orders under his own command , thereby making himself rex bellator , or war king for this , one of clement 's predecessors , pope boniface viii , had attempted to have philip excommunicated , but philip then had boniface abducted and charged with heresy it took a year to choose the next pope , the frenchman clement v , who was also under strong pressure to bend to philip 's will clement moved the papacy from italy to poitiers , france , where philip continued to assert more dominance over the papacy and the templars the grand master of the hospitallers , fulk de villaret , was also delayed in his travel to france , as he was engaged with a battle at rhodes he did not arrive until late summer , so while waiting for his arrival , molay met the pope to discuss other matters , one of which was the charges by one or more ousted templars who had made accusations of impropriety in the templars ' initiation ceremony molay had already spoken with the king in paris on 24 june 1307 about the accusations against his order and was partially reassured returning to poitiers , molay asked the pope to set up an inquiry to quickly clear the order of the rumours and accusations surrounding it , and the pope convened an inquiry on 24 august philip wanted the templars arrested and their possessions confiscated to incorporate their wealth into the royal treasury and to be free of the enormous debt he owed the templar order in a dawn raid on friday , 13 october 1307 , molay and sixty of his templar brother knights were arrested during forced interrogation by royal agents at the university of paris on 24 , or 25 october , molay confessed that the templar initiation ritual included '' denying christ and trampling on the cross '' on 22 march 1312 , at the council of vienne , the order of the knights templar was abolished by papal decree during that year , rumors flew through europe that the mongols had recaptured jerusalem and were going to return the city to the europeans it has been claimed that jacques de molay cursed king philip iv of france and his descendants from his execution pyre philip and clement v both died within a year of molay 's execution ;

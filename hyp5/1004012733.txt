little is known of his early years , but jacques de molay was probably born in molay , haute-saône , in the county of burgundy , at the time a territory ruled by otto iii as part of the holy roman empire , and in modern times in the area of franche-comté , northeastern france in 1265 , as a young man , he was received into the order of the templars in a chapel at the beaune house , by humbert de pairaud , the visitor of france and england another prominent templar in attendance was amaury de la roche , templar master of the province of france around 1270 , de molay went to the east ( outremer ) , although little is recorded of his activities for the next twenty years it became the headquarters of the dwindling kingdom of jerusalem , and the base of operations for any future military attempts by the crusaders against the egyptian mamluks , who for their part were systematically conquering any last crusader strongholds on the mainland templars in cyprus included jacques de molay and thibaud gaudin , their 22nd grand master during a meeting assembled on the island in the autumn of 1291 , molay spoke of reforming the order and put himself forward as an alternative to the current grand master there was talk of merging the templars with one of the other military orders , the knights hospitaller it is known that molay held two general meetings of his order in southern france , at montpellier in 1293 and at arles in 1296 , where he tried to make reforms in the autumn of 1296 , molay was back in cyprus to defend his order against the interests of henry ii of cyprus , which conflict had its roots back in the days of guillaume de beaujeu from 1299 to 1303 , molay was engaged in planning and executing a new attack against the mamluks the ships left famagusta on 20 july 1300 , and under the leadership of admiral baudouin de picquigny , raided the coasts of egypt and syria : rosetta , demurger , p the cypriots then prepared for an attack on tortosa in late 1300 , sending a joint force to a staging area on the island of ruad , from which raids were launched on the mainland meanwhile , pressure increased in europe that the templars should be merged with the other military orders , perhaps all placed under the authority of one king , and that individual should become the new king of jerusalem when it was conquered molay was asked to write memoranda on each of the issues , which he did during the summer of 1306 molay was opposed to the merger , believing instead that having separate military orders was a stronger position , as the missions of each order were somewhat different on 6 june , the leaders of both the templars and the hospitallers were officially asked to come to the papal offices in poitiers to discuss these matters , with the date of the meeting scheduled as all saints day in 1306 , though it later had to be postponed due to the pope 's illness with gastro-enteritis molay left cyprus on 15 october , arriving in france in late 1306 or early 1307 ; however , the meeting was again delayed until late may due to the pope 's illness king philip iv of france , deeply in debt to the templars , was in favor of merging the orders under his own command , thereby making himself rex bellator , or war king for this , one of clement 's predecessors , pope boniface viii , had attempted to have philip excommunicated , but philip then had boniface abducted and charged with heresy clement moved the papacy from italy to poitiers , france , where philip continued to assert more dominance over the papacy and the templars he did not arrive until late summer , so while waiting for his arrival , molay met the pope to discuss other matters , one of which was the charges by one or more ousted templars who had made accusations of impropriety in the templars ' initiation ceremony returning to poitiers , molay asked the pope to set up an inquiry to quickly clear the order of the rumours and accusations surrounding it , and the pope convened an inquiry on 24 august philip wanted the templars arrested and their possessions confiscated to incorporate their wealth into the royal treasury and to be free of the enormous debt he owed the templar order under pressure from philip iv , pope clement v ordered the arrest of all the templars throughout christendom any further opposition by the templars was effectively broken when philip used the previously forced confessions to sentence 54 templars to be burnt at the stake on 10–12 may 1310 molay was sentenced to death together with geoffroi de charney in 1314 as a direct result of cardinal legates ' decisions and actions rather than being ordered by king philip the fair '' this story of wishful thinking was so popular in france that in 1846 a large-scale painting was created by claude jacquand , titled molay prend jerusalem , 1299 ( '' molay takes jerusalem , 1299 '' ) , which depicts the supposed event it has been claimed that jacques de molay cursed king philip iv of france and his descendants from his execution pyre the last templar - the tragedy of jacques de molay , last grand master of the temple ( translated into english by antonia nevill ) , profile books ltd , ( first publication in france in 2002 as jacques de molay : le crépuscule des templiers by éditions payot & rivages ) jacques de molay 's site of execution jacques de molay in medieval history of navarre demolay international , a freemason-sponsored youth group

ferdowsi was born into a family of iranian landowners ( dehqans ) in 940 in the village of paj , near the city of tus , in the khorasan region of the samanid empire , which is located in the present-day khorasan razavi province of northeastern iran ferdowsi grew up in tus , a city under the control of one of these dynasties , the samanids , who claimed descent from the sassanid general bahram chobin ( whose story ferdowsi recounts in one of the later sections of the shahnameh ) the samanid bureaucracy used the new persian language , which had been used to bring islam to the eastern regions of the iranian world and supplanted local languages , and commissioned translations of pahlavi texts into new persian abu mansur muhammad , a dehqan and governor of tus , had ordered his minister abu mansur mamari to invite several local scholars to compile a prose shahnameh ( '' book of kings '' ) , which was completed in 1010 samanid rulers were patrons of such important persian poets as rudaki and daqiqi , and ferdowsi followed in the footsteps of these writers when the turkic ghaznavids overthrew the samanids in the late 990s , ferdowsi continued to work on the poem , rewriting sections to praise the ghaznavid sultan mahmud mahmud 's attitude to ferdowsi and how well he rewarded the poet are matters which have long been subject to dispute and have formed the basis of legends about the poet and his patron ( see below ) according to legend , sultan mahmud of ghazni offered ferdowsi a gold piece for every couplet of the shahnameh he wrote however , the courtier whom mahmud had entrusted with the money despised ferdowsi , regarding him as a heretic , and he replaced the gold coins with silver nizami aruzi , ferdowsi 's early biographer , claimed that all but six lines had been destroyed by a well-wisher who had paid ferdowsi a thousand dirhams for the poem without exception , all such works were based in style and method on ferdowsi 's shahnameh , but none of them could quite achieve the same degree of fame and popularity as ferdowsi 's masterpiece in this respect , ferdowsi surpasses nizami , khayyám , asadi tusi and other seminal persian literary figures in his impact on persian culture and language one such notable figure was rezā shāh pahlavi , who established an academy of persian language and literature , in order to attempt to remove arabic and french words from the persian language , replacing them with suitable persian alternatives ferdowsi 's influence in the persian culture is explained by the encyclopædia britannica : : the persians regard ferdowsi as the greatest of their poets

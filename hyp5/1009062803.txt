ferdowsi was born into a family of iranian landowners ( dehqans ) in 940 in the village of paj , near the city of tus , in the khorasan region of the samanid empire , which is located in the present-day khorasan razavi province of northeastern iran the dehqans were attached to the pre-islamic literary heritage , as their status was associated with it ( so much so that dehqan is sometimes used as a synonym for '' iranian '' in the shahnameh ) thus they saw it as their task to preserve the pre-islamic cultural traditions , including tales of legendary kings the samanid bureaucracy used the new persian language , which had been used to bring islam to the eastern regions of the iranian world and supplanted local languages , and commissioned translations of pahlavi texts into new persian samanid rulers were patrons of such important persian poets as rudaki and daqiqi , and ferdowsi followed in the footsteps of these writers when the turkic ghaznavids overthrew the samanids in the late 990s , ferdowsi continued to work on the poem , rewriting sections to praise the ghaznavid sultan mahmud mahmud 's attitude to ferdowsi and how well he rewarded the poet are matters which have long been subject to dispute and have formed the basis of legends about the poet and his patron ( see below ) the later sections of the shahnameh have passages which reveal ferdowsi 's fluctuating moods : in some he complains about old age , poverty , illness and the death of his son ; in others , he appears happier the tomb , which had fallen into decay , was rebuilt between 1928 and 1934 by the society for the national heritage of iran on the orders of reza shah , and has now become the equivalent of a national shrine without exception , all such works were based in style and method on ferdowsi 's shahnameh , but none of them could quite achieve the same degree of fame and popularity as ferdowsi 's masterpiece his works are cited as a crucial component in the persistence of the persian language , as those works allowed much of the tongue to remain codified and intact in this respect , ferdowsi surpasses nizami , khayyám , asadi tusi and other seminal persian literary figures in his impact on persian culture and language one such notable figure was rezā shāh pahlavi , who established an academy of persian language and literature , in order to attempt to remove arabic and french words from the persian language , replacing them with suitable persian alternatives though written about 1,000 years ago , this work is as intelligible to the average , modern iranian as the king james version of the bible is to a modern english-speaker

the primary source for the battle is the chronicle of 754 , which was written shortly after 754 probably in the vicinity of toledo roger collins ( 1989 ) , the arab conquest of spain , 710 & ndash ; 97 ( london : blackwell publishing ) , 26 & ndash ; 27 , argues for its toledan provenance , but others have suggested córdoba or even syria a full study of the mozarabic chronicle is given in carmen cardelle de hartmann ( 1999 ) , '' the textual transmission of the mozarabic chronicle of 754 '' , early medieval europe , 8 ( 1 ) , 13 & ndash ; 29 the only other latin christian source written within a century of the battle is the historia langobardorum of paul the deacon paul was neither visigothic nor hispanic , but was writing probably in montecassino between 787 and 796 , where many visigothic monks had taken refuge besides the latin christian sources there are several arabic language sources widely used by historians , but increasingly coming under heavy criticism none of them predates the mid-ninth century , the date of the earliest , the futūh miṣr of ibn ʿabd al-ḥakam ( c.803 & ndash ; 71 ) , which was composed in egypt ( 1922 ) , the history of the conquest of egypt , north africa and spain : known as the futūh miṣr of ibn ʿabd al-ḥakam ( yale university press ) ; also john harris jones , trans ( 1858 ) , history of the conquest of spain ( göttingen : w wittiza '' ) , the eleventh-century historian ibn hayyān , the thirteenth-century complete history of ibn al-athir , the fourteenth-century history of ibn khaldūn , or the early modern work of al-maqqarī for an assessment of the value of these sources for the period of the conquest of gothic hispania , see collins ( 1989 ) , 1 & ndash ; 5 the akhbar majmu'ah in particular was upheld by claudio sánchez-albornoz as a genuine eighth-century work surviving only in later copies , but this view has since been refuted thompson , and kenneth baxter wolf are sceptical of the arabic sources and rely more on the mozarabic chronicle collins in particular rejects a syncretistic approach incorporating information from all the available sources though the reign of roderic is traditionally dated to 710 & ndash ; 11 , a literal reading of the mozarabic chronicle of 754 indicates 711 & ndash ; 12 it is possible that roderic was probably the dux ( duke ) of baetica before coming to the throne reilly ( 1993 ) , the medieval spains ( cambridge : cambridge university press ) , 49 & ndash ; 50 collins ( 1989 ) , 28 , and ( 2004 ) , visigothic spain , 409 & ndash ; 711 ( london : blackwell publishing ) , 130 & ndash ; 2 , provides a summary of the disputed succession the battle of guadalete was not an isolated berber attack but followed a series of raids across the straits of gibraltar from north africa which had resulted in the sack of several south iberian towns and two reasonably large armies may have been in the south for a year before the decisive battle was fought '' taric abuzara '' and '' others '' come from the mozarabic chronicle , see collins ( 1989 ) , 30 ṭāriq , which means '' chief '' , is considered an etymological invention by joaquín vallvé ( 1989 ) , '' nuevas ideas sobre la conquista árabe de españa : toponimia y onomástica '' , al-qantara , 10:1 , 51 & ndash ; 150 most of the arabic and berber accounts agree that ṭāriq was a berber military leader from northern africa ignacio olagüe ( 2004 1974 ) , la revolución islámica en occidente ( editorial plurabelle ) , 274 & ndash ; 75 others have argued that ṭāriq was jewish , norman roth ( 1976 ) , '' the jews and the muslim conquest of spain , '' jewish social studies , 38 ( 2 ) , 146 & ndash ; 148 and remained in hispania for fifteen months , but it is unclear from the sources if he came before or after the battle of guadalete , which was fought by the forces of his subordinates mūsā took with him ṭāriq and many visigothic prisoners from the taking of toledo ( collins 1989 , 29 & ndash ; 31 ) according to al-maqqarī , roderic was fighting the basques when he was recalled to the south to deal with an invasion there is also the record of a byzantine attack on southern iberia that was repulsed by theudimer some years before the fall of the visigothic kingdom if this discrepancy is solved by preferring the chronicler 's order to his dating , then the battle occurred in 712 and the fall of toledo later that same year shaw , 224 , suspects that many skirmishes preceded the definitive battle ( probably on the 25th or 26th ) thomas hodgkin , probably following rodrigo jiménez de rada , placed the battle at jerez de la frontera the chronicle of alfonso iii , in both its versions , blames the anonymous '' sons of wittiza '' for conspiring against roderic oppa , wittiza 's historical brother , was found in toledo , possibly as king-elect , by mūsā when he took the city according to vallvé , based on a theoretical confusion in the arabic source between the bay of cádiz and that of algeciras , '' julian '' , a goth , was the governor of cádiz the '' sons of wittiza '' that figure so prominently in later christian sources , are likewise unhistorical wittiza , who is praised by the mozarabic chronicle , is almost universally vilified in subsequent works , beginning with the chronicle of moissac around 818 charles morris , '' the battle of the guadalete '' , historical tales : spanish , philadelphia : j

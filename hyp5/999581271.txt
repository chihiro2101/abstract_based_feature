the primary source for the battle is the chronicle of 754 , which was written shortly after 754 probably in the vicinity of toledo roger collins ( 1989 ) , the arab conquest of spain , 710 & ndash ; 97 ( london : blackwell publishing ) , 26 & ndash ; 27 , argues for its toledan provenance , but others have suggested córdoba or even syria a full study of the mozarabic chronicle is given in carmen cardelle de hartmann ( 1999 ) , '' the textual transmission of the mozarabic chronicle of 754 '' , early medieval europe , 8 ( 1 ) , 13 & ndash ; 29 the only other latin christian source written within a century of the battle is the historia langobardorum of paul the deacon paul was neither visigothic nor hispanic , but was writing probably in montecassino between 787 and 796 , where many visigothic monks had taken refuge the chronicle of 741 is a near-contemporary hispanic source , but it contains no original material pertaining to the battle the high medieval accounts , such as that of lucas de tuy , are generally untrustworthy , containing much legend and invention none of them predates the mid-ninth century , the date of the earliest , the futūh miṣr of ibn ʿabd al-ḥakam ( c.803 & ndash ; 71 ) , which was composed in egypt ( 1858 ) , history of the conquest of spain ( göttingen : w 18 & ndash ; 22 excerpted at ibn abd-el-hakem : the islamic conquest of spain from medieval sourcebook wittiza '' ) , the eleventh-century historian ibn hayyān , the thirteenth-century complete history of ibn al-athir , the fourteenth-century history of ibn khaldūn , or the early modern work of al-maqqarī for an assessment of the value of these sources for the period of the conquest of gothic hispania , see collins ( 1989 ) , 1 & ndash ; 5 the french orientalist évariste lévi-provençal on the other hand advocated ibn hayyān as the supreme muslim historian of the era ( and the battle ) probably they were rivals who never actually came into open conflict , due to the shortness of roderic 's reign and his preoccupation with muslim raids even with roderic 's sphere of influence ( the southwest ) and his capital toledo , he was not unopposed after his '' usurpation '' ( the mozarabic chronicle calls it an '' invasion '' ) collins ( 1989 ) , 28 , and ( 2004 ) , visigothic spain , 409 & ndash ; 711 ( london : blackwell publishing ) , 130 & ndash ; 2 , provides a summary of the disputed succession and two reasonably large armies may have been in the south for a year before the decisive battle was fought these were led by ṭāriq ibn ziyad , and others , under the overall command of mūsā ibn nuṣayr most of the arabic and berber accounts agree that ṭāriq was a berber military leader from northern africa on this view , ṭāriq was a christian ( initially ) others have argued that ṭāriq was jewish , norman roth ( 1976 ) , '' the jews and the muslim conquest of spain , '' jewish social studies , 38 ( 2 ) , 146 & ndash ; 148 a legend first recorded by al-idrīsī has it that ṭāriq burned his boats after landing and remained in hispania for fifteen months , but it is unclear from the sources if he came before or after the battle of guadalete , which was fought by the forces of his subordinates later arabic sources state that mūsā only went to hispania after news of ṭāriq 's success reached him he flogged his subordinate in front of his soldiers and then the two together completed the conquest of the peninsula before mūsā was recalled by the caliph to damascus , a fact confirmed by the mozarabic chronicle mūsā took with him ṭāriq and many visigothic prisoners from the taking of toledo ( collins 1989 , 29 & ndash ; 31 ) according to al-maqqarī , roderic was fighting the basques when he was recalled to the south to deal with an invasion bachrach ( 1973 ) , '' a reassessment of visigothic jewish policy , 589 & ndash ; 711 '' , the american historical review , 78:1 ( february ) , 32 he also identified two invasions , the first by an abu zubra and the second , a year later , by ṭāriq ; probably he has divided the historical figure ṭāriq ibn ziyad into two persons the date of the battle is traditionally 711 , though this is not the date given by the mozarabic chronicle the chronicle dates it to 712 and places it before the conquest of toledo , which it attributes to mūsā in 711 if this discrepancy is solved by preferring the chronicler 's order to his dating , then the battle occurred in 712 and the fall of toledo later that same year some accounts say the battle began on the 19th and lasted one week shaw , 224 , suspects that many skirmishes preceded the definitive battle ( probably on the 25th or 26th ) estimating visigothic forces at 33,000 , david lewis recounts how the muslim army engaged in a series of violent hit and run attacks , while the visigothic lines maneuvered en masse the chronicle of alfonso iii , in both its versions , blames the anonymous '' sons of wittiza '' for conspiring against roderic murphy ( 1952 ) , '' julian of toledo and the fall of the visigothic kingdom in spain '' , speculum , 27 ( 1 ) , 1 & ndash ;

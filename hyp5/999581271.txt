the primary source for the battle is the chronicle of 754 , which was written shortly after 754 probably in the vicinity of toledo roger collins ( 1989 ) , the arab conquest of spain , 710 & ndash ; 97 ( london : blackwell publishing ) , 26 & ndash ; 27 , argues for its toledan provenance , but others have suggested córdoba or even syria a full study of the mozarabic chronicle is given in carmen cardelle de hartmann ( 1999 ) , '' the textual transmission of the mozarabic chronicle of 754 '' , early medieval europe , 8 ( 1 ) , 13 & ndash ; 29 the only other latin christian source written within a century of the battle is the historia langobardorum of paul the deacon paul was neither visigothic nor hispanic , but was writing probably in montecassino between 787 and 796 , where many visigothic monks had taken refuge the chronicle of 741 is a near-contemporary hispanic source , but it contains no original material pertaining to the battle several later latin christian sources contain descriptive accounts of the battle that have sometimes been trusted by historians , most notably the chronicle of alfonso iii , written by alfonso iii of asturias in the late ninth century the high medieval accounts , such as that of lucas de tuy , are generally untrustworthy , containing much legend and invention 18 & ndash ; 22 excerpted at ibn abd-el-hakem : the islamic conquest of spain from medieval sourcebook this account , more rich in detail than the mozarabic chronicle , is at odds with not only the later latin histories , but also the later arabic ones : the anonymous compilation called the akhbār majmūʿa , the late tenth-century work of ibn al-qūṭiyya ( '' the son i.e wittiza '' ) , the eleventh-century historian ibn hayyān , the thirteenth-century complete history of ibn al-athir , the fourteenth-century history of ibn khaldūn , or the early modern work of al-maqqarī for an assessment of the value of these sources for the period of the conquest of gothic hispania , see collins ( 1989 ) , 1 & ndash ; 5 the french orientalist évariste lévi-provençal on the other hand advocated ibn hayyān as the supreme muslim historian of the era ( and the battle ) it is possible that roderic was probably the dux ( duke ) of baetica before coming to the throne even with roderic 's sphere of influence ( the southwest ) and his capital toledo , he was not unopposed after his '' usurpation '' ( the mozarabic chronicle calls it an '' invasion '' ) collins ( 1989 ) , 28 , and ( 2004 ) , visigothic spain , 409 & ndash ; 711 ( london : blackwell publishing ) , 130 & ndash ; 2 , provides a summary of the disputed succession some later arabic and christian sources present an earlier raid by a certain ṭārif in 710 and one , the ad sebastianum recension of the chronicle of alfonso iii , refers to an arab attack incited by erwig during the reign of wamba ( 672 & ndash ; 80 ) and two reasonably large armies may have been in the south for a year before the decisive battle was fought for the others that accompanied ṭāriq & mdash ; abdelmelic , alcama , and mugheith & mdash ; see dykes shaw ( 1906 ) , '' the fall of the visigothic power in spain '' , the english historical review , 21:82 ( april ) , 222 others have argued that ṭāriq was jewish , norman roth ( 1976 ) , '' the jews and the muslim conquest of spain , '' jewish social studies , 38 ( 2 ) , 146 & ndash ; 148 according to all sources , the earliest being paul the deacon , ṭāriq left from ceuta ( septem ) and landed at the rock of calpe , the later gibraltar , which arabic sources derive from jebel tariq , '' rock of ṭāriq '' glick ( 1979 ) , islamic and christian spain in the early middle ages : comparative perspectives on social and cultural formation ( princeton : princeton university press ) , 32 according to ibn ʿabd al-ḥakam writing around 860 , ṭāriq , commander of the berber garrison of tangiers , crossed the straits with ships from a certain count julian ( arabic ilyan ) , lord of ceuta and '' alchadra '' ( algeciras ) , and landed near cartagena , which he took and made his headquarters and remained in hispania for fifteen months , but it is unclear from the sources if he came before or after the battle of guadalete , which was fought by the forces of his subordinates during his time in the peninsula it was racked by civil war ( intestino furore confligeratur , '' internal frenzy '' , to the mozarabic chronicler ) , cities were razed and many people slaughtered in the general destruction he flogged his subordinate in front of his soldiers and then the two together completed the conquest of the peninsula before mūsā was recalled by the caliph to damascus , a fact confirmed by the mozarabic chronicle mūsā took with him ṭāriq and many visigothic prisoners from the taking of toledo ( collins 1989 , 29 & ndash ; 31 ) according to al-maqqarī , roderic was fighting the basques when he was recalled to the south to deal with an invasion this theory is predicated on a certain understanding of the identity of the mysterious count julian ( see '' legend '' below ) he also identified two invasions , the first by an abu zubra and the second , a year later , by ṭāriq ; probably he has divided the historical figure ṭāriq ibn ziyad into two persons if this discrepancy is solved by preferring the chronicler 's order to his dating , then the battle occurred in 712 and the fall of toledo later that same year later arabic accounts give an exact date of 25 or 26 july according to david levering lewis , the battle took place on 19 july 711 estimating visigothic forces at 33,000 , david lewis recounts how the muslim army engaged in a series of violent hit and run attacks , while the visigothic lines maneuvered en masse according to one interpretation of the urban-julian legend , he was a byzantine governor of ceuta who joined with the arabs to raid the southern coasts of iberia in 710 with ṭārif tarīfa means '' point '' in arabic , a reference to its place as the southern tip of hispania wittiza , who is praised by the mozarabic chronicle , is almost universally vilified in subsequent works , beginning with the chronicle of moissac around 818 among the other legends surrounding the battle is that of roderic 's arrival at the field in a chariot drawn by eight white mules

the primary source for the battle is the chronicle of 754 , which was written shortly after 754 probably in the vicinity of toledo roger collins ( 1989 ) , the arab conquest of spain , 710 & ndash ; 97 ( london : blackwell publishing ) , 26 & ndash ; 27 , argues for its toledan provenance , but others have suggested córdoba or even syria a full study of the mozarabic chronicle is given in carmen cardelle de hartmann ( 1999 ) , '' the textual transmission of the mozarabic chronicle of 754 '' , early medieval europe , 8 ( 1 ) , 13 & ndash ; 29 the only other latin christian source written within a century of the battle is the historia langobardorum of paul the deacon paul was neither visigothic nor hispanic , but was writing probably in montecassino between 787 and 796 , where many visigothic monks had taken refuge the chronicle of 741 is a near-contemporary hispanic source , but it contains no original material pertaining to the battle the high medieval accounts , such as that of lucas de tuy , are generally untrustworthy , containing much legend and invention besides the latin christian sources there are several arabic language sources widely used by historians , but increasingly coming under heavy criticism none of them predates the mid-ninth century , the date of the earliest , the futūh miṣr of ibn ʿabd al-ḥakam ( c.803 & ndash ; 71 ) , which was composed in egypt ( 1922 ) , the history of the conquest of egypt , north africa and spain : known as the futūh miṣr of ibn ʿabd al-ḥakam ( yale university press ) ; also john harris jones , trans 18 & ndash ; 22 excerpted at ibn abd-el-hakem : the islamic conquest of spain from medieval sourcebook wittiza '' ) , the eleventh-century historian ibn hayyān , the thirteenth-century complete history of ibn al-athir , the fourteenth-century history of ibn khaldūn , or the early modern work of al-maqqarī for an assessment of the value of these sources for the period of the conquest of gothic hispania , see collins ( 1989 ) , 1 & ndash ; 5 the french orientalist évariste lévi-provençal on the other hand advocated ibn hayyān as the supreme muslim historian of the era ( and the battle ) thompson , and kenneth baxter wolf are sceptical of the arabic sources and rely more on the mozarabic chronicle reilly ( 1993 ) , the medieval spains ( cambridge : cambridge university press ) , 49 & ndash ; 50 even with roderic 's sphere of influence ( the southwest ) and his capital toledo , he was not unopposed after his '' usurpation '' ( the mozarabic chronicle calls it an '' invasion '' ) collins ( 1989 ) , 28 , and ( 2004 ) , visigothic spain , 409 & ndash ; 711 ( london : blackwell publishing ) , 130 & ndash ; 2 , provides a summary of the disputed succession and two reasonably large armies may have been in the south for a year before the decisive battle was fought these were led by ṭāriq ibn ziyad , and others , under the overall command of mūsā ibn nuṣayr for the others that accompanied ṭāriq & mdash ; abdelmelic , alcama , and mugheith & mdash ; see dykes shaw ( 1906 ) , '' the fall of the visigothic power in spain '' , the english historical review , 21:82 ( april ) , 222 most of the arabic and berber accounts agree that ṭāriq was a berber military leader from northern africa others have argued that ṭāriq was jewish , norman roth ( 1976 ) , '' the jews and the muslim conquest of spain , '' jewish social studies , 38 ( 2 ) , 146 & ndash ; 148 persian georges bohas , '' tariq ibn ziyad , '' encyclopædia universalis , accessed 18 october 2009 later arabic sources state that mūsā only went to hispania after news of ṭāriq 's success reached him he flogged his subordinate in front of his soldiers and then the two together completed the conquest of the peninsula before mūsā was recalled by the caliph to damascus , a fact confirmed by the mozarabic chronicle mūsā took with him ṭāriq and many visigothic prisoners from the taking of toledo ( collins 1989 , 29 & ndash ; 31 ) he also identified two invasions , the first by an abu zubra and the second , a year later , by ṭāriq ; probably he has divided the historical figure ṭāriq ibn ziyad into two persons the date of the battle is traditionally 711 , though this is not the date given by the mozarabic chronicle if this discrepancy is solved by preferring the chronicler 's order to his dating , then the battle occurred in 712 and the fall of toledo later that same year shaw , 224 , suspects that many skirmishes preceded the definitive battle ( probably on the 25th or 26th ) according to david levering lewis , the battle took place on 19 july 711 preceding the battle was an entire week of inconclusive skirmishes near the lake la janda , in the plain stretching from the río barbate to the río guadalete david levering lewis ( 2008 ) , god 's crucible : islam and the making of europe , 570 & ndash ;

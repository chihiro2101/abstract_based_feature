in 1925 , ronald fisher advanced the idea of statistical hypothesis testing , which he called '' tests of significance '' , in his publication statistical methods for research workers fisher suggested a probability of one in twenty ( 0.05 ) as a convenient cutoff level to reject the null hypothesis in his 1956 publication statistical methods and scientific inference , he recommended that significance levels be set according to specific circumstances the significance level \alpha is the threshold for p below which the null hypothesis is rejected even though by assumption it were true , and something else is going on this means that \alpha is also the probability of mistakenly rejecting the null hypothesis , if the null hypothesis is true '' conclusions about statistical significance are possible with the help of the confidence interval if the confidence interval does not include the value of zero effect , it can be assumed that there is a statistically significant result statistical significance plays a pivotal role in statistical hypothesis testing for the null hypothesis to be rejected , an observed result has to be statistically significant , i.e the observed p-value is less than the pre-specified significance level \alpha to determine whether a result is statistically significant , a researcher calculates a p-value , which is the probability of observing an effect of the same magnitude or more extreme given that the null hypothesis is true the null hypothesis is rejected if the p-value is less than ( or equal to ) a predetermined level , \alpha \alpha is also called the significance level , and is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given that it is true ( a type i error ) for example , when \alpha is set to 5 % , the conditional probability of a type i error , given that the null hypothesis is true , is 5 % , and a statistically significant result is one where the observed p-value is less than ( or equal to ) 5 % as a result , the null hypothesis can be rejected with a less extreme result if a one-tailed test was used effect size is a measure of a study 's practical significance reviews problems with null hypothesis statistical testing

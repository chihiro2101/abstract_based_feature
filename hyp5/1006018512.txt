in 1925 , ronald fisher advanced the idea of statistical hypothesis testing , which he called '' tests of significance '' , in his publication statistical methods for research workers fisher suggested a probability of one in twenty ( 0.05 ) as a convenient cutoff level to reject the null hypothesis in his 1956 publication statistical methods and scientific inference , he recommended that significance levels be set according to specific circumstances the significance level \alpha is the threshold for p below which the null hypothesis is rejected even though by assumption it were true , and something else is going on this means that \alpha is also the probability of mistakenly rejecting the null hypothesis , if the null hypothesis is true if the confidence interval does not include the value of zero effect , it can be assumed that there is a statistically significant result statistical significance plays a pivotal role in statistical hypothesis testing for the null hypothesis to be rejected , an observed result has to be statistically significant , i.e to determine whether a result is statistically significant , a researcher calculates a p-value , which is the probability of observing an effect of the same magnitude or more extreme given that the null hypothesis is true \alpha is also called the significance level , and is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given that it is true ( a type i error ) for example , when \alpha is set to 5 % , the conditional probability of a type i error , given that the null hypothesis is true , is 5 % , and a statistically significant result is one where the observed p-value is less than ( or equal to ) 5 % these 5 % can be allocated to one side of the sampling distribution , as in a one-tailed test , or partitioned to both sides of the distribution , as in a two-tailed test , with each tail ( or rejection region ) containing 2.5 % of the distribution as a result , the null hypothesis can be rejected with a less extreme result if a one-tailed test was used some journals encouraged authors to do more detailed analysis than just a statistical significance test in 2019 , over 800 statisticians and scientists signed a message calling for the abandonment of the term '' statistical significance '' in science , and the american statistical association published a further official statement declaring ( page 2 ) : statistical significance : rationale , validity and utility , volume 1 of series introducing statistical methods , sage publications ltd , â€“ argues that statistical significance is useful in certain circumstances beyond significance testing : reforming data analysis methods in behavioral research washington , dc : american psychological association

roland barthes was born on 12 november in the town of cherbourg in normandy his father , naval officer louis barthes , was killed in a battle during world war i in the north sea before barthes 's first birthday his mother , henriette barthes , and his aunt and grandmother raised him in the village of urt and the city of bayonne when barthes was eleven , his family moved to paris , though his attachment to his provincial roots would remain strong throughout his life barthes showed great promise as a student and spent the period from 1935 to 1939 at the sorbonne , where he earned a licence in classical literature his repeated physical breakdowns disrupted his academic career , affecting his studies and his ability to take qualifying examinations in 1948 , he returned to purely academic work , gaining numerous short-term positions at institutes in france , romania , and egypt consisting of fifty-four short essays , mostly written between 1954–1956 , mythologies were acute reflections of french popular culture ranging from an analysis on soap detergents to a dissection of popular wrestling knowing little english , barthes taught at middlebury college in 1957 and befriended the future english translator of much of his work , richard howard , that summer in new york city '' remembering roland barthes , '' the nation ( 20 november 1982 ) : '' mutual friends brought us together in 1957 ( michelet and writing degree zero had already been published in france , but he was not yet known in america—not even in most french departments barthes spent the early 1960s exploring the fields of semiology and structuralism , chairing various faculty positions around france , and continuing to produce more full-length studies barthes 's rebuttal in criticism and truth ( 1966 ) accused the old , bourgeois criticism of a lack of concern with the finer points of language and of selective ignorance towards challenging theories , such as marxism he traveled to the us and japan , delivering a presentation at johns hopkins university in 1970 , barthes produced what many consider to be his most prodigious work , the dense , critical reading of balzac 's sarrasine entitled s/z in those same years he became primarily associated with the école des hautes études en sciences sociales ( ehess ) in 1975 he wrote an autobiography titled roland barthes and in 1977 he was elected to the chair of sémiologie littéraire at the collège de france on 25 february 1980 , roland barthes was knocked down by a laundry van while walking home through the streets of paris one month later , on 26 march , he died from the chest injuries he sustained in the accident sartre 's what is literature ? ( 1947 ) expresses a disenchantment both with established forms of writing and more experimental , avant-garde forms , which he feels alienate readers instead , form , or what barthes calls '' writing '' ( the specific way an individual chooses to manipulate conventions of style for a desired effect ) , is the unique and creative act he argued that michelet 's views of history and society are obviously flawed in this sense , barthes believed that art should be critical and should interrogate the world , rather than seek to explain it , as michelet had done he developed a theory of signs to demonstrate this perceived deception barthes explained that these bourgeois cultural myths were '' second-order signs , '' or '' connotations '' a picture of a full , dark bottle is a signifier that relates to a specific signified : a fermented , alcoholic beverage barthes used the term '' myth '' while analyzing the popular , consumer culture of post-war france in order to reveal that '' objects were organized into meaningful relationships via narratives that expressed collective cultural values as barthes 's work with structuralism began to flourish around the time of his debates with picard , his investigation of structure focused on revealing the importance of language in writing , which he felt was overlooked by old criticism barthes 's '' introduction to the structural analysis of narrative '' is concerned with examining the correspondence between the structure of a sentence and that of a larger narrative , thus allowing narrative to be viewed along linguistic lines for example , key words like 'dark ' , 'mysterious ' and 'odd ' , when integrated together , formulate a specific kind of character or 'action ' while barthes found structuralism to be a useful tool and believed that discourse of literature could be formalized , he did not believe it could become a strict scientific endeavour in the late 1960s , radical movements were taking place in literary criticism but since there are no symbols of constant and universal significance , the entire premise of structuralism as a means of evaluating writing ( or anything ) is hollow such thought led barthes to consider the limitations not just of signs and symbols , but also of western culture 's dependency on beliefs of constancy and ultimate standards in the wake of this trip barthes wrote what is largely considered to be his best-known work , the essay '' the death of the author '' ( 1968 ) but barthes points out that the great proliferation of meaning in language and the unknowable state of the author 's mind makes any such ultimate realization impossible as such , the whole notion of the 'knowable text ' acts as little more than another delusion of western bourgeois culture indeed , the idea of giving a book or poem an ultimate end coincides with the notion of making it consumable , something that can be used up and replaced in a capitalist market '' the death of the author '' is considered to be a post-structuralist work , jay clayton , eric rothstein , influence and intertextuality in literary history , university of wisconsin press , 1991 , p since it moves past the conventions of trying to quantify literature , but others see it as more of a transitional phase for barthes in his continuing effort to find significance in culture outside of the bourgeois norms since barthes contends that there can be no originating anchor of meaning in the possible intentions of the author , he considers what other sources of meaning or significance can be found in literature he concludes that since meaning ca n't come from the author , it must be actively created by the reader through a process of textual analysis in his s/z ( 1970 ) , barthes applies this notion in an analysis of sarrasine , a balzac novella a text can be reversible by avoiding the restrictive devices that sarrasine suffered from such as strict timelines and exact definitions of events in the late 1970s , barthes was increasingly concerned with the conflict of two types of language : that of popular culture , which he saw as limiting and pigeonholing in its titles and descriptions , and neutral , which he saw as open and noncommittal he called these two conflicting modes the doxa ( the official and unacknowledged systems of meaning by which we know culture ) and the paradox as a reaction to this , he wrote the pleasure of the text ( 1975 ) , a study that focused on a subject matter he felt was equally outside the realm of both conservative society and militant leftist thinking : hedonism by writing about a subject that was rejected by both social extremes of thought , barthes felt he could avoid the dangers of the limiting language of the doxa yet at the same time the novelistic character is a sympathetic one , and is thus open not just to criticism but also understanding from the reader like friedrich nietzsche and levinas , he also drew from eastern philosophical traditions in his critique of european culture as '' infected '' by western metaphysics but he still considered the photograph to have a unique potential for presenting a completely real representation of the world barthes found the solution to this fine line of personal meaning in the form of his mother 's picture because of this there is something uniquely personal contained in the photograph of barthes 's mother that can not be removed from his subjective state : the recurrent feeling of loss experienced whenever he looks at it on racine ( 1992 ) , university of california

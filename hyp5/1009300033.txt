roland barthes was born on 12 november in the town of cherbourg in normandy his father , naval officer louis barthes , was killed in a battle during world war i in the north sea before barthes 's first birthday his mother , henriette barthes , and his aunt and grandmother raised him in the village of urt and the city of bayonne when barthes was eleven , his family moved to paris , though his attachment to his provincial roots would remain strong throughout his life barthes showed great promise as a student and spent the period from 1935 to 1939 at the sorbonne , where he earned a licence in classical literature he was plagued by ill health throughout this period , suffering from tuberculosis , which often had to be treated in the isolation of sanatoria during this time , he contributed to the leftist parisian paper combat , out of which grew his first full-length work , writing degree zero ( 1953 ) in 1952 , barthes settled at the centre national de la recherche scientifique , where he studied lexicology and sociology during his seven-year period there , he began to write a popular series of bi-monthly essays for the magazine les lettres nouvelles , in which he dismantled myths of popular culture ( gathered in the mythologies collection that was published in 1957 ) consisting of fifty-four short essays , mostly written between 1954–1956 , mythologies were acute reflections of french popular culture ranging from an analysis on soap detergents to a dissection of popular wrestling knowing little english , barthes taught at middlebury college in 1957 and befriended the future english translator of much of his work , richard howard , that summer in new york city ( michelet and writing degree zero had already been published in france , but he was not yet known in america—not even in most french departments ) '' reprinted in signs in culture : roland barthes today , edited by steven ungar and betty r barthes spent the early 1960s exploring the fields of semiology and structuralism , chairing various faculty positions around france , and continuing to produce more full-length studies many of his works challenged traditional academic views of literary criticism and of renowned figures of literature during this time , he wrote his best-known work , the 1967 essay '' death of the author , '' which , in light of the growing influence of jacques derrida 's deconstruction , would prove to be a transitional piece in its investigation of the logical ends of structuralist thought barthes continued to contribute with philippe sollers to the avant-garde literary magazine tel quel , which was developing similar kinds of theoretical inquiry to that pursued in barthes 's writings in 1970 , barthes produced what many consider to be his most prodigious work , the dense , critical reading of balzac 's sarrasine entitled s/z in those same years he became primarily associated with the école des hautes études en sciences sociales ( ehess ) on 25 february 1980 , roland barthes was knocked down by a laundry van while walking home through the streets of paris one month later , on 26 march , he died from the chest injuries he sustained in the accident barthes 's earliest ideas reacted to the trend of existentialist philosophy that was prominent in france during the 1940s , specifically to the figurehead of existentialism , jean-paul sartre in writing degree zero ( 1953 ) , barthes argues that conventions inform both language and style , rendering neither purely creative instead , form , or what barthes calls '' writing '' ( the specific way an individual chooses to manipulate conventions of style for a desired effect ) , is the unique and creative act he argued that michelet 's views of history and society are obviously flawed similarly , barthes felt that avant-garde writing should be praised for its maintenance of just such a distance between its audience and itself for example , barthes cited the portrayal of wine in french society its description as a robust and healthy habit is a bourgeois ideal that is contradicted by certain realities ( i.e the former pertains to the literal or explicit meaning of things while the latter is composed of the language used to speak about the first order however , the bourgeoisie relate it to a new signified : the idea of healthy , robust , relaxing experience in the end barthes 's mythologies became absorbed into bourgeois culture , as he found many third parties asking him to comment on a certain cultural phenomenon , being interested in his control over his readership as barthes 's work with structuralism began to flourish around the time of his debates with picard , his investigation of structure focused on revealing the importance of language in writing , which he felt was overlooked by old criticism barthes 's '' introduction to the structural analysis of narrative '' is concerned with examining the correspondence between the structure of a sentence and that of a larger narrative , thus allowing narrative to be viewed along linguistic lines barthes was able to use these distinctions to evaluate how certain key 'functions ' work in forming characters for example , key words like 'dark ' , 'mysterious ' and 'odd ' , when integrated together , formulate a specific kind of character or 'action ' by breaking down the work into such fundamental distinctions barthes was able to judge the degree of realism given functions have in forming their actions and consequently with what authenticity a narrative can be said to reflect on reality in the late 1960s , radical movements were taking place in literary criticism the post-structuralist movement and the deconstructionism of jacques derrida were testing the bounds of the structuralist theory that barthes 's work exemplified derrida identified the flaw of structuralism as its reliance on a transcendental signifier ; a symbol of constant , universal meaning would be essential as an orienting point in such a closed off system in the wake of this trip barthes wrote what is largely considered to be his best-known work , the essay '' the death of the author '' ( 1968 ) by imagining an ultimate intended meaning of a piece of literature one could infer an ultimate explanation for it indeed , the idea of giving a book or poem an ultimate end coincides with the notion of making it consumable , something that can be used up and replaced in a capitalist market since it moves past the conventions of trying to quantify literature , but others see it as more of a transitional phase for barthes in his continuing effort to find significance in culture outside of the bourgeois norms he concludes that since meaning ca n't come from the author , it must be actively created by the reader through a process of textual analysis from this project barthes concludes that an ideal text is one that is reversible , or open to the greatest variety of independent interpretations and not restrictive in meaning he describes this as the difference between the writerly text , in which the reader is active in a creative process , and a readerly text in which they are restricted to just reading while barthes had sympathized with marxist thought in the past ( or at least parallel criticisms ) , he felt that , despite its anti-ideological stance , marxist theory was just as guilty of using violent language with assertive meanings , as was bourgeois literature this loss of self within the text or immersion in the text , signifies a final impact of reading that is experienced outside the social realm and free from the influence of culturally associative language and is thus neutral with regard to social progress despite this newest theory of reading , barthes remained concerned with the difficulty of achieving truly neutral writing , which required an avoidance of any labels that might carry an implied meaning or identity towards a given object even carefully crafted neutral writing could be taken in an assertive context through the incidental use of a word with a loaded social context he became interested in finding the best method for creating neutral writing , and he decided to try to create a novelistic form of rhetoric that would not seek to impose its meaning on the reader the lover 's attempts to assert himself into a false , ideal reality is involved in a delusion that exposes the contradictory logic inherent in such a search the end result is one that challenges the reader 's views of social constructs of love , without

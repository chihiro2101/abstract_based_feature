roland barthes was born on 12 november in the town of cherbourg in normandy his mother , henriette barthes , and his aunt and grandmother raised him in the village of urt and the city of bayonne when barthes was eleven , his family moved to paris , though his attachment to his provincial roots would remain strong throughout his life he received a diplôme d'études supérieures ( roughly equivalent to an ma by thesis ) from the university of paris in 1941 for his work in greek tragedy schrift , twentieth-century french philosophy : key themes and thinkers , john wiley & sons , 4 feb 2009 , p in 1948 , he returned to purely academic work , gaining numerous short-term positions at institutes in france , romania , and egypt during this time , he contributed to the leftist parisian paper combat , out of which grew his first full-length work , writing degree zero ( 1953 ) during his seven-year period there , he began to write a popular series of bi-monthly essays for the magazine les lettres nouvelles , in which he dismantled myths of popular culture ( gathered in the mythologies collection that was published in 1957 ) consisting of fifty-four short essays , mostly written between 1954–1956 , mythologies were acute reflections of french popular culture ranging from an analysis on soap detergents to a dissection of popular wrestling knowing little english , barthes taught at middlebury college in 1957 and befriended the future english translator of much of his work , richard howard , that summer in new york city '' remembering roland barthes , '' the nation ( 20 november 1982 ) : '' mutual friends brought us together in 1957 ( michelet and writing degree zero had already been published in france , but he was not yet known in america—not even in most french departments ) '' reprinted in signs in culture : roland barthes today , edited by steven ungar and betty r his unorthodox thinking led to a conflict with a well-known sorbonne professor of literature , raymond picard , who attacked the french new criticism ( a label that he inaccurately applied to barthes ) for its obscurity and lack of respect towards france 's literary roots barthes 's rebuttal in criticism and truth ( 1966 ) accused the old , bourgeois criticism of a lack of concern with the finer points of language and of selective ignorance towards challenging theories , such as marxism during this time , he wrote his best-known work , the 1967 essay '' death of the author , '' which , in light of the growing influence of jacques derrida 's deconstruction , would prove to be a transitional piece in its investigation of the logical ends of structuralist thought barthes continued to contribute with philippe sollers to the avant-garde literary magazine tel quel , which was developing similar kinds of theoretical inquiry to that pursued in barthes 's writings in 1970 , barthes produced what many consider to be his most prodigious work , the dense , critical reading of balzac 's sarrasine entitled s/z throughout the 1970s , barthes continued to develop his literary criticism ; he developed new ideals of textualism and novelistic neutrality in those same years he became primarily associated with the école des hautes études en sciences sociales ( ehess ) in the same year , his mother , henriette barthes , to whom he had been devoted , died , aged 85 one month later , on 26 march , he died from the chest injuries he sustained in the accident barthes 's earliest ideas reacted to the trend of existentialist philosophy that was prominent in france during the 1940s , specifically to the figurehead of existentialism , jean-paul sartre instead , form , or what barthes calls '' writing '' ( the specific way an individual chooses to manipulate conventions of style for a desired effect ) , is the unique and creative act however , a writer 's form is vulnerable to becoming a convention once it has been made available to the public in michelet , a critical analysis of the french historian jules michelet , barthes developed these notions , applying them to a broader range of fields similarly , barthes felt that avant-garde writing should be praised for its maintenance of just such a distance between its audience and itself in presenting an obvious artificiality rather than making claims to great subjective truths , barthes argued , avant-garde writers ensure that their audiences maintain an objective perspective barthes 's many monthly contributions , collected in his mythologies ( 1957 ) , frequently interrogated specific cultural materials in order to expose how bourgeois society asserted its values through them its description as a robust and healthy habit is a bourgeois ideal that is contradicted by certain realities ( i.e he developed a theory of signs to demonstrate this perceived deception barthes used the term '' myth '' while analyzing the popular , consumer culture of post-war france in order to reveal that '' objects were organized into meaningful relationships via narratives that expressed collective cultural values barthes 's '' introduction to the structural analysis of narrative '' is concerned with examining the correspondence between the structure of a sentence and that of a larger narrative , thus allowing narrative to be viewed along linguistic lines barthes split this work into three hierarchical levels : 'functions ' , 'actions ' and 'narrative ' 'functions ' are the elementary pieces of a work , such as a single descriptive word that can be used to identify a character barthes was able to use these distinctions to evaluate how certain key 'functions ' work in forming characters for example , key words like 'dark ' , 'mysterious ' and 'odd ' , when integrated together , formulate a specific kind of character or 'action ' by breaking down the work into such fundamental distinctions barthes was able to judge the degree of realism given functions have in forming their actions and consequently with what authenticity a narrative can be said to reflect on reality derrida identified the flaw of structuralism as its reliance on a transcendental signifier ; a symbol of constant , universal meaning would be essential as an orienting point in such a closed off system this is to say that without some regular standard of measurement , a system of criticism that references nothing outside of the actual work itself could never prove useful but since there are no symbols of constant and universal significance , the entire premise of structuralism as a means of evaluating writing ( or anything ) is hollow such thought led barthes to consider the limitations not just of signs and symbols , but also of western culture 's dependency on beliefs of constancy and ultimate standards such a society contrasts greatly to the one he dissected in mythologies , which was revealed to be always asserting a greater , more complex significance on top of the natural one barthes saw the notion of the author , or authorial authority , in the criticism of literary text as the forced projection of an ultimate meaning of the text since it moves past the conventions of trying to quantify literature , but others see it as more of a transitional phase for barthes in his continuing effort to find significance in culture outside of the bourgeois norms since barthes contends that there can be no originating anchor of meaning in the possible intentions of the author , he considers what other sources of meaning or significance can be found in literature he concludes that since meaning ca n't come from the author , it must be actively created by the reader through a process of textual analysis from this project barthes concludes that an ideal text is one that is reversible , or open to the greatest variety of independent interpretations and not restrictive in meaning in the late 1970s , barthes was increasingly concerned with the conflict of two types of language : that of popular culture , which he saw as limiting and pigeonholing in its titles and descriptions , and neutral , which he saw as open and noncommittal this loss of self within the text or immersion in the text , signifies a final impact of reading that is experienced outside the social realm and free from the influence of culturally associative language and is thus neutral with regard to social progress despite this newest theory of reading , barthes remained concerned with the difficulty of achieving truly neutral writing , which required an avoidance of any labels that might carry an implied meaning or identity towards a given object barthes felt his past works , like mythologies , had suffered from this the lover 's attempts to assert himself into a false , ideal reality is involved in a delusion that exposes the contradictory logic inherent in such a search yet at the same time the novelistic character is a sympathetic one , and is thus open not just to criticism but also understanding from the reader thus reading becomes for barthes '' not a parasitical act , the reactive complement of a writing '' , but rather a '' form of work '' ( 10 ) susan sontag , '' writing itself : on roland barthes '' , introduction to roland barthes , a barthes reader , ed '' toys '' : another excerpt from mythologies barthes , roland

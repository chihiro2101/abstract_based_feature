roland barthes was born on 12 november in the town of cherbourg in normandy his father , naval officer louis barthes , was killed in a battle during world war i in the north sea before barthes 's first birthday barthes showed great promise as a student and spent the period from 1935 to 1939 at the sorbonne , where he earned a licence in classical literature schrift , twentieth-century french philosophy : key themes and thinkers , john wiley & sons , 4 feb 2009 , p in 1948 , he returned to purely academic work , gaining numerous short-term positions at institutes in france , romania , and egypt knowing little english , barthes taught at middlebury college in 1957 and befriended the future english translator of much of his work , richard howard , that summer in new york city ( michelet and writing degree zero had already been published in france , but he was not yet known in america—not even in most french departments ) '' reprinted in signs in culture : roland barthes today , edited by steven ungar and betty r barthes spent the early 1960s exploring the fields of semiology and structuralism , chairing various faculty positions around france , and continuing to produce more full-length studies many of his works challenged traditional academic views of literary criticism and of renowned figures of literature by the late 1960s , barthes had established a reputation for himself barthes continued to contribute with philippe sollers to the avant-garde literary magazine tel quel , which was developing similar kinds of theoretical inquiry to that pursued in barthes 's writings throughout the 1970s , barthes continued to develop his literary criticism ; he developed new ideals of textualism and novelistic neutrality in those same years he became primarily associated with the école des hautes études en sciences sociales ( ehess ) in 1975 he wrote an autobiography titled roland barthes and in 1977 he was elected to the chair of sémiologie littéraire at the collège de france in the same year , his mother , henriette barthes , to whom he had been devoted , died , aged 85 his last major work , camera lucida , is partly an essay about the nature of photography and partly a meditation on photographs of his mother the book contains many reproductions of photographs , though none of them are of henriette on 25 february 1980 , roland barthes was knocked down by a laundry van while walking home through the streets of paris one month later , on 26 march , he died from the chest injuries he sustained in the accident barthes 's earliest ideas reacted to the trend of existentialist philosophy that was prominent in france during the 1940s , specifically to the figurehead of existentialism , jean-paul sartre instead , form , or what barthes calls '' writing '' ( the specific way an individual chooses to manipulate conventions of style for a desired effect ) , is the unique and creative act in michelet , a critical analysis of the french historian jules michelet , barthes developed these notions , applying them to a broader range of fields in studying his writings , he continued , one should not seek to learn from michelet 's claims ; rather , one should maintain a critical distance and learn from his errors , since understanding how and why his thinking is flawed will show more about his period of history than his own observations for example , barthes cited the portrayal of wine in french society he found semiotics , the study of signs , useful in these interrogations he suggested that the construction of myths results in two levels of signification : the '' language-object '' , a first order linguistic system ; and the '' metalanguage '' , the second-order system transmitting the myth '' a picture of a full , dark bottle is a signifier that relates to a specific signified : a fermented , alcoholic beverage these insights brought barthes in line with similar marxist theory barthes used the term '' myth '' while analyzing the popular , consumer culture of post-war france in order to reveal that '' objects were organized into meaningful relationships via narratives that expressed collective cultural values in the end barthes 's mythologies became absorbed into bourgeois culture , as he found many third parties asking him to comment on a certain cultural phenomenon , being interested in his control over his readership that character would be an 'action ' , and consequently one of the elements that make up the narrative barthes was able to use these distinctions to evaluate how certain key 'functions ' work in forming characters by breaking down the work into such fundamental distinctions barthes was able to judge the degree of realism given functions have in forming their actions and consequently with what authenticity a narrative can be said to reflect on reality while barthes found structuralism to be a useful tool and believed that discourse of literature could be formalized , he did not believe it could become a strict scientific endeavour the post-structuralist movement and the deconstructionism of jacques derrida were testing the bounds of the structuralist theory that barthes 's work exemplified this is to say that without some regular standard of measurement , a system of criticism that references nothing outside of the actual work itself could never prove useful such thought led barthes to consider the limitations not just of signs and symbols , but also of western culture 's dependency on beliefs of constancy and ultimate standards such a society contrasts greatly to the one he dissected in mythologies , which was revealed to be always asserting a greater , more complex significance on top of the natural one in the wake of this trip barthes wrote what is largely considered to be his best-known work , the essay '' the death of the author '' ( 1968 ) barthes saw the notion of the author , or authorial authority , in the criticism of literary text as the forced projection of an ultimate meaning of the text but barthes points out that the great proliferation of meaning in language and the unknowable state of the author 's mind makes any such ultimate realization impossible as such , the whole notion of the 'knowable text ' acts as little more than another delusion of western bourgeois culture since it moves past the conventions of trying to quantify literature , but others see it as more of a transitional phase for barthes in his continuing effort to find significance in culture outside of the bourgeois norms he concludes that since meaning ca n't come from the author , it must be actively created by the reader through a process of textual analysis the codes led him to define the story as having a capacity for plurality of meaning , limited by its dependence upon strictly sequential elements ( such as a definite timeline that has to be followed by the reader and thus restricts their freedom of analysis ) a text can be reversible by avoiding the restrictive devices that sarrasine suffered from such as strict timelines and exact definitions of events he describes this as the difference between the writerly text , in which the reader is active in a creative process , and a readerly text in which they are restricted to just reading he called these two conflicting modes the doxa ( the official and unacknowledged systems of meaning by which we know culture ) and the paradox as a reaction to this , he wrote the pleasure of the text ( 1975 ) , a study that focused on a subject matter he felt was equally outside the realm of both conservative society and militant leftist thinking : hedonism barthes felt his past works , like mythologies , had suffered from this he became interested in finding the best method for creating neutral writing , and he decided to try to create a novelistic form of rhetoric that would not seek to impose its meaning on the reader the end result is one that challenges the reader 's views of social constructs of love , without trying to assert any definitive theory of meaning barthes also attempted to reinterpret the mind-body dualism theory the insights offered by an array of modern thought , including the insights of surrealism , have rendered the term obsolete roland barthes by roland barthes ( 1977 ) ( in this so-called autobiography , barthes interrogates himself as a text susan sontag , '' writing itself : on roland barthes '' , introduction to roland barthes , a barthes reader , ed

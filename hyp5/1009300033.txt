roland barthes was born on 12 november in the town of cherbourg in normandy his father , naval officer louis barthes , was killed in a battle during world war i in the north sea before barthes 's first birthday his mother , henriette barthes , and his aunt and grandmother raised him in the village of urt and the city of bayonne when barthes was eleven , his family moved to paris , though his attachment to his provincial roots would remain strong throughout his life barthes showed great promise as a student and spent the period from 1935 to 1939 at the sorbonne , where he earned a licence in classical literature his repeated physical breakdowns disrupted his academic career , affecting his studies and his ability to take qualifying examinations he received a diplôme d'études supérieures ( roughly equivalent to an ma by thesis ) from the university of paris in 1941 for his work in greek tragedy schrift , twentieth-century french philosophy : key themes and thinkers , john wiley & sons , 4 feb 2009 , p in 1948 , he returned to purely academic work , gaining numerous short-term positions at institutes in france , romania , and egypt consisting of fifty-four short essays , mostly written between 1954–1956 , mythologies were acute reflections of french popular culture ranging from an analysis on soap detergents to a dissection of popular wrestling '' remembering roland barthes , '' the nation ( 20 november 1982 ) : '' mutual friends brought us together in 1957 he came to my door in the summer of that year , disconcerted by his classes at middlebury ( teaching students unaccustomed to a visitor with no english to speak of ) and bearing , by way of introduction , a fresh-printed copy of mythologies ( michelet and writing degree zero had already been published in france , but he was not yet known in america—not even in most french departments ) '' reprinted in signs in culture : roland barthes today , edited by steven ungar and betty r many of his works challenged traditional academic views of literary criticism and of renowned figures of literature barthes 's rebuttal in criticism and truth ( 1966 ) accused the old , bourgeois criticism of a lack of concern with the finer points of language and of selective ignorance towards challenging theories , such as marxism by the late 1960s , barthes had established a reputation for himself in 1970 , barthes produced what many consider to be his most prodigious work , the dense , critical reading of balzac 's sarrasine entitled s/z in those same years he became primarily associated with the école des hautes études en sciences sociales ( ehess ) in 1975 he wrote an autobiography titled roland barthes and in 1977 he was elected to the chair of sémiologie littéraire at the collège de france his last major work , camera lucida , is partly an essay about the nature of photography and partly a meditation on photographs of his mother barthes 's earliest ideas reacted to the trend of existentialist philosophy that was prominent in france during the 1940s , specifically to the figurehead of existentialism , jean-paul sartre sartre 's what is literature ? ( 1947 ) expresses a disenchantment both with established forms of writing and more experimental , avant-garde forms , which he feels alienate readers barthes 's response was to try to discover that which may be considered unique and original in writing in writing degree zero ( 1953 ) , barthes argues that conventions inform both language and style , rendering neither purely creative instead , form , or what barthes calls '' writing '' ( the specific way an individual chooses to manipulate conventions of style for a desired effect ) , is the unique and creative act however , a writer 's form is vulnerable to becoming a convention once it has been made available to the public in michelet , a critical analysis of the french historian jules michelet , barthes developed these notions , applying them to a broader range of fields he suggested that the construction of myths results in two levels of signification : the '' language-object '' , a first order linguistic system ; and the '' metalanguage '' , the second-order system transmitting the myth barthes explained that these bourgeois cultural myths were '' second-order signs , '' or '' connotations in the end barthes 's mythologies became absorbed into bourgeois culture , as he found many third parties asking him to comment on a certain cultural phenomenon , being interested in his control over his readership this turn of events caused him to question the overall utility of demystifying culture for the masses , thinking it might be a fruitless attempt , and drove him deeper in his search for individualistic meaning in art as barthes 's work with structuralism began to flourish around the time of his debates with picard , his investigation of structure focused on revealing the importance of language in writing , which he felt was overlooked by old criticism for example , key words like 'dark ' , 'mysterious ' and 'odd ' , when integrated together , formulate a specific kind of character or 'action ' while barthes found structuralism to be a useful tool and believed that discourse of literature could be formalized , he did not believe it could become a strict scientific endeavour the post-structuralist movement and the deconstructionism of jacques derrida were testing the bounds of the structuralist theory that barthes 's work exemplified but since there are no symbols of constant and universal significance , the entire premise of structuralism as a means of evaluating writing ( or anything ) is hollow barthes saw the notion of the author , or authorial authority , in the criticism of literary text as the forced projection of an ultimate meaning of the text but barthes points out that the great proliferation of meaning in language and the unknowable state of the author 's mind makes any such ultimate realization impossible as such , the whole notion of the 'knowable text ' acts as little more than another delusion of western bourgeois culture '' the death of the author '' is considered to be a post-structuralist work , jay clayton , eric rothstein , influence and intertextuality in literary history , university of wisconsin press , 1991 , p in his s/z ( 1970 ) , barthes applies this notion in an analysis of sarrasine , a balzac novella a text can be reversible by avoiding the restrictive devices that sarrasine suffered from such as strict timelines and exact definitions of events he describes this as the difference between the writerly text , in which the reader is active in a creative process , and a readerly text in which they are restricted to just reading as a reaction to this , he wrote the pleasure of the text ( 1975 ) , a study that focused on a subject matter he felt was equally outside the realm of both conservative society and militant leftist thinking : hedonism yet at the same time the novelistic character is a sympathetic one , and is thus open not just to criticism but also understanding from the reader the end result is one that challenges the reader 's views of social constructs of love , without trying to assert any definitive theory of meaning barthes also attempted to reinterpret the mind-body dualism theory the theory , which is also described as ethico-political entity , considers the idea of the body as one that functions as a '' fashion word '' that provides the illusion of a grounded discourse this theory has influenced the work of other thinkers such as jerome bel . photography and henriette barthes many of his monthly myth articles in the 50s had attempted to show how a photographic image could represent implied meanings and thus be used by bourgeois culture to infer 'naturalistic truths ' ( 1953 ) writing degree zero ( 1954 ) michelet par lui-même ( 1957 ) mythologies , seuil : paris roland barthes by roland barthes ( 1977 ) ( in this so-called autobiography , barthes interrogates himself as a text london : routledge , 2003 réda bensmaïa , the barthes effect : the essay as reflective text , trans susan sontag , '' writing itself : on roland barthes '' , introduction to roland barthes , a barthes reader , ed roland barthes : professor of desire

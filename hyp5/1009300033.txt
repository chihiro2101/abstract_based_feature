roland barthes was born on 12 november in the town of cherbourg in normandy his father , naval officer louis barthes , was killed in a battle during world war i in the north sea before barthes 's first birthday his mother , henriette barthes , and his aunt and grandmother raised him in the village of urt and the city of bayonne when barthes was eleven , his family moved to paris , though his attachment to his provincial roots would remain strong throughout his life barthes showed great promise as a student and spent the period from 1935 to 1939 at the sorbonne , where he earned a licence in classical literature he received a diplôme d'études supérieures ( roughly equivalent to an ma by thesis ) from the university of paris in 1941 for his work in greek tragedy in 1952 , barthes settled at the centre national de la recherche scientifique , where he studied lexicology and sociology ( michelet and writing degree zero had already been published in france , but he was not yet known in america—not even in most french departments barthes spent the early 1960s exploring the fields of semiology and structuralism , chairing various faculty positions around france , and continuing to produce more full-length studies barthes continued to contribute with philippe sollers to the avant-garde literary magazine tel quel , which was developing similar kinds of theoretical inquiry to that pursued in barthes 's writings throughout the 1970s , barthes continued to develop his literary criticism ; he developed new ideals of textualism and novelistic neutrality in those same years he became primarily associated with the école des hautes études en sciences sociales ( ehess ) in 1975 he wrote an autobiography titled roland barthes and in 1977 he was elected to the chair of sémiologie littéraire at the collège de france in the same year , his mother , henriette barthes , to whom he had been devoted , died , aged 85 the loss of the woman who had raised and cared for him was a serious blow to barthes his last major work , camera lucida , is partly an essay about the nature of photography and partly a meditation on photographs of his mother barthes 's earliest ideas reacted to the trend of existentialist philosophy that was prominent in france during the 1940s , specifically to the figurehead of existentialism , jean-paul sartre barthes 's response was to try to discover that which may be considered unique and original in writing in writing degree zero ( 1953 ) , barthes argues that conventions inform both language and style , rendering neither purely creative in michelet , a critical analysis of the french historian jules michelet , barthes developed these notions , applying them to a broader range of fields in studying his writings , he continued , one should not seek to learn from michelet 's claims ; rather , one should maintain a critical distance and learn from his errors , since understanding how and why his thinking is flawed will show more about his period of history than his own observations similarly , barthes felt that avant-garde writing should be praised for its maintenance of just such a distance between its audience and itself in this sense , barthes believed that art should be critical and should interrogate the world , rather than seek to explain it , as michelet had done barthes 's many monthly contributions , collected in his mythologies ( 1957 ) , frequently interrogated specific cultural materials in order to expose how bourgeois society asserted its values through them for example , barthes cited the portrayal of wine in french society the former pertains to the literal or explicit meaning of things while the latter is composed of the language used to speak about the first order in the end barthes 's mythologies became absorbed into bourgeois culture , as he found many third parties asking him to comment on a certain cultural phenomenon , being interested in his control over his readership as barthes 's work with structuralism began to flourish around the time of his debates with picard , his investigation of structure focused on revealing the importance of language in writing , which he felt was overlooked by old criticism barthes split this work into three hierarchical levels : 'functions ' , 'actions ' and 'narrative ' for example , key words like 'dark ' , 'mysterious ' and 'odd ' , when integrated together , formulate a specific kind of character or 'action ' by breaking down the work into such fundamental distinctions barthes was able to judge the degree of realism given functions have in forming their actions and consequently with what authenticity a narrative can be said to reflect on reality thus , his structuralist theorizing became another exercise in his ongoing attempts to dissect and expose the misleading mechanisms of bourgeois culture this is to say that without some regular standard of measurement , a system of criticism that references nothing outside of the actual work itself could never prove useful as such , barthes reflects on the ability of signs in japan to exist for their own merit , retaining only the significance naturally imbued by their signifiers in the wake of this trip barthes wrote what is largely considered to be his best-known work , the essay '' the death of the author '' ( 1968 ) barthes saw the notion of the author , or authorial authority , in the criticism of literary text as the forced projection of an ultimate meaning of the text the end result was a reading that established five major codes for determining various kinds of significance , with numerous lexias throughout the text – a '' lexia '' here being defined as a unit of the text chosen arbitrarily ( to remain methodologically unbiased as possible ) for further analysis the codes led him to define the story as having a capacity for plurality of meaning , limited by its dependence upon strictly sequential elements ( such as a definite timeline that has to be followed by the reader and thus restricts their freedom of analysis ) he describes this as the difference between the writerly text , in which the reader is active in a creative process , and a readerly text in which they are restricted to just reading the project helped barthes identify what it was he sought in literature : an openness for interpretation in the late 1970s , barthes was increasingly concerned with the conflict of two types of language : that of popular culture , which he saw as limiting and pigeonholing in its titles and descriptions , and neutral , which he saw as open and noncommittal he called these two conflicting modes the doxa ( the official and unacknowledged systems of meaning by which we know culture ) and the paradox as a reaction to this , he wrote the pleasure of the text ( 1975 ) , a study that focused on a subject matter he felt was equally outside the realm of both conservative society and militant leftist thinking : hedonism despite this newest theory of reading , barthes remained concerned with the difficulty of achieving truly neutral writing , which required an avoidance of any labels that might carry an implied meaning or identity towards a given object yet at the same time the novelistic character is a sympathetic one , and is thus open not just to criticism but also understanding from the reader the end result is one that challenges the reader 's views of social constructs of love , without trying to assert any definitive theory of meaning like friedrich nietzsche and levinas , he also drew from eastern philosophical traditions in his critique of european culture as '' infected '' by western metaphysics the theory , which is also described as ethico-political entity , considers the idea of the body as one that functions as a '' fashion word '' that provides the illusion of a grounded discourse when his mother , henriette barthes , died in 1977 he began writing camera lucida as an attempt to explain the unique significance a picture of her as a child carried for him barthes found the solution to this fine line of personal meaning in the form of his mother 's picture as had been made physical through henriette barthes 's death , her childhood photograph is evidence of 'what has ceased to be ' because of this there is something uniquely personal contained in the photograph of barthes 's mother that can not be removed from his subjective state : the recurrent feeling of loss experienced whenever he looks at it jonathan culler , barthes : a very short introduction , oxford and new york : oxford

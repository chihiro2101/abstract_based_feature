left long considered a classical nabataean town on the ancient spice route , archaeologists are now considering the possibility that shivta was a byzantine agricultural colony and a way station for pilgrims en route to the saint catherine 's monastery in the sinai peninsula three byzantine churches ( a main church and two smaller churches ) , two wine-presses , residential areas and administrative buildings have been excavated according to the calculations of archaeologists , the nabatean/byzantine village of shivta produced about two million liters of wine in the early 6th century , grape production in the negev for the so-called vinum gazentum ( 'gaza wine ' in latin ) experiences a major boom , due to the high demand for this product throughout europe and the middle east probably as a result of these two events , international trade with luxury goods such as gaza wine almost grounded to a halt , and in shivta and other negev settlements grape production again gave way to subsistence farming , focused on barley and wheat in nearby nessana , the number of grape pips is even on the rise again during the early islamic period , probably due to the needs of a local christian monastery this seems to indicate that the wine industry of the negev could well be sustained over centuries through appropriate agricultural techniques and in spite of the arid climate , but that the grape monoculture was economically unsustainable in the long run 1 edward henry palmer came in 1870 and the following year he published the first official description , röhl ( 2010 ) , p 4 a team from the école biblique in jerusalem including famed researchers antonin jaussen , raphaël savignac and louis-hugues vincent studied a few aspects of the site in 1904 , theodor kühtreiber added a few observations in 1912 14 in 1933–38 , american archaeologist harris dunscombe colt ( from the family of revolver inventor , samuel colt ) conducted a dig at shivta 15 updates from 2018 : : in january 1938 , a suitcase , which contained artifacts , documents , and photographs from the archaeological excavations at shivta , was forgotten at the haifa port 16 in the 1960s , botanist michael evenari studied the economy of shivta and water collection in its arid environment , his methods of experimental archaeology offering important insights into subsistence farming in the negev desert

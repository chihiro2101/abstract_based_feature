the complexity class np may be viewed as a very simple proof system in this system , the verifier is a deterministic , polynomial-time machine ( a p machine ) the protocol is : the prover looks at the input and computes the solution using its unlimited power and returns a polynomial-size proof certificate in the case where a valid proof certificate exists , the prover is always able to make the verifier accept by giving it that certificate in the case where there is no valid proof certificate , however , the input is not in the language , and no prover , however malicious it is , can convince the verifier otherwise , because any proof certificate will be rejected although np may be viewed as using interaction , it was n't until 1985 that the concept of computation through interaction was conceived ( in the context of complexity theory ) by two independent groups of researchers one approach , by lászló babai , who published '' trading group theory for randomness '' , lászló babai in this presentation , arthur ( the verifier ) is a probabilistic , polynomial-time machine , while merlin ( the prover ) has unbounded resources the class ma in particular is a simple generalization of the np interaction above in which the verifier is probabilistic instead of deterministic soundness : if the string is not in the language , no prover , however malicious , will be able to convince the verifier to accept the string with probability exceeding 1/3 for example , in an ip3 protocol , the sequence would be vpvpvpv , where v is a verifier turn and p is a prover turn the result is that the verifier can not '' hide '' anything from the prover , because the prover is powerful enough to simulate everything the verifier does if it knows what random bits it used private coins versus public coins in interactive proof systems arthur–merlin games : a randomized proof system , and a hierarchy of complexity classes if we allow the elements of the system to use quantum computation , the system is called a quantum interactive proof system , and the corresponding complexity class is called qip it is known that for any constant k , a mip system with k provers and polynomially many rounds can be turned into an equivalent system with only 2 provers , and a constant number of rounds while the designers of ip considered generalizations of babai 's interactive proof systems , others considered restrictions

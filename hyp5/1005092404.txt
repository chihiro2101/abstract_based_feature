when a statutory instrument is required a statutory instrument is used when an act of parliament passed after 1947 confers a power to make , confirm or approve delegated legislation on : the queen and states that it is to be exercisable by order in council ; or a minister of the crown and states that it is to be exercisable by statutory instrument minister of the crown includes the welsh ministers statutory instruments act 1946 , section 1a , substituted by section 160 ( 1 ) and schedule 10 , paragraph 1 of the government of wales act 2006 and various acts provide that delegated legislation , although made by another person ( for example , the general dental council dentists act 1984 , section 45 ) , is also to be made by statutory instrument often the minister authorised to issue a statutory instrument is '' the secretary of state '' , which the interpretation act 1978 defines as '' one of her majesty 's principal secretaries of state '' ; this form effectively allows the prime minister to create new departments and define or redefine their responsibilities at will a statutory instrument is also used when the queen in council or a minister exercises a power under an act passed before 1947 which is legislative , rather than executive , in character statutory instruments act 1946 , section 1 ( 2 ) use of a statutory instrument is not required where the parent act does not specify it the main effect of delegated legislation being made by statutory instrument is that it is effective as soon as it is made , numbered , catalogued , printed , made available for sale statutory instruments act 1946 , section 2 and published on the internet published at the uk national archives this ensures that the public has easy access to the new laws ( s n ) : scottish series : instruments made by the united kingdom government which apply to scotland only ( these are different from scottish statutory instruments made by the scottish government under its devolved powers ) ( ni n ) : northern ireland series : orders in council made by the united kingdom government under its '' direct rule '' powers ( delegated legislation made by northern ireland departments is made by statutory rules ) most statutory instruments ( sis ) are subject to one of two forms of control by parliament , depending on what is specified in the parent act whether or not a statutory instrument is subject to affirmative or negative resolution procedure is dictated by the parent act this requires that the instrument is either : laid before parliament in draft , and can be made once 40 days ( excluding any time during which parliament is dissolved or prorogued , or during which both houses are adjourned for more than four days ) have passed unless either house passes a resolution disapproving it , or laid before parliament after it is made ( but before it comes into force ) , but will be revoked if either house passes a resolution annulling it within 40 days anything done under the instrument whilst it was in force remains valid , and the government is free to make a new statutory instrument the parent act may require that the proposed statutory instrument be approved by both houses of parliament ( or , in the case of an instrument which relates to financial matters , by the house of commons only ) either : before it is made ( i.e if it does , it then lays a draft order before parliament along with an explanation of any changes made , which is again considered by the committees before finally being put to a vote of each house for approval in addition , the house of commons may refer a statutory instrument to a standing committee for detailed debate on the merits of the legislation if a motion to annul ( in the case of an instrument subject to negative resolution ) or approve ( in the case of an instrument subject to affirmative resolution ) is made as with all delegated legislation , because statutory instruments are made by a person exercising a power conferred by an act of parliament for a specified purpose , rather than by parliament exercising its sovereign law-making powers , they can be struck down by the courts if it is concluded that they are ultra vires ( literally , '' beyond the powers '' conferred by the parent act ) this would be the case if the government attempts to use delegated legislation for a purpose not envisioned by the parent act , or if the legislation is an unreasonable use of the power conferred by the act , or if pre-conditions imposed by the act ( for example , consultation with certain organisations ) have not been satisfied

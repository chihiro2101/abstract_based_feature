when a statutory instrument is required a statutory instrument is used when an act of parliament passed after 1947 confers a power to make , confirm or approve delegated legislation on : the queen and states that it is to be exercisable by order in council ; or a minister of the crown and states that it is to be exercisable by statutory instrument minister of the crown includes the welsh ministers statutory instruments act 1946 , section 1a , substituted by section 160 ( 1 ) and schedule 10 , paragraph 1 of the government of wales act 2006 and various acts provide that delegated legislation , although made by another person ( for example , the general dental council dentists act 1984 , section 45 ) , is also to be made by statutory instrument often the minister authorised to issue a statutory instrument is '' the secretary of state '' , which the interpretation act 1978 defines as '' one of her majesty 's principal secretaries of state '' ; this form effectively allows the prime minister to create new departments and define or redefine their responsibilities at will a statutory instrument is also used when the queen in council or a minister exercises a power under an act passed before 1947 which is legislative , rather than executive , in character statutory instruments act 1946 , section 1 ( 2 ) use of a statutory instrument is not required where the parent act does not specify it the main effect of delegated legislation being made by statutory instrument is that it is effective as soon as it is made , numbered , catalogued , printed , made available for sale statutory instruments act 1946 , section 2 and published on the internet so , for example , the income tax ( exemption of minor benefits ) ( amendment ) regulations 2003 are numbered and may be cited as si 2003 no ( s n ) : scottish series : instruments made by the united kingdom government which apply to scotland only ( these are different from scottish statutory instruments made by the scottish government under its devolved powers ) ( ni n ) : northern ireland series : orders in council made by the united kingdom government under its '' direct rule '' powers ( delegated legislation made by northern ireland departments is made by statutory rules ) ( w n ) : national assembly for wales series : statutory instruments made by the national assembly for wales and applying to wales only whether or not a statutory instrument is subject to affirmative or negative resolution procedure is dictated by the parent act statutory instruments act 1946 , section 5 ( 1 ) the last occasion on which a statutory instrument was annulled was on 22 february 2000 , when the house of lords passed a motion to annul the greater london authority elections rules the parent act may require that the proposed statutory instrument be approved by both houses of parliament ( or , in the case of an instrument which relates to financial matters , by the house of commons only ) either : before it is made ( i.e the last time a draft statutory instrument subject to affirmative procedure was not approved by the house of commons was on 12 november 1969 when the house rejected four draft orders relating to parliamentary constituencies select committees of both houses then debate the proposal and examine it against criteria including maintenance of '' necessary protection '' for those who may be affected , the adequacy of public consultation , the extent of the burden to be lifted , financial implications and compliance with european law the joint committee may draw the attention of both houses to an instrument if it : imposes a cost on the public finances , requires payments of fees to a public authority , is made under powers which prevent it from being challenged in the courts , attempts to have retrospective effect ( i.e many statutory instruments ( indeed , the largest group after those subject to the negative resolution procedure ) are not required to be laid before parliament at all , and are therefore not subject to any parliamentary control this would be the case if the government attempts to use delegated legislation for a purpose not envisioned by the parent act , or if the legislation is an unreasonable use of the power conferred by the act , or if pre-conditions imposed by the act ( for example , consultation with certain organisations ) have not been satisfied

when a statutory instrument is required a statutory instrument is used when an act of parliament passed after 1947 confers a power to make , confirm or approve delegated legislation on : the queen and states that it is to be exercisable by order in council ; or a minister of the crown and states that it is to be exercisable by statutory instrument often the minister authorised to issue a statutory instrument is '' the secretary of state '' , which the interpretation act 1978 defines as '' one of her majesty 's principal secretaries of state '' ; this form effectively allows the prime minister to create new departments and define or redefine their responsibilities at will a statutory instrument is also used when the queen in council or a minister exercises a power under an act passed before 1947 which is legislative , rather than executive , in character statutory instruments act 1946 , section 1 ( 2 ) use of a statutory instrument is not required where the parent act does not specify it the main effect of delegated legislation being made by statutory instrument is that it is effective as soon as it is made , numbered , catalogued , printed , made available for sale statutory instruments act 1946 , section 2 and published on the internet ( s n ) : scottish series : instruments made by the united kingdom government which apply to scotland only ( these are different from scottish statutory instruments made by the scottish government under its devolved powers ) ( ni n ) : northern ireland series : orders in council made by the united kingdom government under its '' direct rule '' powers ( delegated legislation made by northern ireland departments is made by statutory rules ) ( w n ) : national assembly for wales series : statutory instruments made by the national assembly for wales and applying to wales only statutory instruments will be classified by subject heading in the annual edition printed by her majesty 's stationery office most statutory instruments ( sis ) are subject to one of two forms of control by parliament , depending on what is specified in the parent act anything done under the instrument whilst it was in force remains valid , and the government is free to make a new statutory instrument statutory instruments act 1946 , section 5 ( 1 ) the last occasion on which a statutory instrument was annulled was on 22 february 2000 , when the house of lords passed a motion to annul the greater london authority elections rules the draft parliamentary constituencies ( england ) order 1969 , the draft parliamentary constituencies ( wales ) order 1969 , the draft parliamentary constituencies ( scotland ) order 1969 and the draft parliamentary constituencies ( northern ireland ) order after the 60 days have passed , the government may then lay a draft order before parliament , following which there is another 60-day period in which the joint committee will make a recommendation to both houses whether the order should be approved some statutory instruments are made under provisions of acts which allow the instrument to change the parent act itself , or to change other primary legislation the joint committee on statutory instruments ( a committee of both houses of parliament ) checks that an instrument is being made in accordance with the powers granted to the minister making it in addition , the house of commons may refer a statutory instrument to a standing committee for detailed debate on the merits of the legislation if a motion to annul ( in the case of an instrument subject to negative resolution ) or approve ( in the case of an instrument subject to affirmative resolution ) is made many statutory instruments ( indeed , the largest group after those subject to the negative resolution procedure ) are not required to be laid before parliament at all , and are therefore not subject to any parliamentary control

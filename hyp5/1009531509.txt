leopold could not meet the costs of running the congo free state the first change was the introduction of the concept of terres vacantes , '' vacant '' land , which was any land that did not contain a habitation or a cultivated garden plot servants of the state ( namely any men in leopold 's employ ) were encouraged to exploit it shortly after the anti-slavery conference he held in brussels in 1889 , leopold issued a new decree which said that africans could only sell their harvested products ( mostly ivory and rubber ) to the state in a large part of the free state any ivory or rubber collected from the state-owned land , the reasoning went , must belong to the state ; creating a de facto state-controlled monopoly suddenly , the only outlet a large share of the local population had for their products was the state , which could set purchase prices and therefore could control the amount of income the congolese could receive for their work however , for local elites this system presented new opportunities as the free state and concession companies paid them with guns to tax their subjects in kind trading companies began to lose out to the free state government , which not only paid no taxes but also collected all the potential income these companies were outraged by the restrictions on free trade , which the berlin act had so carefully protected years before as essential intermediaries , local rulers forced their men , women and children to collect rubber , ivory and foodstuffs depending on the power of local rulers , the free state paid below rising market prices '' the economics of the kwango rubber trade c angola on the move : transport routes , communications and history each company was given a large amount of land in the congo free state on which to collect rubber and ivory for sale in europe these companies were allowed to detain africans who did not work hard enough , to police their vast areas as they saw fit and to take all the products of the forest for themselves at the height of the rubber boom , from 1901 until 1906 , these dividends also filled the royal coffers the other zone—almost two-thirds of the congo—became the domaine privé , the exclusive private property of the state in 1893 , leopold excised the most readily accessible portion of the free trade zone and declared it to be the domaine de la couronne , literally , '' fief of the crown '' rubber revenue went directly to leopold who paid the free state for the high costs of exploitation '' combien le congo à-t-il coûté à la belgique '' from that year onwards , the congolese rubber sector started to generate vast sums of money at an immense cost for the local population msiri tried to play the free state off against rhodes and when negotiations bogged down , stairs flew the free state flag anyway and gave msiri an ultimatum stairs sent a force to capture him but msiri stood his ground , whereupon captain omer bodson shot msiri dead and was fatally wounded in the resulting fight the expedition cut off msiri 's head and put it on a pole , as he had often done to his enemies this was to impress upon the locals that msiri 's rule had really ended , after which the successor chief recognized by stairs signed the treaty initially the authority of the congo free state was relatively weak in the eastern regions of the congo both leopold ii and barghash bin said agreed and on february 24 , 1887 , tippu tip accepted leopold ii was heavily criticized by the european public opinion for his dealings with tippu tip in belgium , the belgian anti-slavery society was founded in 1888 , mainly by catholic intellectuals led by count hippolyte d'ursel , aimed at abolishing the arab slave trade every person that tippu tip hunted down and put into chattel slavery and every pound of ivory he exported to zanzibar was a loss to leopold ii this , and leopold 's humanitarian pledges to the berlin conference to end slavery , meant war was inevitable both sides fought by proxy , arming and leading the populations of the upper congo forests in conflict by early 1894 the zanzibari/swahili slavers were defeated in the eastern congo region and the congo arab war came to an end nonetheless , chaltin continued his advance , and on 17 february 1897 , his outnumbered forces defeated the rebels in the battle of rejaf , securing the lado enclave as a belgian territory until leopold 's death in 1909 leopold 's conquest of the lado enclave met with approval from the british government , at least initially , which welcomed any aid in their ongoing war with mahdist sudan after widespread criticism , this '' primes system '' was substituted for the allocation de retraite in which a large part of the payment was granted , at the end of the service , only to those territorial agents and magistrates whose conduct was judged '' satisfactory '' by their superiors in terms of infrastructure , leopold 's regime began construction of the railway that ran from the coast to the capital of leopoldville ( now kinshasa ) to monopolize the resources of the entire congo free state , leopold issued three decrees in 1891 and 1892 that reduced the native population to serfs collectively , these forced the natives to deliver all ivory and rubber , harvested or found , to state officers thus nearly completing leopold 's monopoly of the ivory and rubber trade the rubber came from wild vines in the jungle , unlike the rubber from brazil ( hevea brasiliensis ) , which was tapped from trees to extract the rubber , instead of tapping the vines , the congolese workers would slash them and lather their bodies with the rubber latex the force publique ( fp ) , leopold 's private army , was used to enforce the rubber quotas early on , the fp was used primarily to campaign against the arab slave trade in the upper congo , protect leopold 's economic interests , and suppress the frequent uprisings within the state on arriving in the congo , these recruited men from zanzibar and west africa , and eventually from the congo itself during the 1890s , the fp 's primary role was to exploit the natives as corvée laborers to promote the rubber trade the human hands were collected as trophies on the orders of their officers to show that bullets had not been wasted this was all contrary to the promises of uplift made at the berlin conference which had recognized the congo free state a village which refused to provide rubber would be completely swept clean the people who were demanded for the forced labour gangs ; and the force publique soldiers were paid their bonuses on the basis of how many hands they collected ( 1904 ) king leopold 's rule in africa p 25 others argued a decrease of 20 percent over the first forty years of colonial rule ( up to the census of 1924 ) one of the main ways england was involved in ending leopold ii of belgium ’ s rule in the congo , was by making belgium , as a whole , more aware of the brutality present in the congo leopold ii offered to reform his congo free state regime , but international opinion supported an end to the king 's rule , and no nation was willing to accept this responsibility just prior to releasing sovereignty over the cfs , leopold had all evidence of his activities in the cfs destroyed , including the archives of the departments of finance and of the interior the order of the crown , originally created in 1897 , rewarded heroic deeds and service achieved while serving in the congo free state archive congo free state , royal museum of central africa

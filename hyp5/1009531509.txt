leopold could not meet the costs of running the congo free state the first change was the introduction of the concept of terres vacantes , '' vacant '' land , which was any land that did not contain a habitation or a cultivated garden plot servants of the state ( namely any men in leopold 's employ ) were encouraged to exploit it shortly after the anti-slavery conference he held in brussels in 1889 , leopold issued a new decree which said that africans could only sell their harvested products ( mostly ivory and rubber ) to the state in a large part of the free state this law grew out of the earlier decree which had said that all '' unoccupied '' land belonged to the state any ivory or rubber collected from the state-owned land , the reasoning went , must belong to the state ; creating a de facto state-controlled monopoly these companies were outraged by the restrictions on free trade , which the berlin act had so carefully protected years before their protests against the violation of free trade prompted leopold to take another , less obvious tack to make money the domainal system enforced an in-kind tax on the free state 's congolese subjects as essential intermediaries , local rulers forced their men , women and children to collect rubber , ivory and foodstuffs depending on the power of local rulers , the free state paid below rising market prices angola on the move : transport routes , communications and history in return for their concessions , these companies paid an annual dividend to the free state at the height of the rubber boom , from 1901 until 1906 , these dividends also filled the royal coffers the free trade zone in the congo was open to entrepreneurs of any european nation , who were allowed to buy 10- & nbsp ; and 15-year monopoly leases on anything of value : ivory from a district or the rubber concession , for example the other zone—almost two-thirds of the congo—became the domaine privé , the exclusive private property of the state in 1893 , leopold excised the most readily accessible portion of the free trade zone and declared it to be the domaine de la couronne , literally , '' fief of the crown '' rubber revenue went directly to leopold who paid the free state for the high costs of exploitation bruxelles : académie royale des sciences coloniale 1957 from that year onwards , the congolese rubber sector started to generate vast sums of money at an immense cost for the local population msiri tried to play the free state off against rhodes and when negotiations bogged down , stairs flew the free state flag anyway and gave msiri an ultimatum stairs sent a force to capture him but msiri stood his ground , whereupon captain omer bodson shot msiri dead and was fatally wounded in the resulting fight this was to impress upon the locals that msiri 's rule had really ended , after which the successor chief recognized by stairs signed the treaty initially the authority of the congo free state was relatively weak in the eastern regions of the congo leopold ii was heavily criticized by the european public opinion for his dealings with tippu tip in belgium , the belgian anti-slavery society was founded in 1888 , mainly by catholic intellectuals led by count hippolyte d'ursel , aimed at abolishing the arab slave trade every person that tippu tip hunted down and put into chattel slavery and every pound of ivory he exported to zanzibar was a loss to leopold ii both sides fought by proxy , arming and leading the populations of the upper congo forests in conflict by early 1894 the zanzibari/swahili slavers were defeated in the eastern congo region and the congo arab war came to an end the second , a much smaller force of only eight-hundred , was led by louis-napoléon chaltin and took the main road towards rejaf this project , known today as the matadi–kinshasa railway , took years to complete by the final decade of the 19th century , john boyd dunlop ’ s 1887 invention of inflatable , rubber bicycle tubes and the growing popularity of the automobile dramatically increased global demand for rubber to monopolize the resources of the entire congo free state , leopold issued three decrees in 1891 and 1892 that reduced the native population to serfs collectively , these forced the natives to deliver all ivory and rubber , harvested or found , to state officers thus nearly completing leopold 's monopoly of the ivory and rubber trade early on , the fp was used primarily to campaign against the arab slave trade in the upper congo , protect leopold 's economic interests , and suppress the frequent uprisings within the state armed with modern weapons and the chicotte—a bull whip made of hippopotamus hide—the force publique routinely took and tortured hostages , slaughtered families of rebels , and flogged and raped congolese people with a reign of terror and abuse that cost millions of lives one refugee from these horrors described the process : we were always in the forest to find the rubber vines , to go without food , and our women had to give up cultivating the fields and gardens they also burned recalcitrant villages , and above all , cut off the hands of congolese natives , including children officers were concerned that their subordinates might waste their ammunition on hunting animals for sport , so they required soldiers to submit one hand for every bullet spent this was all contrary to the promises of uplift made at the berlin conference which had recognized the congo free state as a consequence , the rubber quotas were in part paid off in chopped-off hands sometimes the hands were collected by the soldiers of the force publique , sometimes by the villages themselves there were even small wars where villages attacked neighboring villages to gather hands , since their rubber quotas were too unrealistic to fill rubber causes these torments ; that 's why we no longer want to hear its name spoken they kill us if we do n't bring the rubber in forbath 's words : the baskets of severed hands , set down at the feet of the european post commanders , became the symbol of the congo free state force publique soldiers brought them to the stations in place of rubber ; they even went out to harvest them instead of rubber morel , the congo free state counted '' 20 million souls '' ( 1904 ) king leopold 's rule in africa ( 1905 ) king leopold ’ s soliloquy a defense of his congo rule prices increased throughout the decade as industries discovered new uses for rubber in tires , hoses , tubing , insulation for telegraph and telephone cables and wiring roger casement , then the british consul at boma ( at the mouth of the congo river ) , was sent to the congo free state to investigate the order was made a decoration of the belgian state with the abolition of the congo free state in 1908 and is still awarded today emile de laveleye , leopold ii and the creation of the congo free state , in : belgisch tijdschrift voor nieuwste geschiedenis , 2011 , blz the reports of the congo reform association , particularly the '' memorial on the present phase of the congo question '' ( london , 1912 ) the congo report of commission of inquiry ( new york , 1906 ) burrows , guy and edgar canisius , the curse of central africa

leopold could not meet the costs of running the congo free state desperately , he set in motion a system to maximize revenue the first change was the introduction of the concept of terres vacantes , '' vacant '' land , which was any land that did not contain a habitation or a cultivated garden plot shortly after the anti-slavery conference he held in brussels in 1889 , leopold issued a new decree which said that africans could only sell their harvested products ( mostly ivory and rubber ) to the state in a large part of the free state this law grew out of the earlier decree which had said that all '' unoccupied '' land belonged to the state suddenly , the only outlet a large share of the local population had for their products was the state , which could set purchase prices and therefore could control the amount of income the congolese could receive for their work however , for local elites this system presented new opportunities as the free state and concession companies paid them with guns to tax their subjects in kind trading companies began to lose out to the free state government , which not only paid no taxes but also collected all the potential income their protests against the violation of free trade prompted leopold to take another , less obvious tack to make money depending on the power of local rulers , the free state paid below rising market prices each company was given a large amount of land in the congo free state on which to collect rubber and ivory for sale in europe these companies were allowed to detain africans who did not work hard enough , to police their vast areas as they saw fit and to take all the products of the forest for themselves in return for their concessions , these companies paid an annual dividend to the free state in 1893 , leopold excised the most readily accessible portion of the free trade zone and declared it to be the domaine de la couronne , literally , '' fief of the crown '' rubber revenue went directly to leopold who paid the free state for the high costs of exploitation '' combien le congo à-t-il coûté à la belgique '' bruxelles : académie royale des sciences coloniale 1957 , to take possession of katanga one way or another bennett and brode in the longer term this alliance was indefensible at home and abroad in belgium , the belgian anti-slavery society was founded in 1888 , mainly by catholic intellectuals led by count hippolyte d'ursel , aimed at abolishing the arab slave trade every person that tippu tip hunted down and put into chattel slavery and every pound of ivory he exported to zanzibar was a loss to leopold ii this , and leopold 's humanitarian pledges to the berlin conference to end slavery , meant war was inevitable after rubber profits soared in 1895 , leopold ordered the organization of an expedition into the lado enclave , which had been overrun by mahdist rebels since the outbreak of the mahdist war in 1881 the second , a much smaller force of only eight-hundred , was led by louis-napoléon chaltin and took the main road towards rejaf the congo state : or , the growth of civilisation in central africa district officials ' salaries were reduced to a bare minimum , and made up with a commission payment based on the profit that their area returned to leopold to monopolize the resources of the entire congo free state , leopold issued three decrees in 1891 and 1892 that reduced the native population to serfs collectively , these forced the natives to deliver all ivory and rubber , harvested or found , to state officers thus nearly completing leopold 's monopoly of the ivory and rubber trade the rubber came from wild vines in the jungle , unlike the rubber from brazil ( hevea brasiliensis ) , which was tapped from trees to extract the rubber , instead of tapping the vines , the congolese workers would slash them and lather their bodies with the rubber latex the force publique ( fp ) , leopold 's private army , was used to enforce the rubber quotas early on , the fp was used primarily to campaign against the arab slave trade in the upper congo , protect leopold 's economic interests , and suppress the frequent uprisings within the state the force publique 's officer corps included only white europeans ( belgian regular soldiers and mercenaries from other countries ) on arriving in the congo , these recruited men from zanzibar and west africa , and eventually from the congo itself in addition , leopold had been actually encouraging the slave trade among arabs in the upper congo in return for slaves to fill the ranks of the fp during the 1890s , the fp 's primary role was to exploit the natives as corvée laborers to promote the rubber trade many of the black soldiers were from far-off peoples of the upper congo , while others had been kidnapped in raids on villages in their childhood and brought to roman catholic missions , where they received a military training in conditions close to slavery one refugee from these horrors described the process : we were always in the forest to find the rubber vines , to go without food , and our women had to give up cultivating the fields and gardens then we starved & nbsp ; when we failed and our rubber was short , the soldiers came to our towns and killed us the human hands were collected as trophies on the orders of their officers to show that bullets had not been wasted failure to meet the rubber collection quotas was punishable by death meanwhile , the force publique were required to provide the hand of their victims as proof when they had shot and killed someone , as it was believed that they would otherwise use the munitions ( imported from europe at considerable cost ) for hunting as a consequence , the rubber quotas were in part paid off in chopped-off hands sometimes the hands were collected by the soldiers of the force publique , sometimes by the villages themselves a catholic priest quotes a man , tswambe , speaking of the hated state official léon fiévez , who ran a district along the river north of pool malebo : all blacks saw this man as the devil of the equator a village which refused to provide rubber would be completely swept clean hochschild , king leopold 's ghost , 166 one junior officer described a raid to punish a village that had protested the officer in command '' ordered us to cut off the heads of the men and hang them on the village palisades a reduction of the population of the congo is noted by all who have compared the country at the beginning of leopold 's control with the beginning of belgian state rule in 1908 , but estimates of the death toll vary considerably this letter was a key factor in the propaganda struggle over conditions in the congo . belgian annexation of the congo free state as

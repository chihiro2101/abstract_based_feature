leopold could not meet the costs of running the congo free state the first change was the introduction of the concept of terres vacantes , '' vacant '' land , which was any land that did not contain a habitation or a cultivated garden plot , most of the country ) was therefore deemed to belong to the state servants of the state ( namely any men in leopold 's employ ) were encouraged to exploit it shortly after the anti-slavery conference he held in brussels in 1889 , leopold issued a new decree which said that africans could only sell their harvested products ( mostly ivory and rubber ) to the state in a large part of the free state any ivory or rubber collected from the state-owned land , the reasoning went , must belong to the state ; creating a de facto state-controlled monopoly suddenly , the only outlet a large share of the local population had for their products was the state , which could set purchase prices and therefore could control the amount of income the congolese could receive for their work however , for local elites this system presented new opportunities as the free state and concession companies paid them with guns to tax their subjects in kind trading companies began to lose out to the free state government , which not only paid no taxes but also collected all the potential income these companies were outraged by the restrictions on free trade , which the berlin act had so carefully protected years before their protests against the violation of free trade prompted leopold to take another , less obvious tack to make money a decree in 1892 divided the terres vacantes into a domainal system , which privatized extraction rights over rubber for the state in certain private domains , allowing leopold to grant vast concessions to private companies in other areas , private companies could continue to trade but were highly restricted and taxed the domainal system enforced an in-kind tax on the free state 's congolese subjects depending on the power of local rulers , the free state paid below rising market prices each company was given a large amount of land in the congo free state on which to collect rubber and ivory for sale in europe these companies were allowed to detain africans who did not work hard enough , to police their vast areas as they saw fit and to take all the products of the forest for themselves the free trade zone in the congo was open to entrepreneurs of any european nation , who were allowed to buy 10- & nbsp ; and 15-year monopoly leases on anything of value : ivory from a district or the rubber concession , for example the other zone—almost two-thirds of the congo—became the domaine privé , the exclusive private property of the state rubber revenue went directly to leopold who paid the free state for the high costs of exploitation the same rules applied as in the domaine privé msiri tried to play the free state off against rhodes and when negotiations bogged down , stairs flew the free state flag anyway and gave msiri an ultimatum both leopold ii and barghash bin said agreed and on february 24 , 1887 , tippu tip accepted in belgium , the belgian anti-slavery society was founded in 1888 , mainly by catholic intellectuals led by count hippolyte d'ursel , aimed at abolishing the arab slave trade every person that tippu tip hunted down and put into chattel slavery and every pound of ivory he exported to zanzibar was a loss to leopold ii this , and leopold 's humanitarian pledges to the berlin conference to end slavery , meant war was inevitable by early 1894 the zanzibari/swahili slavers were defeated in the eastern congo region and the congo arab war came to an end after rubber profits soared in 1895 , leopold ordered the organization of an expedition into the lado enclave , which had been overrun by mahdist rebels since the outbreak of the mahdist war in 1881 the second , a much smaller force of only eight-hundred , was led by louis-napoléon chaltin and took the main road towards rejaf the congo state : or , the growth of civilisation in central africa leopold 's conquest of the lado enclave met with approval from the british government , at least initially , which welcomed any aid in their ongoing war with mahdist sudan . economy during leopold 's rule in terms of infrastructure , leopold 's regime began construction of the railway that ran from the coast to the capital of leopoldville ( now kinshasa ) to monopolize the resources of the entire congo free state , leopold issued three decrees in 1891 and 1892 that reduced the native population to serfs collectively , these forced the natives to deliver all ivory and rubber , harvested or found , to state officers thus nearly completing leopold 's monopoly of the ivory and rubber trade to extract the rubber , instead of tapping the vines , the congolese workers would slash them and lather their bodies with the rubber latex early on , the fp was used primarily to campaign against the arab slave trade in the upper congo , protect leopold 's economic interests , and suppress the frequent uprisings within the state the force publique 's officer corps included only white europeans ( belgian regular soldiers and mercenaries from other countries ) on arriving in the congo , these recruited men from zanzibar and west africa , and eventually from the congo itself in addition , leopold had been actually encouraging the slave trade among arabs in the upper congo in return for slaves to fill the ranks of the fp many of the black soldiers were from far-off peoples of the upper congo , while others had been kidnapped in raids on villages in their childhood and brought to roman catholic missions , where they received a military training in conditions close to slavery one refugee from these horrors described the process : we were always in the forest to find the rubber vines , to go without food , and our women had to give up cultivating the fields and gardens when we failed and our rubber was short , the soldiers came to our towns and killed us they also burned recalcitrant villages , and above all , cut off the hands of congolese natives , including children this was all contrary to the promises of uplift made at the berlin conference which had recognized the congo free state storyofthecongofreestate 172b.jpg congolese people working at the port of leopoldville

were required to provide the hand of their victims as proof when they had shot and killed someone , as it was believed that they would otherwise use the munitions ( imported from europe at considerable cost ) for hunting sometimes the hands were collected by the soldiers of the force publique , sometimes by the villages themselves a catholic priest quotes a man , tswambe , speaking of the hated state official léon fiévez , who ran a district along the river north of pool malebo : all blacks saw this man as the devil of the equator he wanted to see the number of hands cut off by

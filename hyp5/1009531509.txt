leopold could not meet the costs of running the congo free state the first change was the introduction of the concept of terres vacantes , '' vacant '' land , which was any land that did not contain a habitation or a cultivated garden plot servants of the state ( namely any men in leopold 's employ ) were encouraged to exploit it any ivory or rubber collected from the state-owned land , the reasoning went , must belong to the state ; creating a de facto state-controlled monopoly suddenly , the only outlet a large share of the local population had for their products was the state , which could set purchase prices and therefore could control the amount of income the congolese could receive for their work however , for local elites this system presented new opportunities as the free state and concession companies paid them with guns to tax their subjects in kind trading companies began to lose out to the free state government , which not only paid no taxes but also collected all the potential income these companies were outraged by the restrictions on free trade , which the berlin act had so carefully protected years before their protests against the violation of free trade prompted leopold to take another , less obvious tack to make money a decree in 1892 divided the terres vacantes into a domainal system , which privatized extraction rights over rubber for the state in certain private domains , allowing leopold to grant vast concessions to private companies in other areas , private companies could continue to trade but were highly restricted and taxed the domainal system enforced an in-kind tax on the free state 's congolese subjects as essential intermediaries , local rulers forced their men , women and children to collect rubber , ivory and foodstuffs depending on the power of local rulers , the free state paid below rising market prices frankfurt am main , lembeck : 85–98 at the height of the rubber boom , from 1901 until 1906 , these dividends also filled the royal coffers the free trade zone in the congo was open to entrepreneurs of any european nation , who were allowed to buy 10- & nbsp ; and 15-year monopoly leases on anything of value : ivory from a district or the rubber concession , for example rubber revenue went directly to leopold who paid the free state for the high costs of exploitation from that year onwards , the congolese rubber sector started to generate vast sums of money at an immense cost for the local population msiri tried to play the free state off against rhodes and when negotiations bogged down , stairs flew the free state flag anyway and gave msiri an ultimatum the expedition cut off msiri 's head and put it on a pole , as he had often done to his enemies this was to impress upon the locals that msiri 's rule had really ended , after which the successor chief recognized by stairs signed the treaty in early 1887 , henry morton stanley arrived in zanzibar and proposed that tippu tip be made governor ( wali ) of the stanley falls district both leopold ii and barghash bin said agreed and on february 24 , 1887 , tippu tip accepted bennett and brode in the longer term this alliance was indefensible at home and abroad this , and leopold 's humanitarian pledges to the berlin conference to end slavery , meant war was inevitable after rubber profits soared in 1895 , leopold ordered the organization of an expedition into the lado enclave , which had been overrun by mahdist rebels since the outbreak of the mahdist war in 1881 but frequent raids outside of lado territory by belgian congolese forces based in rejaf caused alarm and suspicion among british and french officials wary of leopold 's imperial ambitions . economy during leopold 's rule while the war against african powers was ending , the quest for income was increasing , fueled by the aire policy district officials ' salaries were reduced to a bare minimum , and made up with a commission payment based on the profit that their area returned to leopold after widespread criticism , this '' primes system '' was substituted for the allocation de retraite in which a large part of the payment was granted , at the end of the service , only to those territorial agents and magistrates whose conduct was judged '' satisfactory '' by their superiors by the final decade of the 19th century , john boyd dunlop ’ s 1887 invention of inflatable , rubber bicycle tubes and the growing popularity of the automobile dramatically increased global demand for rubber to monopolize the resources of the entire congo free state , leopold issued three decrees in 1891 and 1892 that reduced the native population to serfs the rubber came from wild vines in the jungle , unlike the rubber from brazil ( hevea brasiliensis ) , which was tapped from trees to extract the rubber , instead of tapping the vines , the congolese workers would slash them and lather their bodies with the rubber latex on arriving in the congo , these recruited men from zanzibar and west africa , and eventually from the congo itself in addition , leopold had been actually encouraging the slave trade among arabs in the upper congo in return for slaves to fill the ranks of the fp many were shot , some had their ears cut off ; others were tied up with ropes round their necks and taken away they also burned recalcitrant villages , and above all , cut off the hands of congolese natives , including children the human hands were collected as trophies on the orders of their officers to show that bullets had not been wasted jpg mining by the company union minière du haut katanga sometimes the hands were collected by the soldiers of the force publique , sometimes by the villages themselves there were even small wars where villages attacked neighboring villages to gather hands , since their rubber quotas were too unrealistic to fill a catholic priest quotes a man , tswambe , speaking of the hated state official léon fiévez , who ran a district along the river north of pool malebo : all blacks saw this man as the devil of the equator he wanted to see the number of hands cut off by each soldier , who had to bring them in baskets as a young man , i saw fiévez 's soldier molili , then guarding the village of boyeka , take a net , put ten arrested natives in it , attach big stones to the net , and make it tumble into the river hochschild , king leopold 's ghost , 166 one junior officer described a raid to punish a village that had protested a reduction of the population of the congo is noted by all who have compared the country at the beginning of leopold 's control with the beginning of belgian state rule in 1908 , but estimates of the death toll vary considerably louis and stengers state that population figures at the start of leopold 's control are only '' wild guesses '' , while calling e morel became a journalist and then a publisher , attempting to discredit leopold 's regime leopold ii offered to reform his congo free state regime , but international opinion supported an end to the king 's rule , and no nation was willing to accept this responsibility along with the effects of resource depletion in the congo , international commodity prices had fallen to a level that rendered congolese extraction unprofitable weisbord stated in the 2003 journal of genocide research that attempting to eliminate a portion of the population is enough to qualify as genocide under the un convention morel ( 1873–1924 ) , the congo reform association , and the history of human rights emile de laveleye , leopold ii and the creation of the congo free state , in : belgisch tijdschrift voor nieuwste geschiedenis , 2011 , blz

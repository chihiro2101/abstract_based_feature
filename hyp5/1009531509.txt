creating a de facto state-controlled monopoly suddenly , the only outlet a large share of the local population had for their products was the state , which could set purchase prices and therefore could control the amount of income the congolese could receive for their work however , for local elites this system presented new opportunities as the free state and concession companies paid them with guns to tax their subjects in kind trading companies began to lose out to the free state government , which not only paid no taxes but also collected all the potential income these companies were outraged by the restrictions on free trade , which the berlin act had so carefully protected years before their protests against the violation of free trade prompted leopold to take another , less obvious tack to make money the domainal system enforced an in-kind tax on the free state 's congolese subjects depending on the power of local rulers , the free state paid below rising market prices these companies were allowed to detain africans who did not work hard enough , to police their vast areas as they saw fit and to take all the products of the forest for themselves the free trade zone in the congo was open to entrepreneurs of any european nation , who were allowed to buy 10- & nbsp ;

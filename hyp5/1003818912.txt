during the zhou dynasty ( 1046–256 bc ) , old chinese was the spoken and written form of chinese , and was used to write classical chinese texts by the time of the tang and song dynasties ( 618–1279 ) , people began to write in their vernacular dialects in the form of bianwen and yǔlù , and the spoken language was completely distinct from the still-maintained written standard of classical chinese ( wenyanwen ) during the ming and qing ( 1368–1912 ) , vernacular language began to be used in novels , but formal writing continued to use classical chinese lower yangtze mandarin formed the standard for written vernacular chinese until it was displaced by the beijing dialect in the late qing after the may fourth movement , baihuawen became the normal written form of chinese while the phonology of modern standard chinese is based on that of beijing , its grammar is officially based on the exemplary works of vernacular literature , which excludes certain colloquial or 'extreme ' forms while incorporating some constructions from classical chinese ( see below ) literature in vernacular mandarin and the modern written language since the late 1920s , nearly all chinese newspapers , books , and official and legal documents have been written in vernacular chinese using the standard chinese generally , the more formal the register of vernacular chinese ; the greater the resemblance to classical chinese , and modern writing lies on a continuum between the two since the transition , it has been , however , extremely rare for a text to be written predominantly in classical chinese

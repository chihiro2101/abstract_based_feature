during the zhou dynasty ( 1046–256 bc ) , old chinese was the spoken and written form of chinese , and was used to write classical chinese texts starting from the qin ( 221 bc ) , however , spoken chinese began to evolve faster than written by the time of the tang and song dynasties ( 618–1279 ) , people began to write in their vernacular dialects in the form of bianwen and yǔlù , and the spoken language was completely distinct from the still-maintained written standard of classical chinese ( wenyanwen ) during the ming and qing ( 1368–1912 ) , vernacular language began to be used in novels , but formal writing continued to use classical chinese lower yangtze mandarin formed the standard for written vernacular chinese until it was displaced by the beijing dialect in the late qing chinese writers who spoke other dialects had to use the grammar and vocabulary of lower yangtze and beijing mandarin to make their writing understandable to the majority of chinese after the may fourth movement , baihuawen became the normal written form of chinese literature in vernacular mandarin and the modern written language since the late 1920s , nearly all chinese newspapers , books , and official and legal documents have been written in vernacular chinese using the standard chinese though it is rare to encounter fully classical texts in modern times , it is just as rare to see text of a considerable length only employ colloquial chinese resources and exclude all classical constructions and lexical items

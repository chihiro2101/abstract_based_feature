during the zhou dynasty ( 1046–256 bc ) , old chinese was the spoken and written form of chinese , and was used to write classical chinese texts starting from the qin ( 221 bc ) , however , spoken chinese began to evolve faster than written by the time of the tang and song dynasties ( 618–1279 ) , people began to write in their vernacular dialects in the form of bianwen and yǔlù , and the spoken language was completely distinct from the still-maintained written standard of classical chinese ( wenyanwen ) lower yangtze mandarin formed the standard for written vernacular chinese until it was displaced by the beijing dialect in the late qing after the may fourth movement , baihuawen became the normal written form of chinese literature in vernacular mandarin and the modern written language jin shengtan , who edited several novels in vernacular chinese in the 17th century , is widely regarded as the pioneer of literature in the vernacular style since the late 1920s , nearly all chinese newspapers , books , and official and legal documents have been written in vernacular chinese using the standard chinese since the transition , it has been , however , extremely rare for a text to be written predominantly in classical chinese until the 1970s , the legal code of the republic of china was written in classical chinese , though in a form replete with modern expressions and constructions that would have been foreign to ancient writers

jennings is the inventor and first to patent the commercial dry cleaning process known as '' dry scouring '' , on march 3 , 1821 ( patent number : us 3,306x ) modern dry cleaning 's use of non-water-based solvents to remove soil and stains from clothes was reported as early as 1855 these solvents were much less flammable than petroleum solvents and had improved cleaning power by the mid-1930s , the dry cleaning industry had adopted tetrachloroethylene ( perchloroethylene ) , or pce for short , as the solvent since 2010 , in some markets , web apps have been used to schedule low-cost home delivery for dry cleaning at this time , dry cleaning was carried out in two different machines—one for the cleaning process , and the second to remove the solvent from the garments much stricter controls on solvent emissions have ensured that all dry cleaning machines in the western world are now fully enclosed , and no solvent fumes are vented to the atmosphere in enclosed machines , solvent recovered during the drying process is returned condensed and distilled , so it can be reused to clean further loads or safely disposed of after the laundry cycle , water molecules will dry off the usage of an effective solvent coupled with mechanical friction from tumbling effectively removes stains the washing chamber contains a horizontal , perforated drum that rotates within an outer shell during the wash cycle , the chamber is filled approximately one-third full of solvent and begins to rotate , agitating the clothing during the wash cycle , the solvent in the chamber ( commonly known as the 'cage ' or 'tackle box ' ) is passed through a filtration chamber and then fed back into the 'cage ' also , garments stored in soiled condition for a long time are difficult to bring back to their original color and texture a typical wash cycle lasts for 8–15 minutes depending on the type of garments and degree of soiling during the first three minutes , solvent-soluble soils dissolve into the perchloroethylene and loose , insoluble soil comes off it takes 10–12 minutes after the loose soil has come off to remove the ground-in insoluble soil from garments a dry cleaning surfactant '' soap '' may also be added at the end of the wash cycle , the machine starts a rinse cycle where the garment load is rinsed with freshly distilled solvent dispensed from the solvent tank this pure solvent rinse prevents discoloration caused by soil particles being absorbed back onto the garment surface from the 'dirty ' working solvent until this time , the cleaning is done in normal temperature , as the solvent is never heated in dry cleaning process the air temperature is controlled to prevent heat damage to the garments modern dry cleaning machines use a closed-loop system in which the chilled air is reheated and recirculated in the early days of dry cleaning , large amounts of perchlorethylene were vented to the atmosphere because it was regarded as cheap and believed to be harmless after the aeration cycle , the garments are clean and ready for pressing and finishing over time , a thin layer of filter cake ( called '' muck '' ) accumulates on the lint filter after the lint filter , the solvent passes through an absorptive cartridge filter finally , the solvent passes through a polishing filter , which removes any soil not previously removed the clean solvent is then returned to the working solvent tank pce is the most common solvent , the '' standard '' for cleaning performance the pump increases the pressure of the liquid carbon dioxide to approximately 900 to 1500 psi dibutoxymethane ( solvonk4 ) is a bipolar solvent that removes water-based stains and oil-based stains

jennings is the inventor and first to patent the commercial dry cleaning process known as '' dry scouring '' , on march 3 , 1821 ( patent number : us 3,306x ) an early adopter of commercial '' dry laundry '' using turpentine was jolly belin in paris in 1825 modern dry cleaning 's use of non-water-based solvents to remove soil and stains from clothes was reported as early as 1855 flammability concerns led william joseph stoddard , a dry cleaner from atlanta , to develop stoddard solvent ( white spirit ) as a slightly less flammable alternative to gasoline-based solvents after world war & nbsp ; i , dry cleaners began using chlorinated solvents these solvents were much less flammable than petroleum solvents and had improved cleaning power by the mid-1930s , the dry cleaning industry had adopted tetrachloroethylene ( perchloroethylene ) , or pce for short , as the solvent dry cleaning businesses , from the perspective of the customer , are either plants or drop shops a drop shop receives garments from customers , sends them to a large plant , and then has the cleaned garment returned to the shop for collection by the customer however , running a plant requires more work for the business owner since 2010 , in some markets , web apps have been used to schedule low-cost home delivery for dry cleaning this cycle minimized the risk of fire or dangerous fumes created by the cleaning process at this time , dry cleaning was carried out in two different machinesâ€”one for the cleaning process , and the second to remove the solvent from the garments machines of this era were described as vented ; their drying exhausts were expelled to the atmosphere , the same as many modern tumble-dryer exhausts much stricter controls on solvent emissions have ensured that all dry cleaning machines in the western world are now fully enclosed , and no solvent fumes are vented to the atmosphere in enclosed machines , solvent recovered during the drying process is returned condensed and distilled , so it can be reused to clean further loads or safely disposed of in terms of mechanism , dry cleaning selectively solubilizes stains on the article non-polar solvents are also good for some fabrics , especially natural fabrics , as the solvent does not interact with any polar groups within the fabric water binds to these polar groups which results in the swelling and stretching of proteins within fibers during laundering after the laundry cycle , water molecules will dry off during the wash cycle , the chamber is filled approximately one-third full of solvent and begins to rotate , agitating the clothing the condensed solvent is fed into a separator unit where any remaining water is separated from the solvent and then fed into the 'clean solvent ' tank the ideal flow rate is roughly 8 liters of solvent per kilogram of garments per minute , depending on the size of the machine items such as plastic pens may dissolve in the solvent bath , damaging the textiles some textile dyes are '' loose '' and will shed dye during solvent immersion not all stains can be removed by dry cleaning during the first three minutes , solvent-soluble soils dissolve into the perchloroethylene and loose , insoluble soil comes off until this time , the cleaning is done in normal temperature , as the solvent is never heated in dry cleaning process it will contain solvent , powdered filter material ( diatomite ) , carbon , non-volatile residues , lint , dyes , grease , soils , and water the toxicity of tetrachloroethylene '' is moderate to low '' and '' reports of human injury are uncommon despite its wide usage in dry cleaning and degreasing '' the dry cleaning process involves charging a sealed chamber which is loaded with clothes using gaseous carbon dioxide from a storage vessel to approximately 200 to 300 psi as mentioned in the mechanisms section , dry cleaning utilizes both chemical and mechanical properties to remove stains

jennings is the inventor and first to patent the commercial dry cleaning process known as '' dry scouring '' , on march 3 , 1821 ( patent number : us 3,306x ) modern dry cleaning 's use of non-water-based solvents to remove soil and stains from clothes was reported as early as 1855 the use of highly flammable petroleum solvents caused many fires and explosions , resulting in government regulation of dry cleaners after world war & nbsp ; i , dry cleaners began using chlorinated solvents these solvents were much less flammable than petroleum solvents and had improved cleaning power by the mid-1930s , the dry cleaning industry had adopted tetrachloroethylene ( perchloroethylene ) , or pce for short , as the solvent dry cleaning businesses , from the perspective of the customer , are either plants or drop shops a drop shop receives garments from customers , sends them to a large plant , and then has the cleaned garment returned to the shop for collection by the customer since 2010 , in some markets , web apps have been used to schedule low-cost home delivery for dry cleaning this cycle minimized the risk of fire or dangerous fumes created by the cleaning process at this time , dry cleaning was carried out in two different machines—one for the cleaning process , and the second to remove the solvent from the garments machines of this era were described as vented ; their drying exhausts were expelled to the atmosphere , the same as many modern tumble-dryer exhausts much stricter controls on solvent emissions have ensured that all dry cleaning machines in the western world are now fully enclosed , and no solvent fumes are vented to the atmosphere the majority of modern enclosed machines also incorporate a computer-controlled drying sensor , which automatically senses when all detectable traces of pce have been removed in terms of mechanism , dry cleaning selectively solubilizes stains on the article non-polar solvents are also good for some fabrics , especially natural fabrics , as the solvent does not interact with any polar groups within the fabric after the laundry cycle , water molecules will dry off during the wash cycle , the chamber is filled approximately one-third full of solvent and begins to rotate , agitating the clothing the solvent temperature is maintained at 30 & nbsp ; degrees celsius ( 86 & nbsp ; degrees fahrenheit ) , as a higher temperature may damage it during the wash cycle , the solvent in the chamber ( commonly known as the 'cage ' or 'tackle box ' ) is passed through a filtration chamber and then fed back into the 'cage ' the condensed solvent is fed into a separator unit where any remaining water is separated from the solvent and then fed into the 'clean solvent ' tank items such as plastic pens may dissolve in the solvent bath , damaging the textiles not all stains can be removed by dry cleaning some need to be treated with spotting solvents — sometimes by steam jet or by soaking in special stain-remover liquids — before garments are washed or dry cleaned it takes 10–12 minutes after the loose soil has come off to remove the ground-in insoluble soil from garments a dry cleaning surfactant '' soap '' may also be added this pure solvent rinse prevents discoloration caused by soil particles being absorbed back onto the garment surface from the 'dirty ' working solvent pce is the most common solvent , the '' standard '' for cleaning performance supercritical co 2 is , overall , a mild solvent which lowers its ability to aggressively attack stains as mentioned in the mechanisms section , dry cleaning utilizes both chemical and mechanical properties to remove stains dibutoxymethane ( solvonk4 ) is a bipolar solvent that removes water-based stains and oil-based stains it is among the more expensive solvents , but it is faster cleaning , lower temperatures , and quick dry times

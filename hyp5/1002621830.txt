jennings is the inventor and first to patent the commercial dry cleaning process known as '' dry scouring '' , on march 3 , 1821 ( patent number : us 3,306x ) an early adopter of commercial '' dry laundry '' using turpentine was jolly belin in paris in 1825 modern dry cleaning 's use of non-water-based solvents to remove soil and stains from clothes was reported as early as 1855 the use of highly flammable petroleum solvents caused many fires and explosions , resulting in government regulation of dry cleaners after world war & nbsp ; i , dry cleaners began using chlorinated solvents these solvents were much less flammable than petroleum solvents and had improved cleaning power by the mid-1930s , the dry cleaning industry had adopted tetrachloroethylene ( perchloroethylene ) , or pce for short , as the solvent it has excellent cleaning power and is nonflammable and compatible with most garments this cycle minimized the risk of fire or dangerous fumes created by the cleaning process at this time , dry cleaning was carried out in two different machines—one for the cleaning process , and the second to remove the solvent from the garments this not only contributed to environmental contamination but also much potentially reusable pce was lost to the atmosphere much stricter controls on solvent emissions have ensured that all dry cleaning machines in the western world are now fully enclosed , and no solvent fumes are vented to the atmosphere the majority of modern enclosed machines also incorporate a computer-controlled drying sensor , which automatically senses when all detectable traces of pce have been removed the many oh groups bind water , leading to swelling of the fabric and leading to wrinkling , which is minimized when these materials are treated with tetrachloroethylene and other dry cleaning solvents also , the binding of water molecules interferes with weak attractions within the fiber , resulting in the loss of the fiber 's original shape after the laundry cycle , water molecules will dry off a dry-cleaning machine is similar to a combination of a domestic washing machine and clothes dryer the washing chamber contains a horizontal , perforated drum that rotates within an outer shell during the wash cycle , the chamber is filled approximately one-third full of solvent and begins to rotate , agitating the clothing the solvent is then removed and sent to a distillation unit consisting of a boiler and condenser the condensed solvent is fed into a separator unit where any remaining water is separated from the solvent and then fed into the 'clean solvent ' tank some need to be treated with spotting solvents — sometimes by steam jet or by soaking in special stain-remover liquids — before garments are washed or dry cleaned at the end of the wash cycle , the machine starts a rinse cycle where the garment load is rinsed with freshly distilled solvent dispensed from the solvent tank until this time , the cleaning is done in normal temperature , as the solvent is never heated in dry cleaning process the exhausted warm air from the machine then passes through a chiller unit where solvent vapors are condensed and returned to the distilled solvent tank in the early days of dry cleaning , large amounts of perchlorethylene were vented to the atmosphere because it was regarded as cheap and believed to be harmless after the drying cycle is complete , a deodorizing ( aeration ) cycle cools the garments and removes further traces of solvent , by circulating cool outside air over the garments and then through a vapor recovery filter made from activated carbon and polymer resins working solvent from the washing chamber passes through several filtration steps before it is returned to the washing chamber it will contain solvent , powdered filter material ( diatomite ) , carbon , non-volatile residues , lint , dyes , grease , soils , and water to enhance cleaning power , small amounts of detergent ( 0.5–1.5 % ) are added to the working solvent and are essential to its functionality the dry cleaning process involves charging a sealed chamber which is loaded with clothes using gaseous carbon dioxide from a storage vessel to approximately 200 to 300 psi it is among the more expensive solvents , but it is faster cleaning , lower temperatures , and quick dry times

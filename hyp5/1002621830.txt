jennings is the inventor and first to patent the commercial dry cleaning process known as '' dry scouring '' , on march 3 , 1821 ( patent number : us 3,306x ) modern dry cleaning 's use of non-water-based solvents to remove soil and stains from clothes was reported as early as 1855 flammability concerns led william joseph stoddard , a dry cleaner from atlanta , to develop stoddard solvent ( white spirit ) as a slightly less flammable alternative to gasoline-based solvents the use of highly flammable petroleum solvents caused many fires and explosions , resulting in government regulation of dry cleaners after world war & nbsp ; i , dry cleaners began using chlorinated solvents these solvents were much less flammable than petroleum solvents and had improved cleaning power by the mid-1930s , the dry cleaning industry had adopted tetrachloroethylene ( perchloroethylene ) , or pce for short , as the solvent dry cleaning businesses , from the perspective of the customer , are either plants or drop shops since 2010 , in some markets , web apps have been used to schedule low-cost home delivery for dry cleaning at this time , dry cleaning was carried out in two different machines—one for the cleaning process , and the second to remove the solvent from the garments machines of this era were described as vented ; their drying exhausts were expelled to the atmosphere , the same as many modern tumble-dryer exhausts much stricter controls on solvent emissions have ensured that all dry cleaning machines in the western world are now fully enclosed , and no solvent fumes are vented to the atmosphere in enclosed machines , solvent recovered during the drying process is returned condensed and distilled , so it can be reused to clean further loads or safely disposed of the majority of modern enclosed machines also incorporate a computer-controlled drying sensor , which automatically senses when all detectable traces of pce have been removed the many oh groups bind water , leading to swelling of the fabric and leading to wrinkling , which is minimized when these materials are treated with tetrachloroethylene and other dry cleaning solvents also , the binding of water molecules interferes with weak attractions within the fiber , resulting in the loss of the fiber 's original shape garments are placed in the washing or extraction chamber ( referred to as the 'basket ' or 'drum ' ) , which constitutes the core of the machine the solvent temperature is maintained at 30 & nbsp ; degrees celsius ( 86 & nbsp ; degrees fahrenheit ) , as a higher temperature may damage it during the wash cycle , the solvent in the chamber ( commonly known as the 'cage ' or 'tackle box ' ) is passed through a filtration chamber and then fed back into the 'cage ' this is known as the cycle and is continued for the wash duration a typical wash cycle lasts for 8–15 minutes depending on the type of garments and degree of soiling a dry cleaning surfactant '' soap '' may also be added at the end of the wash cycle , the machine starts a rinse cycle where the garment load is rinsed with freshly distilled solvent dispensed from the solvent tank this pure solvent rinse prevents discoloration caused by soil particles being absorbed back onto the garment surface from the 'dirty ' working solvent after the rinse cycle , the machine begins the extraction process , which recovers the solvent for reuse the extraction cycle begins by draining the solvent from the washing chamber and accelerating the basket to 350–450 & nbsp ; rpm , causing much of the solvent to spin free of the fabric until this time , the cleaning is done in normal temperature , as the solvent is never heated in dry cleaning process in the early days of dry cleaning , large amounts of perchlorethylene were vented to the atmosphere because it was regarded as cheap and believed to be harmless this filter , which contains activated clays and charcoal , removes fine insoluble soil and non-volatile residues , along with dyes from the solvent the waste sludge or solid residue from the still contains solvent , water , soils , carbon , and other non-volatile residues the dry cleaning process involves charging a sealed chamber which is loaded with clothes using gaseous carbon dioxide from a storage vessel to approximately 200 to 300 psi it is among the more expensive solvents , but it is faster cleaning , lower temperatures , and quick dry times

however , he became disillusioned after germany 's loss and severe sanctioning around the same time , he forged a friendship with the young rudolf hess , who would become his scientific assistant and later the deputy leader of the national socialist german workers party their familiarity formed the basis of the mistaken assumption of an equally close contact between haushofer and hitler haushofer entered academia with the aim of restoring and regenerating germany in 1919 , haushofer became privatdozent for political geography at ludwig maximilian university of munich and in 1933 professor , although he declined a formal position and salary , as this would have interfered with his military pension he was a prolific writer , publishing hundreds of articles , reviews , commentaries , obituaries and books , many of which were on asian topics , and he arranged for many leaders in the nsdap and in the german military to receive copies of his works louis pauwels , in his book monsieur gurdjieff , describes haushofer as a former student of george gurdjieff others , including pauwels , said that haushofer created a vril society and that he was a secret member of the thule society after the july 20 plot to assassinate hitler , haushofer 's son albrecht ( 1903–1945 ) was implicated , in part because of his previous association with hess beginning on 24 september 1945 , karl haushofer was informally interrogated by father edmund a on the night of 10–11 march 1946 , karl haushofer and his wife committed suicide in a secluded hollow on their hartschimmelhof estate at pähl/ammersee haushofer developed geopolitik from widely varied sources , including the writings of oswald spengler , alexander humboldt , carl ritter , friedrich ratzel , rudolf kjellén , and halford j the theories contributed five ideas to german foreign policy in the interwar period : organic state lebensraum autarky pan-regions land power/sea power dichotomy mattern , pp.40–41 while some of haushofer 's ideas stem from earlier american and british geostrategy , german geopolitik adopted an essentialist outlook toward the national interest , oversimplifying issues and representing itself as a panacea as a new and essentialist ideology , geopolitik found itself in a position to prey upon the weimar republic of the populace mattern , p.32 haushofer 's position in the university of munich served as a platform for the spread of his geopolitical ideas , magazine articles , and books by 1924 , as the leader of the german geopolitik school of thought , haushofer would establish the zeitschrift für geopolitik monthly devoted to geopolitik walsh ( 1949 ) , pp.4–5 while hitler 's speeches would attract the masses , haushofer 's works served to bring the remaining intellectuals into the fold frontiers & nbsp ;

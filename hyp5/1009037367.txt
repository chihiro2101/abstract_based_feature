haushofer belonged to a family of artists and scholars he was born in munich to max haushofer , a well-known professor of economics , politician and author of both academic and literary works , and adele haushofer ( née fraas ) on his graduation from the munich gymnasium ( high school ) , in 1887 , haushofer entered the 1st field artillery regiment '' prinzregent luitpold '' of the bavarian army and completed kriegsschule , artillerieschule and war academy ( kingdom of bavaria ) they had two sons , albrecht haushofer and heinz haushofer ( 1906–1988 ) in november 1908 , haushofer was ordered to tokyo as a military attache to study the imperial japanese army and as a military advisor in artillery instructor he was received by emperor meiji and became acquainted with many important people in politics and the armed forces he established himself as one of germany ’ s foremost experts regarding the far east , and co-founded the geopolitical monthly zeitschrift für geopolitik ( zfg ) , which he would co-edit until it was suspended towards the end of world war ii haushofer continued his career as a professional soldier after the annexation of bavaria by germany , serving in the army of imperial germany and returning to teach war history at the military academy in munich around the same time , he forged a friendship with the young rudolf hess , who would become his scientific assistant and later the deputy leader of the national socialist german workers party their familiarity formed the basis of the mistaken assumption of an equally close contact between haushofer and hitler haushofer believed the germans ' lack of geographical knowledge and geopolitical awareness to be a major cause of germany ’ s defeat in world war i , as germany had found itself with a disadvantageous alignment of allies and enemies in 1919 , haushofer became privatdozent for political geography at ludwig maximilian university of munich and in 1933 professor , although he declined a formal position and salary , as this would have interfered with his military pension this weltpolitischer monatsbericht made him a household name in contemporary germany , and he came to be known in circles far removed from academia louis pauwels , in his book monsieur gurdjieff , describes haushofer as a former student of george gurdjieff after the establishment of the nazis , haushofer remained friendly with hess , who protected haushofer and his wife from the racial laws of the nazis , which deemed her a '' half-jew '' during the prewar years , haushofer was instrumental in linking japan to the axis powers , acting in accordance with the theories of his book geopolitics of the pacific ocean after the july 20 plot to assassinate hitler , haushofer 's son albrecht ( 1903–1945 ) was implicated , in part because of his previous association with hess mattern , pp.40–41 while some of haushofer 's ideas stem from earlier american and british geostrategy , german geopolitik adopted an essentialist outlook toward the national interest , oversimplifying issues and representing itself as a panacea mattern , p.32 haushofer 's position in the university of munich served as a platform for the spread of his geopolitical ideas , magazine articles , and books by 1924 , as the leader of the german geopolitik school of thought , haushofer would establish the zeitschrift für geopolitik monthly devoted to geopolitik dorpalen , pp.16–17 haushofer exercised influence both through his academic teachings , urging his students to think in terms of continents and emphasizing motion in international politics , and through his political activities mackinder , german geopolitik adds older german ideas the root of uniquely german geopolitik rests in the writings of karl ritter who first developed the organic state that would later be elaborated upon by ratzel and accepted by hausfhofer mattern , p.60 influenced by mahan , ratzel wrote of aspirations for german naval reach , agreeing that sea power was self-sustaining , as the profit from trade would pay for the merchant marine , unlike land power dorpalen , p.54 haushofer defined geopolitik in 1935 as '' the duty to safeguard the right to the soil , to the land in the widest sense , not only the land within the frontiers of the reich , but the right to volksdeutsche and cultural lands '' walsh ( 1949 ) , p.48 culture itself was seen as the most conducive element to dynamic special expansion dorpalen , p.78 to haushofer , the existence of a state depended on living space , the pursuit of which must serve as the basis for all policies dorpalen , pp.207 , 209 haushofer 's version of autarky was based on the quasi-malthusian idea that the earth would become saturated with people and no longer able to provide food for all mattern , p.39 that was a forward-looking refashioning of the drive for colony , something that geopoliticians did not see as an economic necessity but more as a matter of prestige , putting pressure on older colonial powers rudolf hess , hitler 's secretary who would assist in the writing of mein kampf , was a close student of haushofer 's walsh ( 1949 ) , pp.14–15 after world war ii , haushofer would deny that he had taught hitler , and claimed that the national socialist party perverted hess 's study of geopolitik haushofer himself viewed hitler as a half-educated man who never correctly understood the geopolitik principles explained by hess , and saw foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop as the principal distorter of geopolitik in hitler 's mind walsh ( 1949 ) , p.8 furthermore , the nazi party and government lacked any official organ that was receptive to geopolitik , leading to selective adoption and poor interpretation of haushofer 's theories , '' karl haushofer re-examined & nbsp ; – geopolitics as a factor within japanese-german rapprochement in the inter-war years ?

classical conditioning occurs when a conditioned stimulus ( cs ) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus ( us ) usually , the conditioned stimulus is a neutral stimulus ( e.g after pairing is repeated the organism exhibits a conditioned response ( cr ) to the conditioned stimulus when the conditioned stimulus is presented alone ( a conditioned response may occur after only one pairing usually the conditioned response is similar to the unconditioned response , but sometimes it is quite different for this and other reasons , most learning theorists suggest that the conditioned stimulus comes to signal or predict the unconditioned stimulus , and go on to analyze the consequences of this signal rescorla provided a clear summary of this change in thinking , and its implications , in his 1988 article '' pavlovian conditioning : it 's not what you think it is '' classical conditioning differs from operant conditioning : in classical conditioning , behaviors are modified through the association of stimuli as described above , whereas in operant conditioning behaviors are modified by the effect they produce ( i.e pavlov noticed that his dogs began to salivate in the presence of the technician who normally fed them , rather than simply salivating in the presence of food in pavlov 's experiments the unconditioned stimulus ( us ) was the food because its effects did not depend on previous experience after conditioning , the metronome 's sound becomes the conditioned stimulus ( cs ) or conditional stimulus ; because its effects depend on its association with food the conditioned response ( cr ) is the response to the conditioned stimulus , whereas the unconditioned response ( ur ) corresponds to the unconditioned stimulus as noted earlier , it is often thought that the conditioned response is a replica of the unconditioned response , but pavlov noted that saliva produced by the cs differs in composition from that produced by the us in fact , the cr may be any new response to the previously neutral cs that can be clearly linked to experience with the conditional relationship of cs and us it was also thought that repeated pairings are necessary for conditioning to emerge , but many crs can be learned with a single trial , especially in fear conditioning and taste aversion learning two common forms of forward conditioning are delay and trace conditioning delay conditioning : in delay conditioning , the cs is presented and is overlapped by the presentation of the us trace conditioning : during trace conditioning , the cs and us do not overlap if in the above buzzer example , the puff came a second after the sound of the buzzer stopped , that would be trace conditioning , with a trace or conditioning interval of one second first a neutral stimulus ( '' cs1 '' ) comes to signal a us through forward conditioning then a second neutral stimulus ( '' cs2 '' ) is paired with the first ( cs1 ) and comes to yield its own conditioned response for example : a bell might be paired with food until the bell elicits salivation backward conditioning occurs when a cs immediately follows a us unlike the usual conditioning procedure , in which the cs precedes the us , the conditioned response given to the cs tends to be inhibitory for example , a puff of air directed at a person 's eye could be followed by the sound of a buzzer in temporal conditioning , a us is presented at regular intervals , for instance every 10 minutes this method has also been used to study timing ability in animals ( see animal cognition ) the example below shows the temporal conditioning , as us such as food to a hungry mouse is simply delivered on a regular time schedule such as every thirty seconds in this procedure , the cs is paired with the us , but the us also occurs at other times in this case , conditioning fails and the cs does not come to elicit a cr this finding – that prediction rather than cs-us pairing is the key to conditioning – greatly influenced subsequent conditioning research and theory if the cs is presented without the us , and this process is repeated often enough , the cs will eventually stop eliciting a cr several procedures lead to the recovery of a cr that had been first conditioned and then extinguished these procedures are the following : reacquisition : if the cs is again paired with the us , a cr is again acquired , but this second acquisition usually happens much faster than the first one reinstatement : if the us used in conditioning is presented to a subject in the same place where conditioning and extinction occurred , but without the cs being present , the cs often elicits a response when it is tested later stimulus generalization is said to occur if , after a particular cs has come to elicit a cr , a similar test stimulus is found to elicit the same cr one observes stimulus discrimination when one stimulus ( '' cs1 '' ) elicits one cr and another stimulus ( '' cs2 '' ) elicits either another cr or no cr at all this is one of the most common ways to measure the strength of learning in classical conditioning a typical example of this procedure is as follows : a rat first learns to press a lever through operant conditioning the rate of pressing during the cs measures the strength of classical conditioning ; that is , the slower the rat presses , the stronger the association of the cs and the us a cs ( cs+ ) is paired with a us until asymptotic cr levels are reached cs+/us trials are continued , but these are interspersed with trials on which the cs+ is paired with a second cs , ( the cs- ) but not with the us ( i.e summation test for conditioned inhibition : the cs- from phase 2 is presented together with a new cs+ that was conditioned as in phase 1 a compound cs ( cs1+cs2 ) is paired with a us most relevant experiments have used the classical conditioning procedure , although operant conditioning experiments have also been used , and the strength of classical conditioning is often measured through its operant effects , as in conditioned suppression ( see phenomena section above ) and autoshaping ( however , it has been proposed that only when the ur does not involve the central nervous system are the cr and the ur opposites however , after conditioning , the subject is no longer surprised , because the cs predicts the coming of the us it specifies the amount of learning that will occur on a single pairing of a conditioning stimulus ( cs ) with an unconditioned stimulus ( us ) in this model the degree of learning is measured by how well the cs predicts the us , which is given by the '' associative strength '' of the cs in the equation , v represents the current associative strength of the cs , and ∆v is the change in this strength that happens on a given trial σv is the sum of the strengths of all stimuli present in the situation α and β are constants related to the salience of the cs and the speed of learning for a given us for further details , see the main article on the model the r–w model measures conditioning by assigning an '' associative strength '' to the cs and other local stimuli pairing the cs and the us causes a gradual increase in the associative strength of the cs as cs-us pairings accumulate , the us becomes more predictable , and the increase in associative strength on each trial becomes smaller and smaller finally , the difference between the associative strength of the cs ( plus any that may accrue to other stimuli ) and the maximum strength reaches zero extinction is complete when the strength of the cs reaches zero ; no us is predicted , and no us occurs the most important and novel contribution of the r–w model is its assumption that the conditioning of a cs depends not just on that cs alone , and its relationship to the us , but also on all other stimuli present in the conditioning situation in particular , the model states that the us is predicted by the sum of the associative strengths of all stimuli present in the conditioning situation then on additional conditioning trials a second stimulus ( cs2 ) appears together with cs1 , and both are followed by the us as stated earlier , a key idea in conditioning is that the cs signals or predicts the us ( see '' zero contingency procedure '' above ) in the case of eyeblink conditioning , the us is an air-puff , while in fear conditioning the us is threatening or aversive such as a foot shock the anterior cingulate is one candidate for intermediate trace conditioning , but the hippocampus may also play a major role

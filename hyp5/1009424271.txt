classical conditioning occurs when a conditioned stimulus ( cs ) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus ( us ) usually , the conditioned stimulus is a neutral stimulus ( e.g , the sound of a tuning fork ) , the unconditioned stimulus is biologically potent ( e.g , the taste of food ) and the unconditioned response ( ur ) to the unconditioned stimulus is an unlearned reflex response ( e.g after pairing is repeated the organism exhibits a conditioned response ( cr ) to the conditioned stimulus when the conditioned stimulus is presented alone ( a conditioned response may occur after only one pairing for this and other reasons , most learning theorists suggest that the conditioned stimulus comes to signal or predict the unconditioned stimulus , and go on to analyze the consequences of this signal rescorla provided a clear summary of this change in thinking , and its implications , in his 1988 article '' pavlovian conditioning : it 's not what you think it is '' classical conditioning differs from operant conditioning : in classical conditioning , behaviors are modified through the association of stimuli as described above , whereas in operant conditioning behaviors are modified by the effect they produce ( i.e the best-known and most thorough early work on classical conditioning was done by ivan pavlov , although edwin twitmyer published some related findings a year earlier putting these informal observations to an experimental test , pavlov presented a stimulus ( e.g the sound of a metronome ) and then gave the dog food ; after a few repetitions , the dogs started to salivate in response to the stimulus pavlov concluded that if a particular stimulus in the dog 's surroundings was present when the dog was given food then that stimulus could become associated with food and cause salivation on its own the metronome 's sound is originally a neutral stimulus ( ns ) because it does not elicit salivation in the dogs the conditioned response ( cr ) is the response to the conditioned stimulus , whereas the unconditioned response ( ur ) corresponds to the unconditioned stimulus it was also thought that repeated pairings are necessary for conditioning to emerge , but many crs can be learned with a single trial , especially in fear conditioning and taste aversion learning learning is fastest in forward conditioning during forward conditioning , the onset of the cs precedes the onset of the us in order to signal that the us will follow two common forms of forward conditioning are delay and trace conditioning trace conditioning : during trace conditioning , the cs and us do not overlap the stimulus-free period is called the trace interval or the conditioning interval if in the above buzzer example , the puff came a second after the sound of the buzzer stopped , that would be trace conditioning , with a trace or conditioning interval of one second second-order or higher-order conditioning follow a two-step procedure then a second neutral stimulus ( '' cs2 '' ) is paired with the first ( cs1 ) and comes to yield its own conditioned response the bell is the cs1 and the food is the us unlike the usual conditioning procedure , in which the cs precedes the us , the conditioned response given to the cs tends to be inhibitory this presumably happens because the cs serves as a signal that the us has ended , rather than as a signal that the us is about to appear for example , a puff of air directed at a person 's eye could be followed by the sound of a buzzer in temporal conditioning , a us is presented at regular intervals , for instance every 10 minutes this suggests that animals have a biological clock that can serve as a cs the example below shows the temporal conditioning , as us such as food to a hungry mouse is simply delivered on a regular time schedule such as every thirty seconds this then makes it temporal conditioning as it would appear that the mouse is conditioned to the passage of time this finding – that prediction rather than cs-us pairing is the key to conditioning – greatly influenced subsequent conditioning research and theory these phenomena can be explained by postulating accumulation of inhibition when a weak stimulus is presented the speed of conditioning depends on a number of factors , such as the nature and strength of both the cs and the us , previous experience and the animal 's motivational state if the cs is presented without the us , and this process is repeated often enough , the cs will eventually stop eliciting a cr external inhibition may be observed if a strong or unfamiliar stimulus is presented just before , or at the same time as , the cs these procedures are the following : reacquisition : if the cs is again paired with the us , a cr is again acquired , but this second acquisition usually happens much faster than the first one spontaneous recovery : spontaneous recovery is defined as the reappearance of a previously extinguished conditioned response after a rest period stimulus generalization is said to occur if , after a particular cs has come to elicit a cr , a similar test stimulus is found to elicit the same cr conversely , the more the test stimulus differs from the cs , the weaker the cr will be , or the more it will differ from that previously observed one observes stimulus discrimination when one stimulus ( '' cs1 '' ) elicits one cr and another stimulus ( '' cs2 '' ) elicits either another cr or no cr at all latent inhibition refers to the observation that it takes longer for a familiar stimulus to become a cs than it does for a novel stimulus to become a cs , when the stimulus is paired with an effective us an association between the cs and us develops , and the rat slows or stops its lever pressing when the cs comes on the rate of pressing during the cs measures the strength of classical conditioning ; that is , the slower the rat presses , the stronger the association of the cs and the us cs+/us trials are continued , but these are interspersed with trials on which the cs+ is paired with a second cs , ( the cs- ) but not with the us ( i.e typically , organisms show crs on cs+/us trials , but stop responding on cs+/cs− trials summation test for conditioned inhibition : the cs- from phase 2 is presented together with a new cs+ that was conditioned as in phase 1 a cs ( cs1 ) is paired with a us the blocking effect is observed in a lack of conditional response to cs2 , suggesting that the first phase of training blocked the acquisition of the second cs however , conditioning has also been studied in invertebrates , and very important data on the neural basis of conditioning has come from experiments on the sea slug , aplysia ( however , it has been proposed that only when the ur does not involve the central nervous system are the cr and the ur opposites the rescorla-wagner model argues that there is a limit to the amount of conditioning that can occur in the pairing of two stimuli the model also predicts a number of other phenomena , see main article on the model it specifies the amount of learning that will occur on a single pairing of a conditioning stimulus ( cs ) with an unconditioned stimulus ( us ) in this model the degree of learning is measured by how well the cs predicts the us , which is given by the '' associative strength '' of the cs in the equation , v represents the current associative strength of the cs , and ∆v is the change in this strength that happens on a given trial λ is the maximum associative strength that a given us will support ; its value is usually set to 1 on trials when the us is present , and 0 when the us is absent the r–w model reduces conditioning to the association of a cs and us , and measures this with a single number , the associative strength of the cs a number of other powerful models have appeared in recent years which incorporate element representations forms of classical conditioning that are used for this purpose include , among others , fear conditioning , eyeblink conditioning , and the foot contraction conditioning of hermissenda crassicornis , a sea-slug in the case of eyeblink conditioning , the us is an air-puff , while in fear conditioning the us is threatening or aversive such as a foot shock in a typical experiment , a rat is presented with sound-food pairings ( classical conditioning ) some general examples that involve the classical conditioning theory in action include , in a lot of cases , advertising

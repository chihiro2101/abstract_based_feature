classical conditioning occurs when a conditioned stimulus ( cs ) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus ( us ) usually , the conditioned stimulus is a neutral stimulus ( e.g , the sound of a tuning fork ) , the unconditioned stimulus is biologically potent ( e.g , the taste of food ) and the unconditioned response ( ur ) to the unconditioned stimulus is an unlearned reflex response ( e.g after pairing is repeated the organism exhibits a conditioned response ( cr ) to the conditioned stimulus when the conditioned stimulus is presented alone ( a conditioned response may occur after only one pairing usually the conditioned response is similar to the unconditioned response , but sometimes it is quite different for this and other reasons , most learning theorists suggest that the conditioned stimulus comes to signal or predict the unconditioned stimulus , and go on to analyze the consequences of this signal rescorla provided a clear summary of this change in thinking , and its implications , in his 1988 article '' pavlovian conditioning : it 's not what you think it is '' classical conditioning differs from operant conditioning : in classical conditioning , behaviors are modified through the association of stimuli as described above , whereas in operant conditioning behaviors are modified by the effect they produce ( i.e the best-known and most thorough early work on classical conditioning was done by ivan pavlov , although edwin twitmyer published some related findings a year earlier he redirected the animal 's digestive fluids outside the body , where they could be measured pavlov noticed that his dogs began to salivate in the presence of the technician who normally fed them , rather than simply salivating in the presence of food pavlov called the dogs ' anticipatory salivation '' psychic secretion '' the sound of a metronome ) and then gave the dog food ; after a few repetitions , the dogs started to salivate in response to the stimulus after conditioning , the metronome 's sound becomes the conditioned stimulus ( cs ) or conditional stimulus ; because its effects depend on its association with food the conditioned response ( cr ) is the response to the conditioned stimulus , whereas the unconditioned response ( ur ) corresponds to the unconditioned stimulus learning is fastest in forward conditioning two common forms of forward conditioning are delay and trace conditioning delay conditioning : in delay conditioning , the cs is presented and is overlapped by the presentation of the us for example , if a person hears a buzzer for five seconds , during which time air is puffed into their eye , the person will blink this is delay conditioning trace conditioning : during trace conditioning , the cs and us do not overlap instead , the cs begins and ends before the us is presented the stimulus-free period is called the trace interval or the conditioning interval if in the above buzzer example , the puff came a second after the sound of the buzzer stopped , that would be trace conditioning , with a trace or conditioning interval of one second first a neutral stimulus ( '' cs1 '' ) comes to signal a us through forward conditioning if a light is then paired with the bell , then the light may come to elicit salivation as well backward conditioning occurs when a cs immediately follows a us unlike the usual conditioning procedure , in which the cs precedes the us , the conditioned response given to the cs tends to be inhibitory conditioning is said to have occurred when the cr tends to occur shortly before each us this then makes it temporal conditioning as it would appear that the mouse is conditioned to the passage of time in this case , conditioning fails and the cs does not come to elicit a cr this finding – that prediction rather than cs-us pairing is the key to conditioning – greatly influenced subsequent conditioning research and theory however , extinction does not completely eliminate the effects of the prior conditioning these phenomena can be explained by postulating accumulation of inhibition when a weak stimulus is presented if the cs is presented without the us , and this process is repeated often enough , the cs will eventually stop eliciting a cr external inhibition may be observed if a strong or unfamiliar stimulus is presented just before , or at the same time as , the cs this illustrates that the extinction procedure does not completely eliminate the effect of conditioning these procedures are the following : reacquisition : if the cs is again paired with the us , a cr is again acquired , but this second acquisition usually happens much faster than the first one this renewed cr is usually much weaker than the cr observed prior to extinction disinhibition : if the cs is tested just after extinction and an intense but associatively neutral stimulus has occurred , there may be a temporary recovery of the conditioned response to the cs renewal : renewal is a reemergence of a conditioned response following extinction when an animal is returned to the environment in which the conditioned response was acquired stimulus generalization is said to occur if , after a particular cs has come to elicit a cr , a similar test stimulus is found to elicit the same cr usually the more similar the test stimulus is to the cs the stronger the cr will be to the test stimulus conversely , the more the test stimulus differs from the cs , the weaker the cr will be , or the more it will differ from that previously observed this is one of the most common ways to measure the strength of learning in classical conditioning the rate of pressing during the cs measures the strength of classical conditioning ; that is , the slower the rat presses , the stronger the association of the cs and the us ( slow pressing indicates a '' fear '' conditioned response , and it is an example of a conditioned emotional response ; see section below conditioned inhibition is found if the response is less to the cs+/cs- pair than it is to the cs+ alone retardation test for conditioned inhibition : the cs- from phase 2 is paired with the us this form of classical conditioning involves two phases experiments on theoretical issues in conditioning have mostly been done on vertebrates , especially rats and pigeons however , conditioning has also been studied in invertebrates , and very important data on the neural basis of conditioning has come from experiments on the sea slug , aplysia this explanation is called the stimulus-substitution theory of conditioning the rescorla–wagner ( r–w ) model is a relatively simple yet powerful model of conditioning the model predicts a number of important phenomena , but it also fails in important ways , thus leading to a number of modifications and alternative models however , because much of the theoretical research on conditioning in the past 40 years has been instigated by this model or reactions to it , the r–w model deserves a brief description here the rescorla-wagner model argues that there is a limit to the amount of conditioning that can occur in the pairing of two stimuli to find out what has been learned , we must somehow measure behavior ( '' performance '' ) in a test situation the sop account of simple conditioning exemplifies some essentials of the sop model ” of the elements that represent a single stimulus at a given moment , some may be in state a1 , some in state a2 , and some in state i pavlov proposed that conditioning involved a connection between brain centers for conditioned and unconditioned stimuli some general examples that involve the classical conditioning theory in action include , in a lot of cases , advertising

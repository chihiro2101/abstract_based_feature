classical conditioning occurs when a conditioned stimulus ( cs ) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus ( us ) usually , the conditioned stimulus is a neutral stimulus ( e.g , the taste of food ) and the unconditioned response ( ur ) to the unconditioned stimulus is an unlearned reflex response ( e.g after pairing is repeated the organism exhibits a conditioned response ( cr ) to the conditioned stimulus when the conditioned stimulus is presented alone ( a conditioned response may occur after only one pairing classical conditioning differs from operant conditioning : in classical conditioning , behaviors are modified through the association of stimuli as described above , whereas in operant conditioning behaviors are modified by the effect they produce ( i.e the best-known and most thorough early work on classical conditioning was done by ivan pavlov , although edwin twitmyer published some related findings a year earlier putting these informal observations to an experimental test , pavlov presented a stimulus ( e.g in pavlov 's experiments the unconditioned stimulus ( us ) was the food because its effects did not depend on previous experience the metronome 's sound is originally a neutral stimulus ( ns ) because it does not elicit salivation in the dogs after conditioning , the metronome 's sound becomes the conditioned stimulus ( cs ) or conditional stimulus ; because its effects depend on its association with food the conditioned response ( cr ) is the response to the conditioned stimulus , whereas the unconditioned response ( ur ) corresponds to the unconditioned stimulus pavlov reported many basic facts about conditioning ; for example , he found that learning occurred most rapidly when the interval between the cs and the appearance of the us was relatively short it was also thought that repeated pairings are necessary for conditioning to emerge , but many crs can be learned with a single trial , especially in fear conditioning and taste aversion learning learning is fastest in forward conditioning two common forms of forward conditioning are delay and trace conditioning delay conditioning : in delay conditioning , the cs is presented and is overlapped by the presentation of the us trace conditioning : during trace conditioning , the cs and us do not overlap instead , the cs begins and ends before the us is presented if in the above buzzer example , the puff came a second after the sound of the buzzer stopped , that would be trace conditioning , with a trace or conditioning interval of one second backward conditioning occurs when a cs immediately follows a us unlike the usual conditioning procedure , in which the cs precedes the us , the conditioned response given to the cs tends to be inhibitory this presumably happens because the cs serves as a signal that the us has ended , rather than as a signal that the us is about to appear in temporal conditioning , a us is presented at regular intervals , for instance every 10 minutes conditioning is said to have occurred when the cr tends to occur shortly before each us this suggests that animals have a biological clock that can serve as a cs the example below shows the temporal conditioning , as us such as food to a hungry mouse is simply delivered on a regular time schedule such as every thirty seconds this then makes it temporal conditioning as it would appear that the mouse is conditioned to the passage of time in this procedure , the cs is paired with the us , but the us also occurs at other times if this occurs , it is predicted that the us is likely to happen in the absence of the cs in this case , conditioning fails and the cs does not come to elicit a cr these phenomena can be explained by postulating accumulation of inhibition when a weak stimulus is presented this repeated number of trials increase the strength and/or frequency of the cr gradually the speed of conditioning depends on a number of factors , such as the nature and strength of both the cs and the us , previous experience and the animal 's motivational state external inhibition may be observed if a strong or unfamiliar stimulus is presented just before , or at the same time as , the cs this illustrates that the extinction procedure does not completely eliminate the effect of conditioning this renewed cr is usually much weaker than the cr observed prior to extinction reinstatement : if the us used in conditioning is presented to a subject in the same place where conditioning and extinction occurred , but without the cs being present , the cs often elicits a response when it is tested later stimulus generalization is said to occur if , after a particular cs has come to elicit a cr , a similar test stimulus is found to elicit the same cr one observes stimulus discrimination when one stimulus ( '' cs1 '' ) elicits one cr and another stimulus ( '' cs2 '' ) elicits either another cr or no cr at all this can be brought about by , for example , pairing cs1 with an effective us and presenting cs2 with no us this is one of the most common ways to measure the strength of learning in classical conditioning an association between the cs and us develops , and the rat slows or stops its lever pressing when the cs comes on the rate of pressing during the cs measures the strength of classical conditioning ; that is , the slower the rat presses , the stronger the association of the cs and the us ( slow pressing indicates a '' fear '' conditioned response , and it is an example of a conditioned emotional response ; see section below if conditioned inhibition has occurred , the rate of acquisition to the previous cs− should be less than the rate of acquisition that would be found without the phase 2 treatment the rescorla–wagner ( r–w ) model is a relatively simple yet powerful model of conditioning the model predicts a number of important phenomena , but it also fails in important ways , thus leading to a number of modifications and alternative models the rescorla-wagner model argues that there is a limit to the amount of conditioning that can occur in the pairing of two stimuli a key idea behind the r–w model is that a cs signals or predicts the us one might say that before conditioning , the subject is surprised by the us however , after conditioning , the subject is no longer surprised , because the cs predicts the coming of the us in this model the degree of learning is measured by how well the cs predicts the us , which is given by the '' associative strength '' of the cs in the equation , v represents the current associative strength of the cs , and ∆v is the change in this strength that happens on a given trial the r–w model measures conditioning by assigning an '' associative strength '' to the cs and other local stimuli before a cs is conditioned it has an associative strength of zero on the first pairing of the cs and us , this difference is large and the associative strength of the cs takes a big step up finally , the difference between the associative strength of the cs ( plus any that may accrue to other stimuli ) and the maximum strength reaches zero that is , the us is fully predicted , the associative strength of the cs stops growing , and conditioning is complete the associative process described by the r–w model also accounts for extinction ( see '' procedures '' above ) then on additional conditioning trials a second stimulus ( cs2 ) appears together with cs1 , and both are followed by the us forms of classical conditioning that are used for this purpose include , among others , fear conditioning , eyeblink conditioning , and the foot contraction conditioning of hermissenda crassicornis , a sea-slug in the case of eyeblink conditioning , the us is an air-puff , while in fear conditioning the us is threatening or aversive such as a foot shock separately , the rat learns to press a lever to get food ( operant conditioning )

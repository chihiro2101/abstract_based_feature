classical conditioning occurs when a conditioned stimulus ( cs ) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus ( us ) , the taste of food ) and the unconditioned response ( ur ) to the unconditioned stimulus is an unlearned reflex response ( e.g after pairing is repeated the organism exhibits a conditioned response ( cr ) to the conditioned stimulus when the conditioned stimulus is presented alone ( a conditioned response may occur after only one pairing ) thus , unlike the ur , the cr is acquired through experience , and it is also less permanent than the ur usually the conditioned response is similar to the unconditioned response , but sometimes it is quite different rescorla provided a clear summary of this change in thinking , and its implications , in his 1988 article '' pavlovian conditioning : it 's not what you think it is '' putting these informal observations to an experimental test , pavlov presented a stimulus ( e.g after conditioning , the metronome 's sound becomes the conditioned stimulus ( cs ) or conditional stimulus ; because its effects depend on its association with food pavlov reported many basic facts about conditioning ; for example , he found that learning occurred most rapidly when the interval between the cs and the appearance of the us was relatively short in fact , the cr may be any new response to the previously neutral cs that can be clearly linked to experience with the conditional relationship of cs and us it was also thought that repeated pairings are necessary for conditioning to emerge , but many crs can be learned with a single trial , especially in fear conditioning and taste aversion learning during forward conditioning , the onset of the cs precedes the onset of the us in order to signal that the us will follow delay conditioning : in delay conditioning , the cs is presented and is overlapped by the presentation of the us trace conditioning : during trace conditioning , the cs and us do not overlap instead , the cs begins and ends before the us is presented during simultaneous conditioning , the cs and us are presented and terminated at the same time then a second neutral stimulus ( '' cs2 '' ) is paired with the first ( cs1 ) and comes to yield its own conditioned response for example : a bell might be paired with food until the bell elicits salivation the bell is the cs1 and the food is the us unlike the usual conditioning procedure , in which the cs precedes the us , the conditioned response given to the cs tends to be inhibitory in temporal conditioning , a us is presented at regular intervals , for instance every 10 minutes this then makes it temporal conditioning as it would appear that the mouse is conditioned to the passage of time in this procedure , the cs is paired with the us , but the us also occurs at other times if this occurs , it is predicted that the us is likely to happen in the absence of the cs in other words , the cs does not '' predict '' the us this is done after a cs has been conditioned by one of the methods above during acquisition , the cs and us are paired as described above in these test trials , the cs is presented alone and the cr is measured if the cs is presented without the us , and this process is repeated often enough , the cs will eventually stop eliciting a cr disinhibition : if the cs is tested just after extinction and an intense but associatively neutral stimulus has occurred , there may be a temporary recovery of the conditioned response to the cs usually the more similar the test stimulus is to the cs the stronger the cr will be to the test stimulus one observes stimulus discrimination when one stimulus ( '' cs1 '' ) elicits one cr and another stimulus ( '' cs2 '' ) elicits either another cr or no cr at all this can be brought about by , for example , pairing cs1 with an effective us and presenting cs2 with no us latent inhibition refers to the observation that it takes longer for a familiar stimulus to become a cs than it does for a novel stimulus to become a cs , when the stimulus is paired with an effective us an association between the cs and us develops , and the rat slows or stops its lever pressing when the cs comes on the rate of pressing during the cs measures the strength of classical conditioning ; that is , the slower the rat presses , the stronger the association of the cs and the us a cs ( cs+ ) is paired with a us until asymptotic cr levels are reached typically , organisms show crs on cs+/us trials , but stop responding on cs+/cs− trials summation test for conditioned inhibition : the cs- from phase 2 is presented together with a new cs+ that was conditioned as in phase 1 conditioned inhibition is found if the response is less to the cs+/cs- pair than it is to the cs+ alone a cs ( cs1 ) is paired with a us a compound cs ( cs1+cs2 ) is paired with a us a separate test for each cs ( cs1 and cs2 ) is performed according to pavlov , conditioning does not involve the acquisition of any new behavior , but rather the tendency to respond in old ways to new stimuli pavlov himself observed that a dog 's saliva produced as a cr differed in composition from that produced as a ur ( however , it has been proposed that only when the ur does not involve the central nervous system are the cr and the ur opposites the model predicts a number of important phenomena , but it also fails in important ways , thus leading to a number of modifications and alternative models however , after conditioning , the subject is no longer surprised , because the cs predicts the coming of the us in this model the degree of learning is measured by how well the cs predicts the us , which is given by the '' associative strength '' of the cs in the equation , v represents the current associative strength of the cs , and ∆v is the change in this strength that happens on a given trial how the equation predicts various experimental results is explained in following sections the r–w model measures conditioning by assigning an '' associative strength '' to the cs and other local stimuli pairing the cs and the us causes a gradual increase in the associative strength of the cs finally , the difference between the associative strength of the cs ( plus any that may accrue to other stimuli ) and the maximum strength reaches zero on an extinction trial the us fails to occur after the cs learning is controlled by the difference between this total associative strength and the strength supported by the us in blocking ( see '' phenomena '' above ) , cs1 is paired with a us until conditioning is complete since there is no difference between what is predicted and what happens , no new learning happens on the additional trials with cs1+cs2 , hence cs2 later yields no response one of the main reasons for the importance of the r–w model is that it is relatively simple and makes clear predictions however , no single model seems to account for all the phenomena that experiments have produced latent inhibition might happen because a subject stops focusing on a cs that is seen frequently before it is paired with a us for example : in the r–w model , the associative strength of a cs tells us how strongly that cs predicts a us both fear and eyeblink conditioning involve a neutral stimulus , frequently a tone , becoming paired with an unconditioned stimulus

classical conditioning occurs when a conditioned stimulus ( cs ) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus ( us ) usually , the conditioned stimulus is a neutral stimulus ( e.g , the sound of a tuning fork ) , the unconditioned stimulus is biologically potent ( e.g , the taste of food ) and the unconditioned response ( ur ) to the unconditioned stimulus is an unlearned reflex response ( e.g after pairing is repeated the organism exhibits a conditioned response ( cr ) to the conditioned stimulus when the conditioned stimulus is presented alone usually the conditioned response is similar to the unconditioned response , but sometimes it is quite different for this and other reasons , most learning theorists suggest that the conditioned stimulus comes to signal or predict the unconditioned stimulus , and go on to analyze the consequences of this signal classical conditioning differs from operant conditioning : in classical conditioning , behaviors are modified through the association of stimuli as described above , whereas in operant conditioning behaviors are modified by the effect they produce ( i.e he redirected the animal 's digestive fluids outside the body , where they could be measured pavlov called the dogs ' anticipatory salivation '' psychic secretion '' putting these informal observations to an experimental test , pavlov presented a stimulus ( e.g the conditioned response ( cr ) is the response to the conditioned stimulus , whereas the unconditioned response ( ur ) corresponds to the unconditioned stimulus pavlov reported many basic facts about conditioning ; for example , he found that learning occurred most rapidly when the interval between the cs and the appearance of the us was relatively short in fact , the cr may be any new response to the previously neutral cs that can be clearly linked to experience with the conditional relationship of cs and us it was also thought that repeated pairings are necessary for conditioning to emerge , but many crs can be learned with a single trial , especially in fear conditioning and taste aversion learning learning is fastest in forward conditioning during forward conditioning , the onset of the cs precedes the onset of the us in order to signal that the us will follow two common forms of forward conditioning are delay and trace conditioning delay conditioning : in delay conditioning , the cs is presented and is overlapped by the presentation of the us instead , the cs begins and ends before the us is presented if in the above buzzer example , the puff came a second after the sound of the buzzer stopped , that would be trace conditioning , with a trace or conditioning interval of one second during simultaneous conditioning , the cs and us are presented and terminated at the same time first a neutral stimulus ( '' cs1 '' ) comes to signal a us through forward conditioning for example : a bell might be paired with food until the bell elicits salivation unlike the usual conditioning procedure , in which the cs precedes the us , the conditioned response given to the cs tends to be inhibitory this suggests that animals have a biological clock that can serve as a cs the example below shows the temporal conditioning , as us such as food to a hungry mouse is simply delivered on a regular time schedule such as every thirty seconds in this procedure , the cs is paired with the us , but the us also occurs at other times during acquisition , the cs and us are paired as described above the speed of conditioning depends on a number of factors , such as the nature and strength of both the cs and the us , previous experience and the animal 's motivational state this causes a reduction in the conditioned response to the cs these procedures are the following : reacquisition : if the cs is again paired with the us , a cr is again acquired , but this second acquisition usually happens much faster than the first one disinhibition : if the cs is tested just after extinction and an intense but associatively neutral stimulus has occurred , there may be a temporary recovery of the conditioned response to the cs reinstatement : if the us used in conditioning is presented to a subject in the same place where conditioning and extinction occurred , but without the cs being present , the cs often elicits a response when it is tested later usually the more similar the test stimulus is to the cs the stronger the cr will be to the test stimulus conversely , the more the test stimulus differs from the cs , the weaker the cr will be , or the more it will differ from that previously observed this can be brought about by , for example , pairing cs1 with an effective us and presenting cs2 with no us this is one of the most common ways to measure the strength of learning in classical conditioning a typical example of this procedure is as follows : a rat first learns to press a lever through operant conditioning then , in a series of trials , the rat is exposed to a cs , a light or a noise , followed by the us , a mild electric shock the rate of pressing during the cs measures the strength of classical conditioning ; that is , the slower the rat presses , the stronger the association of the cs and the us ( slow pressing indicates a '' fear '' conditioned response , and it is an example of a conditioned emotional response ; see section below conditioned inhibition is found if the response is less to the cs+/cs- pair than it is to the cs+ alone retardation test for conditioned inhibition : the cs- from phase 2 is paired with the us the blocking effect is observed in a lack of conditional response to cs2 , suggesting that the first phase of training blocked the acquisition of the second cs however , conditioning has also been studied in invertebrates , and very important data on the neural basis of conditioning has come from experiments on the sea slug , aplysia thus , he theorized that the cs merely substitutes for the us in evoking the reflex response this explanation is called the stimulus-substitution theory of conditioning the rescorla–wagner ( r–w ) model is a relatively simple yet powerful model of conditioning the model predicts a number of important phenomena , but it also fails in important ways , thus leading to a number of modifications and alternative models however , because much of the theoretical research on conditioning in the past 40 years has been instigated by this model or reactions to it , the r–w model deserves a brief description here a key idea behind the r–w model is that a cs signals or predicts the us one might say that before conditioning , the subject is surprised by the us the model also predicts a number of other phenomena , see main article on the model \delta v \alpha\beta ( \lambda - \sigma v ) this is the rescorla-wagner equation the above equation is solved repeatedly to predict the course of learning over many such trials in this model the degree of learning is measured by how well the cs predicts the us , which is given by the '' associative strength '' of the cs λ is the maximum associative strength that a given us will support ; its value is usually set to 1 on trials when the us is present , and 0 when the us is absent how the equation predicts various experimental results is explained in following sections . r–w model : acquisition for example : in the r–w model , the associative strength of a cs tells us how strongly that cs predicts a us forms of classical conditioning that are used for this purpose include , among others , fear conditioning , eyeblink conditioning , and the foot contraction conditioning of hermissenda crassicornis , a sea-slug in a typical experiment , a rat is presented with sound-food pairings ( classical conditioning ) any type of music , such as christmas music , that triggers certain sweet memories are related to classical conditioning as well .

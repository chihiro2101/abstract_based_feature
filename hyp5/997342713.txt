polymorphism refers to the ability to overload the name of a function with multiple behaviors based on which object ( s ) are passed to it conventional message passing discriminates only on the first object and considers that to be '' sending a message '' to that object the object-oriented approach is an evolution of good design practices that go back to the very beginning of computer programming object-orientation is simply the logical extension of older techniques such as structured programming and abstract data types an object is an abstract data type with the addition of polymorphism and inheritance rather than structure programs as code and data , an object-oriented system integrates the two using the concept of an '' object '' an object has state ( data ) and behavior ( code ) immutable object : an object set up with a fixed state at creation time and which does not change afterward first-class object : an object that can be used without restriction metaobject : an object from which other objects can be created ( compare with a class , which is not necessarily an object ) prototype object : a specialized metaobject from which other objects can be created by copying god object : an object that knows or does too much ( it is an example of an anti-pattern ) singleton object : an object that is the only instance of its class during the lifetime of the program filter object : an object that receives a stream of data as its input and transforms it into the object 's output object lifetime object copy design pattern ( computer science ) business object ( computer science ) actor model

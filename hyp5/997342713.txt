an object is an abstract data type with the addition of polymorphism and inheritance rather than structure programs as code and data , an object-oriented system integrates the two using the concept of an '' object '' there may be further refinements for example under electronic products : cd player , dvd player , etc the following object descriptions are examples of some of the most common design patterns for objects first-class object : an object that can be used without restriction container object : an object that can contain other objects metaobject : an object from which other objects can be created ( compare with a class , which is not necessarily an object ) prototype object : a specialized metaobject from which other objects can be created by copying god object : an object that knows or does too much ( it is an example of an anti-pattern ) singleton object : an object that is the only instance of its class during the lifetime of the program filter object : an object that receives a stream of data as its input and transforms it into the object 's output often the input and output streams are streams of characters , but these also may be streams of arbitrary objects a standard method to package distributed objects is via an interface definition language ( idl ) live distributed objects ( or simply live objects ) ostrowski , k object lifetime object copy design pattern ( computer science ) business object ( computer science ) actor model

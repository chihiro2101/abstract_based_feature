little is known of the music of brazil before the area 's first encounter with portuguese explorers on 22 april 1500 during the colonial period , documents detail the musical activities of the major roman catholic cathedrals and the parlors of the upper classes , but data about musical life outside these domains are sparse further registration of musical activity in brazil came from the activities of two jesuit priests in 1549 one century later , the reduções of the southern brazil , which were founded by spaniard jesuits , had a strong cultural development , where some music schools were founded some of the reports of that time show the fascination of the indigenous people for european music ( portuguese ) the indigenous people also took part in the music , with both the construction of musical instruments and practice of vocal and instrumental performance in the 18th century , there was intense musical activity in all the more developed regions of brazil , with their moderately stable institutional and educational structures the previously few private orchestras became more common and the churches presented a great variety of music some of the most famous pieces of this period are the magnificat by manoel dias de oliveira and the our lady 's antiphon by lobo de mesquita in ouro preto about 250 musicians were active , and in all of the territory of minas gerais almost a thousand musicians were active a crucial factor for the changes in the musical life was the arrival of the portuguese royal family to rio de janeiro in 1808 until then , rio de janeiro was musically similar to other cultural centers of brazil but was even less important than minas gerais the presence of the portuguese royal family , in exile , radically changed this situation , as the capela real of rio de janeiro was established the king john vi of portugal brought with him to brazil the great musical library from the house of bragança , one of the best of europe at that time , and ordered the arrival of musicians from lisbon and the castrati from italy , re-ordering the royal chapel josé maurício nunes garcia , the first of the great brazilian composers , emerged at this time he also composed the first opera written in brazil , le due gemelle ( the two twins ) , with text in italian , but the music is now lost other important composers of this period are gabriel fernandes da trindade , who composed the only brazilian chamber music from the 19th century which has survived to the present times , castagna , paulo and , despite the love of peter i of brazil for the music – he was also author of some musical pieces like the brazilian independence anthem – the difficult financial situation did n't allow many luxuries in spite of his few resources , he founded the musical conservatory of rio de janeiro other important composer of this time is elias álvares lobo , who wrote the opera a noite de são joão , the first brazilian opera with text in portuguese one of the most outstanding name of this period was leopoldo miguez , who followed the wagnerian style and henrique oswald , who incorporated elements of the french impressionism in the beginning of the 20th century , there was a movement for creating an authentically brazilian music , with less influences of the european culture some composers like brasílio itiberê da cunha , luciano gallet and alexandre levy , despite having a european formation , included some typically brazilian elements in their works other composers of brazilian national music of this era include oscar lorenzo fernández , radamés gnattali , camargo guarnieri , osvaldo lacerda , francisco mignone , and ernesto nazareth this group was integrated by composers like cláudio santoro , césar guerra-peixe , eunice catunda and edino krieger the movement edited a magazine and presented a series of radio programs showing their fundaments and works of contemporary music later , guerra-peixe and santoro followed an independent way , centered in the regional music other composers , who used freely the previous styles were marlos nobre , almeida prado , and armando albuquerque , who created their own styles this movement was called música nova ( new music ) and was led by gilberto mendes and willy corrêa de oliveira carlos gomes was the first composer on non-european origin to achieve wide recognition in the classical music environment of the golden age of opera in italy bossa nova was created as anti-opera in a time when opera seemed to represent the art-form of the elite nowadays , brazilian music follows the guidelines of both experimentalism and traditional music the most famous brazilian orchestra is probably the são paulo state symphony orchestra , currently under conductor thierry fischer there are also regular operas scheduled every year in cities such as são paulo and rio de janeiro some of the most famous brazilian conductors are roberto minczuk , john neschling and isaac karabtchevsky in the 1980s , a wave of brazilian heavy metal bands gained public attention the most commercially successful of these was sepultura , founded in são paulo in 1983 , preceded by dorsal atlantica and followed by sarcofago the brazilian music industry opened up to international styles and this has allowed for both foreign and local genres to co-exist and identify people '' brazil is a regionally divided country with a rich cultural and musical diversity among states as such , musicians in the country choose to define their local heritage differently depending on where they come from while there are some artists who continue to perform rock and western pop , there are now just as many contemporaries playing a fusion of african and european influences with those from across the americas some artists have even become influenced by asian music , noticing some parallels between music from the north-east of brazil and music from india much of the area 's folk music imitates the sounds of the amazon rainforest the earliest music in what is now brazil must have been that of the native peoples of the area the afro-brazilian sport of capoeira is never played without its own music , which is usually considered to be a call-and-response type of folk music mpb 's second stage – after the split bossa nova ( 1959 ) / jovem guarda ( 1965 ) / tropicalismo ( both 1967 ) – refers to mainstream brazilian pop music antonio carlos jobim and other composers helped further develop this fusion of jazz harmonies and a smoother , often slower , samba beat , which developed at the beach neighborhoods of ipanema and , later , the copacabana nightclubs many funk artists have openly associated themselves with black movements and often in the lyrics of their songs , comment on race relations and openly express black pride

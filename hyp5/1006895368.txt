little is known of the music of brazil before the area 's first encounter with portuguese explorers on 22 april 1500 during the colonial period , documents detail the musical activities of the major roman catholic cathedrals and the parlors of the upper classes , but data about musical life outside these domains are sparse some information is available in writings left by such travellers as jean de léry , who lived in brazil from 1557 to 1558 and produced the first known transcriptions of native american music : two chants of the tupinambá , near rio de janeiro further registration of musical activity in brazil came from the activities of two jesuit priests in 1549 ten years later , they had already founded settlements for indigenous people ( the reduções ) , with a musical-educational structure one century later , the reduções of the southern brazil , which were founded by spaniard jesuits , had a strong cultural development , where some music schools were founded some of the reports of that time show the fascination of the indigenous people for european music ( portuguese ) the indigenous people also took part in the music , with both the construction of musical instruments and practice of vocal and instrumental performance in the 18th century , there was intense musical activity in all the more developed regions of brazil , with their moderately stable institutional and educational structures a crucial factor for the changes in the musical life was the arrival of the portuguese royal family to rio de janeiro in 1808 until then , rio de janeiro was musically similar to other cultural centers of brazil but was even less important than minas gerais the presence of the portuguese royal family , in exile , radically changed this situation , as the capela real of rio de janeiro was established later , john vi ordered the construction of a sumptuous theater , called the royal theater of são joão the secular music had the presence of marcos portugal , who was designated as the official composer of the household , and of sigismund von neukomm , who contributed with his own work and brought the works of the austrian composers wolfgang

times , castagna , paulo in 1821 , john vi went back to lisbon , taking with him the household , and the cultural life in rio de janeiro became empty and , despite the love of peter i of brazil for the music – he was also author of some musical pieces like the brazilian independence anthem – the difficult financial situation did n't allow many luxuries he was the author of the brazilian national anthem 's melody the most outstanding brazilian composer of this period was antônio carlos gomes , who composed italian-styled operas with national themes , such as il guarany ( based on josé de alencar 's novel o guarani ) and lo schiavo other important composer of this time is elias álvares lobo , who wrote the opera a noite de são joão , the first brazilian opera with text in portuguese

theatro municipal ( são paulo ) , and many others at the end of the 19th century , the greatest composers for the symphonic music were revealed one of the most outstanding name of this period was leopoldo miguez , who followed the wagnerian style and henrique oswald , who incorporated elements of the french impressionism some composers like brasílio itiberê da cunha , luciano gallet and

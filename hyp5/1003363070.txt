bubble memory is largely the brainchild of a single person , andrew bobeck bobeck had worked on many kinds of magnetics-related projects through the 1960s , and two of his projects put him in a particularly good position for the development of bubble memory the first was the development of the first magnetic core memory system driven by a transistor-based controller , and the second was the development of twistor memory twistor is essentially a version of core memory that replaces the '' cores '' with a piece of magnetic tape at & t had great hopes for twistor , believing it would greatly reduce the cost of computer memory and put them in an industry leading position instead , dram memories came onto the market in the early 1970s that rapidly replaced all previous random access memory systems conventional magnetic materials , like the magnetic tape used in twistor , allowed the magnetic signal to be placed at any location and to move in any direction the memory device and method of propagation were described in a paper presented at the 13th annual conference on magnetism and magnetic materials , boston , massachusetts , 15 september 1967 this led to the possibility of making a memory system similar to the moving-domain twistor concept , but using a single block of magnetic material instead of many twistor wires when a small magnetic field was applied , they would become magnetized , and the bubbles would '' stick '' to one end bubble memory is a non-volatile memory in fact , it seemed that bubble memory would soon be the only form of memory used in the vast majority of applications , with the high-performance market being the only one they could not serve one application was konami 's bubble system arcade video game system , introduced in 1984 grid compass 1101 computer , oldcomputers.net bubble memory was also used on the quantel mirage dvm8000/1 vfx system

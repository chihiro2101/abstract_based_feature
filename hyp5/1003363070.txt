bobeck had worked on many kinds of magnetics-related projects through the 1960s , and two of his projects put him in a particularly good position for the development of bubble memory the first was the development of the first magnetic core memory system driven by a transistor-based controller , and the second was the development of twistor memory twistor is essentially a version of core memory that replaces the '' cores '' with a piece of magnetic tape if used properly , it allowed the stored bits to be pushed down the tape and pop off the end , forming a type of delay line memory , but one where the propagation of the fields was under computer control , as opposed to automatically advancing at a set rate defined by the materials used conventional magnetic materials , like the magnetic tape used in twistor , allowed the magnetic signal to be placed at any location and to move in any direction the memory device and method of propagation were described in a paper presented at the 13th annual conference on magnetism and magnetic materials , boston , massachusetts , 15 september 1967 the device used anisotropic thin magnetic films that required different magnetic pulse combinations for orthogonal propagation directions this led to the possibility of making a memory system similar to the moving-domain twistor concept , but using a single block of magnetic material instead of many twistor wires with the magnetic tape materials used in twistor , the data had to be stored on relatively large patches known as domains with orthoferrite , if the patch was written and then a magnetic field was applied to the entire material , the patch would shrink down into a tiny circle , which he called a bubble liebmann memorial award by the ieee with the following citation : for the concept and development of single-walled magnetic domains ( magnetic bubbles ) , and for recognition of their importance to memory technology by the early 1980s , however , bubble memory technology became a dead end with the introduction of hard disk systems offering higher storage densities , higher access speeds , and lower costs nicolet used bubble memory modules for saving waveforms in their model 3091 oscilloscope , as did hp who offered a 1595 bubble memory option that extended the memory on their model 3561a digital signal analyzer grid compass 1101 computer , oldcomputers.net bubble memory was also used on the quantel mirage dvm8000/1 vfx system

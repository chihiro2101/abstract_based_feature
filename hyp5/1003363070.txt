bobeck had worked on many kinds of magnetics-related projects through the 1960s , and two of his projects put him in a particularly good position for the development of bubble memory the first was the development of the first magnetic core memory system driven by a transistor-based controller , and the second was the development of twistor memory twistor is essentially a version of core memory that replaces the '' cores '' with a piece of magnetic tape at & t had great hopes for twistor , believing it would greatly reduce the cost of computer memory and put them in an industry leading position if used properly , it allowed the stored bits to be pushed down the tape and pop off the end , forming a type of delay line memory , but one where the propagation of the fields was under computer control , as opposed to automatically advancing at a set rate defined by the materials used the memory density of twistor was a function of the size of the wires ; the length of any one wire determined how many bits it held , and many such wires were laid side-by-side to produce a larger memory system conventional magnetic materials , like the magnetic tape used in twistor , allowed the magnetic signal to be placed at any location and to move in any direction this led to the possibility of making a memory system similar to the moving-domain twistor concept , but using a single block of magnetic material instead of many twistor wires with orthoferrite , if the patch was written and then a magnetic field was applied to the entire material , the patch would shrink down into a tiny circle , which he called a bubble liebmann memorial award by the ieee with the following citation : for the concept and development of single-walled magnetic domains ( magnetic bubbles ) , and for recognition of their importance to memory technology bubble memory is a non-volatile memory in fact , it seemed that bubble memory would soon be the only form of memory used in the vast majority of applications , with the high-performance market being the only one they could not serve by the early 1980s , however , bubble memory technology became a dead end with the introduction of hard disk systems offering higher storage densities , higher access speeds , and lower costs sharp used bubble memory in their pc 5000 series , a laptop-like portable computer from 1983

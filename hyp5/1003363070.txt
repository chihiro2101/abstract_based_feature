bobeck had worked on many kinds of magnetics-related projects through the 1960s , and two of his projects put him in a particularly good position for the development of bubble memory the first was the development of the first magnetic core memory system driven by a transistor-based controller , and the second was the development of twistor memory twistor is essentially a version of core memory that replaces the '' cores '' with a piece of magnetic tape at & t had great hopes for twistor , believing it would greatly reduce the cost of computer memory and put them in an industry leading position one interesting side-effect of the twistor concept was noticed in production ; under certain conditions , passing a current through one of the electrical wires running inside the tape would cause the magnetic fields on the tape to move in the direction of the current the memory density of twistor was a function of the size of the wires ; the length of any one wire determined how many bits it held , and many such wires were laid side-by-side to produce a larger memory system the memory device and method of propagation were described in a paper presented at the 13th annual conference on magnetism and magnetic materials , boston , massachusetts , 15 september 1967 this led to the possibility of making a memory system similar to the moving-domain twistor concept , but using a single block of magnetic material instead of many twistor wires with orthoferrite , if the patch was written and then a magnetic field was applied to the entire material , the patch would shrink down into a tiny circle , which he called a bubble the next problem was to make them move to the proper location where they could be read back out : twistor was a wire and there was only one place to go , but in a 2d sheet things would not be so easy when a small magnetic field was applied , they would become magnetized , and the bubbles would '' stick '' to one end bubble memory is a non-volatile memory in fact , it seemed that bubble memory would soon be the only form of memory used in the vast majority of applications , with the high-performance market being the only one they could not serve nicolet used bubble memory modules for saving waveforms in their model 3091 oscilloscope , as did hp who offered a 1595 bubble memory option that extended the memory on their model 3561a digital signal analyzer

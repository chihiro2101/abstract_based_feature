bubble memory is largely the brainchild of a single person , andrew bobeck bobeck had worked on many kinds of magnetics-related projects through the 1960s , and two of his projects put him in a particularly good position for the development of bubble memory the first was the development of the first magnetic core memory system driven by a transistor-based controller , and the second was the development of twistor memory twistor is essentially a version of core memory that replaces the '' cores '' with a piece of magnetic tape at & t had great hopes for twistor , believing it would greatly reduce the cost of computer memory and put them in an industry leading position the memory density of twistor was a function of the size of the wires ; the length of any one wire determined how many bits it held , and many such wires were laid side-by-side to produce a larger memory system this led to the possibility of making a memory system similar to the moving-domain twistor concept , but using a single block of magnetic material instead of many twistor wires with orthoferrite , if the patch was written and then a magnetic field was applied to the entire material , the patch would shrink down into a tiny circle , which he called a bubble liebmann memorial award by the ieee with the following citation : for the concept and development of single-walled magnetic domains ( magnetic bubbles ) , and for recognition of their importance to memory technology bubble memory is a non-volatile memory in fact , it seemed that bubble memory would soon be the only form of memory used in the vast majority of applications , with the high-performance market being the only one they could not serve texas instruments introduced the first commercial product that incorporated bubble memory in 1977 nicolet used bubble memory modules for saving waveforms in their model 3091 oscilloscope , as did hp who offered a 1595 bubble memory option that extended the memory on their model 3561a digital signal analyzer grid compass 1101 computer , oldcomputers.net bubble memory was also used on the quantel mirage dvm8000/1 vfx system

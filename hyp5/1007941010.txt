the delivery of the in 1883 and the acquisition of other armored warships by brazil , argentina , and chile shortly afterward alarmed the united states government , as the brazilian navy was now the most powerful in the western hemisphere herbert characterized the situation thus : '' if all this old navy of ours were drawn up in battle array in mid-ocean and confronted by the riachuelo it is doubtful whether a single vessel bearing the american flag would get into port '' the navy advisory board , confronted with the possibility of hostile ironclads operating off the american coast , began planning for a pair of ships to protect that coast in 1884 both had to fit within existing docks and had to have a shallow draft to enable them to use all the major american ports and bases they were both optimized for end-on fire and had their gun turrets sponsoned out over the sides of the ship and echeloned to allow them to fire across the deck , much like the battleships riachuelo and the first ship , laid down for the then-traditional cruiser mission of battleship substitute on overseas deployment and armed with four guns , became the other , armed with two guns , became texas , the first ship named in honor of that state to be built by the united states the navy department conducted an international design competition for texas and the winner was the naval construction & armaments co the winning design placed texass forward turret on the port side and her aft turret to starboard the need for cross-deck fire caused the superstructure to be separated into three pieces to allow for each gun to fire between the sections of the superstructure this significantly limited the gun 's ability to fire to the opposite beam as the superstructure still restricted each gun 's arc of fire furthermore , neither the deck nor the superstructure was reinforced to withstand the muzzle blast as the gun fired , as demonstrated during the battle of santiago de cuba when her starboard deck was damaged even five years before texas was complete , the blast effects from end-on fire were considered prohibitive and en echelon mounting of main guns was abandoned in european navies her hull had two wing compartments on each side of her machinery spaces as well as a centerline longitudinal watertight bulkhead separating the engines and boilers she had a metacentric height of and was fitted with a ram bow texass main armament consisted of two /35 caliber mark i guns mounted in single mark 2 hydraulically powered turrets inside her armored redoubt initially , they could only be loaded at one positions , dead-ahead and at 0° elevation , but they were modified to load at all angles of train just before the start of the spanish–american war the two main deck guns were 35-caliber weapons , while the casemate guns were 30-caliber guns in addition , two 37-mm driggs-schroeder one-pounder guns were mounted in each fighting top texas carried four torpedo tubes , all above water one tube each was in the bow and stern and another on each side , towards the rear of the hull the deck above it was two inches thick the lateral hydraulic pipes that ran along the underside of the gun deck were initially unprotected , but armored tubes were installed to protect them during texass 1902 refit no light armor was fitted above the main belt or at either end of the ship this was not considered a significant threat at the time texas was designed but would become so within a few years when drydocked in the new york navy yard for the first time after her trials several structural flaws came to light in february 1897 , she left the atlantic for a brief cruise to the gulf coast ports of galveston , texas , and new orleans the two ships opened fire just after 14:00 and ceased fire about an hour and 16 & nbsp ; minutes later , having reduced the fort to impotency '' texas was lightly damaged during the battle by a single high explosive shell that hit her on the starboard side above the main deck , immediately forward of the ash hoist texas was decommissioned for a lengthy refit on 3 november 1900 at the norfolk navy yard but was commissioned again on 3 november 1902 '' a cage mast , a duplicate of those used on the dreadnoughts , was built atop the san marcoss remains in 1912 and tested against shells fired by the monitor from a range of on 21 august 1912 san marcos was used for gunnery practice throughout world war ii , although generally as an anchor for a canvas target screen

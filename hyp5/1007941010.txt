the delivery of the in 1883 and the acquisition of other armored warships by brazil , argentina , and chile shortly afterward alarmed the united states government , as the brazilian navy was now the most powerful in the western hemisphere the united states navy now felt capable only of defending its own ports '' the navy advisory board , confronted with the possibility of hostile ironclads operating off the american coast , began planning for a pair of ships to protect that coast in 1884 both had to fit within existing docks and had to have a shallow draft to enable them to use all the major american ports and bases they were both optimized for end-on fire and had their gun turrets sponsoned out over the sides of the ship and echeloned to allow them to fire across the deck , much like the battleships riachuelo and the first ship , laid down for the then-traditional cruiser mission of battleship substitute on overseas deployment and armed with four guns , became the other , armed with two guns , became texas , the first ship named in honor of that state to be built by the united states the navy department conducted an international design competition for texas and the winner was the naval construction & armaments co the need for cross-deck fire caused the superstructure to be separated into three pieces to allow for each gun to fire between the sections of the superstructure this significantly limited the gun 's ability to fire to the opposite beam as the superstructure still restricted each gun 's arc of fire furthermore , neither the deck nor the superstructure was reinforced to withstand the muzzle blast as the gun fired , as demonstrated during the battle of santiago de cuba when her starboard deck was damaged even five years before texas was complete , the blast effects from end-on fire were considered prohibitive and en echelon mounting of main guns was abandoned in european navies texas was long overall her hull had two wing compartments on each side of her machinery spaces as well as a centerline longitudinal watertight bulkhead separating the engines and boilers her double bottom protected most of her hull and extended up the side to the lower edge of the armor deck texass main armament consisted of two /35 caliber mark i guns mounted in single mark 2 hydraulically powered turrets inside her armored redoubt these guns had a maximum elevation of 15° and could depress to −5° initially , they could only be loaded at one positions , dead-ahead and at 0° elevation , but they were modified to load at all angles of train just before the start of the spanish–american war four of the six guns were mounted in casemates in the hull and the other two were mounted on the main deck in open pivot positions the two main deck guns were 35-caliber weapons , while the casemate guns were 30-caliber guns they fired a shell weighing about at a muzzle velocity of about to a range about they had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute texas carried four torpedo tubes , all above water a 12-inch-thick diagonal armored citadel on the gun deck protected the turret machinery and the supports of the conning tower no light armor was fitted above the main belt or at either end of the ship this was not considered a significant threat at the time texas was designed but would become so within a few years after a return to key west for coal , texas arrived off santiago de cuba on 27 may '' texas was lightly damaged during the battle by a single high explosive shell that hit her on the starboard side above the main deck , immediately forward of the ash hoist texas arrived in new york on 31 july by 1910 , she had lost her revolving cannon and one more one-pdr gun in exchange for two additional six-pounder guns '' on 15 february 1911 , her name was changed to san marcos to allow the name texas to be assigned to uss texas ( bb-35 ) san marcos was used for gunnery practice throughout world war ii , although generally as an anchor for a canvas target screen

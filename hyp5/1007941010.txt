the delivery of the in 1883 and the acquisition of other armored warships by brazil , argentina , and chile shortly afterward alarmed the united states government , as the brazilian navy was now the most powerful in the western hemisphere the united states navy now felt capable only of defending its own ports '' the navy advisory board , confronted with the possibility of hostile ironclads operating off the american coast , began planning for a pair of ships to protect that coast in 1884 both had to fit within existing docks and had to have a shallow draft to enable them to use all the major american ports and bases they were both optimized for end-on fire and had their gun turrets sponsoned out over the sides of the ship and echeloned to allow them to fire across the deck , much like the battleships riachuelo and the first ship , laid down for the then-traditional cruiser mission of battleship substitute on overseas deployment and armed with four guns , became the other , armed with two guns , became texas , the first ship named in honor of that state to be built by the united states the navy department conducted an international design competition for texas and the winner was the naval construction & armaments co the winning design placed texass forward turret on the port side and her aft turret to starboard the need for cross-deck fire caused the superstructure to be separated into three pieces to allow for each gun to fire between the sections of the superstructure this significantly limited the gun 's ability to fire to the opposite beam as the superstructure still restricted each gun 's arc of fire furthermore , neither the deck nor the superstructure was reinforced to withstand the muzzle blast as the gun fired , as demonstrated during the battle of santiago de cuba when her starboard deck was damaged even five years before texas was complete , the blast effects from end-on fire were considered prohibitive and en echelon mounting of main guns was abandoned in european navies her double bottom protected most of her hull and extended up the side to the lower edge of the armor deck four of the six guns were mounted in casemates in the hull and the other two were mounted on the main deck in open pivot positions the two main deck guns were 35-caliber weapons , while the casemate guns were 30-caliber guns they had a maximum range less than when fired at maximum elevation the main waterline belt , made of harvey armor , had a maximum thickness of 12 & nbsp ; inches and tapered to at its lower edge the deck above it was two inches thick the lateral hydraulic pipes that ran along the underside of the gun deck were initially unprotected , but armored tubes were installed to protect them during texass 1902 refit along the center of the ship , they were one inch thick , but increased to two inches closer to the sides of the ship this made texas highly vulnerable to rapid-fire guns using high-explosive shells this was not considered a significant threat at the time texas was designed but would become so within a few years when drydocked in the new york navy yard for the first time after her trials several structural flaws came to light the floors had buckled their brackets and the cement near the keel had cracked the board determined that further strengthening of her hull was needed , but the exact measures taken are not known , although they would cost 39,450 and take 100 working days early in the spring , war between the united states and spain erupted over conditions in cuba and the supposed spanish destruction of the battleship in havana harbor in february 1898 '' the defeat of cervera 's fleet helped to seal the doom of santiago de cuba '' '' in late november , texas moved south to hampton roads where she arrived on 2 december during 1904 her armament was upgraded when she exchanged her four /30 & nbsp ; cal guns for more powerful 35-caliber weapons and two one-pounder guns were landed '' on 15 february 1911 , her name was changed to san marcos to allow the name texas to be assigned to uss texas ( bb-35 ) file : uss texas at grants tomb , 1898.ogv uss texas at grant 's tomb , 3 september 1898

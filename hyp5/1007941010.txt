the united states navy now felt capable only of defending its own ports '' the navy advisory board , confronted with the possibility of hostile ironclads operating off the american coast , began planning for a pair of ships to protect that coast in 1884 both had to fit within existing docks and had to have a shallow draft to enable them to use all the major american ports and bases they were both optimized for end-on fire and had their gun turrets sponsoned out over the sides of the ship and echeloned to allow them to fire across the deck , much like the battleships riachuelo and the first ship , laid down for the then-traditional cruiser mission of battleship substitute on overseas deployment and armed with four guns , became the other , armed with two guns , became texas , the first ship named in honor of that state to be built by the united states the navy department conducted an international design competition for texas and the winner was the naval construction & armaments co the winning design placed texass forward turret on the port side and her aft turret to starboard the need for cross-deck fire caused the superstructure to be separated into three pieces to allow for each gun to fire between the sections of the superstructure this significantly limited the gun 's ability to fire to the opposite beam as the superstructure still restricted each gun 's arc of fire furthermore , neither the deck nor the superstructure was reinforced to withstand the muzzle blast as the gun fired , as demonstrated during the battle of santiago de cuba when her starboard deck was damaged construction by this time was too far advanced for such a plan , however , and navy secretary benjamin tracy limited the board to detail improvements her hull had two wing compartments on each side of her machinery spaces as well as a centerline longitudinal watertight bulkhead separating the engines and boilers she carried two edison electric dynamos to power her searchlights and provide interior lighting texass main armament consisted of two /35 caliber mark i guns mounted in single mark 2 hydraulically powered turrets inside her armored redoubt these guns had a maximum elevation of 15° and could depress to −5° four of the six guns were mounted in casemates in the hull and the other two were mounted on the main deck in open pivot positions the two main deck guns were 35-caliber weapons , while the casemate guns were 30-caliber guns they fired a shell weighing about at a muzzle velocity of about at a rate of 20 rounds per minute in addition , two 37-mm driggs-schroeder one-pounder guns were mounted in each fighting top texas carried four torpedo tubes , all above water one tube each was in the bow and stern and another on each side , towards the rear of the hull she was originally intended to carry two small steam torpedo boats , each with a one-pounder gun , and a trainable torpedo tube , but they were cancelled after the poor performance of the boat built for the maine the main waterline belt , made of harvey armor , had a maximum thickness of 12 & nbsp ; inches and tapered to at its lower edge no light armor was fitted above the main belt or at either end of the ship this was not considered a significant threat at the time texas was designed but would become so within a few years when drydocked in the new york navy yard for the first time after her trials several structural flaws came to light however , the board wished to know what effect these changes would have on the draft , stability , and metacentric height of the texas the board received a reply on 4 february that they would increase her displacement by , deepen her draft by less than and raise her metacentric height to after a return to key west for coal , texas arrived off santiago de cuba on 27 may on 3 july , she was steaming off santiago de cuba when the spanish fleet under admiral cervera attempted to escape past the american fleet by 1910 , she had lost her revolving cannon and one more one-pdr gun in exchange for two additional six-pounder guns

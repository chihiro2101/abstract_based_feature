the delivery of the in 1883 and the acquisition of other armored warships by brazil , argentina , and chile shortly afterward alarmed the united states government , as the brazilian navy was now the most powerful in the western hemisphere the united states navy now felt capable only of defending its own ports herbert characterized the situation thus : '' if all this old navy of ours were drawn up in battle array in mid-ocean and confronted by the riachuelo it is doubtful whether a single vessel bearing the american flag would get into port '' the navy advisory board , confronted with the possibility of hostile ironclads operating off the american coast , began planning for a pair of ships to protect that coast in 1884 both had to fit within existing docks and had to have a shallow draft to enable them to use all the major american ports and bases they were both optimized for end-on fire and had their gun turrets sponsoned out over the sides of the ship and echeloned to allow them to fire across the deck , much like the battleships riachuelo and the first ship , laid down for the then-traditional cruiser mission of battleship substitute on overseas deployment and armed with four guns , became the other , armed with two guns , became texas , the first ship named in honor of that state to be built by the united states the navy department conducted an international design competition for texas and the winner was the naval construction & armaments co the need for cross-deck fire caused the superstructure to be separated into three pieces to allow for each gun to fire between the sections of the superstructure this significantly limited the gun 's ability to fire to the opposite beam as the superstructure still restricted each gun 's arc of fire furthermore , neither the deck nor the superstructure was reinforced to withstand the muzzle blast as the gun fired , as demonstrated during the battle of santiago de cuba when her starboard deck was damaged even five years before texas was complete , the blast effects from end-on fire were considered prohibitive and en echelon mounting of main guns was abandoned in european navies her hull had two wing compartments on each side of her machinery spaces as well as a centerline longitudinal watertight bulkhead separating the engines and boilers asymmetric flooding of the wing compartments posed a grave danger to her stability her double bottom protected most of her hull and extended up the side to the lower edge of the armor deck she carried two edison electric dynamos to power her searchlights and provide interior lighting texass main armament consisted of two /35 caliber mark i guns mounted in single mark 2 hydraulically powered turrets inside her armored redoubt four of the six guns were mounted in casemates in the hull and the other two were mounted on the main deck in open pivot positions it angled inwards for at each end , thinning to , to provide protection against raking fire this made texas highly vulnerable to rapid-fire guns using high-explosive shells however , the board wished to know what effect these changes would have on the draft , stability , and metacentric height of the texas the board received a reply on 4 february that they would increase her displacement by , deepen her draft by less than and raise her metacentric height to the ship ran aground near newport , rhode island , in september 1896 a few officers , including future governor of guam alfred walton hinds , were publicly reprimanded while under repairs in new york , the yoke that secured the main injection valve in the starboard engine room broke on 9 november 1896 water pressure unseated the valve and allowed the compartment to flood as the receiving pipe had earlier been removed for repair philip , texas was at key west , readying to prosecute that war '' texas was lightly damaged during the battle by a single high explosive shell that hit her on the starboard side above the main deck , immediately forward of the ash hoist texas was decommissioned for a lengthy refit on 3 november 1900 at the norfolk navy yard but was commissioned again on 3 november 1902 '' on 15 february 1911 , her name was changed to san marcos to allow the name texas to be assigned to uss texas ( bb-35 ) file : uss texas at grants tomb , 1898.ogv uss texas at grant 's tomb , 3 september 1898

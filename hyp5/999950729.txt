godfrey of bouillon was born around 1060 as the second son of eustace ii , count of boulogne , and ida , daughter of the lotharingian duke godfrey the bearded and his first wife , doda however his maternal uncle , godfrey the hunchback , died childless and named his nephew , godfrey of bouillon , as his heir and next in line to his duchy of lower lorraine in fact , lower lorraine was so important to the german kingdom and the holy roman empire that henry iv , the german king and future emperor ( reigned 1084 & ndash ; 1105 ) , decided in 1076 that he would place it in the hands of his own son and give godfrey only bouillon and the margraviate of antwerp as a test of godfrey 's abilities and loyalty godfrey served henry iv loyally , supporting him even when pope gregory vii was battling the german king in the investiture controversy in 1076 he had succeeded as designated heir to the lotharingian lands of his uncle , godfrey the hunchback , and godfrey was struggling to maintain control over the lands that henry iv had not taken away from him as these enemies tried to take away portions of his land , godfrey 's brothers , eustace and baldwin , both came to his aid following these long struggles and proving that he was a loyal subject to henry iv , godfrey finally won back his duchy of lower lorraine in 1087 still , godfrey 's influence in the german kingdom would have been minimal if it had not been for his major role in the first crusade in 1095 pope urban ii called for a crusade to liberate jerusalem from muslim forces and also to aid the byzantine empire , which was under muslim attack with this money he gathered thousands of knights to fight in the holy land as the army of godfrey of bouillon in this he was joined by his older brother , eustace , and his younger brother , baldwin , who had no lands in europe raymond iv , count of toulouse , also known as raymond of saint-gilles , created the largest army at age 55 , raymond was also the oldest and perhaps the best known of the crusader nobles because of his age and fame , raymond expected to be the leader of the entire first crusade in the people 's crusade , beginning in the spring and early summer of 1096 , bands of peasants and low-ranking knights set off early for jerusalem on their own , and persecuted jews during the rhineland massacres godfrey , along with his two brothers , started in august 1096 at the head of an army from lorraine ( some say 40,000 strong ) along '' charlemagne 's road '' , as urban ii seems to have called it ( according to the chronicler robert the monk ) —the road to jerusalem solomon bar simson asserted that godfrey claimed he had never intended to harm jews , but the jews in mainz and cologne each gave him a bribe of 500 silver marks , and godfrey '' assured them of his support and promised them peace '' the pope had called the crusade in order to help the byzantine emperor alexius i fight the islamic turks who were invading his lands from central asia and persia their first major victory , with byzantine soldiers at their side , was at the city of i̇znik , close to constantinople , which the seljuk turks had taken in 1085 before that time , he helped to relieve the vanguard at the battle of dorylaeum after it had been pinned down by the seljuk turks under kilij arslan i , with the help of the other crusader princes in the main force and went on to sack the seljuk camp after this battle and during the trek through asia minor , some sources suggest that godfrey was attacked by a bear and received a serious wound which incapacitated him for a time a muslim force under kerbogha , from the city of mosul , arrived and battled the crusaders , but the christians finally defeated these islamic troops bohemond decided to remain behind in order to secure his new principality ; and godfrey 's younger brother , baldwin , also decided to stay in the north in the crusader state he had established at edessa after months of waiting , the common people on the crusade forced raymond to march on to jerusalem , and godfrey quickly joined him the crusaders would be battling them for the final prize of the first crusade in the siege of jerusalem it was in jerusalem that the legend of godfrey of bouillon was born godfrey and some of his knights were the first to take the walls and enter the city murray , '' the title of godfrey of bouillon as ruler of jerusalem '' , collegium medievale 3 ( 1990 ) , 163–78 ;

godfrey of bouillon was born around 1060 as the second son of eustace ii , count of boulogne , and ida , daughter of the lotharingian duke godfrey the bearded and his first wife , doda however his maternal uncle , godfrey the hunchback , died childless and named his nephew , godfrey of bouillon , as his heir and next in line to his duchy of lower lorraine this duchy was an important one at the time , serving as a buffer between the kingdom of france and the german lands godfrey served henry iv loyally , supporting him even when pope gregory vii was battling the german king in the investiture controversy godfrey fought alongside henry and his forces against the rival forces of rudolf of swabia and also took part in battles in italy when henry iv actually took rome away from the pope a major test of godfrey ’ s leadership skills was shown in his battles to defend his inheritance against a significant array of enemies in 1076 he had succeeded as designated heir to the lotharingian lands of his uncle , godfrey the hunchback , and godfrey was struggling to maintain control over the lands that henry iv had not taken away from him as these enemies tried to take away portions of his land , godfrey 's brothers , eustace and baldwin , both came to his aid following these long struggles and proving that he was a loyal subject to henry iv , godfrey finally won back his duchy of lower lorraine in 1087 still , godfrey 's influence in the german kingdom would have been minimal if it had not been for his major role in the first crusade in 1095 pope urban ii called for a crusade to liberate jerusalem from muslim forces and also to aid the byzantine empire , which was under muslim attack godfrey took out loans on most of his lands , or sold them , to the bishop of liège and the bishop of verdun with this money he gathered thousands of knights to fight in the holy land as the army of godfrey of bouillon godfrey , along with his two brothers , started in august 1096 at the head of an army from lorraine ( some say 40,000 strong ) along '' charlemagne 's road '' , as urban ii seems to have called it ( according to the chronicler robert the monk ) —the road to jerusalem '' after being notified of godfrey 's pledge by a messenger from kalonymus ben meshullam ( the jewish leader in mainz ) , emperor henry iv issued an order prohibiting any harm to the jewish communities the pope had called the crusade in order to help the byzantine emperor alexius i fight the islamic turks who were invading his lands from central asia and persia godfrey and his troops were the second to arrive in constantinople ( after hugh of vermandois ) the crusaders , however , had the main aim of liberating the holy land in palestine from the muslims and reinstating christian rule there godfrey and the other knights agreed to a modified version of this oath , promising to help return some lands to alexius i godfrey and his knights of lorraine played a minor role in the siege of nicaea , with bohemond successfully commanding much of the action before that time , he helped to relieve the vanguard at the battle of dorylaeum after it had been pinned down by the seljuk turks under kilij arslan i , with the help of the other crusader princes in the main force and went on to sack the seljuk camp a muslim force under kerbogha , from the city of mosul , arrived and battled the crusaders , but the christians finally defeated these islamic troops after months of waiting , the common people on the crusade forced raymond to march on to jerusalem , and godfrey quickly joined him the crusaders would be battling them for the final prize of the first crusade in the siege of jerusalem it was in jerusalem that the legend of godfrey of bouillon was born it was an end to three years of fighting by the crusaders , but they had finally achieved what they had set out to do in 1096—to recapture the holy land and , in particular , the city of jerusalem and its holy sites , such as the holy sepulchre , the empty tomb of jesus although it is widely claimed that he took the title advocatus sancti sepulchri ( '' advocate '' or '' defender '' of the holy sepulchre ) , this title is only used in a letter which was not written by godfrey instead , godfrey himself seems to have used the more ambiguous term princeps , or simply retained his title of dux from back home in lower lorraine robert the monk is the only chronicler of the crusade to report that godfrey took the title '' king '' during his short reign , godfrey had to defend the new kingdom of jerusalem against fatimids of egypt , who were defeated at the battle of ascalon in august although the latins came close to capturing ascalon , godfrey 's attempts to prevent raymond of st '' because he had been the first ruler in jerusalem , godfrey of bouillon was idealized in later accounts lawhead godfrey de bouillon , defender of the holy sepulchre , by tom tozer

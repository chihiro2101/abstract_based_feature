like all art forms in indian culture , indian classical music is believed to be a divine art form which originated from the devas and devis ( hindu gods and goddesses ) , moorthy2001 , p17 and is venerated as symbolic of ancient treatises also describe the connection of the origin of the swaras , or notes , to the sounds of animals and birds and man 's effort to simulate these sounds through a keen sense of observation and perception the sama veda , which is believed to have laid the foundation for indian classical music , consists of hymns from the rigveda , set to musical tunes which would be sung using three to seven musical notes during vedic yajnas references to indian classical music are made in many ancient texts , including epics like the ramayana and mahabharata carnatic music is based as it is today on musical concepts ( including swara , raga , and tala ) that were described in detail in several ancient works , particularly the bharata 's natya shastra and silappadhikaram by ilango adigal owing to persian and islamic influences in north india from the 12th century onwards , indian classical music began to diverge into two distinct styles — hindustani music and carnatic music moorthy2001 , p18 by the 16th and 17th centuries , there was a clear demarcation between carnatic and hindustani music ; carnatic music remained relatively unaffected by persian and arabic influences purandara dasa , who is known as the '' father ( pitamaha ) of carnatic music '' , formulated the system that is commonly used for the teaching of carnatic music govindacharya is known for expanding the melakarta system into the sampoorna raga scheme – the system that is in common use today some of the royalty of the kingdoms of mysore and travancore were themselves noted composers and proficient in playing musical instruments , such as the veena , rudra veena , violin , ghatam , flute , mridangam , nagaswara and swarabhat during the late 19th century , the city of chennai ( then known as madras ) emerged as the locus for carnatic music with the dissolution of the erstwhile princely states and the indian independence movement reaching its conclusion in 1947 , carnatic music went through a radical shift in patronage into an art of the masses with ticketed performances organised by private institutions called sabhās the main emphasis in carnatic music is on vocal music ; most compositions are written to be sung , and even when played on instruments , they are meant to be performed in a singing style ( known as gāyaki ) like hindustani music , carnatic music rests on two main elements : , the modes or melodic formulæ , and , the rhythmic cycles today , carnatic music is presented by musicians in concerts or recordings , either vocally or through instruments carnatic music itself developed around musical works or compositions of phenomenal composers ( see below ) it is the approximate equivalent of a tonic ( or less precisely a key ) in western music ; it is the note from which all the others are derived while there are an infinite number of sounds falling within a scale ( or raga ) in carnatic music , the number that can be distinguished by auditory perception is twenty-two ( although over the years , several of them have converged ) santhanlingam , kudumiyan malai , tamil nadu government archeology department publication , 1981 in tamil nadu shows vowel changes to solfege symbols with ra , ri , ru etc in one scale , or raga , there is usually only one variant of each note present in carnatic music , the sampoorna ragas ( those with all seven notes in their scales ) are classified into a system called the melakarta , which groups them according to the kinds of notes that they have there are seventy-two melakarta ragas , thirty six of whose madhyama ( subdominant ) is shuddha ( perfect fourth from the tonic ) , the remaining thirty-six of whose madhyama ( subdominant ) is prati ( an augmented fourth from the tonic ) the ragas are grouped into sets of six , called chakras ( '' wheels '' , though actually segments in the conventional representation ) grouped according to the supertonic and mediant scale degrees tala is formed with three basic parts ( called angas ) which are laghu , dhrtam , and anudhrtam , though complex talas may have other parts like plutam , guru , and kaakapaadam arnold2000 , p17 the main traditional forms of improvisation in carnatic music consist of the following : nettlrussells1998 , pp niraval , usually performed by the more advanced performers , consists of singing one or two lines of text of a song repeatedly , but with a series of melodic improvised elaborations kalpanaswaram , also known as swarakalpana , consists of improvising melodic and rhythmic passages using swaras ( solfa syllables ) the swaras can also be sung at the same speed or double the speed of the melody that is being sung , though some artists sing triple-speed phrases too kalpanaswaram is the most elementary type of improvisation , usually taught before any other form of improvisation tanam is one of the most important forms of improvisation , and is integral to ragam tanam pallavi through niraval , the performer manipulates the pallavi line in complex melodic and rhythmic ways in contrast to hindustani music of the northern part of india , carnatic music is taught and learned through compositions , which encode many intricate musical details , also providing scope for free improvisation nearly every rendition of a carnatic music composition is different and unique as it embodies elements of the composer 's vision , as well as the musician 's interpretation a carnatic composition really has two elements , one being the musical element , the other being what is conveyed in the composition it is probably because of this fact that most carnatic music compositions are composed for singing compositions more commonly associated with indian classical dance and bhakthi have also been increasingly used in the carnatic music repertoire forms such as the divya prabandha , thevaram and ugabhoga are often performed similarly , however , these forms can also have a set melody and rhythm like the devaranama , javali , padam , thillana and thiruppugazh forms varnams are short metric pieces which encapsulate the main features and requirements of a raga known for their complex structure , varnams are a fundamental form in carnatic music varnams are practised as vocal exercises in multiple speeds by performers of carnatic music , to help develop voice culture , and maintain proper pitch and control of rhythm in carnatic music concerts , varnams are often performed by musicians as the opening item – acting as a warm up for the musicians , gupta2006 , p68 and as a means of grabbing the attention of the audience purandara dasa ( 1484–1564 ) is referred to as the pitamaha ( the father or grandfather ) of carnatic music as he formulated the basic lessons in teaching carnatic music , and in honour of his significant contribution to carnatic music he also composed gitas ( simple songs ) for novice students from the late 20th century onwards , with changes in lifestyles and need for young music aspirants to simultaneously pursue a parallel academic career , this system has found few takers various music festivals featuring carnatic music performances are held in india , and throughout the world the music season was started in 1927 , to mark the opening of the madras music academy

like all art forms in indian culture , indian classical music is believed to be a divine art form which originated from the devas and devis ( hindu gods and goddesses ) , moorthy2001 , p17 and is venerated as symbolic of the sama veda , which is believed to have laid the foundation for indian classical music , consists of hymns from the rigveda , set to musical tunes which would be sung using three to seven musical notes during vedic yajnas the yajur-veda , which mainly consists of sacrificial formulae , mentions the veena as an accompaniment to vocal recitations references to indian classical music are made in many ancient texts , including epics like the ramayana and mahabharata carnatic music is based as it is today on musical concepts ( including swara , raga , and tala ) that were described in detail in several ancient works , particularly the bharata 's natya shastra and silappadhikaram by ilango adigal owing to persian and islamic influences in north india from the 12th century onwards , indian classical music began to diverge into two distinct styles — hindustani music and carnatic music commentaries and other works , such as sharngadeva 's sangita ratnakara , further elaborated on the musical concepts found in indian classical music moorthy2001 , p18 by the 16th and 17th centuries , there was a clear demarcation between carnatic and hindustani music ; carnatic music remained relatively unaffected by persian and arabic influences it was at this time that carnatic music flourished in vijayanagara , while the vijayanagar empire reached its greatest extent purandara dasa , who is known as the '' father ( pitamaha ) of carnatic music '' , formulated the system that is commonly used for the teaching of carnatic music govindacharya is known for expanding the melakarta system into the sampoorna raga scheme – the system that is in common use today in the 18th and 19th centuries , carnatic music was mainly patronised by the local kings of the kingdom of mysore , kingdom of travancore , and the thanjavur maratha kingdom some of the royalty of the kingdoms of mysore and travancore were themselves noted composers and proficient in playing musical instruments , such as the veena , rudra veena , violin , ghatam , flute , mridangam , nagaswara and swarabhat during the late 19th century , the city of chennai ( then known as madras ) emerged as the locus for carnatic music with the dissolution of the erstwhile princely states and the indian independence movement reaching its conclusion in 1947 , carnatic music went through a radical shift in patronage into an art of the masses with ticketed performances organised by private institutions called sabhās the main emphasis in carnatic music is on vocal music ; most compositions are written to be sung , and even when played on instruments , they are meant to be performed in a singing style ( known as gāyaki ) like hindustani music , carnatic music rests on two main elements : , the modes or melodic formulæ , and , the rhythmic cycles today , carnatic music is presented by musicians in concerts or recordings , either vocally or through instruments carnatic music itself developed around musical works or compositions of phenomenal composers ( see below ) śruti commonly refers to musical pitch in this sense , while sruti is determined by auditory perception , it is also an expression in the listener 's mind swaras also refer to the solfege of carnatic music , which consist of seven notes , '' sa-ri-ga-ma-pa-da-ni '' ( compare with the hindustani sargam : sa-re-ga-ma-pa-dha-ni or western do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti ) these names are abbreviations of the longer names shadja , rishabha , gandhara , madhyama , panchama , dhaivata and nishada unlike other music systems , every member of the solfege ( called a swara ) has three variants in carnatic music , the sampoorna ragas ( those with all seven notes in their scales ) are classified into a system called the melakarta , which groups them according to the kinds of notes that they have there are seventy-two melakarta ragas , thirty six of whose madhyama ( subdominant ) is shuddha ( perfect fourth from the tonic ) , the remaining thirty-six of whose madhyama ( subdominant ) is prati ( an augmented fourth from the tonic ) they have specific components , which in combinations can give rise to the variety to exist ( over 108 ) , allowing different compositions to have different rhythms carnatic music singers usually keep the beat by moving their hands up and down in specified patterns , and using their fingers simultaneously to keep time tala is formed with three basic parts ( called angas ) which are laghu , dhrtam , and anudhrtam , though complex talas may have other parts like plutam , guru , and kaakapaadam improvisation in raga is the soul of indian classical music – an essential aspect arnold2000 , p17 the main traditional forms of improvisation in carnatic music consist of the following : nettlrussells1998 , pp nettlrussells1998 , p232 the lines are then also played at different levels of speed which can include double speed , triple speed , quadruple speed and even sextuple speed the improvised elaborations are made with a view of outlining the raga , the tempo , and the theme of the composition kalpanaswaram , also known as swarakalpana , consists of improvising melodic and rhythmic passages using swaras ( solfa syllables ) kalpanaswaram is the most elementary type of improvisation , usually taught before any other form of improvisation tani avartanam refers to the extended solo that is played by the percussionists in a concert , arnold2000 , 158 and is usually played after the main composition in a concert in contrast to hindustani music of the northern part of india , carnatic music is taught and learned through compositions , which encode many intricate musical details , also providing scope for free improvisation it is probably because of this fact that most carnatic music compositions are composed for singing compositions more commonly associated with indian classical dance and bhakthi have also been increasingly used in the carnatic music repertoire nettl2005 , p189 the features and rules of the raga ( also known as the sanchaaraas of a raga ) include how each note of the raga should be stressed , the scale of the raga , and so on known for their complex structure , varnams are a fundamental form in carnatic music carnatic music is traditionally taught according to the system formulated by purandara dasa a contemporary carnatic music concert ( called a kutcheri ) usually lasts about three hours , and comprises a number of varied compositions after singing the opening kriti , usually , the performer sings the kalpanaswaram of the raga to the beat some experienced artists may follow the main piece with a ragam thanam pallavi mid-concert , if they do not use it as the main item various music festivals featuring carnatic music performances are held in india , and throughout the world

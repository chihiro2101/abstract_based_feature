like all art forms in indian culture , indian classical music is believed to be a divine art form which originated from the devas and devis ( hindu gods and goddesses ) , moorthy2001 , p17 and is venerated as symbolic of the sama veda , which is believed to have laid the foundation for indian classical music , consists of hymns from the rigveda , set to musical tunes which would be sung using three to seven musical notes during vedic yajnas carnatic music is based as it is today on musical concepts ( including swara , raga , and tala ) that were described in detail in several ancient works , particularly the bharata 's natya shastra and silappadhikaram by ilango adigal owing to persian and islamic influences in north india from the 12th century onwards , indian classical music began to diverge into two distinct styles — hindustani music and carnatic music commentaries and other works , such as sharngadeva 's sangita ratnakara , further elaborated on the musical concepts found in indian classical music moorthy2001 , p18 by the 16th and 17th centuries , there was a clear demarcation between carnatic and hindustani music ; carnatic music remained relatively unaffected by persian and arabic influences it was at this time that carnatic music flourished in vijayanagara , while the vijayanagar empire reached its greatest extent purandara dasa , who is known as the '' father ( pitamaha ) of carnatic music '' , formulated the system that is commonly used for the teaching of carnatic music theory of music , vasanthamadhavi p.183 venkatamakhin invented and authored the formula for the melakarta system of raga classification in his sanskrit work , the chaturdandi prakasika ( 1660 ad ) in the 18th and 19th centuries , carnatic music was mainly patronised by the local kings of the kingdom of mysore , kingdom of travancore , and the thanjavur maratha kingdom pranesh2003 , p54-55 , p92 , p162-163 , p225-226 some famous court-musicians proficient in music were veene sheshanna ( 1852–1926 ) pranesh2003 , p108 and veene subbanna ( 1861–1939 ) , pranesh2003 , p128 among others during the late 19th century , the city of chennai ( then known as madras ) emerged as the locus for carnatic music the main emphasis in carnatic music is on vocal music ; most compositions are written to be sung , and even when played on instruments , they are meant to be performed in a singing style ( known as gāyaki ) like hindustani music , carnatic music rests on two main elements : , the modes or melodic formulæ , and , the rhythmic cycles today , carnatic music is presented by musicians in concerts or recordings , either vocally or through instruments carnatic music itself developed around musical works or compositions of phenomenal composers ( see below ) it is the approximate equivalent of a tonic ( or less precisely a key ) in western music ; it is the note from which all the others are derived swara refers to a type of musical sound that is a single note , which defines a relative ( higher or lower ) position of a note , rather than a defined frequency swaras also refer to the solfege of carnatic music , which consist of seven notes , '' sa-ri-ga-ma-pa-da-ni '' ( compare with the hindustani sargam : sa-re-ga-ma-pa-dha-ni or western do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti ) unlike other music systems , every member of the solfege ( called a swara ) has three variants in effect , it is a series of obligatory musical events which must be observed , either absolutely or with a particular frequency there are seventy-two melakarta ragas , thirty six of whose madhyama ( subdominant ) is shuddha ( perfect fourth from the tonic ) , the remaining thirty-six of whose madhyama ( subdominant ) is prati ( an augmented fourth from the tonic ) talas have cycles of a defined number of beats and rarely change within a song improvisation in raga is the soul of indian classical music – an essential aspect '' manodharma sangeetam '' or '' kalpana sangeetam '' ( '' music of imagination '' ) as it is known in carnatic music , embraces several varieties of improvisation arnold2000 , p17 the main traditional forms of improvisation in carnatic music consist of the following : nettlrussells1998 , pp in performing alapana , performers consider each raga as an object that has beginnings and endings and consists somehow of sequences of thought theoretically , this ought to be the easiest type of improvisation , since the rules are so few , but in fact , it takes much skill to sing a pleasing , comprehensive ( in the sense of giving a '' feel for the ragam '' ) and , most importantly , original raga alapana niraval , usually performed by the more advanced performers , consists of singing one or two lines of text of a song repeatedly , but with a series of melodic improvised elaborations nettlrussell1998 , p219 like niraval , nettlrussell1998 , p232 kalpanaswaras are sung to end on a particular swara in the raga of the melody and at a specific place ( idam ) in the tala cycle ragam , tanam , and pallavi are the principal long form in concerts , and is a composite form of improvisation through niraval , the performer manipulates the pallavi line in complex melodic and rhythmic ways in contrast to hindustani music of the northern part of india , carnatic music is taught and learned through compositions , which encode many intricate musical details , also providing scope for free improvisation a carnatic composition really has two elements , one being the musical element , the other being what is conveyed in the composition it is probably because of this fact that most carnatic music compositions are composed for singing in addition to the rich musical experience , each composition brings out the knowledge and personality of the composer , and hence the words are as important as the musical element itself compositions more commonly associated with indian classical dance and bhakthi have also been increasingly used in the carnatic music repertoire the most common and significant forms in carnatic music are the varnam and the kriti ( or kirtanam ) nettl2005 , p189 the features and rules of the raga ( also known as the sanchaaraas of a raga ) include how each note of the raga should be stressed , the scale of the raga , and so on known for their complex structure , varnams are a fundamental form in carnatic music this usually consists of , at least , a principal performer , a melodic accompaniment , a rhythm accompaniment , and a drone the audience of a typical concert will have some understanding of carnatic music various music festivals featuring carnatic music performances are held in india , and throughout the world with the city of chennai ( then known as madras ) emerging as the locus for carnatic music during the 19th century , its musicians founded the tyagaraja aradhana festival in 1846 some concert organisers also feature their own carnatic music festivals during the season the karnataka ganakala parishat is an annual conference of carnatic music , held in february every year , which has lectures and demonstrations in the morning , and performances in the afternoons and evenings

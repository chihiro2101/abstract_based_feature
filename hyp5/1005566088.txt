like all art forms in indian culture , indian classical music is believed to be a divine art form which originated from the devas and devis ( hindu gods and goddesses ) , moorthy2001 , p17 and is venerated as symbolic of the sama veda , which is believed to have laid the foundation for indian classical music , consists of hymns from the rigveda , set to musical tunes which would be sung using three to seven musical notes during vedic yajnas the yajur-veda , which mainly consists of sacrificial formulae , mentions the veena as an accompaniment to vocal recitations carnatic music is based as it is today on musical concepts ( including swara , raga , and tala ) that were described in detail in several ancient works , particularly the bharata 's natya shastra and silappadhikaram by ilango adigal owing to persian and islamic influences in north india from the 12th century onwards , indian classical music began to diverge into two distinct styles — hindustani music and carnatic music commentaries and other works , such as sharngadeva 's sangita ratnakara , further elaborated on the musical concepts found in indian classical music moorthy2001 , p18 by the 16th and 17th centuries , there was a clear demarcation between carnatic and hindustani music ; carnatic music remained relatively unaffected by persian and arabic influences it was at this time that carnatic music flourished in vijayanagara , while the vijayanagar empire reached its greatest extent purandara dasa , who is known as the '' father ( pitamaha ) of carnatic music '' , formulated the system that is commonly used for the teaching of carnatic music in the 18th and 19th centuries , carnatic music was mainly patronised by the local kings of the kingdom of mysore , kingdom of travancore , and the thanjavur maratha kingdom during the late 19th century , the city of chennai ( then known as madras ) emerged as the locus for carnatic music with the dissolution of the erstwhile princely states and the indian independence movement reaching its conclusion in 1947 , carnatic music went through a radical shift in patronage into an art of the masses with ticketed performances organised by private institutions called sabhās the main emphasis in carnatic music is on vocal music ; most compositions are written to be sung , and even when played on instruments , they are meant to be performed in a singing style ( known as gāyaki ) like hindustani music , carnatic music rests on two main elements : , the modes or melodic formulæ , and , the rhythmic cycles in this sense , while sruti is determined by auditory perception , it is also an expression in the listener 's mind swara refers to a type of musical sound that is a single note , which defines a relative ( higher or lower ) position of a note , rather than a defined frequency swaras also refer to the solfege of carnatic music , which consist of seven notes , '' sa-ri-ga-ma-pa-da-ni '' ( compare with the hindustani sargam : sa-re-ga-ma-pa-dha-ni or western do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti ) it specifies rules for movements up ( aarohanam ) and down ( avarohanam ) , the scale of which notes should figure more and which notes should be used more sparingly , which notes may be sung with gamaka ( ornamentation ) , which phrases should be used or avoided , and so on in carnatic music , the sampoorna ragas ( those with all seven notes in their scales ) are classified into a system called the melakarta , which groups them according to the kinds of notes that they have ragas may be divided into two classes : janaka ragas ( i.e tala refers to a fixed time cycle or metre , set for a particular composition , which is built from groupings of beats carnatic music singers usually keep the beat by moving their hands up and down in specified patterns , and using their fingers simultaneously to keep time tala is formed with three basic parts ( called angas ) which are laghu , dhrtam , and anudhrtam , though complex talas may have other parts like plutam , guru , and kaakapaadam five jaathis times seven tala groups gives thirty-five basic talas , although use of other angas results in a total of 108 talas theoretically , this ought to be the easiest type of improvisation , since the rules are so few , but in fact , it takes much skill to sing a pleasing , comprehensive ( in the sense of giving a '' feel for the ragam '' ) and , most importantly , original raga alapana niraval , usually performed by the more advanced performers , consists of singing one or two lines of text of a song repeatedly , but with a series of melodic improvised elaborations nettlrussell1998 , p219 like niraval , nettlrussell1998 , p232 kalpanaswaras are sung to end on a particular swara in the raga of the melody and at a specific place ( idam ) in the tala cycle nettlrussell1998 , p221 kalpanaswaras have a somewhat predictable rhythmical structure ; solisnettl2009 , p188 the swaras are sung to end on the samam ( the first beat of the rhythmical cycle ) the swaras can also be sung at the same speed or double the speed of the melody that is being sung , though some artists sing triple-speed phrases too originally developed for the veena , it consists of expanding the raga with syllables like tha , nam , thom , aa , nom , na , etc ragam , tanam , and pallavi are the principal long form in concerts , and is a composite form of improvisation nearly every rendition of a carnatic music composition is different and unique as it embodies elements of the composer 's vision , as well as the musician 's interpretation in addition to the rich musical experience , each composition brings out the knowledge and personality of the composer , and hence the words are as important as the musical element itself though these forms consist of lyric-based verses , musicians improvise raga phrases in free rhythm , like an alapana , so both the sound value , and the meaning of the text , guide the musician through elaborate melodic improvisations forms such as the divya prabandha , thevaram and ugabhoga are often performed similarly , however , these forms can also have a set melody and rhythm like the devaranama , javali , padam , thillana and thiruppugazh forms varnams are short metric pieces which encapsulate the main features and requirements of a raga known for their complex structure , varnams are a fundamental form in carnatic music varnams are practised as vocal exercises in multiple speeds by performers of carnatic music , to help develop voice culture , and maintain proper pitch and control of rhythm in carnatic music concerts , varnams are often performed by musicians as the opening item – acting as a warm up for the musicians , gupta2006 , p68 and as a means of grabbing the attention of the audience carnatic songs ( kritis ) are varied in structure and style , but generally consist of three units : pallavi composers of carnatic music were often inspired by religious devotion and were usually scholars proficient in one or more of the languages kannada , malayalam , sanskrit , tamil , or telugu carnatic music is traditionally taught according to the system formulated by purandara dasa unlike hindustani music concerts , where an accompanying tabla player can keep beats without following the musical phrases at times , in carnatic music , the accompanists have to follow the intricacies of the composition since there are percussion elements such as eduppu in several compositions a contemporary carnatic music concert ( called a kutcheri ) usually lasts about three hours , and comprises a number of varied compositions the audience of a typical concert will have some understanding of carnatic music various music festivals featuring carnatic music performances are held in india , and throughout the world

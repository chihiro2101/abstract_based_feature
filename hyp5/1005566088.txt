the sama veda , which is believed to have laid the foundation for indian classical music , consists of hymns from the rigveda , set to musical tunes which would be sung using three to seven musical notes during vedic yajnas the yajur-veda , which mainly consists of sacrificial formulae , mentions the veena as an accompaniment to vocal recitations references to indian classical music are made in many ancient texts , including epics like the ramayana and mahabharata carnatic music is based as it is today on musical concepts ( including swara , raga , and tala ) that were described in detail in several ancient works , particularly the bharata 's natya shastra and silappadhikaram by ilango adigal owing to persian and islamic influences in north india from the 12th century onwards , indian classical music began to diverge into two distinct styles — hindustani music and carnatic music commentaries and other works , such as sharngadeva 's sangita ratnakara , further elaborated on the musical concepts found in indian classical music it was at this time that carnatic music flourished in vijayanagara , while the vijayanagar empire reached its greatest extent purandara dasa , who is known as the '' father ( pitamaha ) of carnatic music '' , formulated the system that is commonly used for the teaching of carnatic music in the 18th and 19th centuries , carnatic music was mainly patronised by the local kings of the kingdom of mysore , kingdom of travancore , and the thanjavur maratha kingdom pranesh2003 , p54-55 , p92 , p162-163 , p225-226 some famous court-musicians proficient in music were veene sheshanna ( 1852–1926 ) pranesh2003 , p108 and veene subbanna ( 1861–1939 ) , pranesh2003 , p128 among others during the late 19th century , the city of chennai ( then known as madras ) emerged as the locus for carnatic music the main emphasis in carnatic music is on vocal music ; most compositions are written to be sung , and even when played on instruments , they are meant to be performed in a singing style ( known as gāyaki ) like hindustani music , carnatic music rests on two main elements : , the modes or melodic formulæ , and , the rhythmic cycles today , carnatic music is presented by musicians in concerts or recordings , either vocally or through instruments carnatic music itself developed around musical works or compositions of phenomenal composers ( see below ) swara refers to a type of musical sound that is a single note , which defines a relative ( higher or lower ) position of a note , rather than a defined frequency swaras also refer to the solfege of carnatic music , which consist of seven notes , '' sa-ri-ga-ma-pa-da-ni '' ( compare with the hindustani sargam : sa-re-ga-ma-pa-dha-ni or western do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti ) the exceptions are the drone notes , shadja and panchama ( also known as the tonic and the dominant ) , which have only one form ; and madhyama ( the subdominant ) , which has two forms in one scale , or raga , there is usually only one variant of each note present a raga in carnatic music prescribes a set of rules for building a melody – very similar to the western concept of mode in effect , it is a series of obligatory musical events which must be observed , either absolutely or with a particular frequency in carnatic music , the sampoorna ragas ( those with all seven notes in their scales ) are classified into a system called the melakarta , which groups them according to the kinds of notes that they have ragas may be divided into two classes : janaka ragas ( i.e melakarta or parent ragas ) and janya ragas ( descendant ragas of a particular janaka raga ) improvisation in raga is the soul of indian classical music – an essential aspect '' manodharma sangeetam '' or '' kalpana sangeetam '' ( '' music of imagination '' ) as it is known in carnatic music , embraces several varieties of improvisation kalpanaswaram , also known as swarakalpana , consists of improvising melodic and rhythmic passages using swaras ( solfa syllables ) nettlrussell1998 , p221 kalpanaswaras have a somewhat predictable rhythmical structure ; solisnettl2009 , p188 the swaras are sung to end on the samam ( the first beat of the rhythmical cycle ) the swaras can also be sung at the same speed or double the speed of the melody that is being sung , though some artists sing triple-speed phrases too tanam is one of the most important forms of improvisation , and is integral to ragam tanam pallavi originally developed for the veena , it consists of expanding the raga with syllables like tha , nam , thom , aa , nom , na , etc through niraval , the performer manipulates the pallavi line in complex melodic and rhythmic ways tani avartanam refers to the extended solo that is played by the percussionists in a concert , arnold2000 , 158 and is usually played after the main composition in a concert nearly every rendition of a carnatic music composition is different and unique as it embodies elements of the composer 's vision , as well as the musician 's interpretation compositions more commonly associated with indian classical dance and bhakthi have also been increasingly used in the carnatic music repertoire the performance of the sanskrit sloka , tamil viruttam and telugu padyamu or sisapadya forms are particularly unique though these forms consist of lyric-based verses , musicians improvise raga phrases in free rhythm , like an alapana , so both the sound value , and the meaning of the text , guide the musician through elaborate melodic improvisations the most common and significant forms in carnatic music are the varnam and the kriti ( or kirtanam ) all varnams consist of lyrics , bradnock1992 , p631 as well as swara passages , including a pallavi , an anupallavi , muktayi swaras , a charanam , and chitta swara varnams are practised as vocal exercises in multiple speeds by performers of carnatic music , to help develop voice culture , and maintain proper pitch and control of rhythm in carnatic music concerts , varnams are often performed by musicians as the opening item – acting as a warm up for the musicians , gupta2006 , p68 and as a means of grabbing the attention of the audience the notions of key and absolute pitch are deeply rooted in western music , whereas the carnatic notation does not specify the key and prefers to use scale degrees ( relative pitch ) to denote notes the accompaniments form an integral part of every composition presented , and they closely follow and augment the melodic phrases outlined by the lead singer with the city of chennai ( then known as madras ) emerging as the locus for carnatic music during the 19th century , its musicians founded the tyagaraja aradhana festival in 1846 the aradhana festival is an annual death-anniversary celebration of the prolific carnatic music composer , tyagaraja list of carnatic composers list of carnatic instrumentalists trinity of carnatic music

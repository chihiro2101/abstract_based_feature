ancient treatises also describe the connection of the origin of the swaras , or notes , to the sounds of animals and birds and man 's effort to simulate these sounds through a keen sense of observation and perception the sama veda , which is believed to have laid the foundation for indian classical music , consists of hymns from the rigveda , set to musical tunes which would be sung using three to seven musical notes during vedic yajnas references to indian classical music are made in many ancient texts , including epics like the ramayana and mahabharata carnatic music is based as it is today on musical concepts ( including swara , raga , and tala ) that were described in detail in several ancient works , particularly the bharata 's natya shastra and silappadhikaram by ilango adigal owing to persian and islamic influences in north india from the 12th century onwards , indian classical music began to diverge into two distinct styles — hindustani music and carnatic music commentaries and other works , such as sharngadeva 's sangita ratnakara , further elaborated on the musical concepts found in indian classical music moorthy2001 , p18 by the 16th and 17th centuries , there was a clear demarcation between carnatic and hindustani music ; carnatic music remained relatively unaffected by persian and arabic influences it was at this time that carnatic music flourished in vijayanagara , while the vijayanagar empire reached its greatest extent purandara dasa , who is known as the '' father ( pitamaha ) of carnatic music '' , formulated the system that is commonly used for the teaching of carnatic music theory of music , vasanthamadhavi p.183 venkatamakhin invented and authored the formula for the melakarta system of raga classification in his sanskrit work , the chaturdandi prakasika ( 1660 ad ) govindacharya is known for expanding the melakarta system into the sampoorna raga scheme – the system that is in common use today during the late 19th century , the city of chennai ( then known as madras ) emerged as the locus for carnatic music with the dissolution of the erstwhile princely states and the indian independence movement reaching its conclusion in 1947 , carnatic music went through a radical shift in patronage into an art of the masses with ticketed performances organised by private institutions called sabhās the main emphasis in carnatic music is on vocal music ; most compositions are written to be sung , and even when played on instruments , they are meant to be performed in a singing style ( known as gāyaki ) today , carnatic music is presented by musicians in concerts or recordings , either vocally or through instruments it is the approximate equivalent of a tonic ( or less precisely a key ) in western music ; it is the note from which all the others are derived while there are an infinite number of sounds falling within a scale ( or raga ) in carnatic music , the number that can be distinguished by auditory perception is twenty-two ( although over the years , several of them have converged ) in this sense , while sruti is determined by auditory perception , it is also an expression in the listener 's mind in one scale , or raga , there is usually only one variant of each note present the exceptions exist in '' light '' ragas , in which , for artistic effect , there may be two , one ascending ( in the arohanam ) and another descending ( in the avarohanam ) in effect , it is a series of obligatory musical events which must be observed , either absolutely or with a particular frequency in carnatic music , the sampoorna ragas ( those with all seven notes in their scales ) are classified into a system called the melakarta , which groups them according to the kinds of notes that they have tala refers to a fixed time cycle or metre , set for a particular composition , which is built from groupings of beats talas have cycles of a defined number of beats and rarely change within a song carnatic music singers usually keep the beat by moving their hands up and down in specified patterns , and using their fingers simultaneously to keep time five jaathis times seven tala groups gives thirty-five basic talas , although use of other angas results in a total of 108 talas improvisation in raga is the soul of indian classical music – an essential aspect arnold2000 , p17 the main traditional forms of improvisation in carnatic music consist of the following : nettlrussells1998 , pp alapana niraval pallavi ragam swarakalpana tanam tani avartanam an alapana , sometimes also called ragam , is the exposition of a raga or tone – a slow improvisation with no rhythm , where the raga acts as the basis of embellishment the performer will explore the ragam and touch on its various nuances , singing in the lower octaves first , then gradually moving up to higher octaves , while giving a hint of the song to be performed niraval , usually performed by the more advanced performers , consists of singing one or two lines of text of a song repeatedly , but with a series of melodic improvised elaborations nettlrussell1998 , p219 like niraval , nettlrussell1998 , p232 kalpanaswaras are sung to end on a particular swara in the raga of the melody and at a specific place ( idam ) in the tala cycle tanam is one of the most important forms of improvisation , and is integral to ragam tanam pallavi originally developed for the veena , it consists of expanding the raga with syllables like tha , nam , thom , aa , nom , na , etc as the name suggests , it consists of raga alapana , tanam , and a pallavi line set to a slow-paced tala , the pallavi line is often composed by the performer it is probably because of this fact that most carnatic music compositions are composed for singing compositions more commonly associated with indian classical dance and bhakthi have also been increasingly used in the carnatic music repertoire though these forms consist of lyric-based verses , musicians improvise raga phrases in free rhythm , like an alapana , so both the sound value , and the meaning of the text , guide the musician through elaborate melodic improvisations forms such as the divya prabandha , thevaram and ugabhoga are often performed similarly , however , these forms can also have a set melody and rhythm like the devaranama , javali , padam , thillana and thiruppugazh forms nettl2005 , p189 the features and rules of the raga ( also known as the sanchaaraas of a raga ) include how each note of the raga should be stressed , the scale of the raga , and so on papanasam sivan , who has been hailed as the tamil tyagaraja of carnatic music , composed in tamil and sanskrit , and used the signature ramadasan in his compositions each kriti sticks to one specific raga , although some are composed with more than one raga ; these are known as ragamalika ( a garland of ragas ) some experienced artists may follow the main piece with a ragam thanam pallavi mid-concert , if they do not use it as the main item it used to be a traditional month-long carnatic music festival , but since then it has also diversified into dance and drama , as well as non-carnatic art forms

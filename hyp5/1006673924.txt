the five books below are musashi 's descriptions of the exact methods or techniques which are described by such elements the term '' ichi school '' is referred to in the book , go rin no sho when referring to such books , it refers to '' niten no ichi ryu '' or '' ni ten ichi ryu '' , which literally translates to , '' two heaven , one school '' alternative translations include '' two swords , one spirit '' , and '' two swords , one entity '' the translation , '' two swords , one dragon '' was thought to be a misinterpretation of the kanji word ryu the book of earth chapter serves as an introduction , and metaphorically discusses martial arts , leadership , and training as building a house the book of water chapter describes musashi 's style , ni-ten ichi-ryu , or '' two heavens , one style '' the book of wind chapter is something of a pun , since the japanese character can mean both '' wind '' and '' style '' ( e.g it discusses what musashi considers to be the failings of various contemporary schools of sword fighting the book of the void chapter is a short epilogue , describing , in more esoteric terms , musashi 's probably zen-influenced thoughts on consciousness and the correct mindset the book of earth a book of five rings by miyamoto musashi ( translation from japanese by victor harris ) , london : allison and busby , 1974 . the earth book , according to '' go rin no sho '' , is mentioned as the book that refers expressly to the strategy taught by musashi at the ichi school when you attain the way of strategy there will not be one thing you can not see musashi also remarks on the gun as having no equal on the battlefield , until swords clash , when it becomes useless however , it is unsatisfactory in sieges , or when the enemy is more than forty yards away musashi indicates that during battle you should not overuse one weapon—this is as bad as using the weapon poorly since it becomes easy for an enemy to find a weakness in your style after countless uses of the same weapon timing , as explained by musashi , is the core principle in strategy which is listed in the earth book the idea of timing as explained within the earth book is that you must be able to adapt your strategy to timing with your skill , in that you must know when to attack and when not to attack in the book of five rings he writes on timing : '' timing is important in dancing and pipe or string music , for they are in rhythm only if timing is good there is timing in the whole life of the warrior , in his thriving and declining , in his harmony and discord from the outset you must know the applicable timing and the inapplicable timing , and from among the large and small things and the fast and slow timings find the relevant timing , first seeing the distance timing and the background timing it is especially important to know the background timing , otherwise your strategy will become uncertain these rules are for his students , and are complemented by the 21 '' spiritual principles '' for all to follow , which are found in the dokkōdō ( musashi 's final work ) a person should master many aspects of life allowing them to possess both balance and flexibility the spiritual bearing in strategy , which musashi writes about concerns your temperament and spirituality whilst in the midst of , or in formulation of a battle being a buddhist , most of what is written in the section concerning spirituality refers to principles of calmness , tranquility and spiritual balance ; in strategy your spiritual bearing must not be any different from normal this balance refers to what could be thought of as yin and yang within yourself the over-familiarity or over-use of one weapon is discouraged by musashi , as it would be seen to reveal your spirituality to your enemy during battle , the spirituality and balance is something of which musashi notes that you should take advantage this is something which seems easy , but it is said to change when you are on the battlefield , as then you must know to both adjust your spiritual balance according to what is around you , and to perceive the balance of those around you to take advantage accordingly he notes that this is again one of the most important parts of strategy , as well as being able to see things which are close to you , such as the technique of an enemy upper middle lower right side left side the five attitudes of swordsmanship are referred to as the five classifications of areas for attack on the human body left side and right side attitudes are fluid '' in-one timing '' refers to the technique of biding your time until you can find a suitable gap in the enemies ' defense , to which you will deliver one fatal blow to the enemy although this is said to be difficult , musashi notes that masters of this technique are usually masters of the five attitudes because they must be perceptive of weaknesses it is rumored that musashi disgraced a former sword master by using such a technique with a bokken , but there are no descriptions mentioning '' in one '' timing '' red leaves cut '' refers to knocking down the enemy 's long sword in the spirit of the '' no design , no conception '' cut individually , it refers to attacking the enemy 's sword , breaking it , removing it from play , and a technique of controlling it through direct blade on blade contact '' the book of nothing , according to musashi , is the true meaning of the strategy of ni ten ichi ryu if you are currently within a situation in which you and your opponent 's swords are to clash , you must strike extremely hard without raising your sword to any extent

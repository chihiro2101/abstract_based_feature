though ideas are taken from other sources , the text is predominantly seminal the five books below are musashi 's descriptions of the exact methods or techniques which are described by such elements when referring to such books , it refers to '' niten no ichi ryu '' or '' ni ten ichi ryu '' , which literally translates to , '' two heaven , one school '' alternative translations include '' two swords , one spirit '' , and '' two swords , one entity '' the translation , '' two swords , one dragon '' was thought to be a misinterpretation of the kanji word ryu the book of water chapter describes musashi 's style , ni-ten ichi-ryu , or '' two heavens , one style '' it describes some basic technique and fundamental principles the book of fire chapter refers to the heat of battle , and discusses matters such as different types of timing the book of wind chapter is something of a pun , since the japanese character can mean both '' wind '' and '' style '' ( e.g the book of the void chapter is a short epilogue , describing , in more esoteric terms , musashi 's probably zen-influenced thoughts on consciousness and the correct mindset the book of earth a book of five rings by miyamoto musashi ( translation from japanese by victor harris ) , london : allison and busby , 1974 . the earth book , according to '' go rin no sho '' , is mentioned as the book that refers expressly to the strategy taught by musashi at the ichi school it is said to be how to distinguish the way through '' sword-fencing '' , or '' swordsmanship '' the idea of strategy would be encouraged to be very astute in their study and strategy : know the smallest things and the biggest things , the shallowest things and the deepest things when you attain the way of strategy there will not be one thing you can not see musashi also remarks on the gun as having no equal on the battlefield , until swords clash , when it becomes useless timing , as explained by musashi , is the core principle in strategy which is listed in the earth book the idea of timing as explained within the earth book is that you must be able to adapt your strategy to timing with your skill , in that you must know when to attack and when not to attack in the book of five rings he writes on timing : '' timing is important in dancing and pipe or string music , for they are in rhythm only if timing is good there is timing in the whole life of the warrior , in his thriving and declining , in his harmony and discord similarly , there is timing in the way of the merchant , in the rise and fall of capital all things entail rising and falling timing in strategy there are various timing considerations these rules are for his students , and are complemented by the 21 '' spiritual principles '' for all to follow , which are found in the dokkōdō ( musashi 's final work ) so also should one possess the ability to change in accordance with one ’ s own situation to easily shift between disciplines , methods , and options when presented with new information a person should master many aspects of life allowing them to possess both balance and flexibility the spiritual bearing in strategy , which musashi writes about concerns your temperament and spirituality whilst in the midst of , or in formulation of a battle being a buddhist , most of what is written in the section concerning spirituality refers to principles of calmness , tranquility and spiritual balance ; in strategy your spiritual bearing must not be any different from normal the over-familiarity or over-use of one weapon is discouraged by musashi , as it would be seen to reveal your spirituality to your enemy these are areas which are noted for their advantages when striking at an enemy , and the strategist is said to think of them when in situations where , for any reason , you should not be able to strike them left and right attitudes should be used if there is an obstruction overhead or to one side as each is thought of as an attitude , it could be thought of that musashi means to practice with each '' attitude '' so that you do not become over-reliant upon one , something which musashi repeatedly notes as being worse than bad technique '' flowing water cut '' technique refers to if you come into a fight with an enemy of a similar level to you in swordsmanship the fire book refers to fighting methods unlike the specific fighting techniques listed in the water book this is purely so that your vision is focused on nothing but the enemy , and thus there is more concentration upon the enemy 's stratagems the idea of timing , as with singular battles , is known as the most important part of attacking next to the skill of participants the broader lesson from this book is that an important part of understanding your own way is to understand the way of your opponent as precisely as possible he notes that in this void , what can be comprehended are things which we do and see , such as the way of the warrior , martial arts , and ni ten ichi ryu this is why you must always think of quickly getting your body close to the enemy one must attempt to paste one 's body against the opponent 's without leaving any area in which the bodies are not touching .

in strategy your spiritual bearing must not be any different from normal the over-familiarity or over-use of one weapon is discouraged by musashi , as it would be seen to reveal your spirituality to your enemy as each is thought of as an attitude , it could be thought of that musashi means to practice with each '' attitude '' so that you do not become over-reliant upon one , something which musashi repeatedly notes as being worse than bad technique '' in-one timing '' refers to the technique of biding your time until you can find a suitable gap in the enemies ' defense , to which you will deliver one fatal blow to the enemy although this is said to be difficult , musashi notes that masters of this technique are usually masters of the five attitudes because they must be perceptive of weaknesses it is rumored that musashi disgraced a former sword master by using such a technique with a bokken , but there are no descriptions mentioning '' in one '' timing aside from this philosophical approach to the meaning , the technique is relatively simple to explain : if you are in a deadlock with the enemy , using the force from the cut , you push with your body and use the disciplines outlined in the void book to knock the enemy over the main idea being to feign weakness as to open a weak spot , or achilles ' heel , in the opposing force , and then regrouping to exploit such a hole by attacking deep within the enemy 's party a method particularly useful for musashi or others , if attacking a general directly would signal the end of the battle upon his defeat as there is collapse within an enemy , such as waning in his numbers , musashi notes that one must observe such events and use them to advantage he notes that in this void , what can be comprehended are things which we do and see , such as the way of the warrior , martial arts , and ni ten ichi ryu if you are currently within a situation in which you and your opponent 's swords are to clash , you must strike extremely hard without raising your sword to any extent this is why you must always think of quickly getting your body close to the enemy when one is to do this , one must first behave as though one had been strongly glued to him with one 's feet , head , and body

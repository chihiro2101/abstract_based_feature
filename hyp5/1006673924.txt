the five '' books '' refer to the idea that there are different elements of battle , just as there are different physical elements in life , as described by buddhism , shinto , and other eastern religions the five books below are musashi 's descriptions of the exact methods or techniques which are described by such elements when referring to such books , it refers to '' niten no ichi ryu '' or '' ni ten ichi ryu '' , which literally translates to , '' two heaven , one school '' alternative translations include '' two swords , one spirit '' , and '' two swords , one entity '' the translation , '' two swords , one dragon '' was thought to be a misinterpretation of the kanji word ryu the book of earth chapter serves as an introduction , and metaphorically discusses martial arts , leadership , and training as building a house the book of water chapter describes musashi 's style , ni-ten ichi-ryu , or '' two heavens , one style '' it describes some basic technique and fundamental principles the book of fire chapter refers to the heat of battle , and discusses matters such as different types of timing the book of wind chapter is something of a pun , since the japanese character can mean both '' wind '' and '' style '' ( e.g it discusses what musashi considers to be the failings of various contemporary schools of sword fighting the book of the void chapter is a short epilogue , describing , in more esoteric terms , musashi 's probably zen-influenced thoughts on consciousness and the correct mindset the book of earth a book of five rings by miyamoto musashi ( translation from japanese by victor harris ) , london : allison and busby , 1974 . the earth book , according to '' go rin no sho '' , is mentioned as the book that refers expressly to the strategy taught by musashi at the ichi school the idea of strategy would be encouraged to be very astute in their study and strategy : know the smallest things and the biggest things , the shallowest things and the deepest things when you attain the way of strategy there will not be one thing you can not see he writes , '' the bow is tactically strong at the commencement of battle , especially battles on a moor , as it is possible to shoot quickly from among the spearmen '' one of the principles of the niten ichi-ryū is that one should be versed in many weaponry skills musashi indicates that during battle you should not overuse one weapon—this is as bad as using the weapon poorly since it becomes easy for an enemy to find a weakness in your style after countless uses of the same weapon timing , as explained by musashi , is the core principle in strategy which is listed in the earth book the idea of timing as explained within the earth book is that you must be able to adapt your strategy to timing with your skill , in that you must know when to attack and when not to attack in the book of five rings he writes on timing : '' timing is important in dancing and pipe or string music , for they are in rhythm only if timing is good there is timing in the whole life of the warrior , in his thriving and declining , in his harmony and discord '' the book of earth ends with nine basic principles -- the '' ground '' upon which the samurai must rely these are '' practical '' or '' worldly , '' each intended to help develop an understanding of strategy ( while the other books focus on tactics and movement ) this balance refers to what could be thought of as yin and yang within yourself the idea is that a perfectly balanced spirit is also a perfectly balanced physical presence , and neither creates weakness nor reveals it to your enemy this is part of what musashi notes as wedging in he notes that this is again one of the most important parts of strategy , as well as being able to see things which are close to you , such as the technique of an enemy it is also used to perceive things far away , such as arriving troops or enemies , as that is the precursor to battle these are areas which are noted for their advantages when striking at an enemy , and the strategist is said to think of them when in situations where , for any reason , you should not be able to strike them although this is said to be difficult , musashi notes that masters of this technique are usually masters of the five attitudes because they must be perceptive of weaknesses it is rumored that musashi disgraced a former sword master by using such a technique with a bokken , but there are no descriptions mentioning '' in one '' timing '' abdomen timing of two '' refers to feinting an attack , then striking an enemy as they are retreating from the attack , hitting them in the abdomen with the correct timing of either two moves or two seconds although the technique seems relatively simple , musashi lists this as one of the hardest techniques to time correctly when your opponent either tries to push off your sword , or to hasten back as to disengage it , you must first expand your whole body and your mind by moving your body first and then that of your sword , you will be able to strike powerfully and broadly with a movement that seems to reflect the natural flow of water as there is collapse within an enemy , such as waning in his numbers , musashi notes that one must observe such events and use them to advantage he indicates that his appraisal may be one sided because the only school he had interest for was his own , and , in a way , he does not see parallels to his own creation and work he notes that in this void , what can be comprehended are things which we do and see , such as the way of the warrior , martial arts , and ni ten ichi ryu

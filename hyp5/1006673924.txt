non existing '' , mixes the five attitudes with the attitude of '' no attitude '' , meaning that the user of the longsword uses the techniques and principles of both at whichever moment he or she finds most opportune '' in-one timing '' refers to the technique of biding your time until you can find a suitable gap in the enemies ' defense , to which you will deliver one fatal blow to the enemy although this is said to be difficult , musashi notes that masters of this technique are usually masters of the five attitudes because they must be perceptive of weaknesses it is rumored that musashi disgraced a former sword master by using such a technique with a bokken , but there are no descriptions mentioning '' in one '' timing aside from this philosophical approach to the meaning , the technique is relatively simple to explain : if you are in a deadlock with the enemy , using the force from the cut , you push with your body and use the disciplines outlined in the void book to knock the enemy over '' flowing water cut '' technique refers to if you come into a fight with an enemy of a similar level to you in swordsmanship when attacking fast , musashi notes that you will always be at stalemate , so like stagnant water , you must cut as slowly as possible with your long sword there is a strategy above sword-fencing : '' some of the world 's strategists are concerned only with sword-fencing , and limit their training to flourishing the long sword and carriage of the body this method is combined with 'the strike of nonthought ' , in which you will always strike with true force by swinging your sword toward the ground when your opponent 's sword is about to drop when one is to do this , one must first behave as though one had been strongly glued to him with one 's feet , head , and body

though ideas are taken from other sources , the text is predominantly seminal the five '' books '' refer to the idea that there are different elements of battle , just as there are different physical elements in life , as described by buddhism , shinto , and other eastern religions the five books below are musashi 's descriptions of the exact methods or techniques which are described by such elements the term '' ichi school '' is referred to in the book , go rin no sho when referring to such books , it refers to '' niten no ichi ryu '' or '' ni ten ichi ryu '' , which literally translates to , '' two heaven , one school '' alternative translations include '' two swords , one spirit '' , and '' two swords , one entity '' the translation , '' two swords , one dragon '' was thought to be a misinterpretation of the kanji word ryu the book of water chapter describes musashi 's style , ni-ten ichi-ryu , or '' two heavens , one style '' it describes some basic technique and fundamental principles it discusses what musashi considers to be the failings of various contemporary schools of sword fighting the book of the void chapter is a short epilogue , describing , in more esoteric terms , musashi 's probably zen-influenced thoughts on consciousness and the correct mindset . the earth book , according to '' go rin no sho '' , is mentioned as the book that refers expressly to the strategy taught by musashi at the ichi school musashi states that the use of glaive-like naginata and spears are purely for the field , whereas the longsword and accompanying short-sword can be used in most environments , such as on horseback or in fierce battle he does note that the gun had the disadvantage of being unable to see a bullet and adjust aim as one would with a bow however , it is unsatisfactory in sieges , or when the enemy is more than forty yards away musashi indicates that during battle you should not overuse one weapon—this is as bad as using the weapon poorly since it becomes easy for an enemy to find a weakness in your style after countless uses of the same weapon timing , as explained by musashi , is the core principle in strategy which is listed in the earth book the idea of timing as explained within the earth book is that you must be able to adapt your strategy to timing with your skill , in that you must know when to attack and when not to attack in the book of five rings he writes on timing : '' timing is important in dancing and pipe or string music , for they are in rhythm only if timing is good timing and rhythm are also involved in the military arts , shooting bows and guns , and riding horses it is especially important to know the background timing , otherwise your strategy will become uncertain these rules are for his students , and are complemented by the 21 '' spiritual principles '' for all to follow , which are found in the dokkōdō ( musashi 's final work ) '' '' know the ways of all professions '' '' distinguish between gain and loss in worldly matters both in fighting and in everyday life you should be determined though calm the over-familiarity or over-use of one weapon is discouraged by musashi , as it would be seen to reveal your spirituality to your enemy during battle , the spirituality and balance is something of which musashi notes that you should take advantage since small people know the spirituality of big people , they can thus note differences and weaknesses between each other he notes that this is again one of the most important parts of strategy , as well as being able to see things which are close to you , such as the technique of an enemy these are areas which are noted for their advantages when striking at an enemy , and the strategist is said to think of them when in situations where , for any reason , you should not be able to strike them as each is thought of as an attitude , it could be thought of that musashi means to practice with each '' attitude '' so that you do not become over-reliant upon one , something which musashi repeatedly notes as being worse than bad technique it is rumored that musashi disgraced a former sword master by using such a technique with a bokken , but there are no descriptions mentioning '' in one '' timing although the technique seems relatively simple , musashi lists this as one of the hardest techniques to time correctly aside from this philosophical approach to the meaning , the technique is relatively simple to explain : if you are in a deadlock with the enemy , using the force from the cut , you push with your body and use the disciplines outlined in the void book to knock the enemy over '' flowing water cut '' technique refers to if you come into a fight with an enemy of a similar level to you in swordsmanship when your opponent either tries to push off your sword , or to hasten back as to disengage it , you must first expand your whole body and your mind it goes into a broader scope in terms of hints as to assess a situation , as well as specific situational instructions although it spreads over two or more paragraphs , most information is common sense , relating to caution and avoidance of such situations there is a strategy above sword-fencing : '' some of the world 's strategists are concerned only with sword-fencing , and limit their training to flourishing the long sword and carriage of the body if you are currently within a situation in which you and your opponent 's swords are to clash , you must strike extremely hard without raising your sword to any extent when one is to do this , one must first behave as though one had been strongly glued to him with one 's feet , head , and body

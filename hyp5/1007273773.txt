the first egr systems were crude ; some were as simple as an orifice jet between the exhaust and intake tracts which admitted exhaust to the intake tract whenever the engine was running control systems grew more sophisticated as automakers gained experience ; volkswagen 's '' coolant controlled exhaust gas recirculation '' system of 1973 exemplified this evolution : a coolant temperature sensor blocked vacuum to the egr valve until the engine reached normal operating temperature '' 1973 cleaner air system highlights '' – chrysler corporation , imperialclub.com later , backpressure transducers were added to the egr valve control to further tailor egr flow to engine load conditions most modern engines now need exhaust gas recirculation to meet emissions standards in a typical automotive spark-ignited ( si ) engine , 5 % to 15 % of the exhaust gas is routed back to the intake as egr the impact of egr on engine efficiency largely depends on the specific engine design , and sometimes leads to a compromise between efficiency and emissions since the egr system recirculates a portion of exhaust gases , over time the valve can become clogged with carbon deposits that prevent it from operating properly in modern diesel engines , the egr gas is usually cooled with a heat exchanger to allow the introduction of a greater mass of recirculated gas the effect of egr on diesel engine wear , sae 1999-01-0839 , in-cylinder diesel particulate and control 1999 since modern diesels often have a throttle , egr can reduce the need for throttling eliminating losses in the same way that it does for si engines exhaust gas—largely nitrogen , carbon dioxide , and water vapor—has a higher specific heat than air , so it still serves to lower peak combustion temperatures by feeding the lower oxygen exhaust gas into the intake , diesel egr systems lower combustion temperature , reducing emissions of egr systems can also add abrasive contaminants and increase engine oil acidity , which in turn can reduce engine longevity

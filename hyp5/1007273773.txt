the first egr systems were crude ; some were as simple as an orifice jet between the exhaust and intake tracts which admitted exhaust to the intake tract whenever the engine was running by 1973 , an egr valve controlled by manifold vacuum opened or closed to admit exhaust to the intake tract only under certain conditions control systems grew more sophisticated as automakers gained experience ; volkswagen 's '' coolant controlled exhaust gas recirculation '' system of 1973 exemplified this evolution : a coolant temperature sensor blocked vacuum to the egr valve until the engine reached normal operating temperature '' 1973 cleaner air system highlights '' â€“ chrysler corporation , imperialclub.com later , backpressure transducers were added to the egr valve control to further tailor egr flow to engine load conditions in a typical automotive spark-ignited ( si ) engine , 5 % to 15 % of the exhaust gas is routed back to the intake as egr the addition of inert exhaust gas into the intake system means that for a given power output , the throttle plate must be opened further , resulting in increased inlet manifold pressure and reduced throttling losses quote : '' recent studies performed by engineers at southwest research institute ( swri ) have examined the role that exhaust gas recirculation ( egr ) can play in reducing , or even eliminating , these sources of inefficiency in gasoline engines since the egr system recirculates a portion of exhaust gases , over time the valve can become clogged with carbon deposits that prevent it from operating properly the effect of egr on diesel engine wear , sae 1999-01-0839 , in-cylinder diesel particulate and control 1999 since modern diesels often have a throttle , egr can reduce the need for throttling eliminating losses in the same way that it does for si engines by feeding the lower oxygen exhaust gas into the intake , diesel egr systems lower combustion temperature , reducing emissions of the normally '' dry '' intake system of a diesel engine is now subject to fouling from soot , unburned fuel and oil in the egr bleed , which has little effect on airflow page : 206 though engine manufacturers have refused to release details of the effect of egr on fuel economy , the epa regulations of 2002 that led to the introduction of cooled egr were associated with a 3 % drop in engine efficiency , bucking a trend of a

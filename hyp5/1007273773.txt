the first egr systems were crude ; some were as simple as an orifice jet between the exhaust and intake tracts which admitted exhaust to the intake tract whenever the engine was running by 1973 , an egr valve controlled by manifold vacuum opened or closed to admit exhaust to the intake tract only under certain conditions moreover , the egr valve was controlled , in part , by vacuum drawn from the carburetor venturi , which allowed more precise constraint of egr flow to only those engine load conditions under which is likely to form '' 1973 cleaner air system highlights '' – chrysler corporation , imperialclub.com later , backpressure transducers were added to the egr valve control to further tailor egr flow to engine load conditions in a typical automotive spark-ignited ( si ) engine , 5 % to 15 % of the exhaust gas is routed back to the intake as egr the impact of egr on engine efficiency largely depends on the specific engine design , and sometimes leads to a compromise between efficiency and emissions since the egr system recirculates a portion of exhaust gases , over time the valve can become clogged with carbon deposits that prevent it from operating properly the effect of egr on diesel engine wear , sae 1999-01-0839 , in-cylinder diesel particulate and control 1999 since modern diesels often have a throttle , egr can reduce the need for throttling eliminating losses in the same way that it does for si engines exhaust gas—largely nitrogen , carbon dioxide , and water vapor—has a higher specific heat than air , so it still serves to lower peak combustion temperatures the most common is a diesel particulate filter ( dpf ) in the exhaust system which cleans the exhaust but causes a constant minor reduction in fuel efficiency due to the back pressure created by feeding the lower oxygen exhaust gas into the intake , diesel egr systems lower combustion temperature , reducing emissions of page : 206 though engine manufacturers have refused to release details of the effect of egr on fuel economy , the epa regulations of 2002 that led to the introduction of cooled egr were associated with a 3 % drop in engine efficiency , bucking a trend of a

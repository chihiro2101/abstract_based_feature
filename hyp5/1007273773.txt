the first egr systems were crude ; some were as simple as an orifice jet between the exhaust and intake tracts which admitted exhaust to the intake tract whenever the engine was running moreover , the egr valve was controlled , in part , by vacuum drawn from the carburetor venturi , which allowed more precise constraint of egr flow to only those engine load conditions under which is likely to form '' 1973 cleaner air system highlights '' – chrysler corporation , imperialclub.com later , backpressure transducers were added to the egr valve control to further tailor egr flow to engine load conditions the 3.6 chrysler pentastar engine is one example that does not require egr adding exhaust gas therefore reduces pressure and temperature during the isentropic compression in the cylinder , and lowers the adiabatic flame temperature in a typical automotive spark-ignited ( si ) engine , 5 % to 15 % of the exhaust gas is routed back to the intake as egr the impact of egr on engine efficiency largely depends on the specific engine design , and sometimes leads to a compromise between efficiency and emissions quote : '' recent studies performed by engineers at southwest research institute ( swri ) have examined the role that exhaust gas recirculation ( egr ) can play in reducing , or even eliminating , these sources of inefficiency in gasoline engines in modern diesel engines , the egr gas is usually cooled with a heat exchanger to allow the introduction of a greater mass of recirculated gas exhaust gas—largely nitrogen , carbon dioxide , and water vapor—has a higher specific heat than air , so it still serves to lower peak combustion temperatures by feeding the lower oxygen exhaust gas into the intake , diesel egr systems lower combustion temperature , reducing emissions of egr systems can also add abrasive contaminants and increase engine oil acidity , which in turn can reduce engine longevity

the first egr systems were crude ; some were as simple as an orifice jet between the exhaust and intake tracts which admitted exhaust to the intake tract whenever the engine was running control systems grew more sophisticated as automakers gained experience ; volkswagen 's '' coolant controlled exhaust gas recirculation '' system of 1973 exemplified this evolution : a coolant temperature sensor blocked vacuum to the egr valve until the engine reached normal operating temperature moreover , the egr valve was controlled , in part , by vacuum drawn from the carburetor venturi , which allowed more precise constraint of egr flow to only those engine load conditions under which is likely to form '' 1973 cleaner air system highlights '' â€“ chrysler corporation , imperialclub.com later , backpressure transducers were added to the egr valve control to further tailor egr flow to engine load conditions adding exhaust gas therefore reduces pressure and temperature during the isentropic compression in the cylinder , and lowers the adiabatic flame temperature in a typical automotive spark-ignited ( si ) engine , 5 % to 15 % of the exhaust gas is routed back to the intake as egr exhaust recirculated back into the cylinder can increase engine wear as carbon particulates blow by the piston rings and into the oil the effect of egr on diesel engine wear , sae 1999-01-0839 , in-cylinder diesel particulate and control 1999 since modern diesels often have a throttle , egr can reduce the need for throttling eliminating losses in the same way that it does for si engines however , adding egr to a diesel reduces the specific heat ratio of the combustion gases in the power stroke by feeding the lower oxygen exhaust gas into the intake , diesel egr systems lower combustion temperature , reducing emissions of egr systems can also add abrasive contaminants and increase engine oil acidity , which in turn can reduce engine longevity page : 206 though engine manufacturers have refused to release details of the effect of egr on fuel economy , the epa regulations of 2002 that led to the introduction of cooled egr were associated with a 3 % drop in engine efficiency , bucking a trend of a

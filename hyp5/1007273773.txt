the first egr systems were crude ; some were as simple as an orifice jet between the exhaust and intake tracts which admitted exhaust to the intake tract whenever the engine was running control systems grew more sophisticated as automakers gained experience ; volkswagen 's '' coolant controlled exhaust gas recirculation '' system of 1973 exemplified this evolution : a coolant temperature sensor blocked vacuum to the egr valve until the engine reached normal operating temperature moreover , the egr valve was controlled , in part , by vacuum drawn from the carburetor venturi , which allowed more precise constraint of egr flow to only those engine load conditions under which is likely to form '' 1973 cleaner air system highlights '' – chrysler corporation , imperialclub.com later , backpressure transducers were added to the egr valve control to further tailor egr flow to engine load conditions in a typical automotive spark-ignited ( si ) engine , 5 % to 15 % of the exhaust gas is routed back to the intake as egr a properly operating egr can theoretically increase the efficiency of gasoline engines via several mechanisms : reduced throttling losses the addition of inert exhaust gas into the intake system means that for a given power output , the throttle plate must be opened further , resulting in increased inlet manifold pressure and reduced throttling losses in internally funded research , they determined that egr can improve the fuel consumption of both direct-injected and port-injected gasoline engines by reducing pumping losses , mitigating knock , cooling the exhaust and eliminating the need for fuel enrichment exhaust gas—largely nitrogen , carbon dioxide , and water vapor—has a higher specific heat than air , so it still serves to lower peak combustion temperatures the most common is a diesel particulate filter ( dpf ) in the exhaust system which cleans the exhaust but causes a constant minor reduction in fuel efficiency due to the back pressure created by feeding the lower oxygen exhaust gas into the intake , diesel egr systems lower combustion temperature , reducing emissions of egr systems can also add abrasive contaminants and increase engine oil acidity , which in turn can reduce engine longevity

wipo , international survey on private copying - law & practice 2013 ( 23rd ed ) p.4 : '' a levy was first introduced in germany in 1966 levies today are assessed on recordable compact discs , a form of media that did not exist when levies were first conceived this is debatable , however : levies could be seen as not being an advance for fines , but rather , only intended to compensate for copies in the private sphere that are legally allowed in many jurisdictions a difficulty that immediately arises is the practical impossibility of devising a mechanism for distributing the proceeds to copyright holders that is considered '' fair '' by all copyright holders and consumers implemented systems are typically restricted to music and may distribute the proceeds proportionally to a measurement of sales of cds in music shops or amount of air-play on radio or the like while the prime purpose of levy systems is to compensate authors , some part of the collected money is also used for general cultural funding purposes this funding is usually executed by the same entities ( collecting societies ) that distribute the levy money to individual authors the discrepancy between reality and the assumption underlying a levy system is growing as '' web 2.0 '' matures , with pervasive user-supplied content , from wikipedia to youtube an implementation question that arises is whether the tax applies to any type of copyrighted work or is restricted to a limited field such as music if it is restricted then the issue arises of how to collect the tax on media which can also be used for other purposes collecting the tax on all media but allowing purchasers to claim a refund for media applied to non-covered uses with respect to fairness in countries with the levy everyone is shares in the financial burden caused by the levy in countries that do not have the levy , many people are copying music and never receive any reprimands while others are made an example and prosecuted this is the similar argument that non-proponents to the levy system use to show fault finally , those countries that do not have private copying laws are in fact making many of their citizens criminals lawyers rather than artists may well be the greatest beneficiaries in non-private copying countries this argument assumes that private copying can only be allowed with a levy it is theorized that such levy may be linked to a corresponding relaxation of copyright law , by permitting the recording of copyrighted works on media for which the tax has been paid the court found the tax legal even though it went to private sources because it served a public purpose copyright amendment act 1989 ( cth ) introduced the levy on blank tapes but was later repealed by copyright amendment ( re-enactment ) act 1993 following the '' blank tapes levy case '' in the hca in 1993 in belgium a fee is charged on both blank media and recording equipment which is passed on to '' auvibel '' , which is in charge of distributing the funds the power to set rates and to set the distribution allocation is vested in the copyright board of canada in canada : the levy applies to '' blank audio recording media '' , such as cd-rs the levy is paid by importers and manufacturers of such media sold within canada ( and typically passed on to the retailer , and passed on to the purchaser ) canada 's current private copying levies are as follows : 0.29 per unit for cd-r , cd-rw , cd-r audio , cd-rw audio disks copyright act of canada copyright board canada canadian private copying collective copyswede the finnish site for private copying levy

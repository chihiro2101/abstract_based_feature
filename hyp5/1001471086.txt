wipo , international survey on private copying - law & practice 2013 ( 23rd ed ) p.4 : '' a levy was first introduced in germany in 1966 levies today are assessed on recordable compact discs , a form of media that did not exist when levies were first conceived this is debatable , however : levies could be seen as not being an advance for fines , but rather , only intended to compensate for copies in the private sphere that are legally allowed in many jurisdictions a difficulty that immediately arises is the practical impossibility of devising a mechanism for distributing the proceeds to copyright holders that is considered '' fair '' by all copyright holders and consumers implemented systems are typically restricted to music and may distribute the proceeds proportionally to a measurement of sales of cds in music shops or amount of air-play on radio or the like while the prime purpose of levy systems is to compensate authors , some part of the collected money is also used for general cultural funding purposes this funding is usually executed by the same entities ( collecting societies ) that distribute the levy money to individual authors the cost of producing a certain amount of bits widely varies by type of information an implementation question that arises is whether the tax applies to any type of copyrighted work or is restricted to a limited field such as music if it is restricted then the issue arises of how to collect the tax on media which can also be used for other purposes collecting the tax on all media but allowing purchasers to claim a refund for media applied to non-covered uses with respect to fairness in countries with the levy everyone is shares in the financial burden caused by the levy in countries that do not have the levy , many people are copying music and never receive any reprimands while others are made an example and prosecuted they advocate that if the levy can not be precisely applied to the people that are private copying , it is a faulty system this argument assumes that private copying can only be allowed with a levy even when restricting levy system to devices that primarily play music , this itself creates loopholes that prevents collecting levies from cellphones , pdas , and other all-in-one portable electronic devices the court found the tax legal even though it went to private sources because it served a public purpose the copyright board has handed the task of collecting and distributing the funds to the canadian private copying collective , which is a non-profit private organization in canada : the levy applies to '' blank audio recording media '' , such as cd-rs with the exception of the zero-rating exemption , the levy is collected regardless of the purchaser 's end use of the media 654 before this , the proposed rates were 2 for players with less than 1 gb of capacity , 15 for players up to 15 gb , and 25 for players 15 gb and over in addition , cpcc also proposed levies of 2 to 10 for memory cards ( since withdrawn ) , 8 cent increases to cd , cd-r audio , cd-rw audio and minidiscs on october 26 , 2007 , the court granted the canadian recording industry association 's request to intervene in the private copying/ipod levy judicial review some argue that cria wanted to limit the scope of the private copying levy , given that it legalizes copying for the private use of the person making the copy , possibly regardless of whether the source is non-infringing or not making it a popular '' copying levy haven '' for blank media buyers from countries such as france and germany copyright act of canada copyright board canada canadian private copying collective copyswede the finnish site for private copying levy

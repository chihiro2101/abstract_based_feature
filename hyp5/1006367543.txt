there are many consistent or standardized romanization systems source , or donor language – a system may be tailored to romanize text from a particular language , or a series of languages , or for any language in a particular writing system a language-specific system typically preserves language features like pronunciation , while the general one may be better for cataloguing international texts target , or receiver language – most systems are intended for an audience that speaks or reads a particular language ( so-called international romanization systems for cyrillic text are based on central-european alphabets like the czech and croatian alphabet ) simplicity – since the basic latin alphabet has a smaller number of letters than many other writing systems , digraphs , diacritics , or special characters must be used to represent them all in latin script this affects the ease of creation , digital storage and transmission , reproduction , and reading of the romanized text if the romanization attempts to transliterate the original script , the guiding principle is a one-to-one mapping of characters in the source language into the target script , with less emphasis on how the result sounds when pronounced according to the reader 's language for example , the nihon-shiki romanization of japanese allows the informed reader to reconstruct the original japanese kana syllables with 100 % accuracy , but requires additional knowledge for correct pronunciation most romanizations are intended to enable the casual reader who is unfamiliar with the original script to pronounce the source language reasonably accurately such romanizations follow the principle of phonemic orthography and attempt to render the significant sounds ( phonemes ) of the original as faithfully as possible in the target language the popular hepburn romanization of japanese is an example of a transcriptive romanization designed for english speakers a phonetic conversion goes one step further and attempts to depict all phones in the source language , sacrificing legibility if necessary by using characters or conventions not found in the target script the international phonetic alphabet is the most common system of phonetic transcription for most language pairs , building a usable romanization involves trade-offs between the two extremes pure transcriptions are generally not possible , as the source language usually contains sounds and distinctions not found in the target language , but which must be shown for the romanized form to be comprehensible in modern times the chain of transcription is usually spoken foreign language , written foreign language , written native language , spoken ( read ) native language romanization standards include the following : deutsche morgenländische gesellschaft ( 1936 ) : adopted by the international convention of orientalist scholars in rome bs 4280 ( 1968 ) : developed by the british standards institution satts ( 1970s ) : a one-for-one substitution system , a legacy from the morse code era ungegn ( 1972 ) din 31635 ( 1982 ) : developed by the deutsches institut für normung ( german institute for standardization ) iso 233 ( 1984 ) qalam ( 1985 ) : a system that focuses upon preserving the spelling , rather than the pronunciation , and uses mixed case iso 233-2 ( 1993 ) : simplified transliteration buckwalter transliteration ( 1990s ) : developed at xerox by tim buckwalter ;

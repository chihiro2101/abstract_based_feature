source , or donor language – a system may be tailored to romanize text from a particular language , or a series of languages , or for any language in a particular writing system a language-specific system typically preserves language features like pronunciation , while the general one may be better for cataloguing international texts ( so-called international romanization systems for cyrillic text are based on central-european alphabets like the czech and croatian alphabet reversibility – whether or not the original can be restored from the converted text if the romanization attempts to transliterate the original script , the guiding principle is a one-to-one mapping of characters in the source language into the target script , with less emphasis on how the result sounds when pronounced according to the reader 's language most romanizations are intended to enable the casual reader who is unfamiliar with the original script to pronounce the source language reasonably accurately the popular hepburn romanization of japanese is an example of a transcriptive romanization designed for english speakers a phonetic conversion goes one step further and attempts to depict all phones in the source language , sacrificing legibility if necessary by using characters or conventions not found in the target script the international phonetic alphabet is the most common system of phonetic transcription pure transcriptions are generally not possible , as the source language usually contains sounds and distinctions not found in the target language , but which must be shown for the romanized form to be comprehensible in modern times the chain of transcription is usually spoken foreign language , written foreign language , written native language , spoken ( read ) native language in general , outside a limited audience of scholars , romanizations tend to lean more towards transcription romanization of specific writing systems : the below listing may be incomplete , see also : category : romanization qalam ( 1985 ) : a system that focuses upon preserving the spelling , rather than the pronunciation , and uses mixed case iso 233-2 ( 1993 ) : simplified transliteration the hebrew alphabet is romanized using several standards : ansi z39.25 ( 1975 ) ungegn ( 1977 ) iso 259 ( 1984 ) : transliteration the brahmic family of abugidas is used for languages of the indian subcontinent and south-east asia there is a long tradition in the west to study sanskrit and other indic texts in latin transliteration various transliteration conventions have been used for indic scripts since the time of sir william jones hindustani is an indo-aryan language with extreme digraphia and diglossia resulting from the hindi–urdu controversy starting in the 1800s two standardized registers , standard hindi and standard urdu , are recognized as official languages in india and pakistan one of primary stated objectives of hamari boli is to relieve hindustani of the crippling devanagari–nastaʿlīq digraphia by way of romanization legge romanization : created by james legge , a scottish missionary ( these comments apply to romanization in general ) iso 7098 ( 1991 ) : based on hanyu pinyin technically this represented a largely phonemic transcription system , as min nan was not commonly written in chinese the most common systems are : hepburn ( 1867 ) : phonetic transcription to anglo-american practices , used in geographical names nihon-shiki ( 1885 ) : transliteration a slightly changed version of mr was the official system for korean in south korea from 1984 to 2000 , and yet a different modification is still the official system in north korea although mostly irrelevant when transcribing uninflected words , these aberrations are so widespread that any mention of '' mccune-reischauer romanization '' may not necessarily refer to the original system as published in the 1930s several problems with mr led to the development of the newer systems : yale ( 1942 ) : this system has become the established standard romanization for korean among linguists revised romanization of korean ( rr ; 2000 ) : includes rules both for transcription and for transliteration german or french ) , some are designed as a librarian 's transliteration , some are prescribed for russian travellers ' passports ; the transcription of some names is purely traditional streamlined system basic and optimized romanization of russian the chart below shows the most common phonemic transcription romanization used for several different alphabets

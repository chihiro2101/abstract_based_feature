there are many consistent or standardized romanization systems source , or donor language – a system may be tailored to romanize text from a particular language , or a series of languages , or for any language in a particular writing system a language-specific system typically preserves language features like pronunciation , while the general one may be better for cataloguing international texts target , or receiver language – most systems are intended for an audience that speaks or reads a particular language ( so-called international romanization systems for cyrillic text are based on central-european alphabets like the czech and croatian alphabet ) simplicity – since the basic latin alphabet has a smaller number of letters than many other writing systems , digraphs , diacritics , or special characters must be used to represent them all in latin script this affects the ease of creation , digital storage and transmission , reproduction , and reading of the romanized text most romanizations are intended to enable the casual reader who is unfamiliar with the original script to pronounce the source language reasonably accurately such romanizations follow the principle of phonemic orthography and attempt to render the significant sounds ( phonemes ) of the original as faithfully as possible in the target language the popular hepburn romanization of japanese is an example of a transcriptive romanization designed for english speakers a phonetic conversion goes one step further and attempts to depict all phones in the source language , sacrificing legibility if necessary by using characters or conventions not found in the target script the international phonetic alphabet is the most common system of phonetic transcription furthermore , due to diachronic and synchronic variance no written language represents any spoken language with perfect accuracy and the vocal interpretation of a script may vary by a great degree among languages in modern times the chain of transcription is usually spoken foreign language , written foreign language , written native language , spoken ( read ) native language in general , outside a limited audience of scholars , romanizations tend to lean more towards transcription the arabic alphabet is used to write arabic , persian , urdu and pashto as well as numerous other languages in the muslim world , particularly african and asian languages without alphabets of their own qalam ( 1985 ) : a system that focuses upon preserving the spelling , rather than the pronunciation , and uses mixed case iso 233-2 ( 1993 ) : simplified transliteration buckwalter transliteration ( 1990s ) : developed at xerox by tim buckwalter ; does n't require unusual diacritics ala-lc ( 1997 ) arabic chat alphabet there are romanization systems for both modern and ancient greek see also transliteration of indic scripts : how to use iso 15919 two standardized registers , standard hindi and standard urdu , are recognized as official languages in india and pakistan one of primary stated objectives of hamari boli is to relieve hindustani of the crippling devanagari–nastaʿlīq digraphia by way of romanization the news international - dec 29 , 2011 -- '' hamari boli ( our language ) is perhaps one of the very first serious undertakings to explore , develop and encourage the growth of roman script in the use of urdu/hindi language romanization of the sinitic languages , particularly mandarin , has proved a very difficult problem , although the issue is further complicated by political considerations because of this , many romanization tables contain chinese characters plus one or more romanizations or zhuyin the system is also used in other chinese-speaking areas such as singapore and parts of taiwan , and has been adopted by much of the international community as a standard for writing chinese words and names in the latin script technically this represented a largely phonemic transcription system , as min nan was not commonly written in chinese ala-lc : similar to modified hepburn wāpuro : ( '' word processor romanization '' ) transliteration while romanization has taken various and at times seemingly unstructured forms , some sets of rules do exist : mccune–reischauer ( mr ; 1937 ? ) , the first transcription to gain some acceptance lukoff romanization , developed 1945–47 for his spoken korean coursebooks systems include : bgn/pcgn ( 1947 ) : transliteration system ( united states board on geographic names & permanent committee on geographical names for british official use ) the latin script for syriac was developed in the 1930s , following the state policy for minority languages of the soviet union , with some material published ala-lc iso 9 ukrainian national transliteration ukrainian national and bgn/pcgn systems , at the un working group on romanization systems thomas t

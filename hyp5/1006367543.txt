there are many consistent or standardized romanization systems a particular system ’ s characteristics may make it better-suited for various , sometimes contradictory applications , including document retrieval , linguistic analysis , easy readability , faithful representation of pronunciation source , or donor language – a system may be tailored to romanize text from a particular language , or a series of languages , or for any language in a particular writing system a language-specific system typically preserves language features like pronunciation , while the general one may be better for cataloguing international texts target , or receiver language – most systems are intended for an audience that speaks or reads a particular language ( so-called international romanization systems for cyrillic text are based on central-european alphabets like the czech and croatian alphabet ) simplicity – since the basic latin alphabet has a smaller number of letters than many other writing systems , digraphs , diacritics , or special characters must be used to represent them all in latin script most romanizations are intended to enable the casual reader who is unfamiliar with the original script to pronounce the source language reasonably accurately such romanizations follow the principle of phonemic orthography and attempt to render the significant sounds ( phonemes ) of the original as faithfully as possible in the target language the popular hepburn romanization of japanese is an example of a transcriptive romanization designed for english speakers the international phonetic alphabet is the most common system of phonetic transcription for most language pairs , building a usable romanization involves trade-offs between the two extremes pure transcriptions are generally not possible , as the source language usually contains sounds and distinctions not found in the target language , but which must be shown for the romanized form to be comprehensible in modern times the chain of transcription is usually spoken foreign language , written foreign language , written native language , spoken ( read ) native language in general , outside a limited audience of scholars , romanizations tend to lean more towards transcription : the below listing may be incomplete , see also : category : romanization the arabic alphabet is used to write arabic , persian , urdu and pashto as well as numerous other languages in the muslim world , particularly african and asian languages without alphabets of their own romanization standards include the following : deutsche morgenländische gesellschaft ( 1936 ) : adopted by the international convention of orientalist scholars in rome qalam ( 1985 ) : a system that focuses upon preserving the spelling , rather than the pronunciation , and uses mixed case iso 233-2 ( 1993 ) : simplified transliteration buckwalter transliteration ( 1990s ) : developed at xerox by tim buckwalter ; does n't require unusual diacritics ala-lc ( 1997 ) arabic chat alphabet the brahmic family of abugidas is used for languages of the indian subcontinent and south-east asia iso 15919 ( 2001 ) : a standard transliteration convention was codified in the iso 15919 standard it uses diacritics to map the much larger set of brahmic consonants and vowels to the latin script two standardized registers , standard hindi and standard urdu , are recognized as official languages in india and pakistan initiated in 2011 , the hamari boli initiative is a full-scale open-source language planning initiative aimed at hindustani script , style , status & lexical reform and modernization technically this represented a largely phonemic transcription system , as min nan was not commonly written in chinese romanization ( or , more generally , roman letters ) is called '' rōmaji '' in japanese ala-lc : similar to modified hepburn wāpuro : ( '' word processor romanization '' ) transliteration when spain colonised the philippines in the late 16th century , the numerous languages of the philippines were written in various scripts , such as baybayin there is no single universally accepted system of writing russian using the latin script—in fact there are a huge number of such systems : some are adjusted for a particular target language ( e.g systems include : bgn/pcgn ( 1947 ) : transliteration system ( united states board on geographic names & permanent committee on geographical names for british official use ) comparative transliteration of russian in different languages ( western european , arabic , georgian , braille , morse ) the chart below shows the most common phonemic transcription romanization used for several different alphabets

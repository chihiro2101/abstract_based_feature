there are many consistent or standardized romanization systems source , or donor language – a system may be tailored to romanize text from a particular language , or a series of languages , or for any language in a particular writing system a language-specific system typically preserves language features like pronunciation , while the general one may be better for cataloguing international texts target , or receiver language – most systems are intended for an audience that speaks or reads a particular language ( so-called international romanization systems for cyrillic text are based on central-european alphabets like the czech and croatian alphabet ) simplicity – since the basic latin alphabet has a smaller number of letters than many other writing systems , digraphs , diacritics , or special characters must be used to represent them all in latin script reversibility – whether or not the original can be restored from the converted text if the romanization attempts to transliterate the original script , the guiding principle is a one-to-one mapping of characters in the source language into the target script , with less emphasis on how the result sounds when pronounced according to the reader 's language most romanizations are intended to enable the casual reader who is unfamiliar with the original script to pronounce the source language reasonably accurately the popular hepburn romanization of japanese is an example of a transcriptive romanization designed for english speakers a phonetic conversion goes one step further and attempts to depict all phones in the source language , sacrificing legibility if necessary by using characters or conventions not found in the target script the international phonetic alphabet is the most common system of phonetic transcription pure transcriptions are generally not possible , as the source language usually contains sounds and distinctions not found in the target language , but which must be shown for the romanized form to be comprehensible furthermore , due to diachronic and synchronic variance no written language represents any spoken language with perfect accuracy and the vocal interpretation of a script may vary by a great degree among languages in modern times the chain of transcription is usually spoken foreign language , written foreign language , written native language , spoken ( read ) native language in general , outside a limited audience of scholars , romanizations tend to lean more towards transcription romanization of specific writing systems qalam ( 1985 ) : a system that focuses upon preserving the spelling , rather than the pronunciation , and uses mixed case iso 233-2 ( 1993 ) : simplified transliteration buckwalter transliteration ( 1990s ) : developed at xerox by tim buckwalter ;

source , or donor language – a system may be tailored to romanize text from a particular language , or a series of languages , or for any language in a particular writing system a language-specific system typically preserves language features like pronunciation , while the general one may be better for cataloguing international texts target , or receiver language – most systems are intended for an audience that speaks or reads a particular language ( so-called international romanization systems for cyrillic text are based on central-european alphabets like the czech and croatian alphabet ) simplicity – since the basic latin alphabet has a smaller number of letters than many other writing systems , digraphs , diacritics , or special characters must be used to represent them all in latin script if the romanization attempts to transliterate the original script , the guiding principle is a one-to-one mapping of characters in the source language into the target script , with less emphasis on how the result sounds when pronounced according to the reader 's language for example , the nihon-shiki romanization of japanese allows the informed reader to reconstruct the original japanese kana syllables with 100 % accuracy , but requires additional knowledge for correct pronunciation the popular hepburn romanization of japanese is an example of a transcriptive romanization designed for english speakers a phonetic conversion goes one step further and attempts to depict all phones in the source language , sacrificing legibility if necessary by using characters or conventions not found in the target script the international phonetic alphabet is the most common system of phonetic transcription for most language pairs , building a usable romanization involves trade-offs between the two extremes pure transcriptions are generally not possible , as the source language usually contains sounds and distinctions not found in the target language , but which must be shown for the romanized form to be comprehensible furthermore , due to diachronic and synchronic variance no written language represents any spoken language with perfect accuracy and the vocal interpretation of a script may vary by a great degree among languages in modern times the chain of transcription is usually spoken foreign language , written foreign language , written native language , spoken ( read ) native language : the below listing may be incomplete , see also : category : romanization the arabic alphabet is used to write arabic , persian , urdu and pashto as well as numerous other languages in the muslim world , particularly african and asian languages without alphabets of their own there is a long tradition in the west to study sanskrit and other indic texts in latin transliteration iso 15919 ( 2001 ) : a standard transliteration convention was codified in the iso 15919 standard it uses diacritics to map the much larger set of brahmic consonants and vowels to the latin script two standardized registers , standard hindi and standard urdu , are recognized as official languages in india and pakistan the news international - dec 29 , 2011 -- '' hamari boli ( our language ) is perhaps one of the very first serious undertakings to explore , develop and encourage the growth of roman script in the use of urdu/hindi language ala-lc : used to be similar to wade–giles , but converted to hanyu pinyin in 2000 efeo developed by école française d'extrême-orient in the 19th century , used mainly in france hanyu pinyin ( 1958 ) : in mainland china , hanyu pinyin has been used officially to romanize mandarin for decades , primarily as a linguistic tool for teaching the standardized language the system is also used in other chinese-speaking areas such as singapore and parts of taiwan , and has been adopted by much of the international community as a standard for writing chinese words and names in the latin script pe̍h-ōe-jī ( poj ) , once the de facto official script of the presbyterian church in taiwan ( since the late 19th century ) technically this represented a largely phonemic transcription system , as min nan was not commonly written in chinese romanization ( or , more generally , roman letters ) is called '' rōmaji '' in japanese ala-lc : similar to modified hepburn wāpuro : ( '' word processor romanization '' ) transliteration these were eventually superseded by the pilipino alphabet and by the 28-letter , modern filipino alphabet , which adds ñ and the native ng to the standard , 26-letter latin alphabet there is no single universally accepted system of writing russian using the latin script—in fact there are a huge number of such systems : some are adjusted for a particular target language ( e.g german or french ) , some are designed as a librarian 's transliteration , some are prescribed for russian travellers ' passports ;

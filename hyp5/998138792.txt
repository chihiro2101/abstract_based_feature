the earliest modes of operation , ecb , cbc , ofb , and cfb ( see below for all ) , date back to 1981 and were specified in fips 81 , des modes of operation in 2001 , the us national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) revised its list of approved modes of operation by including aes as a block cipher and adding ctr mode in sp800-38a , recommendation for block cipher modes of operation finally , in january , 2010 , nist added xts-aes in sp800-38e , recommendation for block cipher modes of operation : the xts-aes mode for confidentiality on storage devices for example , cts is ciphertext stealing mode and available in many popular cryptographic libraries the block cipher modes ecb , cbc , ofb , cfb , ctr , and xts provide confidentiality , but they do not protect against accidental modification or malicious tampering hmac was approved in 2002 as fips 198 , the keyed-hash message authentication code ( hmac ) , cmac was released in 2005 under sp800-38b , recommendation for block cipher modes of operation : the cmac mode for authentication , and gmac was formalized in 2007 under sp800-38d , recommendation for block cipher modes of operation : galois/counter mode ( gcm ) and gmac an initialization vector ( iv ) or starting variable ( sv ) is a block of bits that is used by several modes to randomize the encryption and hence to produce distinct ciphertexts even if the same plaintext is encrypted multiple times , without the need for a slower re-keying process for most block cipher modes it is important that an initialization vector is never reused under the same key , i.e many block cipher modes have stronger requirements , such as the iv must be random or pseudorandom some block ciphers have particular problems with certain initialization vectors , such as all zero iv generating no encryption ( for some keys ) this can be seen because both modes effectively create a bitstream that is xored with the plaintext , and this bitstream is dependent on the key and iv only in cbc mode , the iv must be unpredictable ( random or pseudorandom ) at encryption time ; in particular , the ( previously ) common practice of re-using the last ciphertext block of a message as the iv for the next message is insecure ( for example , this method was used by ssl 2.0 ) for some keys an all-zero initialization vector may generate some block cipher modes ( cfb-8 , ofb-8 ) to get internal state stuck at all-zero a block cipher works on units of a fixed size ( known as a block size ) , but messages come in a variety of lengths slightly more complex is the original des method , which is to add a single one bit , followed by enough zero bits to fill out the block ; if the message ends on a block boundary , a whole padding block will be added cfb , ofb and ctr modes do not require any special measures to handle messages whose lengths are not multiples of the block size , since the modes work by xoring the plaintext with the output of the block cipher this characteristic of stream ciphers makes them suitable for applications that require the encrypted ciphertext data to be the same size as the original plaintext data , and for applications that transmit data in streaming form where it is inconvenient to add padding bytes a number of modes of operation have been designed to combine secrecy and authentication in a single cryptographic primitive in addition , some modes also allow for the authentication of unencrypted associated data , and these are called aead ( authenticated encryption with associated data ) schemes like in ctr , blocks are numbered sequentially , and then this block number is combined with an iv and encrypted with a block cipher , usually aes like all counter modes , this is essentially a stream cipher , and so it is essential that a different iv is used for each stream that is encrypted different cipher modes mask patterns by cascading outputs from the cipher block or other globally deterministic variables into the subsequent cipher block they are generally used in modes of operation similar to the block modes described here

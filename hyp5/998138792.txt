the earliest modes of operation , ecb , cbc , ofb , and cfb ( see below for all ) , date back to 1981 and were specified in fips 81 , des modes of operation in 2001 , the us national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) revised its list of approved modes of operation by including aes as a block cipher and adding ctr mode in sp800-38a , recommendation for block cipher modes of operation finally , in january , 2010 , nist added xts-aes in sp800-38e , recommendation for block cipher modes of operation : the xts-aes mode for confidentiality on storage devices for example , cts is ciphertext stealing mode and available in many popular cryptographic libraries the block cipher modes ecb , cbc , ofb , cfb , ctr , and xts provide confidentiality , but they do not protect against accidental modification or malicious tampering hmac was approved in 2002 as fips 198 , the keyed-hash message authentication code ( hmac ) , cmac was released in 2005 under sp800-38b , recommendation for block cipher modes of operation : the cmac mode for authentication , and gmac was formalized in 2007 under sp800-38d , recommendation for block cipher modes of operation : galois/counter mode ( gcm ) and gmac an initialization vector ( iv ) or starting variable ( sv ) is a block of bits that is used by several modes to randomize the encryption and hence to produce distinct ciphertexts even if the same plaintext is encrypted multiple times , without the need for a slower re-keying process an initialization vector has different security requirements than a key , so the iv usually does not need to be secret for most block cipher modes it is important that an initialization vector is never reused under the same key , i.e many block cipher modes have stronger requirements , such as the iv must be random or pseudorandom it is recommended to review relevant iv requirements for the particular block cipher mode in relevant specification , for example sp800-38a in cbc mode , the iv must be unpredictable ( random or pseudorandom ) at encryption time ; in particular , the ( previously ) common practice of re-using the last ciphertext block of a message as the iv for the next message is insecure ( for example , this method was used by ssl 2.0 ) if an attacker knows the iv ( or the previous block of ciphertext ) before the next plaintext is specified , they can check their guess about plaintext of some block that was encrypted with the same key before ( this is known as the tls cbc iv attack ) for some keys an all-zero initialization vector may generate some block cipher modes ( cfb-8 , ofb-8 ) to get internal state stuck at all-zero synthetic initialization vector ( siv ) synthesize an internal iv by running an pseudo-random function ( prf ) construction called s2v on the input ( additional data and plaintext ) , preventing any external data from directly controlling the iv so some modes ( namely ecb and cbc ) require that the final block be padded before encryption the simplest is to add null bytes to the plaintext to bring its length up to a multiple of the block size , but care must be taken that the original length of the plaintext can be recovered ; this is trivial , for example , if the plaintext is a c style string which contains no null bytes except at the end slightly more complex is the original des method , which is to add a single one bit , followed by enough zero bits to fill out the block ; if the message ends on a block boundary , a whole padding block will be added this characteristic of stream ciphers makes them suitable for applications that require the encrypted ciphertext data to be the same size as the original plaintext data , and for applications that transmit data in streaming form where it is inconvenient to add padding bytes some single-pass authenticated encryption algorithms , such as ocb mode , are encumbered by patents , while others were specifically designed and released in a way to avoid such encumberment in addition , some modes also allow for the authentication of unencrypted associated data , and these are called aead ( authenticated encryption with associated data ) schemes different cipher modes mask patterns by cascading outputs from the cipher block or other globally deterministic variables into the subsequent cipher block deterministic authenticated encryption modes such as the nist key wrap algorithm and the siv ( rfc 5297 ) aead mode do not require an iv as an input , and return the same ciphertext and authentication tag every time for a given plaintext and key

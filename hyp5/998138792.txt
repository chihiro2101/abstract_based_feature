the earliest modes of operation , ecb , cbc , ofb , and cfb ( see below for all ) , date back to 1981 and were specified in fips 81 , des modes of operation in 2001 , the us national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) revised its list of approved modes of operation by including aes as a block cipher and adding ctr mode in sp800-38a , recommendation for block cipher modes of operation finally , in january , 2010 , nist added xts-aes in sp800-38e , recommendation for block cipher modes of operation : the xts-aes mode for confidentiality on storage devices the block cipher modes ecb , cbc , ofb , cfb , ctr , and xts provide confidentiality , but they do not protect against accidental modification or malicious tampering hmac was approved in 2002 as fips 198 , the keyed-hash message authentication code ( hmac ) , cmac was released in 2005 under sp800-38b , recommendation for block cipher modes of operation : the cmac mode for authentication , and gmac was formalized in 2007 under sp800-38d , recommendation for block cipher modes of operation : galois/counter mode ( gcm ) and gmac they therefore began to supply modes which combined confidentiality and data integrity into a single cryptographic primitive ( an encryption algorithm ) an initialization vector ( iv ) or starting variable ( sv ) is a block of bits that is used by several modes to randomize the encryption and hence to produce distinct ciphertexts even if the same plaintext is encrypted multiple times , without the need for a slower re-keying process for most block cipher modes it is important that an initialization vector is never reused under the same key , i.e some block ciphers have particular problems with certain initialization vectors , such as all zero iv generating no encryption ( for some keys ) in cbc mode , the iv must be unpredictable ( random or pseudorandom ) at encryption time ; in particular , the ( previously ) common practice of re-using the last ciphertext block of a message as the iv for the next message is insecure ( for example , this method was used by ssl 2.0 ) if an attacker knows the iv ( or the previous block of ciphertext ) before the next plaintext is specified , they can check their guess about plaintext of some block that was encrypted with the same key before ( this is known as the tls cbc iv attack ) for some keys an all-zero initialization vector may generate some block cipher modes ( cfb-8 , ofb-8 ) to get internal state stuck at all-zero aes-gcm-siv synthesize an internal iv by running polyval galois mode of authentication on input ( additional data and plaintext ) , followed by an aes operation a block cipher works on units of a fixed size ( known as a block size ) , but messages come in a variety of lengths so some modes ( namely ecb and cbc ) require that the final block be padded before encryption cfb , ofb and ctr modes do not require any special measures to handle messages whose lengths are not multiples of the block size , since the modes work by xoring the plaintext with the output of the block cipher authenticated encryption with additional data ( aead ) modes authenticated encryption modes are classified as single-pass modes or double-pass modes like in ctr , blocks are numbered sequentially , and then this block number is combined with an iv and encrypted with a block cipher , usually aes aes-gcm-siv is a mode of operation for the advanced encryption standard which provides similar performance to galois/counter mode as well as misuse resistance in the event of the reuse of a cryptographic nonce different cipher modes mask patterns by cascading outputs from the cipher block or other globally deterministic variables into the subsequent cipher block many modes use an initialization vector ( iv ) which , depending on the mode , may have requirements such as being only used once ( a nonce ) or being unpredictable ahead of its publication , etc they are generally used in modes of operation similar to the block modes described here

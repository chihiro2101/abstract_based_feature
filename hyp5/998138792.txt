the earliest modes of operation , ecb , cbc , ofb , and cfb ( see below for all ) , date back to 1981 and were specified in fips 81 , des modes of operation in 2001 , the us national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) revised its list of approved modes of operation by including aes as a block cipher and adding ctr mode in sp800-38a , recommendation for block cipher modes of operation finally , in january , 2010 , nist added xts-aes in sp800-38e , recommendation for block cipher modes of operation : the xts-aes mode for confidentiality on storage devices the block cipher modes ecb , cbc , ofb , cfb , ctr , and xts provide confidentiality , but they do not protect against accidental modification or malicious tampering for most block cipher modes it is important that an initialization vector is never reused under the same key , i.e many block cipher modes have stronger requirements , such as the iv must be random or pseudorandom some block ciphers have particular problems with certain initialization vectors , such as all zero iv generating no encryption ( for some keys ) it is recommended to review relevant iv requirements for the particular block cipher mode in relevant specification , for example sp800-38a for cbc and cfb , reusing an iv leaks some information about the first block of plaintext , and about any common prefix shared by the two messages in cbc mode , the iv must be unpredictable ( random or pseudorandom ) at encryption time ; in particular , the ( previously ) common practice of re-using the last ciphertext block of a message as the iv for the next message is insecure ( for example , this method was used by ssl 2.0 ) if an attacker knows the iv ( or the previous block of ciphertext ) before the next plaintext is specified , they can check their guess about plaintext of some block that was encrypted with the same key before ( this is known as the tls cbc iv attack ) aes-gcm-siv synthesize an internal iv by running polyval galois mode of authentication on input ( additional data and plaintext ) , followed by an aes operation a block cipher works on units of a fixed size ( known as a block size ) , but messages come in a variety of lengths so some modes ( namely ecb and cbc ) require that the final block be padded before encryption schneier and ferguson suggest two possibilities , both simple : append a byte with value 128 ( hex 80 ) , followed by as many zero bytes as needed to fill the last block , or pad the last block with n bytes all with value n cfb , ofb and ctr modes do not require any special measures to handle messages whose lengths are not multiples of the block size , since the modes work by xoring the plaintext with the output of the block cipher authenticated encryption modes are classified as single-pass modes or double-pass modes in addition , some modes also allow for the authentication of unencrypted associated data , and these are called aead ( authenticated encryption with associated data ) schemes for example , eax mode is a double-pass aead scheme while ocb mode is single-pass galois/counter mode ( gcm ) combines the well-known counter mode of encryption with the new galois mode of authentication the cbc mode of operation incurs pipeline stalls that hamper its efficiency and performance different cipher modes mask patterns by cascading outputs from the cipher block or other globally deterministic variables into the subsequent cipher block deterministic authenticated encryption modes such as the nist key wrap algorithm and the siv ( rfc 5297 ) aead mode do not require an iv as an input , and return the same ciphertext and authentication tag every time for a given plaintext and key

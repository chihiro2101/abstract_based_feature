the earliest modes of operation , ecb , cbc , ofb , and cfb ( see below for all ) , date back to 1981 and were specified in fips 81 , des modes of operation in 2001 , the us national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) revised its list of approved modes of operation by including aes as a block cipher and adding ctr mode in sp800-38a , recommendation for block cipher modes of operation finally , in january , 2010 , nist added xts-aes in sp800-38e , recommendation for block cipher modes of operation : the xts-aes mode for confidentiality on storage devices for example , cts is ciphertext stealing mode and available in many popular cryptographic libraries the block cipher modes ecb , cbc , ofb , cfb , ctr , and xts provide confidentiality , but they do not protect against accidental modification or malicious tampering hmac was approved in 2002 as fips 198 , the keyed-hash message authentication code ( hmac ) , cmac was released in 2005 under sp800-38b , recommendation for block cipher modes of operation : the cmac mode for authentication , and gmac was formalized in 2007 under sp800-38d , recommendation for block cipher modes of operation : galois/counter mode ( gcm ) and gmac they therefore began to supply modes which combined confidentiality and data integrity into a single cryptographic primitive ( an encryption algorithm ) an initialization vector ( iv ) or starting variable ( sv ) is a block of bits that is used by several modes to randomize the encryption and hence to produce distinct ciphertexts even if the same plaintext is encrypted multiple times , without the need for a slower re-keying process for most block cipher modes it is important that an initialization vector is never reused under the same key , i.e some block ciphers have particular problems with certain initialization vectors , such as all zero iv generating no encryption ( for some keys ) for cbc and cfb , reusing an iv leaks some information about the first block of plaintext , and about any common prefix shared by the two messages for some keys an all-zero initialization vector may generate some block cipher modes ( cfb-8 , ofb-8 ) to get internal state stuck at all-zero aes-gcm-siv synthesize an internal iv by running polyval galois mode of authentication on input ( additional data and plaintext ) , followed by an aes operation a block cipher works on units of a fixed size ( known as a block size ) , but messages come in a variety of lengths slightly more complex is the original des method , which is to add a single one bit , followed by enough zero bits to fill out the block ; if the message ends on a block boundary , a whole padding block will be added cfb , ofb and ctr modes do not require any special measures to handle messages whose lengths are not multiples of the block size , since the modes work by xoring the plaintext with the output of the block cipher the last partial block of plaintext is xored with the first few bytes of the last keystream block , producing a final ciphertext block that is the same size as the final partial plaintext block this characteristic of stream ciphers makes them suitable for applications that require the encrypted ciphertext data to be the same size as the original plaintext data , and for applications that transmit data in streaming form where it is inconvenient to add padding bytes authenticated encryption modes are classified as single-pass modes or double-pass modes aes-gcm-siv is a mode of operation for the advanced encryption standard which provides similar performance to galois/counter mode as well as misuse resistance in the event of the reuse of a cryptographic nonce different cipher modes mask patterns by cascading outputs from the cipher block or other globally deterministic variables into the subsequent cipher block many more modes of operation for block ciphers have been suggested still others do n't categorize as confidentiality , authenticity , or authenticated encryption – for example key feedback mode and davies–meyer hashing

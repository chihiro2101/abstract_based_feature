fermented foods have a long history in many cultures , with sauerkraut being one of the most well-known instances of traditional fermented moist cabbage side dishes although '' sauerkraut '' is a german word , the dish did not originate in germany , as fermenting cabbage as suan cai was already practised back in the days of the building of the great wall of china , and the practice was likely transmitted from china to europe by the tartary it then took root mostly in central and eastern european cuisines , but also in other countries including the netherlands , where it is known as zuurkool , and france , where the name became choucroute the english name is borrowed from german where it means '' sour cabbage '' the names in slavic and other central and eastern european languages have similar meanings with the german word : '' fermented cabbage '' , , , , , , or '' sour cabbage '' , , , , , , , , , , , , , , kisla kapusta ) '' during world war i , due to concerns the american public would reject a product with a german name , american sauerkraut makers relabeled their product as '' liberty cabbage '' for the duration of the war sauerkraut is made by a process of pickling called lactic acid fermentation that is analogous to how traditional ( not heat-treated ) pickled cucumbers and kimchi are made fermentation by lactobacilli is introduced naturally , as these air-borne bacteria culture on raw cabbage leaves where they grow yeasts also are present , and may yield soft sauerkraut of poor flavor when the fermentation temperature is too high the second phase starts as the acid levels become too high for many bacteria , and leuconostoc mesenteroides and other leuconostoc species take dominance a 2004 genomic study found an unexpectedly large diversity of lactic acid bacteria in sauerkraut , and that previous studies had oversimplified this diversity this sourdough process is known as '' backslopping '' or '' inoculum enrichment '' ; when used in making sauerkraut , first- and second-stage population dynamics , important to developing flavor , are bypassed a home made type of very mild sauerkraut is available , where white cabbage is pickled with salt in a refrigerator for only three to seven days sometimes in russia the double fermentation is used , with the initial step producing an exceptionally sour product , which is then '' corrected '' by adding 30-50 % more fresh cabbage and fermenting the mix again many health benefits have been claimed for sauerkraut : it is a high source of vitamins c and k ; the fermentation process increases the bioavailability of nutrients rendering sauerkraut even more nutritious than the original cabbage a polish study in 2010 concluded that '' induction of the key detoxifying enzymes by cabbage juices , particularly sauerkraut , may be responsible for their chemopreventive activity demonstrated by epidemiological studies and in animal models ''

rhodes and the imperial factor rhodes used his wealth and that of his business partner alfred beit and other investors to pursue his dream of creating a british empire in new territories to the north by obtaining mineral rights from the most powerful indigenous chiefs rhodes ' competitive advantage over other mineral prospecting companies was his combination of wealth and astute political instincts , also called the '' imperial factor , '' as he often collaborated with the british government he befriended its local representatives , the british commissioners , and through them organized british protectorates over the mineral concession areas via separate but related treaties in this way he obtained both legality and security for mining operations the imperial factor was a double-edged sword : rhodes did not want the bureaucrats of the colonial office in london to interfere in the empire in africa this put him on a collision course with many in britain , as well as with british missionaries , who favoured what they saw as the more ethical direct rule from london rhodes prevailed because he would pay the cost of administering the territories to the north of south africa against his future mining profits rhodes promoted his business interests as in the strategic interest of britain : preventing the portugal , the germany or the boers from moving into south-central africa rhodes 's companies and agents cemented these advantages by obtaining many mining concessions , as exemplified by the rudd and lochner concessions rhodes had already tried and failed to get a mining concession from lobengula , king of the ndebele of matabeleland during the company 's early days , rhodes and his associates set themselves up to make millions ( hundreds of millions in current pounds ) over the coming years through what has been described as a '' suppressio veri & nbsp ; which must be regarded as one of rhodes 's least creditable actions '' when colonial office functionaries discovered this chicanery in 1891 , they advised secretary of state for the colonies knutsford to consider revoking the concession , but no action was taken armed with the rudd concession , in 1889 rhodes obtained a charter from the british government for his british south africa company ( bsac ) to rule , police , and make new treaties and concessions from the limpopo river to the great lakes of central africa rhodes paid much of the cost so that the british central africa commissioner sir harry johnston , and his successor alfred sharpe , would assist with security for rhodes in the bsac 's north-eastern territories johnston shared rhodes 's expansionist views , but he and his successors were not as pro-settler as rhodes , and disagreed on dealings with africans the bsac had its own police force , the british south africa police , which was used to control matabeleland and mashonaland , in present-day zimbabwe because the gold deposits were on a much smaller scale , many of the white settlers who accompanied the bsac to mashonaland became farmers rather than miners shortly after learning of the assassination of the ndebele spiritual leader , mlimo , by the american scout frederick russell burnham , rhodes walked unarmed into the ndebele stronghold in matobo hills in may 1895 , its name was officially changed to '' rhodesia '' , reflecting rhodes 's popularity among settlers who had been using the name informally since 1891 image : south africa committee vanity fair 1897-11-25.jpg thumb 300px caricature '' empire makers and breakers '' - a scene at the south africa committee 1897 despite occasional efforts to return his body to the united kingdom , his grave remains there still , '' part and parcel of the history of zimbabwe '' and attracts thousands of visitors each year one of rhodes 's dreams ( shared by other members of the british empire ) was for a '' red line '' on the map from the cape to cairo ( on geo-political maps , british dominions were always denoted in red or pink ) i contend that every acre added to our territory means the birth of more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence as rhodes also respected and admired the germans and their kaiser , he allowed german students to be included in the rhodes scholarships rhodes 's views on race have been debated ; he supported the rights of indigenous africans to vote , but critics have labelled him as an '' architect of apartheid '' and a '' white supremacy '' , particularly since 2015 i do not go so far as the member for victoria west , who would not give the black man a vote if the whites maintain their position as the supreme race , the day may come when we shall be thankful that we have the natives with us in their proper position rhodes ' only major impact was his large-scale support of the irish nationalist party , led by charles stewart parnell ( 1846â€“1891 ) rhodes worked well with the afrikaners in the cape colony ; he supported teaching dutch as well as english in public schools '' godwin goes on to say '' rhodes and his cronies fit in perfectly with their surroundings and conformed to the morality ( or lack of it ) of the day rhodes 's bequests , new-york tribune , 6 april 1902 , page 4 he was finally laid to rest at world 's view , a hilltop located approximately south of bulawayo , in what was then rhodesia in his second will , written in 1877 before he had accumulated his wealth , rhodes wanted to create a secret society that would bring the whole world under british rule memorials to rhodes have been opposed since at least the 1950s , when some afrikaner students demanded the removal of a rhodes statue at the university of cape town these include a campaign to change the name of rhodes university and to remove a statue of rhodes from oriel college , oxford in the british film rhodes of africa ( 1936 , directed by austrian filmmaker berthold viertel ) , rhodes was portrayed by canadian actor walter huston in 1996 , bbc-tv made an eight-part television drama about rhodes called rhodes ( tv series )

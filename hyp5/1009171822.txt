rhodes ' competitive advantage over other mineral prospecting companies was his combination of wealth and astute political instincts , also called the '' imperial factor , '' as he often collaborated with the british government he befriended its local representatives , the british commissioners , and through them organized british protectorates over the mineral concession areas via separate but related treaties the imperial factor was a double-edged sword : rhodes did not want the bureaucrats of the colonial office in london to interfere in the empire in africa rhodes prevailed because he would pay the cost of administering the territories to the north of south africa against his future mining profits rhodes 's companies and agents cemented these advantages by obtaining many mining concessions , as exemplified by the rudd and lochner concessions rhodes had already tried and failed to get a mining concession from lobengula , king of the ndebele of matabeleland he sent john moffat , son of the missionary robert moffat , who was trusted by lobengula , to persuade the latter to sign a treaty of friendship with britain , and to look favourably on rhodes 's proposals his associate charles rudd , together with francis thompson and rochfort maguire , assured lobengula that no more than ten white men would mine in matabeleland when lobengula discovered later the true effects of the concession , he tried to renounce it , but the british government ignored him contrary to what the british government and the public had been allowed to think , the rudd concession was not vested in the british south africa company , but in a short-lived ancillary concern of rhodes , rudd and a few others called the central search association , which was quietly formed in london in 1889 when colonial office functionaries discovered this chicanery in 1891 , they advised secretary of state for the colonies knutsford to consider revoking the concession , but no action was taken armed with the rudd concession , in 1889 rhodes obtained a charter from the british government for his british south africa company ( bsac ) to rule , police , and make new treaties and concessions from the limpopo river to the great lakes of central africa rhodes also wanted bechuanaland protectorate ( now botswana ) incorporated in the bsac charter rhodes paid much of the cost so that the british central africa commissioner sir harry johnston , and his successor alfred sharpe , would assist with security for rhodes in the bsac 's north-eastern territories johnston shared rhodes 's expansionist views , but he and his successors were not as pro-settler as rhodes , and disagreed on dealings with africans the bsac had its own police force , the british south africa police , which was used to control matabeleland and mashonaland , in present-day zimbabwe because the gold deposits were on a much smaller scale , many of the white settlers who accompanied the bsac to mashonaland became farmers rather than miners he persuaded the impi to lay down their arms , thus ending the second matabele war rhodes is buried alongside leander starr jameson and 34 british soldiers killed in the shangani patrol rhodes had been instrumental in securing southern african states for the empire france and britain in africa : imperial rivalry and colonial rule ( yale university press , 1971 ) in his last will and testament , rhodes said of the english , '' i contend that we are the first race in the world , and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race '' rhodes wanted to develop a commonwealth in which all of the british-dominated countries in the empire would be imperial federation as rhodes also respected and admired the germans and their kaiser , he allowed german students to be included in the rhodes scholarships he believed that eventually the united kingdom ( including ireland ) , the us , and germany together would dominate the world and ensure perpetual peace rhodes 's views on race have been debated ; he supported the rights of indigenous africans to vote , but critics have labelled him as an '' architect of apartheid '' and a '' white supremacy '' , particularly since 2015 we must adopt a system of despotism , such as works in india , in our relations with the barbarism of south africa '' rhodes advocated the governance of indigenous africans living in the cape colony '' in a state of barbarism and communal tenure '' as '' a subject race i do not go so far as the member for victoria west , who would not give the black man a vote mensing notes that rhodes has the reputation as the most flamboyant exemplar of the british imperial spirit , and always believed that british institutions were the best mensing argues that rhodes quietly developed a more nuanced concept of imperial federation in africa , and that his mature views were more balanced and realistic despite his support for what became the basis for the apartheid system , he is best seen as a cultural racism '' philip ziegler , legacy : cecil rhodes , the rhodes trust and rhodes scholarships ( yale up , 2008 ) online review memorials to rhodes have been opposed since at least the 1950s , when some afrikaner students demanded the removal of a rhodes statue at the university of cape town in june 2020 , amid the wider context of black lives matter protests , the governing body of oxford 's oriel college voted to remove the statue of rhodes cecil rhodes was the subject of a south african television mini-series , barney barnato , made in 1989 and first aired on sabc in early 1990 in the serial , cecil rhodes is played by martin shaw , the younger cecil rhodes is played by his son joe shaw , and princess radziwiłł is played by frances barber '' rhodes features prominently in wilbur smith 's ballantyne series of novels , fictional stories based amongst real events in rhodes ' lifetime .

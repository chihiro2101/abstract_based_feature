rhodes and the imperial factor rhodes used his wealth and that of his business partner alfred beit and other investors to pursue his dream of creating a british empire in new territories to the north by obtaining mineral rights from the most powerful indigenous chiefs he befriended its local representatives , the british commissioners , and through them organized british protectorates over the mineral concession areas via separate but related treaties the imperial factor was a double-edged sword : rhodes did not want the bureaucrats of the colonial office in london to interfere in the empire in africa rhodes prevailed because he would pay the cost of administering the territories to the north of south africa against his future mining profits rhodes promoted his business interests as in the strategic interest of britain : preventing the portugal , the germany or the boers from moving into south-central africa rhodes had already tried and failed to get a mining concession from lobengula , king of the ndebele of matabeleland his associate charles rudd , together with francis thompson and rochfort maguire , assured lobengula that no more than ten white men would mine in matabeleland furthermore , it stated that the mining companies could do anything necessary to their operations when lobengula discovered later the true effects of the concession , he tried to renounce it , but the british government ignored him which must be regarded as one of rhodes 's least creditable actions '' armed with the rudd concession , in 1889 rhodes obtained a charter from the british government for his british south africa company ( bsac ) to rule , police , and make new treaties and concessions from the limpopo river to the great lakes of central africa he obtained further concessions and treaties north of the zambezi , such as those in barotseland ( the lochner concession with king lewanika in 1890 , which was similar to the rudd concession ) ; and in the lake mweru area ( alfred sharpe 's 1890 kazembe concession ) rhodes also wanted bechuanaland protectorate ( now botswana ) incorporated in the bsac charter '' the british colonial office also decided to administer british central africa ( malawi ) owing to the activism of david livingstone trying to end the arab slave trade rhodes paid much of the cost so that the british central africa commissioner sir harry johnston , and his successor alfred sharpe , would assist with security for rhodes in the bsac 's north-eastern territories johnston shared rhodes 's expansionist views , but he and his successors were not as pro-settler as rhodes , and disagreed on dealings with africans shortly after learning of the assassination of the ndebele spiritual leader , mlimo , by the american scout frederick russell burnham , rhodes walked unarmed into the ndebele stronghold in matobo hills despite occasional efforts to return his body to the united kingdom , his grave remains there still , '' part and parcel of the history of zimbabwe '' and attracts thousands of visitors each year one of rhodes 's dreams ( shared by other members of the british empire ) was for a '' red line '' on the map from the cape to cairo ( on geo-political maps , british dominions were always denoted in red or pink ) rhodes wanted to expand the british empire because he believed that the anglo-saxon race was destined to greatness in his last will and testament , rhodes said of the english , '' i contend that we are the first race in the world , and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race i contend that every acre added to our territory means the birth of more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence rhodes explicitly stipulated in his will that all races should be eligible for the scholarships as rhodes also respected and admired the germans and their kaiser , he allowed german students to be included in the rhodes scholarships rhodes 's views on race have been debated ; he supported the rights of indigenous africans to vote , but critics have labelled him as an '' architect of apartheid '' and a '' white supremacy '' , particularly since 2015 we must adopt a system of despotism , such as works in india , in our relations with the barbarism of south africa '' rhodes advocated the governance of indigenous africans living in the cape colony '' in a state of barbarism and communal tenure '' as '' a subject race mensing notes that rhodes has the reputation as the most flamboyant exemplar of the british imperial spirit , and always believed that british institutions were the best mensing argues that rhodes quietly developed a more nuanced concept of imperial federation in africa , and that his mature views were more balanced and realistic rhodes ' only major impact was his large-scale support of the irish nationalist party , led by charles stewart parnell ( 1846â€“1891 ) rhodes worked well with the afrikaners in the cape colony ; he supported teaching dutch as well as english in public schools rhodes memorial stands on rhodes 's favourite spot on the slopes of devil 's peak , cape town , with a view looking north and east towards the cape to cairo route from 1910 to 1984 rhodes 's house in cape town , groote schuur , was the official cape residence of the prime ministers of south africa and continued as a presidential residence a 2015 movement , known as '' rhodes must fall '' ( or rhodesmustfall on social media ) , began with student protests at the university of cape town that were successful in getting university authorities to remove the rhodes statue from the campus following a series of protests and vandalism at the university of cape town , various allied movements both in south africa and other countries have been launched in opposition to cecil rhodes memorials in june 2020 , amid the wider context of black lives matter protests , the governing body of oxford 's oriel college voted to remove the statue of rhodes in the british film rhodes of africa ( 1936 , directed by austrian filmmaker berthold viertel ) , rhodes was portrayed by canadian actor walter huston

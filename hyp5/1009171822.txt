rhodes and the imperial factor rhodes used his wealth and that of his business partner alfred beit and other investors to pursue his dream of creating a british empire in new territories to the north by obtaining mineral rights from the most powerful indigenous chiefs rhodes ' competitive advantage over other mineral prospecting companies was his combination of wealth and astute political instincts , also called the '' imperial factor , '' as he often collaborated with the british government he befriended its local representatives , the british commissioners , and through them organized british protectorates over the mineral concession areas via separate but related treaties the imperial factor was a double-edged sword : rhodes did not want the bureaucrats of the colonial office in london to interfere in the empire in africa rhodes prevailed because he would pay the cost of administering the territories to the north of south africa against his future mining profits rhodes promoted his business interests as in the strategic interest of britain : preventing the portugal , the germany or the boers from moving into south-central africa contrary to what the british government and the public had been allowed to think , the rudd concession was not vested in the british south africa company , but in a short-lived ancillary concern of rhodes , rudd and a few others called the central search association , which was quietly formed in london in 1889 armed with the rudd concession , in 1889 rhodes obtained a charter from the british government for his british south africa company ( bsac ) to rule , police , and make new treaties and concessions from the limpopo river to the great lakes of central africa rhodes also wanted bechuanaland protectorate ( now botswana ) incorporated in the bsac charter rhodes commented : '' it is humiliating to be utterly beaten by these niggers rhodes paid much of the cost so that the british central africa commissioner sir harry johnston , and his successor alfred sharpe , would assist with security for rhodes in the bsac 's north-eastern territories johnston shared rhodes 's expansionist views , but he and his successors were not as pro-settler as rhodes , and disagreed on dealings with africans he persuaded the impi to lay down their arms , thus ending the second matabele war by the end of 1894 , the territories over which the bsac had concessions or treaties , collectively called '' zambesia '' after the zambezi river flowing through the middle , comprised an area of 1,143,000 & nbsp ; km 2 between the limpopo river and lake tanganyika in may 1895 , its name was officially changed to '' rhodesia '' , reflecting rhodes 's popularity among settlers who had been using the name informally since 1891 image : south africa committee vanity fair 1897-11-25.jpg thumb 300px caricature '' empire makers and breakers '' - a scene at the south africa committee 1897 rhodes is buried alongside leander starr jameson and 34 british soldiers killed in the shangani patrol despite occasional efforts to return his body to the united kingdom , his grave remains there still , '' part and parcel of the history of zimbabwe '' and attracts thousands of visitors each year one of rhodes 's dreams ( shared by other members of the british empire ) was for a '' red line '' on the map from the cape to cairo ( on geo-political maps , british dominions were always denoted in red or pink ) he and others felt the best way to '' unify the possessions , facilitate governance , enable the military to move quickly to hot spots or conduct war , help settlement , and foster trade '' would be to build the '' cape to cairo railway '' rhodes wanted to expand the british empire because he believed that the anglo-saxon race was destined to greatness '' rhodes wanted to develop a commonwealth in which all of the british-dominated countries in the empire would be imperial federation rhodes 's views on race have been debated ; he supported the rights of indigenous africans to vote , but critics have labelled him as an '' architect of apartheid '' and a '' white supremacy '' , particularly since 2015 according to magubane , rhodes was '' unhappy that in many cape constituencies , africans could be decisive if more of them exercised this right to vote under current law referring to the cape qualified franchise , '' with rhodes arguing that '' the native is to be treated as a child and denied the franchise we must adopt a system of despotism , such as works in india , in our relations with the barbarism of south africa '' rhodes advocated the governance of indigenous africans living in the cape colony '' in a state of barbarism and communal tenure '' as '' a subject race i do not go so far as the member for victoria west , who would not give the black man a vote if the whites maintain their position as the supreme race , the day may come when we shall be thankful that we have the natives with us in their proper position mensing argues that rhodes quietly developed a more nuanced concept of imperial federation in africa , and that his mature views were more balanced and realistic rhodes ' only major impact was his large-scale support of the irish nationalist party , led by charles stewart parnell ( 1846â€“1891 ) rhodes made pickering the sole beneficiary of his will , but an accident resulted in pickering catching septicaemia , during which time rhodes spent six weeks trying to nurse pickering back to health rhodes used his position and influence to lobby the british government to relieve the siege of kimberley , claiming in the press that the situation in the city was desperate in his second will , written in 1877 before he had accumulated his wealth , rhodes wanted to create a secret society that would bring the whole world under british rule memorials to rhodes have been opposed since at least the 1950s , when some afrikaner students demanded the removal of a rhodes statue at the university of cape town the book contains a vivid description of cecil rhodes himself , seen through the eyes of a traveller from the future british empire in the british film rhodes of africa ( 1936 , directed by austrian filmmaker berthold viertel ) , rhodes was portrayed by canadian actor walter huston '' rhodes features prominently in wilbur smith 's ballantyne series of novels , fictional stories based amongst real events in rhodes ' lifetime .

thrombosis is generally defined by the type of blood vessel affected ( arterial or venous thrombosis ) and the precise location of the blood vessel or the organ supplied by it deep vein thrombosis ( dvt ) is the formation of a blood clot within a deep vein three factors are important in the formation of a blood clot within a deep veinâ€”these are the rate of blood flow , the thickness of the blood and qualities of the vessel wall budd-chiari syndrome is the blockage of a hepatic vein or of the hepatic part of the inferior vena cava renal vein thrombosis is the obstruction of the renal vein by a thrombus symptoms may include headache , abnormal vision , any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs on one side of the body and seizures jugular vein thrombosis is a condition that may occur due to infection , intravenous drug use or malignancy jugular vein thrombosis can have a varying list of complications , including : sepsis , pulmonary embolism , and papilledema though characterized by a sharp pain at the site of the vein , it can prove difficult to diagnose , because it can occur at random arterial thrombosis is the formation of a thrombus within an artery in most cases , arterial thrombosis follows rupture of atheroma ( a fat-rich deposit in the blood vessel wall ) , and is therefore referred to as atherothrombosis arterial embolism occurs when clots then migrate downstream , and can affect any organ alternatively , arterial occlusion occurs as a consequence of embolism of blood clots originating from the heart ( '' cardiogenic '' emboli ) the most common cause is atrial fibrillation , which causes a blood stasis within the atria with easy thrombus formation , but blood clots can develop inside the heart for other reasons too in thrombotic stroke , a thrombus ( blood clot ) usually forms around atherosclerotic plaques myocardial infarction ( mi ) or heart attack , is caused by ischemia , ( restriction in the blood supply ) , often due to the obstruction of a coronary artery by a thrombus '' virchow 's triad '' has been suggested to describe the three factors necessary for the formation of thrombosis : stasis of blood , vessel wall injury , and altered blood coagulation ischemia/infarction : if an arterial thrombus can not be lysed by the body and it does not embolise , and if the thrombus is large enough to impair or occlude blood flow in the involved artery , then local ischemia or infarction will result venous thrombosis can lead to pulmonary embolism when the migrated embolus becomes lodged in the lung arterial embolism can lead to obstruction of blood flow through the blood vessel that is obstructed by it , and lack of oxygen and nutrients ( ischemia ) of the downstream tissue the treatment for thrombosis depends on whether it is in a vein or an artery , the impact on the person , and the risk of complications from treatment arterial thrombosis may require surgery if it causes acute limb ischemia

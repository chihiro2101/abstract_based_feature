thrombosis is generally defined by the type of blood vessel affected ( arterial or venous thrombosis ) and the precise location of the blood vessel or the organ supplied by it deep vein thrombosis ( dvt ) is the formation of a blood clot within a deep vein three factors are important in the formation of a blood clot within a deep veinâ€”these are the rate of blood flow , the thickness of the blood and qualities of the vessel wall paget-schroetter disease or upper extremity dvt ( uedvt ) is the obstruction of an arm vein ( such as the axillary vein or subclavian vein ) by a thrombus portal vein thrombosis affects the hepatic portal vein , which can lead to portal hypertension and reduction of the blood supply to the liver renal vein thrombosis is the obstruction of the renal vein by a thrombus cerebral venous sinus thrombosis jugular vein thrombosis is a condition that may occur due to infection , intravenous drug use or malignancy in most cases , arterial thrombosis follows rupture of atheroma ( a fat-rich deposit in the blood vessel wall ) , and is therefore referred to as atherothrombosis arterial embolism occurs when clots then migrate downstream , and can affect any organ this can be due to ischemia , thrombus , embolus ( a lodged particle ) or hemorrhage ( a bleed ) in thrombotic stroke , a thrombus ( blood clot ) usually forms around atherosclerotic plaques myocardial infarction ( mi ) or heart attack , is caused by ischemia , ( restriction in the blood supply ) , often due to the obstruction of a coronary artery by a thrombus hepatic artery thrombosis usually occurs as a devastating complication after liver transplantation some risk factors predispose for venous thrombosis while others increase the risk of arterial thrombosis the main causes of thrombosis are given in virchow 's triad which lists thrombophilia , endothelial cell injury , and disturbed blood flow recent studies indicate that white blood cells play a pivotal role in deep vein thrombosis , mediating numerous pro-thrombotic actions any inflammatory process , such as trauma , surgery or infection , can cause damage to the endothelium of the vessel 's wall inflammatory and other stimuli ( such as hypercholesterolemia ) can lead to changes in gene expression in endothelium producing to a pro-thrombotic state a venous thrombus may or may not be ischemic , since veins distribute deoxygenated blood that is less vital for cellular metabolism arterial embolism can lead to obstruction of blood flow through the blood vessel that is obstructed by it , and lack of oxygen and nutrients ( ischemia ) of the downstream tissue arterial thrombosis may require surgery if it causes acute limb ischemia

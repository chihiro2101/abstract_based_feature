thrombosis is generally defined by the type of blood vessel affected ( arterial or venous thrombosis ) and the precise location of the blood vessel or the organ supplied by it deep vein thrombosis ( dvt ) is the formation of a blood clot within a deep vein three factors are important in the formation of a blood clot within a deep vein—these are the rate of blood flow , the thickness of the blood and qualities of the vessel wall portal vein thrombosis affects the hepatic portal vein , which can lead to portal hypertension and reduction of the blood supply to the liver renal vein thrombosis is the obstruction of the renal vein by a thrombus cerebral venous sinus thrombosis cerebral venous sinus thrombosis ( cvst ) is a rare form of stroke which results from the blockage of the dural venous sinuses by a thrombus symptoms may include headache , abnormal vision , any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs on one side of the body and seizures jugular vein thrombosis can have a varying list of complications , including : sepsis , pulmonary embolism , and papilledema cavernous sinus thrombosis is a specialised form of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis , where there is thrombosis of the cavernous sinus of the basal skull dura , due to the retrograde spread of infection and endothelial damage from the danger triangle of the face alternatively , arterial occlusion occurs as a consequence of embolism of blood clots originating from the heart ( '' cardiogenic '' emboli ) the most common cause is atrial fibrillation , which causes a blood stasis within the atria with easy thrombus formation , but blood clots can develop inside the heart for other reasons too this can be due to ischemia , thrombus , embolus ( a lodged particle ) or hemorrhage ( a bleed ) in thrombotic stroke , a thrombus ( blood clot ) usually forms around atherosclerotic plaques the former affects vessels such as the internal carotids , vertebral and the circle of willis myocardial infarction ( mi ) or heart attack , is caused by ischemia , ( restriction in the blood supply ) , often due to the obstruction of a coronary artery by a thrombus an arterial thrombus or embolus can also form in the limbs , which can lead to acute limb ischemia '' virchow 's triad '' has been suggested to describe the three factors necessary for the formation of thrombosis : stasis of blood , vessel wall injury , and altered blood coagulation in addition , arterial and cardiac clots are normally rich in platelets–which are required for clot formation in areas under high stress due to blood flow nevertheless , non-ischemic venous thrombosis may still be problematic , due to the swelling caused by blockage to venous drainage venous thrombosis can lead to pulmonary embolism when the migrated embolus becomes lodged in the lung thrombolysis is the pharmacological destruction of blood clots by administering thrombolytic drugs including tissue plasminogen activator , which enhances the normal destruction of blood clots by the body 's enzymes

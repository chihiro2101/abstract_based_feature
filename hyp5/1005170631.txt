thrombosis is generally defined by the type of blood vessel affected ( arterial or venous thrombosis ) and the precise location of the blood vessel or the organ supplied by it deep vein thrombosis ( dvt ) is the formation of a blood clot within a deep vein three factors are important in the formation of a blood clot within a deep vein—these are the rate of blood flow , the thickness of the blood and qualities of the vessel wall this form of thrombosis presents with abdominal pain , ascites and hepatomegaly portal vein thrombosis affects the hepatic portal vein , which can lead to portal hypertension and reduction of the blood supply to the liver cerebral venous sinus thrombosis ( cvst ) is a rare form of stroke which results from the blockage of the dural venous sinuses by a thrombus symptoms may include headache , abnormal vision , any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs on one side of the body and seizures jugular vein thrombosis is a condition that may occur due to infection , intravenous drug use or malignancy arterial thrombosis is the formation of a thrombus within an artery the most common cause is atrial fibrillation , which causes a blood stasis within the atria with easy thrombus formation , but blood clots can develop inside the heart for other reasons too a stroke is the rapid decline of brain function due to a disturbance in the supply of blood to the brain in thrombotic stroke , a thrombus ( blood clot ) usually forms around atherosclerotic plaques thrombotic stroke can be divided into two categories—large vessel disease and small vessel disease myocardial infarction ( mi ) or heart attack , is caused by ischemia , ( restriction in the blood supply ) , often due to the obstruction of a coronary artery by a thrombus an arterial thrombus or embolus can also form in the limbs , which can lead to acute limb ischemia some people have a higher risk of developing thrombosis and its possible development into thromboembolism '' virchow 's triad '' has been suggested to describe the three factors necessary for the formation of thrombosis : stasis of blood , vessel wall injury , and altered blood coagulation some risk factors predispose for venous thrombosis while others increase the risk of arterial thrombosis the main mechanism is exposure of tissue factor to the blood coagulation system ischemia/infarction : if an arterial thrombus can not be lysed by the body and it does not embolise , and if the thrombus is large enough to impair or occlude blood flow in the involved artery , then local ischemia or infarction will result arterial embolism can lead to obstruction of blood flow through the blood vessel that is obstructed by it , and lack of oxygen and nutrients ( ischemia ) of the downstream tissue arterial thrombosis may require surgery if it causes acute limb ischemia

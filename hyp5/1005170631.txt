thrombosis is generally defined by the type of blood vessel affected ( arterial or venous thrombosis ) and the precise location of the blood vessel or the organ supplied by it deep vein thrombosis ( dvt ) is the formation of a blood clot within a deep vein it most commonly affects leg veins , such as the femoral vein three factors are important in the formation of a blood clot within a deep veinâ€”these are the rate of blood flow , the thickness of the blood and qualities of the vessel wall classical signs of dvt include swelling , pain and redness of the affected area paget-schroetter disease or upper extremity dvt ( uedvt ) is the obstruction of an arm vein ( such as the axillary vein or subclavian vein ) by a thrombus portal vein thrombosis affects the hepatic portal vein , which can lead to portal hypertension and reduction of the blood supply to the liver renal vein thrombosis is the obstruction of the renal vein by a thrombus cerebral venous sinus thrombosis ( cvst ) is a rare form of stroke which results from the blockage of the dural venous sinuses by a thrombus jugular vein thrombosis is a condition that may occur due to infection , intravenous drug use or malignancy jugular vein thrombosis can have a varying list of complications , including : sepsis , pulmonary embolism , and papilledema cavernous sinus thrombosis is a specialised form of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis , where there is thrombosis of the cavernous sinus of the basal skull dura , due to the retrograde spread of infection and endothelial damage from the danger triangle of the face arterial thrombosis is the formation of a thrombus within an artery in most cases , arterial thrombosis follows rupture of atheroma ( a fat-rich deposit in the blood vessel wall ) , and is therefore referred to as atherothrombosis the most common cause is atrial fibrillation , which causes a blood stasis within the atria with easy thrombus formation , but blood clots can develop inside the heart for other reasons too myocardial infarction ( mi ) or heart attack , is caused by ischemia , ( restriction in the blood supply ) , often due to the obstruction of a coronary artery by a thrombus an arterial thrombus or embolus can also form in the limbs , which can lead to acute limb ischemia some risk factors predispose for venous thrombosis while others increase the risk of arterial thrombosis the main causes of thrombosis are given in virchow 's triad which lists thrombophilia , endothelial cell injury , and disturbed blood flow endothelial injury is almost invariably involved in the formation of thrombi in arteries , as high rates of blood flow normally hinder clot formation for a mural thrombus ( defined as a thrombus in a large vessel that restricts the blood flow but does not occlude completely ) , histological reorganisation of the thrombus does not occur via the classic wound healing mechanism arterial embolism can lead to obstruction of blood flow through the blood vessel that is obstructed by it , and lack of oxygen and nutrients ( ischemia ) of the downstream tissue

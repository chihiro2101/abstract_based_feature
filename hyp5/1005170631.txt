thrombosis is generally defined by the type of blood vessel affected ( arterial or venous thrombosis ) and the precise location of the blood vessel or the organ supplied by it deep vein thrombosis ( dvt ) is the formation of a blood clot within a deep vein three factors are important in the formation of a blood clot within a deep vein—these are the rate of blood flow , the thickness of the blood and qualities of the vessel wall paget-schroetter disease or upper extremity dvt ( uedvt ) is the obstruction of an arm vein ( such as the axillary vein or subclavian vein ) by a thrombus portal vein thrombosis affects the hepatic portal vein , which can lead to portal hypertension and reduction of the blood supply to the liver renal vein thrombosis is the obstruction of the renal vein by a thrombus cerebral venous sinus thrombosis cerebral venous sinus thrombosis ( cvst ) is a rare form of stroke which results from the blockage of the dural venous sinuses by a thrombus jugular vein thrombosis is a condition that may occur due to infection , intravenous drug use or malignancy jugular vein thrombosis can have a varying list of complications , including : sepsis , pulmonary embolism , and papilledema cavernous sinus thrombosis is a specialised form of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis , where there is thrombosis of the cavernous sinus of the basal skull dura , due to the retrograde spread of infection and endothelial damage from the danger triangle of the face the most common cause is atrial fibrillation , which causes a blood stasis within the atria with easy thrombus formation , but blood clots can develop inside the heart for other reasons too this can be due to ischemia , thrombus , embolus ( a lodged particle ) or hemorrhage ( a bleed ) thrombotic stroke can be divided into two categories—large vessel disease and small vessel disease myocardial infarction ( mi ) or heart attack , is caused by ischemia , ( restriction in the blood supply ) , often due to the obstruction of a coronary artery by a thrombus an arterial thrombus or embolus can also form in the limbs , which can lead to acute limb ischemia thrombosis prevention is initiated with assessing the risk for its development '' virchow 's triad '' has been suggested to describe the three factors necessary for the formation of thrombosis : stasis of blood , vessel wall injury , and altered blood coagulation some risk factors predispose for venous thrombosis while others increase the risk of arterial thrombosis venous thrombosis can lead to pulmonary embolism when the migrated embolus becomes lodged in the lung arterial embolism can lead to obstruction of blood flow through the blood vessel that is obstructed by it , and lack of oxygen and nutrients ( ischemia ) of the downstream tissue arterial thrombosis may require surgery if it causes acute limb ischemia

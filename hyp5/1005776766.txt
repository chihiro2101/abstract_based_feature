they are normally realised as menkheperra djehutymes , meaning '' eternal are the manifestations of ra , born of thoth '' while modern egyptological pronunciation renders his name as djehutymes , at the time of his reign his name was probably pronounced as tahati'missaw leprohon , ronald ( 2013 ) , denise doxey , editor , the great name : ancient egyptian royal titulary , atlanta : society of biblical literature thutmose iii was the son of thutmose ii by a secondary wife , iset his father 's great royal wife was queen hatshepsut when thutmose ii died , thutmose iii was too young to rule hatshepsut became his regent , soon his co-regent , and shortly thereafter declared herself to be the pharaoh while never denying kingship to thutmose iii thutmosis iii had little power over the empire while hatshepsut exercised the formal titulary of kingship when thutmose iii reached a suitable age and demonstrated the capability , she appointed him to head her armies thutmose iii had several wives : satiah : she may have been the mother of his firstborn son , amenemhat o'connor , david and cline , eric h the complete royal families of ancient egypt , thames and hudson thutmose 's successor , the crown prince and future king amenhotep ii , was the son of merytre-hatshepsut additional children include menkheperre and daughters named nebetiunet , meryetamun ( c ) , meryetamun ( d ) and iset merytre-hatshepsut was the daughter of the divine adoratrice huy neferure : thutmose iii may have married his half-sister , but there is no conclusive evidence for this marriage it has been suggested that neferure , instead of satiah , may have been the mother of amenemhat thutmose iii reigned from 1479 & nbsp ; bc to 1425 & nbsp ; bc according to the low chronology of ancient egypt the chronology of the amarna letters with special reference to the hypothetical coregency of amenophis iii and akhenaten though in some circles the older dates 1504 & nbsp ; bc to 1450 & nbsp ; bc are preferred from the high chronology of egypt these two latitudes give dates 20 years apart , the high and low chronologies , respectively the length of thutmose iii 's reign is known to the day thanks to information found in the tomb of the military commander amenemheb-mahu journal of near eastern studies , vol 25 , no 2 amenemheb-mahu records thutmose iii 's death to his master 's 54th regnal year , breasted , james henry jürgen von beckerath , chronologie des pharaonischen ägypten widely considered a military genius by historians , thutmose iii conducted at least 16 campaigns in 20 years boston : ginn and company , 1914 , p.85 he is recorded to have captured 350 cities during his rule and conquered much of the near east from the euphrates to nubia during seventeen known military campaigns he was the first pharaoh after thutmose i to cross the euphrates , doing so during his campaign against mitanni his campaign records were transcribed onto the walls of the temple of amun at karnak and are now transcribed into urkunden iv the older egyptologists , most recently ed a submission of mesopotamia is unthinkable ; and whether the tributes of alashia ( cyprus ) were more than occasional gifts remains questionable thutmose iii encountered little resistance from neighbouring kingdoms , allowing him to expand his realm of influence easily thutmose iii mustered his own army and departed egypt , passing through the border fortress of tjaru ( sile ) on the 25th day of the eighth month the ensuing battle of megiddo probably was the largest battle of thutmose 's 17 campaigns redford , donald b '' despite the laudatory nature of thutmose 's annals , such a pass does indeed exist , although not as narrow as thutmose indicates , gardiner , alan for some reason , the canaanite forces did not attack him as his army emerged , and his army routed them decisively thutmose was forced to besiege the city , but he finally succeeded in conquering it after a siege of seven or eight months ( see battle of megiddo ( 15th century bc ) ) this campaign drastically changed the political situation in the ancient near east by taking megiddo , thutmose gained control of all of northern canaan and the syrian princes were obligated to send tribute and their own sons as hostages to egypt beyond the euphrates , the assyrian , kassites and hittite kings all gave thutmose gifts , which he alleged to be '' tribute '' when he recorded it on the walls of karnak thutmose 's second , third and fourth campaigns appear to have been nothing more than tours of syria and canaan to collect tribute . this text records tribute from the area which the egyptians called retjenu ( roughly equivalent to canaan ) and it was also at this time that assyria paid a second '' tribute '' to thutmose iii ancient records of egypt , vol this survey is dated to thutmose 's 25th year the fifth , sixth and seventh campaigns of thutmose iii were directed against the phoenician cities in syria and against kadesh on the orontes in thutmose 's 29th year , he began his fifth campaign , where he first took an unknown city ( the name falls in a lacuna ) which had been garrisoned by tunip he then moved inland and took the city and territory around ardata ; the town was pillaged and the wheatfields burned unlike previous plundering raids , thutmose iii garrisoned the area known as djahy , which is probably a reference to southern syria a history of ancient egypt although there is no direct evidence for it , it is for this reason that some have supposed that thutmose 's sixth campaign , in his thirtieth year , commenced with a naval transportation of troops directly to byblos , bypassing canaan entirely . turning west again , thutmose took simyra and quelled a rebellion in ardata , which apparently had rebelled again to stop such rebellions , thutmose began taking hostages from the cities in syria thutmose iii found that by taking family members of these key people to egypt as hostages , he could drastically increase their loyalty to him after thutmose iii had taken control of the syrian cities , the obvious target for his eighth campaign was the state of mitanni , a hurrian country with an indo-aryan ruling class he sailed directly to byblos it appears that mitanni was not expecting an invasion , so they had no army of any kind ready to defend against thutmose , although their ships on the euphrates did try to defend against the egyptian crossing he engaged and destroyed three surrounding mitannian garrisons and returned to egypt in victory until recently , a general theory has been that after the death of her husband thutmose ii , hatshepsut 'usurper ' the throne from thutmose iii all of this evidence casts serious doubt upon the popular theory that thutmose iii ordered the destruction in a fit of vengeful rage shortly after his accession duckworth , 2000 ( reprint ) but the mummy was missing its feet , so thutmose iii was undoubtedly taller than the figure given by smith

bc to 1450 & nbsp ; bc are preferred from the high chronology of egypt '' thutmose iii , '' p.401 these dates , just as all the dates of the eighteenth dynasty , are open to dispute because of uncertainty about the circumstances surrounding the recording of a sothic cycle of sirius in the reign of amenhotep i a history of ancient egypt journal of near eastern studies , vol 25 , no 2 university of chicago press , 1966 ancient records of egypt , vol thutmose 's military campaigns widely considered a military genius by historians , thutmose iii conducted at least 16 campaigns in 20 years he was an active expansionist ruler , sometimes called egypt 's greatest conqueror or '' the napoleon of egypt he was the first pharaoh after thutmose i to cross the euphrates , doing so during his campaign against mitanni his campaign records were transcribed onto the walls of the temple of amun at karnak and are now transcribed into urkunden iv a submission of mesopotamia is unthinkable ; and whether the tributes of alashia ( cyprus ) were more than occasional gifts remains questionable much is known about thutmosis '' the warrior '' not only because of his military achievements , but also because of his royal scribe and army commander , thanuny , who wrote about his conquests and reign when the hyksos invaded and took over egypt with more advanced weapons , such as horse-drawn chariots , the people of egypt learned to use these weapons thutmose iii encountered little resistance from neighbouring kingdoms , allowing him to expand his realm of influence easily these campaigns are inscribed on the inner wall of the great chamber housing the '' holy of holies '' at the karnak temple of amun thutmose iii mustered his own army and departed egypt , passing through the border fortress of tjaru ( sile ) on the 25th day of the eighth month thutmose marched his troops through the coastal plain as far as yavne , then inland to yehem , a small city near megiddo , which he reached in the middle of the ninth month of the same year the ensuing battle of megiddo probably was the largest battle of thutmose 's 17 campaigns egypt , canaan , and israel in ancient times '' despite the laudatory nature of thutmose 's annals , such a pass does indeed exist , although not as narrow as thutmose indicates , gardiner , alan when egypt ruled the east thutmose was forced to besiege the city , but he finally succeeded in conquering it after a siege of seven or eight months ( see battle of megiddo ( 15th century bc ) ) by taking megiddo , thutmose gained control of all of northern canaan and the syrian princes were obligated to send tribute and their own sons as hostages to egypt beyond the euphrates , the assyrian , kassites and hittite kings all gave thutmose gifts , which he alleged to be '' tribute '' when he recorded it on the walls of karnak 193 oxford university press , 1964 the only noticeable absence is mitanni , which would bear the brunt of the following egyptian campaigns into western asia thutmose 's second , third and fourth campaigns appear to have been nothing more than tours of syria and canaan to collect tribute . this text records tribute from the area which the egyptians called retjenu ( roughly equivalent to canaan ) and it was also at this time that assyria paid a second '' tribute '' to thutmose iii university of chicago press , chicago , 1906 thutmose 's third campaign was not considered significant enough to appear in his otherwise extensive annals at karnak ancient records of egypt , vol this survey is dated to thutmose 's 25th year . no record remains of thutmose 's fourth campaign , breasted , james henry in thutmose 's 29th year , he began his fifth campaign , where he first took an unknown city ( the name falls in a lacuna ) which had been garrisoned by tunip unlike previous plundering raids , thutmose iii garrisoned the area known as djahy , which is probably a reference to southern syria thutmose iii found that by taking family members of these key people to egypt as hostages , he could drastically increase their loyalty to him thutmose moved his troops by land up the coastal road and put down rebellions in the arka plain ( '' arkantu '' in thutmose 's chronicle ) and moved on tunip two of the smaller rooms in this temple contained the reliefs of the survey of the plants and animals of canaan which he took in his third campaign this view is supported further by the fact that no strong evidence has been found to show thutmose iii sought to claim the throne hatshepsut : from queen to pharaoh , an exhibition catalog from the metropolitan museum of art ( fully available online as pdf ) , which contains material on thutmose iii ( see index )

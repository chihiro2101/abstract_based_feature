thutmose 's two main names transliterate as mn-ḫpr-rˁ ḏḥwty-ms while modern egyptological pronunciation renders his name as djehutymes , at the time of his reign his name was probably pronounced as tahati'missaw leprohon , ronald ( 2013 ) , denise doxey , editor , the great name : ancient egyptian royal titulary , atlanta : society of biblical literature thutmose iii was the son of thutmose ii by a secondary wife , iset joyce tyldesley , hatchepsut : the female pharaoh , pp.94–95 viking , 1996 his father 's great royal wife was queen hatshepsut when thutmose ii died , thutmose iii was too young to rule hatshepsut became his regent , soon his co-regent , and shortly thereafter declared herself to be the pharaoh while never denying kingship to thutmose iii thutmosis iii had little power over the empire while hatshepsut exercised the formal titulary of kingship when thutmose iii reached a suitable age and demonstrated the capability , she appointed him to head her armies thutmose iii had several wives : satiah : she may have been the mother of his firstborn son , amenemhat thutmose iii : a new biography , the university of michigan press , 2006 , an alternative theory is that the boy was the son of neferure amenemhat predeceased his father thutmose 's successor , the crown prince and future king amenhotep ii , was the son of merytre-hatshepsut nebtu : she is depicted on a pillar in thutmose iii 's tomb neferure : thutmose iii may have married his half-sister , but there is no conclusive evidence for this marriage it has been suggested that neferure , instead of satiah , may have been the mother of amenemhat thutmose iii reigned from 1479 & nbsp ; bc to 1425 & nbsp ; bc according to the low chronology of ancient egypt this has been the conventional egyptian chronology in academic circles since the 1960s , campbell , edward fay jr the chronology of the amarna letters with special reference to the hypothetical coregency of amenophis iii and akhenaten though in some circles the older dates 1504 & nbsp ; bc to 1450 & nbsp ; bc are preferred from the high chronology of egypt '' thutmose iii , '' p.401 the oxford encyclopedia of ancient egypt these dates , just as all the dates of the eighteenth dynasty , are open to dispute because of uncertainty about the circumstances surrounding the recording of a sothic cycle of sirius in the reign of amenhotep i this document has no note of the place of observation , but it can safely be assumed that it was taken in either a delta city , such as memphis or heliopolis , or in thebes these two latitudes give dates 20 years apart , the high and low chronologies , respectively the length of thutmose iii 's reign is known to the day thanks to information found in the tomb of the military commander amenemheb-mahu journal of near eastern studies , vol 25 , no 2 university of chicago press , 1966 amenemheb-mahu records thutmose iii 's death to his master 's 54th regnal year , breasted , james henry university of chicago press , chicago , 1906 he was an active expansionist ruler , sometimes called egypt 's greatest conqueror or '' the napoleon of egypt he was the first pharaoh after thutmose i to cross the euphrates , doing so during his campaign against mitanni his campaign records were transcribed onto the walls of the temple of amun at karnak and are now transcribed into urkunden iv a submission of mesopotamia is unthinkable ; and whether the tributes of alashia ( cyprus ) were more than occasional gifts remains questionable much is known about thutmosis '' the warrior '' not only because of his military achievements , but also because of his royal scribe and army commander , thanuny , who wrote about his conquests and reign thutmose iii encountered little resistance from neighbouring kingdoms , allowing him to expand his realm of influence easily when hatshepsut died on the 10th day of the sixth month of thutmose iii 's 21st year , according to information from a single stela from armant , the king of kadesh advanced his army to megiddo through the aruna mountain pass , which he alleged was only wide enough for the army to pass '' horse after horse and man after man '' despite the laudatory nature of thutmose 's annals , such a pass does indeed exist , although not as narrow as thutmose indicates , gardiner , alan 192 oxford university press , 1964 and taking it was a brilliant strategic move since when his army emerged from the pass they were situated on the plain of esdraelon , directly between the rear of the canaanite forces and megiddo itself for some reason , the canaanite forces did not attack him as his army emerged , and his army routed them decisively this date corresponds to 9 may 1457 & nbsp ; bc based on thutmose iii 's accession in 1479 & nbsp ; bc after victory in battle , his troops stopped to plunder the enemy and the enemy was able to escape into megiddo this campaign drastically changed the political situation in the ancient near east . this text records tribute from the area which the egyptians called retjenu ( roughly equivalent to canaan ) and it was also at this time that assyria paid a second '' tribute '' to thutmose iii it is probable that these texts come from thutmose 's 40th year or later and thus have nothing to do with the second campaign at all a survey was made of the animals and plants he found in canaan , which was illustrated on the walls of a special room at karnak ancient records of egypt , vol . no record remains of thutmose 's fourth campaign , breasted , james henry he then moved inland and took the city and territory around ardata ; the town was pillaged and the wheatfields burned unlike previous plundering raids , thutmose iii garrisoned the area known as djahy , which is probably a reference to southern syria after the troops arrived in syria by whatever means , they proceeded into the jordan river valley and moved north , pillaging kadesh 's lands the cities in syria were not guided by the popular sentiment of the people so much as they were by the small number of nobles who were aligned to mitanni : a king and a small number of foreign maryannu thutmose iii found that by taking family members of these key people to egypt as hostages , he could drastically increase their loyalty to him however , to reach mitanni , he had to cross the euphrates river as usual for any egyptian king , thutmose boasted a total crushing victory , but this statement is suspect due to the very small amount of plunder taken he built a temenos wall around the central chapel containing smaller chapels , along with workshops and storerooms he commissioned royal artists to depict his extensive collections of fauna and flora in the botanical garden of thutmosis iii additionally , thutmose iii 's mortuary temple was built directly next to hatshepsut 's , an act that would have been unlikely to occur if thutmose iii bore a grudge against her the mummy of thutmose iii now resides in the royal mummies hall of the cairo museum , catalog number 61068

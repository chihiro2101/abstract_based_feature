before starting the actual reading , the reader will typically try to elicit cooperation from the subject , saying something such as , '' i often see images that are a bit unclear and which may sometimes mean more to you than to me ; if you help , we can together uncover new things about you '' one of the most crucial elements of a convincing cold reading is a subject eager to make connections or reinterpret vague statements in any way that will help the reader appear to make specific predictions or intuitions after determining that the subject is cooperative , the reader will make a number of probing statements or questions , typically using variations of the methods noted below the subject will then reveal further information with their replies ( whether verbal or non-verbal ) and the cold reader can continue from there , pursuing promising lines of inquiry and quickly abandoning or avoiding unproductive ones in general , while revelations seem to come from the reader , most of the facts and statements come from the subject , which are then refined and restated by the reader so as to reinforce the idea that the reader got something correct combining the techniques of cold reading with information obtained covertly ( also called '' hot reading '' ) can leave a strong impression that the reader knows or has access to a great deal of information about the subject because the majority of time during a reading is spent dwelling on the '' hits '' the reader obtains , while the time spent recognizing '' misses '' is minimized , the effect gives an impression that the cold reader knows far more about the subject than an ordinary stranger could james underdown from center for inquiry and independent investigations group said , '' in the context of a studio audience full of people , cold reading is not very impressive a typical studio audience consists of approximately 200 people , divided up into three sections edward describes a mental image of a clown placing flowers on graves and adds , '' does that mean anything to someone ?

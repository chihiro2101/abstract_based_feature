the optic nerve has been classified as the second of twelve paired cranial nerves but it is technically part of the central nervous system , rather than the peripheral nervous system because it is derived from an out-pouching of the diencephalon ( optic stalks ) during embryonic development as a consequence , the fibers of the optic nerve are covered with myelin produced by oligodendrocytes , rather than schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system , and are encased within the meninges however , most typically the optic nerve is grouped with the other eleven cranial nerves and is considered to be part of the peripheral nervous system the optic nerve is ensheathed in all three meninges layers ( dura , arachnoid , and pia mater ) rather than the epineurium , perineurium , and endoneurium found in peripheral nerves the fibers from the retina run along the optic nerve to nine primary visual nuclei in the brain , from which a major relay inputs into the primary visual cortex each human optic nerve contains between 770,000 and 1.7 million nerve fibers , which are axons of the retinal ganglion cells of one retina the optic nerve leaves the orbit ( eye socket ) via the optic canal , running postero-medially towards the optic chiasm , where there is a partial decussation ( crossing ) of fibers from the temporal visual fields ( the nasal hemi-retina ) of both eyes the optic nerve component lengths are 1 & nbsp ; mm in the globe , 24 & nbsp ; mm in the orbit , 9 & nbsp ; mm in the optic canal , and 16 & nbsp ; mm in the cranial space before joining the optic chiasm damage to the optic nerve typically causes permanent and potentially severe loss of vision , as well as an abnormal pupillary reflex , which is important for the diagnosis of nerve damage damage to the optic nerve that is anterior , or in front of the optic chiasm ( toward the face ) causes loss of vision in the eye on the same side as the damage optic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve optic nerve hypoplasia is the underdevelopment of the optic nerve resulting in little to no vision in the affected eye direct optic nerve injury can occur from a penetrating injury to the orbit , but the nerve can also be injured by indirect trauma in which severe head impact or movement stretches or even tears the nerve the international foundation for optic nerve diseases ( ifond ) sponsors research and provides information on a variety of optic nerve disorders

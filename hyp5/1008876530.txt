hard-paste porcelain was invented in china , and also used in japanese porcelain , and most of the finest quality porcelain wares are in this material the earliest european porcelains were produced at the meissen factory in the early 18th century ; they were formed from a paste composed of kaolin and alabaster and fired at temperatures up to in a wood-fired kiln , producing a porcelain of great hardness , translucency , and strength later , the composition of the meissen hard paste was changed and the alabaster was replaced by feldspar and quartz , allowing the pieces to be fired at lower temperatures kaolinite , feldspar and quartz ( or other forms of silica ) continue to constitute the basic ingredients for most continental european hard-paste porcelains soft-paste porcelains date back from the early attempts by european potters to replicate chinese porcelain by using mixtures of clay and frit these wares were not yet actual porcelain wares as they were not hard nor vitrified by firing kaolin clay at high temperatures as these early formulations suffered from high pyroplastic deformation , or slumping in the kiln at high temperatures , they were uneconomic to produce and of low quality soft-paste porcelains are fired at lower temperatures than hard-paste porcelain , therefore these wares are generally less hard than hard-paste porcelains although originally developed in england in 1748 to compete with imported porcelain , bone china is now made worldwide , including china kaolin is the primary material from which porcelain is made , even though clay minerals might account for only a small proportion of the whole the clays used are often described as being long or short , depending on their plasticity long clays are cohesive ( sticky ) and have high plasticity ; short clays are less cohesive and have lower plasticity it was originally typically made on the potter 's wheel , though moulds were also used from early on unlike their lower-fired counterparts , porcelain wares do not need glazing to render them impermeable to liquids and for the most part are glazed for decorative purposes and to make them resistant to dirt and staining many types of glaze , such as the iron-containing glaze used on the celadon wares of longquan , were designed specifically for their striking effects on porcelain porcelain often receives underglaze decoration using pigments that include cobalt oxide and copper , or overglaze enamels , allowing a wider range of colours porcelain is fired at a higher temperature than earthenware so that the body can vitrify and become non-porous many types of porcelain in the past have been fired twice or even three times , to allow decoration using less robust pigments in overglaze enamel porcelain was invented in china over a centuries-long development period beginning with '' proto-porcelain '' wares dating from the shang dynasty ( 1600–1046 bc ) by the time of the eastern han dynasty ( ad 25–220 ) these early glazed ceramic wares had developed into porcelain , which chinese defined as high-fired ware by the time of the ming dynasty ( 1368–1644 ad ) , porcelain wares were being exported to asia and europe the ming dynasty controlled much of the porcelain trade , which was expanded to asia , africa and europe via the silk road some porcelains were more highly valued than others in imperial china the most valued types can be identified by their association with the court , either as tribute offerings , or as products of kilns under imperial supervision rawson , jessica '' chinese art '' , 2007 , publisher : the british museum press , london , since the yuan dynasty , the largest and best centre of production has made jingdezhen porcelain during the ming dynasty , jingdezhen porcelain become a source of imperial pride the yongle emperor erected a white porcelain brick-faced pagoda at nanjing , and an exceptionally smoothly glazed type of white porcelain is peculiar to his reign jingdezhen porcelain 's fame came to a peak during the qing dynasty they brought an improved type of kiln , and one of them spotted a source of porcelain clay near arita , and before long several kilns had started in the region at first the wares used european shapes and mostly chinese decoration , as the chinese had done , but gradually original japanese styles developed imari ware and kakiemon are broad terms for styles of export porcelain with overglaze '' enamelled '' decoration begun in the early period , both with many sub-types much traditional porcelain continues to replicate older methods of production and styles , and there are several modern industrial manufacturers early in the 16th century , portuguese traders returned home with samples of kaolin , which they discovered in china to be essential in the production of porcelain wares countless experiments to produce porcelain had unpredictable results and met with failure tschirnhaus had a wide knowledge of science and had been involved in the european quest to perfect porcelain manufacture when , in 1705 , böttger was appointed to assist him in this task in 1749 , thomas frye took out a patent on a porcelain containing bone ash this was the first bone china , subsequently perfected by josiah spode eventually other factories opened : gardner porcelain , dulyovo ( 1832 ) , kuznetsovsky porcelain , popovsky porcelain , and gzhel a more detailed description of the history , manufacture and properties of porcelain tiles is given in the article “ porcelain tile : the revolution is only beginning

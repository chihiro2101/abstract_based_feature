hard-paste porcelain was invented in china , and also used in japanese porcelain , and most of the finest quality porcelain wares are in this material the earliest european porcelains were produced at the meissen factory in the early 18th century ; they were formed from a paste composed of kaolin and alabaster and fired at temperatures up to in a wood-fired kiln , producing a porcelain of great hardness , translucency , and strength later , the composition of the meissen hard paste was changed and the alabaster was replaced by feldspar and quartz , allowing the pieces to be fired at lower temperatures kaolinite , feldspar and quartz ( or other forms of silica ) continue to constitute the basic ingredients for most continental european hard-paste porcelains soft-paste porcelains date back from the early attempts by european potters to replicate chinese porcelain by using mixtures of clay and frit these wares were not yet actual porcelain wares as they were not hard nor vitrified by firing kaolin clay at high temperatures as these early formulations suffered from high pyroplastic deformation , or slumping in the kiln at high temperatures , they were uneconomic to produce and of low quality formulations were later developed based on kaolin with quartz , feldspars , nepheline syenite or other feldspathic rocks soft-paste porcelains are fired at lower temperatures than hard-paste porcelain , therefore these wares are generally less hard than hard-paste porcelains although originally developed in england in 1748 to compete with imported porcelain , bone china is now made worldwide , including china the english had read the letters of jesuit missionary françois xavier d'entrecolles , which described chinese porcelain manufacturing secrets in detail vol.1 brighton , 20–24 june 1999 , pg.11-17 the special appeal of bone china 10 , ( 9 ) , 34 , 1980 spode 's bone china – progress in processing without compromise in quality 115 , ( 6 ) , 32 , 1980 an introduction to the technology of pottery kaolin is the primary material from which porcelain is made , even though clay minerals might account for only a small proportion of the whole a more common terminology for the unfired material is '' body '' ; for example , when buying materials a potter might order an amount of porcelain body from a vendor the composition of porcelain is highly variable , but the clay mineral kaolinite is often a raw material other raw materials can include feldspar , ball clay , glass , bone ash , steatite , quartz , petuntse and alabaster clays used for porcelain are generally of lower plasticity and are shorter than many other pottery clays it was originally typically made on the potter 's wheel , though moulds were also used from early on biscuit porcelain is unglazed porcelain treated as a finished product , mostly for figures and sculpture unlike their lower-fired counterparts , porcelain wares do not need glazing to render them impermeable to liquids and for the most part are glazed for decorative purposes and to make them resistant to dirt and staining many types of glaze , such as the iron-containing glaze used on the celadon wares of longquan , were designed specifically for their striking effects on porcelain porcelain often receives underglaze decoration using pigments that include cobalt oxide and copper , or overglaze enamels , allowing a wider range of colours in this process , '' green '' ( unfired ) ceramic wares are heated to high temperatures in a kiln to permanently set their shapes , vitrify the body and the glaze porcelain is fired at a higher temperature than earthenware so that the body can vitrify and become non-porous porcelain was invented in china over a centuries-long development period beginning with '' proto-porcelain '' wares dating from the shang dynasty ( 1600–1046 bc ) by the late sui dynasty ( 581–618 ad ) and early tang dynasty ( 618–907 ad ) , the now-standard requirements of whiteness and translucency had been achieved , vainker , 66 in types such as ding ware by the ming dynasty , production of the finest wares for the court was concentrated in a single city , and jingdezhen porcelain , originally owned by the imperial government , remains the centre of chinese porcelain production by the time of the ming dynasty ( 1368–1644 ad ) , porcelain wares were being exported to asia and europe although the japanese elite were keen importers of chinese porcelain from early on , they were not able to make their own until the arrival of korean potters that were taken captive during the japanese invasions of korea ( 1592–1598 ) at first the wares used european shapes and mostly chinese decoration , as the chinese had done , but gradually original japanese styles developed imari ware and kakiemon are broad terms for styles of export porcelain with overglaze '' enamelled '' decoration begun in the early period , both with many sub-types early in the 16th century , portuguese traders returned home with samples of kaolin , which they discovered in china to be essential in the production of porcelain wares metropolitan museum of art ; italy doccia porcelain of florence was founded in 1735 and remains in production , unlike capodimonte porcelain which was moved from naples to madrid by its royal owner , after producing from 1743 to 1759 peter the great had tried to reveal the '' big porcelain secret '' , and sent an agent to the meissen factory , and finally hired a porcelain master from abroad porcelain is an excellent insulator for use with high voltages , especially in outdoor applications ( see insulator ( electricity ) material ) a more detailed description of the history , manufacture and properties of porcelain tiles is given in the article “ porcelain tile : the revolution is only beginning however bath tubs are not made of porcelain , but of porcelain enamel on a metal base , usually of cast iron

hard-paste porcelain was invented in china , and also used in japanese porcelain , and most of the finest quality porcelain wares are in this material the earliest european porcelains were produced at the meissen factory in the early 18th century ; they were formed from a paste composed of kaolin and alabaster and fired at temperatures up to in a wood-fired kiln , producing a porcelain of great hardness , translucency , and strength later , the composition of the meissen hard paste was changed and the alabaster was replaced by feldspar and quartz , allowing the pieces to be fired at lower temperatures soft-paste porcelains date back from the early attempts by european potters to replicate chinese porcelain by using mixtures of clay and frit these wares were not yet actual porcelain wares as they were not hard nor vitrified by firing kaolin clay at high temperatures as these early formulations suffered from high pyroplastic deformation , or slumping in the kiln at high temperatures , they were uneconomic to produce and of low quality soft-paste porcelains are fired at lower temperatures than hard-paste porcelain , therefore these wares are generally less hard than hard-paste porcelains although originally developed in england in 1748 to compete with imported porcelain , bone china is now made worldwide , including china the english had read the letters of jesuit missionary françois xavier d'entrecolles , which described chinese porcelain manufacturing secrets in detail one writer has speculated that a misunderstanding of the text could possibly have been responsible for the first attempts to use bone-ash as an ingredient of english porcelain , although this is not supported by researchers and historians vol.1 brighton , 20–24 june 1999 , pg.11-17 the special appeal of bone china 10 , ( 9 ) , 34 , 1980 spode 's bone china – progress in processing without compromise in quality 115 , ( 6 ) , 32 , 1980 an introduction to the technology of pottery kaolin is the primary material from which porcelain is made , even though clay minerals might account for only a small proportion of the whole other raw materials can include feldspar , ball clay , glass , bone ash , steatite , quartz , petuntse and alabaster clays used for porcelain are generally of lower plasticity and are shorter than many other pottery clays thus , the range of water content within which these clays can be worked is very narrow and consequently must be carefully controlled biscuit porcelain is unglazed porcelain treated as a finished product , mostly for figures and sculpture unlike their lower-fired counterparts , porcelain wares do not need glazing to render them impermeable to liquids and for the most part are glazed for decorative purposes and to make them resistant to dirt and staining many types of glaze , such as the iron-containing glaze used on the celadon wares of longquan , were designed specifically for their striking effects on porcelain porcelain often receives underglaze decoration using pigments that include cobalt oxide and copper , or overglaze enamels , allowing a wider range of colours like many earlier wares , modern porcelains are often biscuit-fired at around , coated with glaze and then sent for a second glaze-firing at a temperature of about or greater many types of porcelain in the past have been fired twice or even three times , to allow decoration using less robust pigments in overglaze enamel by the time of the eastern han dynasty ( ad 25–220 ) these early glazed ceramic wares had developed into porcelain , which chinese defined as high-fired ware eventually , porcelain and the expertise required to create it began to spread into other areas of east asia the genius of china : 3,000 years of science , discovery , and invention ( 3rd edition ) by the time of the ming dynasty ( 1368–1644 ad ) , porcelain wares were being exported to asia and europe the yongle emperor erected a white porcelain brick-faced pagoda at nanjing , and an exceptionally smoothly glazed type of white porcelain is peculiar to his reign smith , harris , & clark , 163-164 ;

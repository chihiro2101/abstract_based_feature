hard-paste porcelain was invented in china , and also used in japanese porcelain , and most of the finest quality porcelain wares are in this material the earliest european porcelains were produced at the meissen factory in the early 18th century ; they were formed from a paste composed of kaolin and alabaster and fired at temperatures up to in a wood-fired kiln , producing a porcelain of great hardness , translucency , and strength soft-paste porcelains date back from the early attempts by european potters to replicate chinese porcelain by using mixtures of clay and frit these wares were not yet actual porcelain wares as they were not hard nor vitrified by firing kaolin clay at high temperatures as these early formulations suffered from high pyroplastic deformation , or slumping in the kiln at high temperatures , they were uneconomic to produce and of low quality soft-paste porcelains are fired at lower temperatures than hard-paste porcelain , therefore these wares are generally less hard than hard-paste porcelains although originally developed in england in 1748 to compete with imported porcelain , bone china is now made worldwide , including china the english had read the letters of jesuit missionary françois xavier d'entrecolles , which described chinese porcelain manufacturing secrets in detail science of early english porcelain 10 , ( 9 ) , 34 , 1980 spode 's bone china – progress in processing without compromise in quality kaolin is the primary material from which porcelain is made , even though clay minerals might account for only a small proportion of the whole the word paste is an old term for both the unfired and fired materials a more common terminology for the unfired material is '' body '' ; for example , when buying materials a potter might order an amount of porcelain body from a vendor the composition of porcelain is highly variable , but the clay mineral kaolinite is often a raw material long clays are cohesive ( sticky ) and have high plasticity ; short clays are less cohesive and have lower plasticity clays used for porcelain are generally of lower plasticity and are shorter than many other pottery clays thus , the range of water content within which these clays can be worked is very narrow and consequently must be carefully controlled porcelain can be made using all the shaping techniques for pottery it was originally typically made on the potter 's wheel , though moulds were also used from early on slipcasting has been the most common commercial method in recent times biscuit porcelain is unglazed porcelain treated as a finished product , mostly for figures and sculpture unlike their lower-fired counterparts , porcelain wares do not need glazing to render them impermeable to liquids and for the most part are glazed for decorative purposes and to make them resistant to dirt and staining many types of glaze , such as the iron-containing glaze used on the celadon wares of longquan , were designed specifically for their striking effects on porcelain another early method is '' once-fired '' , where the glaze is applied to the unfired body and the two fired together in a single operation in this process , '' green '' ( unfired ) ceramic wares are heated to high temperatures in a kiln to permanently set their shapes , vitrify the body and the glaze porcelain is fired at a higher temperature than earthenware so that the body can vitrify and become non-porous by the time of the eastern han dynasty ( ad 25–220 ) these early glazed ceramic wares had developed into porcelain , which chinese defined as high-fired ware by the ming dynasty , production of the finest wares for the court was concentrated in a single city , and jingdezhen porcelain , originally owned by the imperial government , remains the centre of chinese porcelain production some of the most well-known chinese porcelain art styles arrived in europe during this era , such as the coveted '' blue-and-white '' wares the ming dynasty controlled much of the porcelain trade , which was expanded to asia , africa and europe via the silk road during the ming dynasty , jingdezhen porcelain become a source of imperial pride although the japanese elite were keen importers of chinese porcelain from early on , they were not able to make their own until the arrival of korean potters that were taken captive during the japanese invasions of korea ( 1592–1598 ) they brought an improved type of kiln , and one of them spotted a source of porcelain clay near arita , and before long several kilns had started in the region imari ware and kakiemon are broad terms for styles of export porcelain with overglaze '' enamelled '' decoration begun in the early period , both with many sub-types a workshop note records that the first specimen of hard , white and vitrified european porcelain was produced in 1708 most english porcelain from the late 18th century to the present is bone china peter the great had tried to reveal the '' big porcelain secret '' , and sent an agent to the meissen factory , and finally hired a porcelain master from abroad “ new american standard defines polished porcelain by the porcelain tile certification agency porcelain enamel is a marketing term used in the us , and is not porcelain but vitreous enamel

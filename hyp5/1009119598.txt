maslow 's hierarchy of needs is often portrayed in the shape of a pyramid with the largest , most fundamental needs at the bottom and the need for self-actualization and transcendence at the top in other words , the idea is that individuals ' most basic needs must be met before they become motivated to achieve higher-level needs however , it has been pointed out that , although the ideas behind the hierarchy are maslow 's , the pyramid itself does not exist anywhere in maslow 's original work the most fundamental four layers of the pyramid contain what maslow called '' deficiency needs '' or '' d-needs '' : esteem , friendship and love , security , and physical needs if these '' deficiency needs '' are not met – except for the most fundamental ( physiological ) need – there may not be a physical indication , but the individual will feel anxious and tense maslow 's idea suggests that the most basic level of needs must be met before the individual will strongly desire ( or focus motivation upon ) the secondary or higher-level needs the human brain is a complex system and has parallel processes running at the same time , thus many different motivations from various levels of maslow 's hierarchy can occur at the same time maslow spoke clearly about these levels and their satisfaction in terms such as '' relative '' , '' general '' , and '' primarily '' thus maslow acknowledged the likelihood that the different levels of motivation could occur at any time in the human mind , but he focused on identifying the basic types of motivation and the order in which they would tend to be met this means that physiological needs are universal human needs physiological needs , being primal , are by default , a governor on the attainment of the '' higher '' needs efforts to accomplish higher needs may be interrupted temporarily by a deficit of primal needs , such as a lack of food or air physiological needs are considered in internal motivation according to maslow 's hierarchy of needs if these needs are not achieved , it leads to an increase in displeasure within an individual to pursue intrinsic motivation higher up maslow 's hierarchy , physiological needs must be met first after physiological and safety needs are fulfilled , the third level of human needs is interpersonal and involves feelings of love and belongingness in contrast , for some individuals , the need for self-esteem is more important than the need for love ; and for others , the need for creative fulfillment may supersede even the most basic needs maslow noted two versions of esteem needs although recent research appears to validate the existence of universal human needs , the hierarchy proposed by maslow is called into question for example , sex is placed with other physiological needs which must be satisfied before a person considers '' higher '' levels of motivation with regards to satisfaction of needs during the war , in the us there were three levels : physiological needs , safety needs , and psychological needs ( social , self-esteem , and self-actualization )

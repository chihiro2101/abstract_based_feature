maslow 's hierarchy of needs is often portrayed in the shape of a pyramid with the largest , most fundamental needs at the bottom and the need for self-actualization and transcendence at the top in other words , the idea is that individuals ' most basic needs must be met before they become motivated to achieve higher-level needs however , it has been pointed out that , although the ideas behind the hierarchy are maslow 's , the pyramid itself does not exist anywhere in maslow 's original work the most fundamental four layers of the pyramid contain what maslow called '' deficiency needs '' or '' d-needs '' : esteem , friendship and love , security , and physical needs if these '' deficiency needs '' are not met – except for the most fundamental ( physiological ) need – there may not be a physical indication , but the individual will feel anxious and tense maslow 's idea suggests that the most basic level of needs must be met before the individual will strongly desire ( or focus motivation upon ) the secondary or higher-level needs maslow also coined the term '' metamotivation '' to describe the motivation of people who go beyond the scope of the basic needs and strive for constant betterment the human brain is a complex system and has parallel processes running at the same time , thus many different motivations from various levels of maslow 's hierarchy can occur at the same time instead of stating that the individual focuses on a certain need at any given time , maslow stated that a certain need '' dominates '' the human organism this means that physiological needs are universal human needs physiological needs , being primal , are by default , a governor on the attainment of the '' higher '' needs physiological needs are considered in internal motivation according to maslow 's hierarchy of needs maslow 's idea is that humans are compelled to fulfill these physiological needs first to pursue intrinsic satisfaction on a higher level physiological needs as traits allude to long-term , unchanging demands that are required of basic human life to pursue intrinsic motivation higher up maslow 's hierarchy , physiological needs must be met first if a person does not feel safe in an environment , they will seek safety before attempting to meet any higher level of survival after physiological and safety needs are fulfilled , the third level of human needs is interpersonal and involves feelings of love and belongingness according to maslow , humans possess an effective need for a sense of belonging and acceptance among social groups , regardless of whether gemeinschaft and gesellschaft although recent research appears to validate the existence of universal human needs , the hierarchy proposed by maslow is called into question for example , sex is placed with other physiological needs which must be satisfied before a person considers '' higher '' levels of motivation with regards to satisfaction of needs during the war , in the us there were three levels : physiological needs , safety needs , and psychological needs ( social , self-esteem , and self-actualization )

maslow 's hierarchy of needs is often portrayed in the shape of a pyramid with the largest , most fundamental needs at the bottom and the need for self-actualization and transcendence at the top in other words , the idea is that individuals ' most basic needs must be met before they become motivated to achieve higher-level needs however , it has been pointed out that , although the ideas behind the hierarchy are maslow 's , the pyramid itself does not exist anywhere in maslow 's original work maslow 's idea suggests that the most basic level of needs must be met before the individual will strongly desire ( or focus motivation upon ) the secondary or higher-level needs maslow also coined the term '' metamotivation '' to describe the motivation of people who go beyond the scope of the basic needs and strive for constant betterment the third force : the psychology of abraham maslow the human brain is a complex system and has parallel processes running at the same time , thus many different motivations from various levels of maslow 's hierarchy can occur at the same time maslow spoke clearly about these levels and their satisfaction in terms such as '' relative '' , '' general '' , and '' primarily '' instead of stating that the individual focuses on a certain need at any given time , maslow stated that a certain need '' dominates '' the human organism thus maslow acknowledged the likelihood that the different levels of motivation could occur at any time in the human mind , but he focused on identifying the basic types of motivation and the order in which they would tend to be met this means that physiological needs are universal human needs physiological needs are considered in internal motivation according to maslow 's hierarchy of needs maslow 's idea is that humans are compelled to fulfill these physiological needs first to pursue intrinsic satisfaction on a higher level to pursue intrinsic motivation higher up maslow 's hierarchy , physiological needs must be met first according to maslow , humans possess an effective need for a sense of belonging and acceptance among social groups , regardless of whether gemeinschaft and gesellschaft maslow noted two versions of esteem needs this means that esteem and the subsequent levels are not strictly separated ; instead , the levels are closely related although recent research appears to validate the existence of universal human needs , the hierarchy proposed by maslow is called into question in their extensive review of research based on maslow 's hierarchy , wahba and bridwell found little evidence for the ranking of needs that maslow described or for the existence of a definite hierarchy at all maslow 's hierarchy places sex in the needs category along with food and breathing ; it lists sex solely from an individualistic perspective for example , sex is placed with other physiological needs which must be satisfied before a person considers '' higher '' levels of motivation

maslow 's hierarchy of needs is often portrayed in the shape of a pyramid with the largest , most fundamental needs at the bottom and the need for self-actualization and transcendence at the top in other words , the idea is that individuals ' most basic needs must be met before they become motivated to achieve higher-level needs however , it has been pointed out that , although the ideas behind the hierarchy are maslow 's , the pyramid itself does not exist anywhere in maslow 's original work the most fundamental four layers of the pyramid contain what maslow called '' deficiency needs '' or '' d-needs '' : esteem , friendship and love , security , and physical needs if these '' deficiency needs '' are not met – except for the most fundamental ( physiological ) need – there may not be a physical indication , but the individual will feel anxious and tense maslow 's idea suggests that the most basic level of needs must be met before the individual will strongly desire ( or focus motivation upon ) the secondary or higher-level needs instead of stating that the individual focuses on a certain need at any given time , maslow stated that a certain need '' dominates '' the human organism thus maslow acknowledged the likelihood that the different levels of motivation could occur at any time in the human mind , but he focused on identifying the basic types of motivation and the order in which they would tend to be met physiological needs , being primal , are by default , a governor on the attainment of the '' higher '' needs physiological needs are considered in internal motivation according to maslow 's hierarchy of needs maslow 's idea is that humans are compelled to fulfill these physiological needs first to pursue intrinsic satisfaction on a higher level if these needs are not achieved , it leads to an increase in displeasure within an individual physiological needs as a state allude to the unpleasant decrease in pleasure and the increase for an incentive to fulfill a necessity to pursue intrinsic motivation higher up maslow 's hierarchy , physiological needs must be met first this means that if a human is struggling to meet their physiological needs , then they are unlikely to intrinsically pursue safety , belongingness , esteem , and self-actualization once a person 's physiological needs are relatively satisfied , their safety needs take precedence and dominate behavior after physiological and safety needs are fulfilled , the third level of human needs is interpersonal and involves feelings of love and belongingness in their extensive review of research based on maslow 's hierarchy , wahba and bridwell found little evidence for the ranking of needs that maslow described or for the existence of a definite hierarchy at all for example , sex is placed with other physiological needs which must be satisfied before a person considers '' higher '' levels of motivation with regards to satisfaction of needs during the war , in the us there were three levels : physiological needs , safety needs , and psychological needs ( social , self-esteem , and self-actualization ) during the war , the satisfaction of physiological needs and safety needs were separated into two independent needs while during peacetime , they were combined as one

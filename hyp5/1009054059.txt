this group of disorders affects connective tissues across the body , with symptoms most typically present in the joints , skin , and blood vessels however , as connective tissue is found throughout the body , eds may result in an array of unexpected impacts with any degree of severity , and the condition is not limited to joints , skin , and blood vessels effects may range from mildly loose joints to life-threatening cardiovascular complications due to the diversity of subtypes within the eds family , symptoms may vary widely between individuals diagnosed with eds there can be an early onset of advanced osteoarthritis , chronic degenerative joint disease , swan neck deformity of the fingers , and boutonniere deformity of the fingers deformities of the spine , such as scoliosis ( curvature of the spine ) , kyphosis ( a thoracic hump ) , tethered spinal cord syndrome , craniocervical instability , and occipitoatlantoaxial hypermobility may also be present there can also be myalgia ( muscle pain ) and arthralgia ( joint pain ) , which may be severe and disabling osgoodâ€“schlatter disease , a painful lump on the knee , is common as well other skin symptoms include molluscoid pseudotumors , especially on pressure points , petechiae , subcutaneous spheroids , livedo reticularis , and piezogenic papules are less common file : atrophic scar of ehlers danlos syndrome.jpg atrophic scar in a case of eds file : pmc3567970 1752-1947-7-35-1 ( cropped ) png translucent skin in vascular eds file : ehlers-danlos syndrome4.jpg individual with eds displaying skin hyperelasticity file : piezogenic papules.jpg piezogenic papules on the heel of an individual with hypermobile eds thoracic outlet syndrome arterial rupture valvular heart disease , such as mitral valve prolapse , creates an increased risk for infective endocarditis during surgery also , it can be misdiagnosed as eds due to common symptoms , including fatigue , pain , gastrointestinal complaints , or cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction osteoporosis and osteopenia are associated with eds and symptomatic joint hypermobility psychiatric disorders almost half of eds patients have psychiatric disorders citation needed file : pmc2856381 ijd-55-86-g002.png gorlin 's sign in a case of eds file : a case of keratoglobus in a case of brittle cornea syndrome.png a case of keratoglobus in a case of brittle-cornea syndrome because it is often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed in childhood , some instances of eds have been mischaracterized as child abuse the pain may also be misdiagnosed as a behavior disorder or munchausen biproxy every type of eds , except the hypermobile type ( which affects the vast majority of people with eds ) , can be positively tied to specific genetic variation most forms of eds are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern , which means only one of the two copies of the gene in question must be altered to cause a disorder children should be taught that demonstrating the unusual positions that they can maintain due to loose joints should not be done , as this may cause early degeneration of the joints it can worsen symptoms of mast cell activation syndrome , a disease that may be associated with eds opioids have shown efficiency in some eds cases for management of both acute and chronic pain if the pain is neuropathic in origin , tricyclic antidepressants in low doses , anticonvulsants , and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors can be used some people with eds also show a resistance to local anaesthetics the outcome for individuals with eds depends on the specific type of eds they have eds may be far more common than the currently accepted estimate due to the wide range of severities with which the disorder presents for example , fewer than 10 infants and children with dermatosparaxis eds have been described worldwide

this group of disorders affects connective tissues across the body , with symptoms most typically present in the joints , skin , and blood vessels however , as connective tissue is found throughout the body , eds may result in an array of unexpected impacts with any degree of severity , and the condition is not limited to joints , skin , and blood vessels effects may range from mildly loose joints to life-threatening cardiovascular complications due to the diversity of subtypes within the eds family , symptoms may vary widely between individuals diagnosed with eds musculoskeletal symptoms include hyperflexible joints that are unstable and prone to sprain , dislocation , subluxation , and hyperextension there can be an early onset of advanced osteoarthritis , chronic degenerative joint disease , swan neck deformity of the fingers , and boutonniere deformity of the fingers deformities of the spine , such as scoliosis ( curvature of the spine ) , kyphosis ( a thoracic hump ) , tethered spinal cord syndrome , craniocervical instability , and occipitoatlantoaxial hypermobility may also be present there can also be myalgia ( muscle pain ) and arthralgia ( joint pain ) , which may be severe and disabling trendelenburg 's sign is often seen , which means that when standing on one leg , the pelvis drops on the other side in infants , walking can be delayed ( beyond 18 months of age ) , and bottom-shuffling instead of crawling occurs in vascular eds , skin can also be thin and translucent file : atrophic scar of ehlers danlos syndrome.jpg atrophic scar in a case of eds file : pmc3567970 1752-1947-7-35-1 ( cropped ) png translucent skin in vascular eds file : ehlers-danlos syndrome4.jpg individual with eds displaying skin hyperelasticity file : piezogenic papules.jpg piezogenic papules on the heel of an individual with hypermobile eds celiac disease may be associated with eds also , it can be misdiagnosed as eds due to common symptoms , including fatigue , pain , gastrointestinal complaints , or cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction every type of eds , except the hypermobile type ( which affects the vast majority of people with eds ) , can be positively tied to specific genetic variation a defect in collagen can weaken connective tissue in the skin , bones , blood vessels , and organs , resulting in the features of the disorder most forms of eds are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern , which means only one of the two copies of the gene in question must be altered to cause a disorder a few are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern , which means both copies of the gene must be altered for a person to be affected by a disorder before pregnancy , people with eds should have genetic counseling and familiarize themselves with the risks to their own bodies that pregnancy poses children should be taught that demonstrating the unusual positions that they can maintain due to loose joints should not be done , as this may cause early degeneration of the joints successfully treating chronic pain in eds needs a multidisciplinary team the current state of pain management with eds is considered insufficient it can worsen symptoms of mast cell activation syndrome , a disease that may be associated with eds severe mobility-related disability is seen more often in heds than in classical eds or vascular eds for example , the chance of being a carrier for dermatosparaxis eds is one in 248 in ashkenazi jews , whereas the prevalence of this variation in the general population is one in 2,000

this group of disorders affects connective tissues across the body , with symptoms most typically present in the joints , skin , and blood vessels however , as connective tissue is found throughout the body , eds may result in an array of unexpected impacts with any degree of severity , and the condition is not limited to joints , skin , and blood vessels effects may range from mildly loose joints to life-threatening cardiovascular complications due to the diversity of subtypes within the eds family , symptoms may vary widely between individuals diagnosed with eds musculoskeletal symptoms include hyperflexible joints that are unstable and prone to sprain , dislocation , subluxation , and hyperextension there can be an early onset of advanced osteoarthritis , chronic degenerative joint disease , swan neck deformity of the fingers , and boutonniere deformity of the fingers there can also be myalgia ( muscle pain ) and arthralgia ( joint pain ) , which may be severe and disabling the weak connective tissue causes abnormal skin in vascular eds , skin can also be thin and translucent file : atrophic scar of ehlers danlos syndrome.jpg atrophic scar in a case of eds file : pmc3567970 1752-1947-7-35-1 ( cropped ) png translucent skin in vascular eds file : ehlers-danlos syndrome4.jpg individual with eds displaying skin hyperelasticity file : piezogenic papules.jpg piezogenic papules on the heel of an individual with hypermobile eds also , it can be misdiagnosed as eds due to common symptoms , including fatigue , pain , gastrointestinal complaints , or cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction osteoporosis and osteopenia are associated with eds and symptomatic joint hypermobility psychiatric disorders almost half of eds patients have psychiatric disorders citation needed the pain associated with eds ranges from mild to debilitating most forms of eds are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern , which means only one of the two copies of the gene in question must be altered to cause a disorder before pregnancy , people with eds should have genetic counseling and familiarize themselves with the risks to their own bodies that pregnancy poses children with eds should be provided with information about their disorder so they can understand why they should avoid contact sports and other physically stressful activities children should be taught that demonstrating the unusual positions that they can maintain due to loose joints should not be done , as this may cause early degeneration of the joints support groups can be immensely helpful for people dealing with major lifestyle changes and poor health usable methods may include posture re-education , muscle release , joint mobilization , trunk stabilization , and manual therapy for overworked muscles cognitive behavioural therapy is used in all chronic pain patients , especially those who have severe , chronic , life-controlling pain that is unresponsive to treatment surgery in people with eds requires careful tissue handling and a longer immobilization afterward severe spinal deformities may affect breathing in the case of extreme joint instability , dislocations may result from simple tasks such as rolling over in bed or turning a doorknob the median life expectancy in the population with vascular eds is 48 years eds may be far more common than the currently accepted estimate due to the wide range of severities with which the disorder presents

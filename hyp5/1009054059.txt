this group of disorders affects connective tissues across the body , with symptoms most typically present in the joints , skin , and blood vessels however , as connective tissue is found throughout the body , eds may result in an array of unexpected impacts with any degree of severity , and the condition is not limited to joints , skin , and blood vessels effects may range from mildly loose joints to life-threatening cardiovascular complications due to the diversity of subtypes within the eds family , symptoms may vary widely between individuals diagnosed with eds musculoskeletal symptoms include hyperflexible joints that are unstable and prone to sprain , dislocation , subluxation , and hyperextension there can be an early onset of advanced osteoarthritis , chronic degenerative joint disease , swan neck deformity of the fingers , and boutonniere deformity of the fingers deformities of the spine , such as scoliosis ( curvature of the spine ) , kyphosis ( a thoracic hump ) , tethered spinal cord syndrome , craniocervical instability , and occipitoatlantoaxial hypermobility may also be present there can also be myalgia ( muscle pain ) and arthralgia ( joint pain ) , which may be severe and disabling trendelenburg 's sign is often seen , which means that when standing on one leg , the pelvis drops on the other side this may present as stretchy or in other types simply be velvet soft in dermatosparaxis eds , the skin is extremely fragile and saggy file : atrophic scar of ehlers danlos syndrome.jpg atrophic scar in a case of eds file : pmc3567970 1752-1947-7-35-1 ( cropped ) png translucent skin in vascular eds file : ehlers-danlos syndrome4.jpg individual with eds displaying skin hyperelasticity file : piezogenic papules.jpg piezogenic papules on the heel of an individual with hypermobile eds also , it can be misdiagnosed as eds due to common symptoms , including fatigue , pain , gastrointestinal complaints , or cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction osteoporosis and osteopenia are associated with eds and symptomatic joint hypermobility psychiatric disorders almost half of eds patients have psychiatric disorders citation needed adhd is common in hypermobility spectrum disorder but not in eds patients every type of eds , except the hypermobile type ( which affects the vast majority of people with eds ) , can be positively tied to specific genetic variation collagen provides structure and strength to connective tissue most forms of eds are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern , which means only one of the two copies of the gene in question must be altered to cause a disorder children with eds should be provided with information about their disorder so they can understand why they should avoid contact sports and other physically stressful activities support groups can be immensely helpful for people dealing with major lifestyle changes and poor health family members , teachers , and friends should be informed about eds so they can accept and assist the child the instability of joints , leading to subluxations and joint pain , often requires surgical intervention in people with eds if considering surgical intervention , seeking care from a surgeon with extensive knowledge and experience in treating people with eds and joint hypermobility issues would be prudent the outcome for individuals with eds depends on the specific type of eds they have for example , fewer than 10 infants and children with dermatosparaxis eds have been described worldwide

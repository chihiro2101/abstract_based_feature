mount erebus is currently the most active volcano in antarctica and is the current eruptive zone of the erebus hotspot the summit contains a persistent convecting phonolite lava lake , one of five long-lasting lava lakes on earth characteristic eruptive activity consists of strombolian eruptions from the lava lake or from one of several subsidiary vents , all within the volcano 's inner crater scientific study of the volcano is also facilitated by its proximity to mcmurdo station ( u.s ) and scott base ( new zealand ) , both sited on ross island around 35 km away mount erebus is classified as a polygenetic stratovolcano the composition of the current eruptive products of erebus are anorthoclase-porphyritic tephritic phonolite and phonolite , which are the bulk of exposed lava flow on the volcano slightly younger basanite and phonotephrite lavas crop out on fang ridge—an eroded remnant of an early erebus volcano—and at other isolated locations on the flanks of erebus lava flows of more viscous phonotephrite and trachyte erupted after the basanite the upper slopes of mount erebus are dominated by steeply dipping ( about 30° ) tephritic phonolite lava flows with large-scale flow levees the active lava lake in this summit cone undergoes continuous degassing the organisms survive using co 2 fixation and some may use co oxidization for the metabolism there are many rock formations on mount erebus also on the northwest slope sits tarr nunatak , named by the new zealand geographic board ( nzgb ) in 2000 after sgt the flight crashed into mount erebus on november 28 , 1979 , killing all 257 people on board during the antarctic summer , snow melt on the flanks of mount erebus continually reveals debris from the crash that is visible from the air a picture from space of the lava lake at the summit of mount erebus erebus glacier tongue a panoramic view from the summit of mount erebus footage of mount erebus erupting in 2005

mount erebus is currently the most active volcano in antarctica and is the current eruptive zone of the erebus hotspot the summit contains a persistent convecting phonolite lava lake , one of five long-lasting lava lakes on earth characteristic eruptive activity consists of strombolian eruptions from the lava lake or from one of several subsidiary vents , all within the volcano 's inner crater ) and scott base ( new zealand ) , both sited on ross island around 35 km away the composition of the current eruptive products of erebus are anorthoclase-porphyritic tephritic phonolite and phonolite , which are the bulk of exposed lava flow on the volcano slightly younger basanite and phonotephrite lavas crop out on fang ridge—an eroded remnant of an early erebus volcano—and at other isolated locations on the flanks of erebus the upper slopes of mount erebus are dominated by steeply dipping ( about 30° ) tephritic phonolite lava flows with large-scale flow levees in the center of the summit caldera is a small , steep-sided cone composed primarily of decomposed lava bombs and a large deposit of anorthoclase crystals known as erebus crystals the active lava lake in this summit cone undergoes continuous degassing these results demonstrated a complex upper-volcano conduit system with appreciable upper-volcano magma storage to the northwest of the lava lake at depths hundreds of meters below the surface erebus is notable for its numerous ice fumaroles – ice towers that form around gases that escape from vents in the surface mount erebus is large enough to have several named features on its slopes , including a number of craters and rock formations there are many rock formations on mount erebus the cashman crags are two rock summits at about high on the west slope of mount erebus , southwest of hoopers shoulder mount erebus was discovered on january 27 , 1841 ( and observed to be in eruption ) , ross , voyage to the southern seas , vol file : ross island map usgs 250k.png topographic map of ross island ( 1:250,000 scale ) mount erebus is in the lower left a picture from space of the lava lake at the summit of mount erebus erebus glacier tongue a panoramic view from the summit of mount erebus footage of mount erebus erupting in 2005

mount erebus is currently the most active volcano in antarctica and is the current eruptive zone of the erebus hotspot the summit contains a persistent convecting phonolite lava lake , one of five long-lasting lava lakes on earth characteristic eruptive activity consists of strombolian eruptions from the lava lake or from one of several subsidiary vents , all within the volcano 's inner crater ) and scott base ( new zealand ) , both sited on ross island around 35 km away the composition of the current eruptive products of erebus are anorthoclase-porphyritic tephritic phonolite and phonolite , which are the bulk of exposed lava flow on the volcano slightly younger basanite and phonotephrite lavas crop out on fang ridge—an eroded remnant of an early erebus volcano—and at other isolated locations on the flanks of erebus the upper slopes of mount erebus are dominated by steeply dipping ( about 30° ) tephritic phonolite lava flows with large-scale flow levees in the center of the summit caldera is a small , steep-sided cone composed primarily of decomposed lava bombs and a large deposit of anorthoclase crystals known as erebus crystals by studying the refracted and scattered seismic waves , the scientists produced an image of the uppermost ( top few km ) of the volcano to understand the geometry of its '' plumbing '' and how the magma rises to the lava lake erebus is notable for its numerous ice fumaroles – ice towers that form around gases that escape from vents in the surface for photographs of ice fumaroles , see ice towers mount everest volcano observatory the ice caves associated with the fumaroles are dark , in polar alpine environments starved in organics and with oxygenated hydrothermal circulation in highly reducing host rock mount erebus is large enough to have several named features on its slopes , including a number of craters and rock formations named craters located on mount erebus include side crater , a nearly circular crater named for its location on the side of the main summit cone , and western crater , named for the slope on which it sits also on the northwest slope sits tarr nunatak , named by the new zealand geographic board ( nzgb ) in 2000 after sgt the flight crashed into mount erebus on november 28 , 1979 , killing all 257 people on board file : ross island map usgs 250k.png topographic map of ross island ( 1:250,000 scale ) mount erebus is in the lower left a picture from space of the lava lake at the summit of mount erebus erebus glacier tongue a panoramic view from the summit of mount erebus footage of mount erebus erupting in 2005

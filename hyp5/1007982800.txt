mount erebus is currently the most active volcano in antarctica and is the current eruptive zone of the erebus hotspot the summit contains a persistent convecting phonolite lava lake , one of five long-lasting lava lakes on earth characteristic eruptive activity consists of strombolian eruptions from the lava lake or from one of several subsidiary vents , all within the volcano 's inner crater ) and scott base ( new zealand ) , both sited on ross island around 35 km away the composition of the current eruptive products of erebus are anorthoclase-porphyritic tephritic phonolite and phonolite , which are the bulk of exposed lava flow on the volcano the oldest eruptive products consist of relatively undifferentiated and viscosity basanite lavas that form the low broad platform shield of erebus slightly younger basanite and phonotephrite lavas crop out on fang ridge—an eroded remnant of an early erebus volcano—and at other isolated locations on the flanks of erebus erebus is the world 's only presently erupting phonolite volcano the upper slopes of mount erebus are dominated by steeply dipping ( about 30° ) tephritic phonolite lava flows with large-scale flow levees in the center of the summit caldera is a small , steep-sided cone composed primarily of decomposed lava bombs and a large deposit of anorthoclase crystals known as erebus crystals erebus is notable for its numerous ice fumaroles – ice towers that form around gases that escape from vents in the surface mount erebus is large enough to have several named features on its slopes , including a number of craters and rock formations also on the northwest slope sits tarr nunatak , named by the new zealand geographic board ( nzgb ) in 2000 after sgt on the southwest rim of the summit caldera sits seismic bluff , named for a seismic station nearby the cashman crags are two rock summits at about high on the west slope of mount erebus , southwest of hoopers shoulder jpg aerial view of mount erebus craters file : mounterebusnasa.jpg satellite picture of mount erebus showing glow from its persistent lava lake file : operation-deep-freeze-mt-erebus-6851.jpg mount erebus in december 1955 a picture from space of the lava lake at the summit of mount erebus erebus glacier tongue a panoramic view from the summit of mount erebus footage of mount erebus erupting in 2005

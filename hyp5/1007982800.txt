mount erebus is currently the most active volcano in antarctica and is the current eruptive zone of the erebus hotspot ) and scott base ( new zealand ) , both sited on ross island around 35 km away the composition of the current eruptive products of erebus are anorthoclase-porphyritic tephritic phonolite and phonolite , which are the bulk of exposed lava flow on the volcano the oldest eruptive products consist of relatively undifferentiated and viscosity basanite lavas that form the low broad platform shield of erebus slightly younger basanite and phonotephrite lavas crop out on fang ridge—an eroded remnant of an early erebus volcano—and at other isolated locations on the flanks of erebus erebus is the world 's only presently erupting phonolite volcano the upper slopes of mount erebus are dominated by steeply dipping ( about 30° ) tephritic phonolite lava flows with large-scale flow levees a conspicuous break in slope around 3,200 m asl calls attention to a summit plateau representing a caldera it is filled with small volume tephritic phonolite and phonolite lava flows the active lava lake in this summit cone undergoes continuous degassing these results demonstrated a complex upper-volcano conduit system with appreciable upper-volcano magma storage to the northwest of the lava lake at depths hundreds of meters below the surface the caves on erebus are of special interest for astrobiology , as most surface caves are influenced by human activities , or by organics from the surface brought in by animals ( e.g there are many rock formations on mount erebus the mountain was surveyed in december 1912 by a science party from robert falcon scott 's terra nova expedition , who also collected geological samples the flight crashed into mount erebus on november 28 , 1979 , killing all 257 people on board ; general the mount erebus volcano observatory ( includes live camera images of the volcano 's lava lake , video clips of eruptions , and other information ) a picture from space of the lava lake at the summit of mount erebus erebus glacier tongue a panoramic view from the summit of mount erebus footage of mount erebus erupting in 2005

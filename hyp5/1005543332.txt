saṃsāra , a fundamental concept in all indian religions , is linked to the karma theory and refers to the belief that all living beings cyclically go through births and rebirths the term is related to phrases such as '' the cycle of successive existence '' , '' transmigration '' , '' karmic cycle '' , '' the wheel of life '' , and '' cyclicality of all life , matter , existence '' a conceptual form from this root appears in ancient texts as saṃsaraṇa , which means '' going around through a succession of states , birth , rebirth of living beings and the world '' , without obstruction the term shortens to saṃsāra , referring to the same concept , as a '' passage through successive states of mundane existence '' , a transmigration , metempsychosis , a circuit of living where one repeats previous states , from one body to another , a worldly life of constant change , that is rebirth , growth , decay and redeath the word saṃsāra appears , along with moksha , in several principal upanishads such as in verse 1.3.7 of the katha upanishad , katha upanishad प्रथमोध्यायः/तृतीयवल्ली wikisource verse 6.16 of the shvetashvatara upanishad , shvetashvatara upanishad षष्ठः अध्यायः wikisource verses 1.4 and 6.34 of the maitri upanishad maitri upanishad wikisource , quote : ३ चित्तमेव हि संसारम् तत्प्रयत्नेन शोधयेत् ga jacob ( 1963 ) , a concordance to the principal upanishads and bhagavad gita , motilal banarsidass , pp the earliest layers of vedic text incorporate the concept of life , followed by an afterlife in heaven and hell based on cumulative virtues ( merit ) or vices ( demerit ) however , the ancient vedic rishis challenged this idea of afterlife as simplistic , because people do not live an equally moral or immoral life this idea appears in ancient and medieval texts , as the cycle of life , death , rebirth and redeath , such as section 6:31 of the mahabharata and section 6.10 of devi bhagavata purana the historical origins of a concept of a cycle of repeated reincarnation are obscure but the idea appears in texts of both india and ancient greece during the first millennium bc 451–53 , 459–68 the late textual layers of the vedas mention and anticipate the doctrine of karma and rebirth , however states stephen laumakis , the idea is not fully developed while saṃsāra is usually described as rebirth and reincarnation of living beings , the chronological development of the idea over its history began with the questions on what is the true nature of human existence and whether people die only once

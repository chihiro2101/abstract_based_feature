the best-known form of imprinting is filial imprinting , in which a young animal narrows its social preferences to an object ( typically a parent ) as a result of exposure to that object it was first reported in domestic chickens , by sir thomas more in 1516 as described in his treatise utopia , 350years earlier than by the 19th-century amateur biologist douglas spalding 268 lorenz demonstrated how incubator-hatched geese would imprint on the first suitable moving stimulus they saw within what he called a '' critical period '' between 13 and 16 hours shortly after hatching for example , the goslings would imprint on lorenz himself ( to be more specific , on his wading boots ) , and he is often depicted being followed by a gaggle of geese who had imprinted on him the filial imprinting of birds was a primary technique used to create the movie winged migration ( le peuple migrateur ) , which contains a great deal of footage of migratory birds in flight d'arrigo noted that the flight of a non-motorised hang-glider is very similar to the flight patterns of migratory birds ; both use updrafts of hot air ( thermal currents ) to gain altitude that then permits soaring flight over distance because birds hatched in captivity have no mentor birds to teach them traditional migratory routes , d'arrigo hatched chicks under the wing of his glider and they imprinted on him this behaviour was used to determine that very young chicks of a few days old have rudimentary counting skills american coot mothers have the ability to recognize their chicks by imprinting on cues from the first chick that hatches for example , male zebra finches appear to prefer mates with the appearance of the female bird that rears them , rather than that of the birth parent when they are different sexual attraction to humans can develop in non-human mammals or birds as a result of sexual imprinting when reared from young by humans reverse sexual imprinting is also seen in instances where two people who live in domestic proximity during the first few years in the life of either one become desensitized to later close sexual attraction a study of the marriage patterns of these children later in life revealed that out of the nearly 3,000 marriages that occurred across the kibbutz system , only fourteen were between children from the same peer group in humanâ€“computer interaction , baby duck syndrome denotes the tendency for computer users to '' imprint '' on the first system they learn , then judge other systems by their similarity to that first system

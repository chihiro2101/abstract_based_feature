the best-known form of imprinting is filial imprinting , in which a young animal narrows its social preferences to an object ( typically a parent ) as a result of exposure to that object it was first reported in domestic chickens , by sir thomas more in 1516 as described in his treatise utopia , 350years earlier than by the 19th-century amateur biologist douglas spalding 268 lorenz demonstrated how incubator-hatched geese would imprint on the first suitable moving stimulus they saw within what he called a '' critical period '' between 13 and 16 hours shortly after hatching in one notable experiment , they followed a box placed on a model train in circles around the track filial imprinting is not restricted to non-human animals that are able to follow their parents , however the birds imprinted on handlers , who wore yellow jackets and honked horns constantly the young birds followed him not only on the ground ( as with lorenz ) but also in the air as he took the path of various migratory routes chicks of domestic chickens prefer to be near large groups of objects that they have imprinted on this behaviour was used to determine that very young chicks of a few days old have rudimentary counting skills american coot mothers have the ability to recognize their chicks by imprinting on cues from the first chick that hatches sexual imprinting is the process by which a young animal learns the characteristics of a desirable mate sexual imprinting on inanimate objects is a popular theory concerning the development of sexual fetishism it is one of the suggested explanations for the claim that the experiences of an infant , particularly during the first two years of his life , contribute to his lifelong developmental psychology this result provides evidence not only that the westermarck effect is demonstrable but that it operates during the period from birth to the age of six

the best-known form of imprinting is filial imprinting , in which a young animal narrows its social preferences to an object ( typically a parent ) as a result of exposure to that object it was rediscovered by the early ethologist oskar heinroth , and studied extensively and popularized by his disciple konrad lorenz working with greylag geese 268 lorenz demonstrated how incubator-hatched geese would imprint on the first suitable moving stimulus they saw within what he called a '' critical period '' between 13 and 16 hours shortly after hatching for example , the goslings would imprint on lorenz himself ( to be more specific , on his wading boots ) , and he is often depicted being followed by a gaggle of geese who had imprinted on him lorenz also found that the geese could imprint on inanimate objects the filial imprinting of birds was a primary technique used to create the movie winged migration ( le peuple migrateur ) , which contains a great deal of footage of migratory birds in flight d'arrigo noted that the flight of a non-motorised hang-glider is very similar to the flight patterns of migratory birds ; both use updrafts of hot air ( thermal currents ) to gain altitude that then permits soaring flight over distance because birds hatched in captivity have no mentor birds to teach them traditional migratory routes , d'arrigo hatched chicks under the wing of his glider and they imprinted on him the young birds followed him not only on the ground ( as with lorenz ) but also in the air as he took the path of various migratory routes sexual attraction to humans can develop in non-human mammals or birds as a result of sexual imprinting when reared from young by humans it is one of the suggested explanations for the claim that the experiences of an infant , particularly during the first two years of his life , contribute to his lifelong developmental psychology reverse sexual imprinting is also seen in instances where two people who live in domestic proximity during the first few years in the life of either one become desensitized to later close sexual attraction sigmund freud argued that as children , members of the same family naturally lust for one another , making it necessary for societies to create incest taboos , freud , s in humanâ€“computer interaction , baby duck syndrome denotes the tendency for computer users to '' imprint '' on the first system they learn , then judge other systems by their similarity to that first system

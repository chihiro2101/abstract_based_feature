the best-known form of imprinting is filial imprinting , in which a young animal narrows its social preferences to an object ( typically a parent ) as a result of exposure to that object it is most obvious in nidifugous birds , which imprint on their parents and then follow them around 268 lorenz demonstrated how incubator-hatched geese would imprint on the first suitable moving stimulus they saw within what he called a '' critical period '' between 13 and 16 hours shortly after hatching for example , the goslings would imprint on lorenz himself ( to be more specific , on his wading boots ) , and he is often depicted being followed by a gaggle of geese who had imprinted on him lorenz also found that the geese could imprint on inanimate objects the filial imprinting of birds was a primary technique used to create the movie winged migration ( le peuple migrateur ) , which contains a great deal of footage of migratory birds in flight in a series of experiments , they were made to imprint on plastic balls and could figure out which of two groups of balls hidden behind screens had the most balls american coot mothers have the ability to recognize their chicks by imprinting on cues from the first chick that hatches sexual imprinting is the process by which a young animal learns the characteristics of a desirable mate sexual attraction to humans can develop in non-human mammals or birds as a result of sexual imprinting when reared from young by humans the breeder then courts a suitable imprint female bird ( including offering food , if it is part of that species 's normal courtship ) this phenomenon , known as the westermarck effect , was first formally described by finnish anthropologist edvard westermarck in his book the history of human marriage ( 1891 ) this result provides evidence not only that the westermarck effect is demonstrable but that it operates during the period from birth to the age of six in humanâ€“computer interaction , baby duck syndrome denotes the tendency for computer users to '' imprint '' on the first system they learn , then judge other systems by their similarity to that first system

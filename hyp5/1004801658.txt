some common whips such as the bullwhip or stockwhip are able to move faster than sound : the tip of the whip exceeds this speed and causes a sharp crack—literally a sonic boom firearms made after the 19th century generally have a supersonic muzzle velocity the sound barrier may have been first breached by living beings about 150 million years ago some paleobiology report that , based on computer models of their biomechanics capabilities , certain long-tailed dinosaurs such as brontosaurus , apatosaurus , and diplodocus may have been able to flick their tails at supersonic speeds , creating a cracking sound '' did dinosaurs break the sound barrier ? '' the new york times , december 2 , 1997 meteors entering the earth 's atmosphere usually , if not always , descend faster than sound the tip of the propeller on many early aircraft may reach supersonic speeds , producing a noticeable buzz that differentiates such aircraft it is due to these effects that propellers are known to suffer from dramatically decreased performance as they approach the speed of sound it is easy to demonstrate that the power needed to improve performance is so great that the weight of the required engine grows faster than the power output of the propeller can compensate most infamously , in the mitsubishi zero , pilots flew at full power into the terrain because the rapidly increasing forces acting on the control surfaces of their aircraft overpowered them all of these effects , although unrelated in most ways , led to the concept of a '' barrier '' making it difficult for an aircraft to exceed the speed of sound rocketry and artillery experts ' products routinely exceeded mach 1 , but aircraft designers and aerodynamic engineers during and after world war ii discussed mach 0.7 as a limit dangerous to exceed during wwii and immediately thereafter , a number of claims were made that the sound barrier had been broken in a dive the typical airspeed indicator ( asi ) uses air pressure differences between two or more points on the aircraft , typically near the nose and at the side of the fuselage , to produce a speed figure this effect became known as '' mach jump '' comstock and roger dyar had exceeded the speed of sound during test dives in a republic p-47 thunderbolt it is widely agreed that this was due to inaccurate asi readings one of the highest recorded instrumented mach numbers attained for a propeller aircraft is the mach 0.891 for a spitfire pr xi , flown during dive tests at the royal aircraft establishment in april 1944 the spitfire , a photo-reconnaissance variant , the mark xi , fitted with an extended '' rake type '' multiple pitot system , was flown by squadron leader j tobin to this speed , corresponding to a corrected true airspeed ( tas ) of 606 & nbsp ; mph in a subsequent flight , squadron leader anthony martindale achieved mach 0.92 , but it ended in a forced landing after over-revving damaged the engine hans guido mutke claimed to have broken the sound barrier on 9 april 1945 in the messerschmitt me 262 jet aircraft '' me 262 and the sound barrier '' wagner stated : '' i do n't want to exclude the possibility , but i can imagine he may also have been just below the speed of sound and felt the buffeting , but did not go above mach-1 f-su-1111-nd on january 10 , 1946 : the comments about restoration of flight control and cessation of buffeting above mach 1 are very significant in a 1946 document he claims that on 6 july 1944 , dittmar , flying me 163b v18 , bearing the alphabetic code va+sp , was measured traveling at a speed of 1,130 & nbsp ; km/h ( 702 & nbsp ; mph ) dittmar himself does not make a claim that he broke the sound barrier on that flight and notes that the speed was recorded only on the ais the luftwaffe test pilot lothar sieber ( 7 april 1922 – 1 march 1945 ) may have inadvertently become the first man to break the sound barrier on 1 march 1945 '' historical footnote : on march 1st 1945 , did lothar sieber become the first person to break the sound barrier ? '' doug 's darkworld : war , science , and philosophy in a fractured world , november 25 , 2008 there are a number of unmanned vehicles that flew at supersonic speeds during this period , but they generally do not meet the definition in 1933 , soviet designers working on ramjet concepts fired phosphorus-powered engines out of artillery guns to get them to operational speeds in contrast , the german v-2 ballistic missile routinely broke the sound barrier in flight , for the first time on 3 october 1942 by september 1944 , v-2s routinely achieved mach 4 ( 1,200 & nbsp ; m/s , or 3044 & nbsp ; mph ) during terminal descent breaking the sound barrier in 1942 , the united kingdom 's ministry of aviation began a top-secret project with miles aircraft to develop the world 's first aircraft capable of breaking the sound barrier the wing tips were '' clipped '' to keep them clear of the conical shock wave generated by the nose of the aircraft finally , the design included another critical element the use of a inlet cone in the nose to slow the incoming air to the subsonic speeds needed by the engine although concorde and the tu-144 were the first aircraft to carry commercial passengers at supersonic speeds , they were not the first or only commercial airliners to break the sound barrier on 21 august 1961 , a douglas dc-8 broke the sound barrier at mach & nbsp ; 1.012 , or 1,240 & nbsp ; km/h ( 776.2 & nbsp ; mph ) , while in a controlled dive through 41,088 & nbsp ; feet ( 12,510 & nbsp ; m ) a china airlines 747 may have broken the sound barrier in an unplanned descent from 41,000 & nbsp ; ft ( 12,500 & nbsp ; m ) to 9,500 & nbsp ; ft ( 2,900 & nbsp ; m ) after an in-flight upset on 19 february 1985 baumgartner landed in eastern new mexico after jumping from a world record 128,100 & nbsp ; feet ( 39,045 & nbsp ; m ) , or 24.26 & nbsp ; miles , and broke the sound barrier as he traveled at speeds up to 833.9 & nbsp ; mph ( 1342 & nbsp ; km/h , or mach 1.26 ) chuck yeager and the bell x-1 : breaking the sound barrier

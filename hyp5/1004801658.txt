some common whips such as the bullwhip or stockwhip are able to move faster than sound : the tip of the whip exceeds this speed and causes a sharp crack—literally a sonic boom firearms made after the 19th century generally have a supersonic muzzle velocity the sound barrier may have been first breached by living beings about 150 million years ago '' did dinosaurs break the sound barrier ? '' the new york times , december 2 , 1997 meteors entering the earth 's atmosphere usually , if not always , descend faster than sound the tip of the propeller on many early aircraft may reach supersonic speeds , producing a noticeable buzz that differentiates such aircraft this is undesirable , as the transonic air movement creates disruptive shock waves and turbulence it is due to these effects that propellers are known to suffer from dramatically decreased performance as they approach the speed of sound it is easy to demonstrate that the power needed to improve performance is so great that the weight of the required engine grows faster than the power output of the propeller can compensate nevertheless , propeller aircraft were able to approach the critical mach number in a dive a similar problem is thought to have been the cause of the 1943 crash of the bi-1 rocket aircraft in the soviet union all of these effects , although unrelated in most ways , led to the concept of a '' barrier '' making it difficult for an aircraft to exceed the speed of sound erroneous news reports caused most people to envision the sound barrier as a physical '' wall '' , which supersonic aircraft needed to '' break '' with a sharp needle nose on the front of the fuselage during wwii and immediately thereafter , a number of claims were made that the sound barrier had been broken in a dive the majority of these purported events can be dismissed as instrumentation errors '' the amazing george welch , part two , first through the sonic wall '' before the introduction of machmeter , accurate measurements of supersonic speeds could only be made remotely , normally using ground-based instruments many claims of supersonic speeds were found to be far below this speed when measured in this fashion comstock and roger dyar had exceeded the speed of sound during test dives in a republic p-47 thunderbolt it is widely agreed that this was due to inaccurate asi readings spitfire – typical high speed dive hans guido mutke claimed to have broken the sound barrier on 9 april 1945 in the messerschmitt me 262 jet aircraft all of the effects he reported are known to occur on the me 262 at much lower speeds , and the asi reading is simply not reliable in the transonic further , a series of tests made by karl doetsch at the behest of willy messerschmitt found that the plane became uncontrollable above mach 0.86 , and at mach 0.9 would nose over into a dive that could not be recovered from these tests do not rule out the possibility , but are lacking accurate data on the coefficient of drag that would be needed to make accurate simulations wagner stated : '' i do n't want to exclude the possibility , but i can imagine he may also have been just below the speed of sound and felt the buffeting , but did not go above mach-1 f-su-1111-nd on january 10 , 1946 : the comments about restoration of flight control and cessation of buffeting above mach 1 are very significant in a 1946 document he reached this speed at less than full throttle , as he was concerned by the transonic buffeting dittmar himself does not make a claim that he broke the sound barrier on that flight and notes that the speed was recorded only on the ais he does , however , take credit for being the first pilot to '' knock on the sound barrier '' the luftwaffe test pilot lothar sieber ( 7 april 1922 – 1 march 1945 ) may have inadvertently become the first man to break the sound barrier on 1 march 1945 in 55 seconds , he traveled a total of 14 & nbsp ; km ( 8.7 & nbsp ; miles ) it is possible that this produced supersonic performance as high as mach 2 , durant , frederick c by september 1944 , v-2s routinely achieved mach 4 ( 1,200 & nbsp ; m/s , or 3044 & nbsp ; mph ) during terminal descent initially , the aircraft was to use frank whittle 's latest engine , the power jets w.2/700 , which would only reach supersonic speed in a shallow dive to develop a fully supersonic version of the aircraft , an innovation incorporated was a reheat jetpipe – also known as an afterburner finally , the design included another critical element the use of a inlet cone in the nose to slow the incoming air to the subsonic speeds needed by the engine the first '' official '' aircraft to break the sound barrier as the science of high-speed flight became more widely understood , a number of changes led to the eventual understanding that the '' sound barrier '' is easily penetrated , with the right conditions test pilot chuck yeager 's successful attempt to break the sound barrier in an aircraft chuck yeager and the bell x-1 : breaking the sound barrier the quest for mach one : a first-person account of breaking the sound barrier

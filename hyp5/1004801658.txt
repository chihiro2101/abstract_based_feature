some common whips such as the bullwhip or stockwhip are able to move faster than sound : the tip of the whip exceeds this speed and causes a sharp crack—literally a sonic boom american scientist , volume 90 , issue 5 , september–october 2002 firearms made after the 19th century generally have a supersonic muzzle velocity the sound barrier may have been first breached by living beings about 150 million years ago '' did dinosaurs break the sound barrier ? '' the new york times , december 2 , 1997 the tip of the propeller on many early aircraft may reach supersonic speeds , producing a noticeable buzz that differentiates such aircraft this is undesirable , as the transonic air movement creates disruptive shock waves and turbulence it is due to these effects that propellers are known to suffer from dramatically decreased performance as they approach the speed of sound it is easy to demonstrate that the power needed to improve performance is so great that the weight of the required engine grows faster than the power output of the propeller can compensate most infamously , in the mitsubishi zero , pilots flew at full power into the terrain because the rapidly increasing forces acting on the control surfaces of their aircraft overpowered them a similar problem is thought to have been the cause of the 1943 crash of the bi-1 rocket aircraft in the soviet union all of these effects , although unrelated in most ways , led to the concept of a '' barrier '' making it difficult for an aircraft to exceed the speed of sound 18 : '' for various reasons it is fairly certain that the maximum attainable speed under self-propelled conditions will be that of sound in air '' , i.e erroneous news reports caused most people to envision the sound barrier as a physical '' wall '' , which supersonic aircraft needed to '' break '' with a sharp needle nose on the front of the fuselage the typical airspeed indicator ( asi ) uses air pressure differences between two or more points on the aircraft , typically near the nose and at the side of the fuselage , to produce a speed figure at high speed , the various compression effects that lead to the sound barrier also cause the asi to go non-linear and produce inaccurately high or low readings , depending on the specifics of the installation planes and pilots of world war two , 1998–2000 many claims of supersonic speeds were found to be far below this speed when measured in this fashion in similar tests , the north american p-51 mustang demonstrated limits at mach 0.85 , with every flight over m0.84 causing the aircraft to be damaged by vibration one of the highest recorded instrumented mach numbers attained for a propeller aircraft is the mach 0.891 for a spitfire pr xi , flown during dive tests at the royal aircraft establishment in april 1944 & nbsp ; r tobin to this speed , corresponding to a corrected true airspeed ( tas ) of 606 & nbsp ; mph in a subsequent flight , squadron leader anthony martindale achieved mach 0.92 , but it ended in a forced landing after over-revving damaged the engine post-war tests by the raf confirmed these results , with the slight modification that the maximum speed using new instruments was found to be mach 0.84 , rather than mach 0.86 '' me 262 and the sound barrier '' dittmar had been officially recorded at 1,004.5 & nbsp ; km/h ( 623.8 & nbsp ; mph ) in level flight on 2 october 1941 in the prototype me 163a v4 dittmar himself does not make a claim that he broke the sound barrier on that flight and notes that the speed was recorded only on the ais the luftwaffe test pilot lothar sieber ( 7 april 1922 – 1 march 1945 ) may have inadvertently become the first man to break the sound barrier on 1 march 1945 '' historical footnote : on march 1st 1945 , did lothar sieber become the first person to break the sound barrier ?

some common whips such as the bullwhip or stockwhip are able to move faster than sound : the tip of the whip exceeds this speed and causes a sharp crack—literally a sonic boom firearms made after the 19th century generally have a supersonic muzzle velocity the sound barrier may have been first breached by living beings about 150 million years ago '' did dinosaurs break the sound barrier ? '' the new york times , december 2 , 1997 meteors entering the earth 's atmosphere usually , if not always , descend faster than sound the tip of the propeller on many early aircraft may reach supersonic speeds , producing a noticeable buzz that differentiates such aircraft it is due to these effects that propellers are known to suffer from dramatically decreased performance as they approach the speed of sound nevertheless , propeller aircraft were able to approach the critical mach number in a dive most infamously , in the mitsubishi zero , pilots flew at full power into the terrain because the rapidly increasing forces acting on the control surfaces of their aircraft overpowered them all of these effects , although unrelated in most ways , led to the concept of a '' barrier '' making it difficult for an aircraft to exceed the speed of sound 18 : '' for various reasons it is fairly certain that the maximum attainable speed under self-propelled conditions will be that of sound in air '' , i.e erroneous news reports caused most people to envision the sound barrier as a physical '' wall '' , which supersonic aircraft needed to '' break '' with a sharp needle nose on the front of the fuselage the typical airspeed indicator ( asi ) uses air pressure differences between two or more points on the aircraft , typically near the nose and at the side of the fuselage , to produce a speed figure before the introduction of machmeter , accurate measurements of supersonic speeds could only be made remotely , normally using ground-based instruments comstock and roger dyar had exceeded the speed of sound during test dives in a republic p-47 thunderbolt one of the highest recorded instrumented mach numbers attained for a propeller aircraft is the mach 0.891 for a spitfire pr xi , flown during dive tests at the royal aircraft establishment in april 1944 tobin to this speed , corresponding to a corrected true airspeed ( tas ) of 606 & nbsp ; mph in a subsequent flight , squadron leader anthony martindale achieved mach 0.92 , but it ended in a forced landing after over-revving damaged the engine mutke reported not just transonic buffeting , but the resumption of normal control once a certain speed was exceeded , then a resumption of severe buffeting once the me 262 slowed again all of the effects he reported are known to occur on the me 262 at much lower speeds , and the asi reading is simply not reliable in the transonic '' me 262 and the sound barrier '' wagner stated : '' i do n't want to exclude the possibility , but i can imagine he may also have been just below the speed of sound and felt the buffeting , but did not go above mach-1 he claims that on 6 july 1944 , dittmar , flying me 163b v18 , bearing the alphabetic code va+sp , was measured traveling at a speed of 1,130 & nbsp ; km/h ( 702 & nbsp ; mph ) dittmar himself does not make a claim that he broke the sound barrier on that flight and notes that the speed was recorded only on the ais he does , however , take credit for being the first pilot to '' knock on the sound barrier '' the luftwaffe test pilot lothar sieber ( 7 april 1922 – 1 march 1945 ) may have inadvertently become the first man to break the sound barrier on 1 march 1945 this occurred while he was piloting a bachem ba 349 '' natter '' for the first manned vertical takeoff of a rocket in history in 55 seconds , he traveled a total of 14 & nbsp ; km ( 8.7 & nbsp ; miles ) '' historical footnote : on march 1st 1945 , did lothar sieber become the first person to break the sound barrier ? '' doug 's darkworld : war , science , and philosophy in a fractured world , november 25 , 2008 there are a number of unmanned vehicles that flew at supersonic speeds during this period , but they generally do not meet the definition in 1933 , soviet designers working on ramjet concepts fired phosphorus-powered engines out of artillery guns to get them to operational speeds breaking the sound barrier in 1942 , the united kingdom 's ministry of aviation began a top-secret project with miles aircraft to develop the world 's first aircraft capable of breaking the sound barrier a huge number of advanced features were incorporated into the resulting m.52 design , many of which hint at a detailed knowledge of supersonic aerodynamics in particular , the design featured a conical nose and sharp wing leading edges , as it was known that round-nosed projectiles could not be stabilised at supersonic speeds brown , eric ( august–november 1980 ) initially , the aircraft was to use frank whittle 's latest engine , the power jets w.2/700 , which would only reach supersonic speed in a shallow dive the first '' official '' aircraft to break the sound barrier jackie cochran was the first woman to break the sound barrier on 18 may 1953 , in a canadair sabre , with yeager as her wingman a china airlines 747 may have broken the sound barrier in an unplanned descent from 41,000 & nbsp ; ft ( 12,500 & nbsp ; m ) to 9,500 & nbsp ; ft ( 2,900 & nbsp ; m ) after an in-flight upset on 19 february 1985 test pilot chuck yeager 's successful attempt to break the sound barrier in an aircraft chuck yeager and the bell x-1 : breaking the sound barrier

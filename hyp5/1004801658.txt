some common whips such as the bullwhip or stockwhip are able to move faster than sound : the tip of the whip exceeds this speed and causes a sharp crack—literally a sonic boom the sound barrier may have been first breached by living beings about 150 million years ago some paleobiology report that , based on computer models of their biomechanics capabilities , certain long-tailed dinosaurs such as brontosaurus , apatosaurus , and diplodocus may have been able to flick their tails at supersonic speeds , creating a cracking sound '' did dinosaurs break the sound barrier ? '' the new york times , december 2 , 1997 meteors entering the earth 's atmosphere usually , if not always , descend faster than sound the tip of the propeller on many early aircraft may reach supersonic speeds , producing a noticeable buzz that differentiates such aircraft this is undesirable , as the transonic air movement creates disruptive shock waves and turbulence it is due to these effects that propellers are known to suffer from dramatically decreased performance as they approach the speed of sound nevertheless , propeller aircraft were able to approach the critical mach number in a dive likewise , the flexing caused by the low torsional stiffness of the supermarine spitfire 's wings caused them , in turn , to counteract aileron control inputs , leading to a condition known as control reversal worse still , a particularly dangerous interaction of the airflow between the wings and tail surfaces of diving lockheed p-38 lightnings made '' pulling out '' of dives difficult ; however , the problem was later solved by the addition of a '' dive flap '' that upset the airflow under these circumstances flutter due to the formation of shock waves on curved surfaces was another major problem , which led most famously to the breakup of a de havilland swallow and death of its pilot geoffrey de havilland , jr erroneous news reports caused most people to envision the sound barrier as a physical '' wall '' , which supersonic aircraft needed to '' break '' with a sharp needle nose on the front of the fuselage rocketry and artillery experts ' products routinely exceeded mach 1 , but aircraft designers and aerodynamic engineers during and after world war ii discussed mach 0.7 as a limit dangerous to exceed during wwii and immediately thereafter , a number of claims were made that the sound barrier had been broken in a dive the typical airspeed indicator ( asi ) uses air pressure differences between two or more points on the aircraft , typically near the nose and at the side of the fuselage , to produce a speed figure at high speed , the various compression effects that lead to the sound barrier also cause the asi to go non-linear and produce inaccurately high or low readings , depending on the specifics of the installation before the introduction of machmeter , accurate measurements of supersonic speeds could only be made remotely , normally using ground-based instruments in similar tests , the north american p-51 mustang demonstrated limits at mach 0.85 , with every flight over m0.84 causing the aircraft to be damaged by vibration one of the highest recorded instrumented mach numbers attained for a propeller aircraft is the mach 0.891 for a spitfire pr xi , flown during dive tests at the royal aircraft establishment in april 1944 in a subsequent flight , squadron leader anthony martindale achieved mach 0.92 , but it ended in a forced landing after over-revving damaged the engine post-war tests by the raf confirmed these results , with the slight modification that the maximum speed using new instruments was found to be mach 0.84 , rather than mach 0.86 '' me 262 and the sound barrier '' in 1999 , mutke enlisted the help of professor otto wagner of the munich technical university to run computational tests to determine whether the aircraft could break the sound barrier f-su-1111-nd on january 10 , 1946 : the comments about restoration of flight control and cessation of buffeting above mach 1 are very significant in a 1946 document however , no evidence of such a flight exists in any of the materials from that period , which were captured by allied forces and extensively studied dittmar had been officially recorded at 1,004.5 & nbsp ; km/h ( 623.8 & nbsp ; mph ) in level flight on 2 october 1941 in the prototype me 163a v4 dittmar himself does not make a claim that he broke the sound barrier on that flight and notes that the speed was recorded only on the ais the luftwaffe test pilot lothar sieber ( 7 april 1922 – 1 march 1945 ) may have inadvertently become the first man to break the sound barrier on 1 march 1945 in 1933 , soviet designers working on ramjet concepts fired phosphorus-powered engines out of artillery guns to get them to operational speeds in contrast , the german v-2 ballistic missile routinely broke the sound barrier in flight , for the first time on 3 october 1942 breaking the sound barrier in 1942 , the united kingdom 's ministry of aviation began a top-secret project with miles aircraft to develop the world 's first aircraft capable of breaking the sound barrier the project resulted in the development of the prototype miles m.52 turbojet-powered aircraft , which was designed to reach 1,000 & nbsp ; mph ( 417 & nbsp ; m/s ; 1,600 & nbsp ; km/h ) ( over twice the existing speed record ) in level flight , and to climb to an altitude of 36,000 & nbsp ; ft ( 11 & nbsp ; km ) in 1 & nbsp ; minute 30 & nbsp ; seconds the design used very thin wings of biconvex section proposed by jakob ackeret for low drag an stabilator is considered to be a minimum condition of enabling aircraft to break the transonic barrier safely , without losing pilot control initially , the aircraft was to use frank whittle 's latest engine , the power jets w.2/700 , which would only reach supersonic speed in a shallow dive the british air ministry signed an agreement with the united states to exchange all its high-speed research , data and designs and bell aircraft company was given access to the drawings and research on the m.52 , wood , derek ( 1975 ) as the science of high-speed flight became more widely understood , a number of changes led to the eventual understanding that the '' sound barrier '' is easily penetrated , with the right conditions test pilot chuck yeager 's successful attempt to break the sound barrier in an aircraft chuck yeager and the bell x-1 : breaking the sound barrier cramer , ph.d breaking the sound barrier with an aircraft by carl rod nave , ph.d a video of a concorde reaching mach 1 at intersection tesgo taken from below an interactive java applet , illustrating the sound barrier

some common whips such as the bullwhip or stockwhip are able to move faster than sound : the tip of the whip exceeds this speed and causes a sharp crackâ€”literally a sonic boom the sound barrier may have been first breached by living beings about 150 million years ago some paleobiology report that , based on computer models of their biomechanics capabilities , certain long-tailed dinosaurs such as brontosaurus , apatosaurus , and diplodocus may have been able to flick their tails at supersonic speeds , creating a cracking sound '' did dinosaurs break the sound barrier ? '' the new york times , december 2 , 1997 the tip of the propeller on many early aircraft may reach supersonic speeds , producing a noticeable buzz that differentiates such aircraft this is undesirable , as the transonic air movement creates disruptive shock waves and turbulence nevertheless , propeller aircraft were able to approach the critical mach number in a dive likewise , the flexing caused by the low torsional stiffness of the supermarine spitfire 's wings caused them , in turn , to counteract aileron control inputs , leading to a condition known as control reversal flutter due to the formation of shock waves on curved surfaces was another major problem , which led most famously to the breakup of a de havilland swallow and death of its pilot geoffrey de havilland , jr a similar problem is thought to have been the cause of the 1943 crash of the bi-1 rocket aircraft in the soviet union all of these effects , although unrelated in most ways , led to the concept of a '' barrier '' making it difficult for an aircraft to exceed the speed of sound 18 : '' for various reasons it is fairly certain that the maximum attainable speed under self-propelled conditions will be that of sound in air '' , i.e erroneous news reports caused most people to envision the sound barrier as a physical '' wall '' , which supersonic aircraft needed to '' break '' with a sharp needle nose on the front of the fuselage rocketry and artillery experts ' products routinely exceeded mach 1 , but aircraft designers and aerodynamic engineers during and after world war ii discussed mach 0.7 as a limit dangerous to exceed at high speed , the various compression effects that lead to the sound barrier also cause the asi to go non-linear and produce inaccurately high or low readings , depending on the specifics of the installation many claims of supersonic speeds were found to be far below this speed when measured in this fashion hans guido mutke claimed to have broken the sound barrier on 9 april 1945 in the messerschmitt me 262 jet aircraft all of the effects he reported are known to occur on the me 262 at much lower speeds , and the asi reading is simply not reliable in the transonic further , a series of tests made by karl doetsch at the behest of willy messerschmitt found that the plane became uncontrollable above mach 0.86 , and at mach 0.9 would nose over into a dive that could not be recovered from post-war tests by the raf confirmed these results , with the slight modification that the maximum speed using new instruments was found to be mach 0.84 , rather than mach 0.86 '' me 262 and the sound barrier '' in his 1990 book me-163 , former messerschmitt me 163 pilot mano ziegler claims that his friend , test pilot heini dittmar , broke the sound barrier while diving the rocket plane , and that several people on the ground heard the sonic booms however , no evidence of such a flight exists in any of the materials from that period , which were captured by allied forces and extensively studied dittmar himself does not make a claim that he broke the sound barrier on that flight and notes that the speed was recorded only on the ais this occurred while he was piloting a bachem ba 349 '' natter '' for the first manned vertical takeoff of a rocket in history it is possible that this produced supersonic performance as high as mach 2 , durant ,

kingdom 's ministry of aviation began a top-secret project with miles aircraft to develop the world 's first aircraft capable of breaking the sound barrier in particular , the design featured a conical nose and sharp wing leading edges , as it was known that round-nosed projectiles could not be stabilised at supersonic speeds the fuselage had the minimum cross-section allowable around the centrifugal engine with fuel tanks in a saddle over the top initially , the aircraft was to use frank whittle 's latest engine , the power jets w.2/700 , which would only reach supersonic speed in a shallow dive finally , the design included another critical element the use of a inlet cone in the nose to slow the incoming air to the subsonic speeds needed by the engine meanwhile , test pilots

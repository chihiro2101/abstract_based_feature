reformed irish parliament ch iii until his marriage , john mitchel had by and large taken his politics from his father who , according to mitchel 's early biographer william dillon , had '' begun to comprehend the degradation of his countrymen '' soon after the granting of catholic emancipation in 1829 , the o'connellites challenged the protestant ascendancy in newry by running a catholic parliamentary candidate mitchel 's congregation took an active part in the elections on the side of the ascendancy , and pressed the rev mitchel to do the same his refusal to do earned him the nickname '' papist mitchel '' in banbridge , mitchel was often employed by the catholics in the legal proceedings arising from provocative , sometimes violent , orange incursions into their districts

embraced davis 's promotion of the irish language and of gaelic ireland as a non-sectarian basis for a common irish nationality mitchel , however , did not share davis 's anti-clericalism , declining to support davis as he sought to reverse o'connell 's opposition to the government 's secular , or as o'connell proposed '' godless '' , colleges bill mitchel insisted that the government , aware that it would cause dissension , had introduced their bill for non-religious higher education to divide the national movement for mitchel a cultural nationalism based on ireland gaelic heritage was intended not to displace the two religious traditions but rather serve as common ground between them he left his legal practice in newry , and brought his wife and children to live in dublin ,

would force them to sell their other crops and starve invoking new laissez-faire doctrines '' political economy '' , they immediately set about dismantling peel 's limited , but practical , efforts to provide ireland food relief a broken man , on the advice of his doctors o'connell took himself to the continent where , on route to rome , he died in may 1847 in the months before o'connell 's death , duffy circulated letters received from james fintan lalor in which he argued that independence could be pursued only in a popular struggle for the land lalor advised only against a general uprising : the people , he believed , could not hold their own against the country 's english garrison when the london journal the standard observed that the new irish railways could be used to transport troops to quickly curb agrarian unrest , mitchel responded that the tracks could be turned into pikes and trains ambushed o ’ connell publicly distanced himself from the nation , appearing to some to set duffy , as the editor , up for prosecution on the threat of their own resignations , they carried a resolution in the repeal association declaring that under no circumstances was a nation justified in asserting its liberties by force of arms 195-6 the grouping around the nation that o'connell had taken to calling '' young ireland '' , a reference to giuseppe mazzini 's anti-clerical and

and speeches only two weeks after it had been publicly condemned by o'connell despite mitchel himself waxing indignant at cromwell 's conduct in ireland , carlyle was pleased : he believed mitchel had conceded cromwell 's essential greatness duffy , 19 january 1846 , ms 5756 , national library of ireland , dublin mitchel had just published his own hagiography of the ulster rebel chieftain hugh o'neill , which both duffy and davis had found excessively '' carlylean '' the book was a success : '' an early incursion of carlylean thought into the romantic construction of the irish nation that was to dominate militant irish politics for a century mitchel 's response was not join o'connell in proclaiming himself '' the friend of liberty in every clime , class and color '' o'connell , an address in conciliation hall , in dublin on september 29 , 1845 recorded by frederick douglass in a letter to william lloyd garrison it was not only that mitchel claimed ( as others had done ) that

rushing to destruction carlyle later said , when mitchel was on trial , '' irish mitchel , poor fellow… i told him he would most likely be hanged , but i told him , too , that they could not hang the immortal part of him such actions would be illegal , but such was his opposition to british rule that in mitchel 's view , no opinion in ireland was '' worth a farthing which is not illegal '' the first number of mitchel 's own paper , the united irishman , appeared on 12 february 1848 the prospectus announced that as editor mitchel would be '' aided by thomas devin reilly , john martin of loughorne and other competent contributors '' who were likewise convinced that '' ireland really and truly wants to be freed from english dominion , and to promote civil war for the purpose of exterminating every englishman in ireland on 15 april 1848 , a grand jury was called on to indict not only mitchel , but also his former associates on the nation o'brien and meagher for '' seditious

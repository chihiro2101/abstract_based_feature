characteristics of consensus decision-making include : collaboration : participants contribute to a shared proposal and shape it into a decision that meets the concerns of all group members as much as possible cooperation : participants in an effective consensus process should strive to reach the best possible decision for the group and all of its members , rather than competing for personal preferences egalitarianism : all members of a consensus decision-making body should be afforded , as much as possible , equal input into the process inclusion : as many stakeholders as possible should be involved in the consensus decision-making process participation : the consensus process should actively solicit the input and participation of all decision-makers consensus decision-making is an alternative to commonly practiced group decision-making processes this book allows the structuring of debate and passage of proposals that can be approved through majority vote critics of such a process believe that it can involve adversarial debate and the formation of competing factions consensus decision-making attempts to address the beliefs of such problems better group relationships : a cooperative , collaborative group atmosphere can foster greater group cohesion and interpersonal connection the level of agreement necessary to finalize a decision is known as a '' decision rule '' to ensure the agreement or consent of all participants is valued , many groups choose unanimity or near-unanimity as their decision rule the ethics of consensus decision-making encourage participants to place the good of the whole group above their own individual preferences when there is potential for a block to a group decision , both the group and dissenters in the group are encouraged to collaborate until agreement can be reached simply vetoing a decision is not considered a responsible use of consensus blocking some common guidelines for the use of consensus blocking include : providing an option for those who do not support a proposal to “ stand aside ” rather than block limiting each person 's option to block consensus to a handful of times in one 's life some common options may include the ability to : declare reservations : group members who are willing to let a motion pass but desire to register their concerns with the group may choose '' declare reservations stand aside : a '' stand aside '' may be registered by a group member who has a '' serious personal disagreement '' with a proposal , but is willing to let the motion pass in the model , affinity groups make joint decisions by each designating a speaker and sitting behind that circle of spokespeople , akin to the spokes of a wheel in the case of an activist spokescouncil preparing for the washington a16 , 2000 , affinity groups disputed their spokescouncil 's imposition of nonviolence in their action guidelines every proposed option is accepted if the referees decide it is relevant and conforms with the un charter on human rights the referees decide which option , or which composite of the two leading options , is the outcome if its level of support surpasses a minimum consensus coefficient , it may be adopted groups that require unanimity commonly use a core set of procedures depicted in this flow chart the general direction of the group and potential proposals for action are often identified during the discussion call for consensus : the facilitator of the decision-making body calls for consensus on the proposal identification and addressing of concerns : if consensus is not achieved , each dissenter presents his or her concerns on the proposal , potentially starting another round of discussion to address or clarify the concern quaker-based consensus is said to be effective because it puts in place a simple , time-tested structure that moves a group towards unity the quaker model is intended to allow hearing individual voices while providing a mechanism for dealing with disagreements the quaker model has been adapted by earlham college for application to secular settings , and can be effectively applied in any consensus decision-making process the facilitator ( '' clerk '' or '' convenor '' in the quaker model ) identifies areas of agreement and names disagreements to push discussion deeper key components of quaker-based consensus include a belief in a common humanity and the ability to decide together '' ensuring that group members speak only once until others are heard encourages a diversity of thought in the quaker model , as with other consensus decision-making processes , articulating the emerging consensus allows members to be clear on the decision in front of them the consensus decision-making process often has several roles designed to make the process run more effectively the common roles in a consensus meeting are : facilitator : as the name implies , the role of the facilitator is to help make the process of reaching a consensus decision easier '' consensus in supreme court voting , particularly the extreme consensus of unanimity , has often puzzled court observers who adhere to ideological accounts of judicial decision making anabaptists , including some mennonites , have a history of using consensus decision-making and some believe anabaptists practiced consensus as early as the martyrs ' synod of 1527 japanese companies normally use consensus decision-making , meaning that unanimous support on the board of directors is sought for any decision the polish–lithuanian commonwealth of 1569–1795 used consensus decision-making in the form of liberum veto ( 'free veto ' ) in its sejms ( legislative assemblies )

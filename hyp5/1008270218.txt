characteristics of consensus decision-making include : collaboration : participants contribute to a shared proposal and shape it into a decision that meets the concerns of all group members as much as possible cooperation : participants in an effective consensus process should strive to reach the best possible decision for the group and all of its members , rather than competing for personal preferences egalitarianism : all members of a consensus decision-making body should be afforded , as much as possible , equal input into the process inclusion : as many stakeholders as possible should be involved in the consensus decision-making process participation : the consensus process should actively solicit the input and participation of all decision-makers . alternative to common decision-making practices consensus decision-making is an alternative to commonly practiced group decision-making processes these dynamics may harm group member relationships and undermine the ability of a group to cooperatively implement a contentious decision consensus decision-making attempts to address the beliefs of such problems proponents claim that outcomes of the consensus process include : better decisions : through including the input of all stakeholders the resulting proposals may better address all potential concerns consensus is not synonymous with '' unanimity '' & ndash ; though that may be a rule agreed to in a decision making process to ensure the agreement or consent of all participants is valued , many groups choose unanimity or near-unanimity as their decision rule the ethics of consensus decision-making encourage participants to place the good of the whole group above their own individual preferences when there is potential for a block to a group decision , both the group and dissenters in the group are encouraged to collaborate until agreement can be reached simply vetoing a decision is not considered a responsible use of consensus blocking limiting each person 's option to block consensus to a handful of times in one 's life a participant who does not support a proposal may have alternatives to simply blocking it stand aside : a '' stand aside '' may be registered by a group member who has a '' serious personal disagreement '' with a proposal , but is willing to let the motion pass although stand asides do not halt a motion , it is often regarded as a strong '' nay vote '' and the concerns of group members standing aside are usually addressed by modifications to the proposal stand asides may also be registered by users who feel they are incapable of adequately understanding or participating in the proposal in groups with a unanimity decision rule , a single block is sufficient to stop a proposal the referees produce and display a list of these options the debate proceeds , with queries , comments , criticisms and/or even new options if the debate fails to come to a verbal consensus , the referees draw up a final list of options - usually between 4 and 6 - to represent the debate once an agenda for discussion has been set and , optionally , the ground rules for the meeting have been agreed upon , each item of the agenda is addressed in turn if it is , dissenters are asked to share their concerns with proceeding with the agreement , so that any potential harms can be addressed/minimized identification and addressing of concerns : if consensus is not achieved , each dissenter presents his or her concerns on the proposal , potentially starting another round of discussion to address or clarify the concern quaker-based consensus is said to be effective because it puts in place a simple , time-tested structure that moves a group towards unity the quaker model has been adapted by earlham college for application to secular settings , and can be effectively applied in any consensus decision-making process discussion involves active listening and sharing information the facilitator ( '' clerk '' or '' convenor '' in the quaker model ) identifies areas of agreement and names disagreements to push discussion deeper the group as a whole is responsible for the decision and the decision belongs to the group key components of quaker-based consensus include a belief in a common humanity and the ability to decide together in the quaker model , as with other consensus decision-making processes , articulating the emerging consensus allows members to be clear on the decision in front of them the consensus decision-making process often has several roles designed to make the process run more effectively although the name and nature of these roles varies from group to group , the most common are the facilitator , consensor , a timekeeper , an empath and a secretary or notes taker some consensus groups use two co-facilitators shared facilitation is often adopted to diffuse the perceived power of the facilitator and create a system whereby a co-facilitator can pass off facilitation duties if he or she becomes more personally engaged in a debate consensus voting , in contrast , the modified borda count , mbc , can identify the consensus of any electorate , whenever such a consensus exists japanese companies normally use consensus decision-making , meaning that unanimous support on the board of directors is sought for any decision in the internet engineering task force ( ietf ) , decisions are assumed to be taken by rough consensus

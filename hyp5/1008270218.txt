characteristics of consensus decision-making include : collaboration : participants contribute to a shared proposal and shape it into a decision that meets the concerns of all group members as much as possible cooperation : participants in an effective consensus process should strive to reach the best possible decision for the group and all of its members , rather than competing for personal preferences egalitarianism : all members of a consensus decision-making body should be afforded , as much as possible , equal input into the process inclusion : as many stakeholders as possible should be involved in the consensus decision-making process participation : the consensus process should actively solicit the input and participation of all decision-makers consensus decision-making is an alternative to commonly practiced group decision-making processes consensus decision-making attempts to address the beliefs of such problems proponents claim that outcomes of the consensus process include : better decisions : through including the input of all stakeholders the resulting proposals may better address all potential concerns better implementation : a process that includes and respects all parties , and generates as much agreement as possible sets the stage for greater cooperation in implementing the resulting decisions to ensure the agreement or consent of all participants is valued , many groups choose unanimity or near-unanimity as their decision rule groups that require unanimity allow individual participants the option of blocking a group decision this provision motivates a group to make sure that all group members consent to any new proposal before it is adopted the ethics of consensus decision-making encourage participants to place the good of the whole group above their own individual preferences when there is potential for a block to a group decision , both the group and dissenters in the group are encouraged to collaborate until agreement can be reached simply vetoing a decision is not considered a responsible use of consensus blocking requiring the blocking party to supply an alternative proposal or a process for generating one limiting the option of blocking to decisions that are substantial to the mission or operation of the group and not allowing blocking on routine decisions '' if there are significant reservations about a motion , the decision-making body may choose to modify or re-word the proposal although stand asides do not halt a motion , it is often regarded as a strong '' nay vote '' and the concerns of group members standing aside are usually addressed by modifications to the proposal they received the reprieve of letting groups self-organize their protests , and as the city 's protest was subsequently divided into pie slices , each blockaded by an affinity group 's choice of protest every proposed option is accepted if the referees decide it is relevant and conforms with the un charter on human rights if its level of support surpasses a minimum consensus coefficient , it may be adopted groups that require unanimity commonly use a core set of procedures depicted in this flow chart the general direction of the group and potential proposals for action are often identified during the discussion call for consensus : the facilitator of the decision-making body calls for consensus on the proposal identification and addressing of concerns : if consensus is not achieved , each dissenter presents his or her concerns on the proposal , potentially starting another round of discussion to address or clarify the concern modification of the proposal : the proposal is amended , re-phrased or ridered in an attempt to address the concerns of the decision-makers the quaker model has been adapted by earlham college for application to secular settings , and can be effectively applied in any consensus decision-making process its process includes : multiple concerns and information are shared until the sense of the group is clear '' ensuring that group members speak only once until others are heard encourages a diversity of thought the facilitator is understood as serving the group rather than acting as person-in-charge in the quaker model , as with other consensus decision-making processes , articulating the emerging consensus allows members to be clear on the decision in front of them the consensus decision-making process often has several roles designed to make the process run more effectively the common roles in a consensus meeting are : facilitator : as the name implies , the role of the facilitator is to help make the process of reaching a consensus decision easier facilitators accept responsibility for moving through the agenda on time ; ensuring the group adheres to the mutually agreed-upon mechanics of the consensus process ; and , if necessary , suggesting alternate or additional discussion or decision-making techniques , such as go-arounds , break-out groups or role-playing for instance , red cards to indicate feedback on a breach in rules or decorum , yellow cards for clarifying questions , and green cards for desire to speak if the potential outcome of the fall-back method can be anticipated , then those who support that outcome have incentives to block consensus so that the fall-back method gets applied outside of western culture , multiple other cultures have used consensus decision-making japanese companies normally use consensus decision-making , meaning that unanimous support on the board of directors is sought for any decision '' one tradition in support of rough consensus is the tradition of humming rather than ( countable ) hand-raising ; this allows a group to quickly discern the prevalence of dissent , without making it easy to slip into majority rule the polish–lithuanian commonwealth of 1569–1795 used consensus decision-making in the form of liberum veto ( 'free veto ' ) in its sejms ( legislative assemblies )

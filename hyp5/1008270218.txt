characteristics of consensus decision-making include : collaboration : participants contribute to a shared proposal and shape it into a decision that meets the concerns of all group members as much as possible cooperation : participants in an effective consensus process should strive to reach the best possible decision for the group and all of its members , rather than competing for personal preferences egalitarianism : all members of a consensus decision-making body should be afforded , as much as possible , equal input into the process inclusion : as many stakeholders as possible should be involved in the consensus decision-making process participation : the consensus process should actively solicit the input and participation of all decision-makers . alternative to common decision-making practices consensus decision-making is an alternative to commonly practiced group decision-making processes proponents claim that outcomes of the consensus process include : better decisions : through including the input of all stakeholders the resulting proposals may better address all potential concerns consensus is not synonymous with '' unanimity '' & ndash ; though that may be a rule agreed to in a decision making process to ensure the agreement or consent of all participants is valued , many groups choose unanimity or near-unanimity as their decision rule groups that require unanimity allow individual participants the option of blocking a group decision this provision motivates a group to make sure that all group members consent to any new proposal before it is adopted proper guidelines for the use of this option , however , are important the ethics of consensus decision-making encourage participants to place the good of the whole group above their own individual preferences when there is potential for a block to a group decision , both the group and dissenters in the group are encouraged to collaborate until agreement can be reached in groups with a unanimity decision rule , a single block is sufficient to stop a proposal other decision rules may require more than one objection for a proposal to be blocked or not pass ( see previous section , in the case of an activist spokescouncil preparing for the washington a16 , 2000 , affinity groups disputed their spokescouncil 's imposition of nonviolence in their action guidelines many of the participants learned about the spokescouncil model on the fly by participating in it directly , and came to better understand their planned action by hearing others ' concerns and voicing their own the debate on the chosen problem is initiated by the facilitator calling for proposals if the debate fails to come to a verbal consensus , the referees draw up a final list of options - usually between 4 and 6 - to represent the debate typically , each decision arising from an agenda item follows through a simple structure : discussion of the item : the item is discussed with the goal of identifying opinions and information on the topic at hand the general direction of the group and potential proposals for action are often identified during the discussion formation of a proposal : based on the discussion a formal decision proposal on the issue is presented to the group call for consensus : the facilitator of the decision-making body calls for consensus on the proposal if it is , dissenters are asked to share their concerns with proceeding with the agreement , so that any potential harms can be addressed/minimized this can happen even if the consent threshold is unanimity , especially if many voters stand aside identification and addressing of concerns : if consensus is not achieved , each dissenter presents his or her concerns on the proposal , potentially starting another round of discussion to address or clarify the concern the process then returns to the call for consensus and the cycle is repeated until a satisfactory decision passes the consent threshold for the group the quaker model has been adapted by earlham college for application to secular settings , and can be effectively applied in any consensus decision-making process its process includes : multiple concerns and information are shared until the sense of the group is clear the facilitator ( '' clerk '' or '' convenor '' in the quaker model ) identifies areas of agreement and names disagreements to push discussion deeper the facilitator articulates the sense of the discussion , asks if there are other concerns , and proposes a '' minute '' of the decision ideally , all dissenters ' perspectives are synthesized into the final outcome for a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts in the quaker model , as with other consensus decision-making processes , articulating the emerging consensus allows members to be clear on the decision in front of them as members ' views are taken into account they are likely to support it the consensus decision-making process often has several roles designed to make the process run more effectively studies of effective consensus process usually indicate a shunning of unanimity or '' illusion of unanimity '' that does not hold up as a group comes under real-world pressure ( when dissent reappears ) consensus voting , in contrast , the modified borda count , mbc , can identify the consensus of any electorate , whenever such a consensus exists the ietf has studiously refrained from defining a mechanical method for verifying such consensus , apparently in the belief that any such codification leads to attempts to '' game the system the polish–lithuanian commonwealth of 1569–1795 used consensus decision-making in the form of liberum veto ( 'free veto ' ) in its sejms ( legislative assemblies )

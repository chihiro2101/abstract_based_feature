characteristics of consensus decision-making include : collaboration : participants contribute to a shared proposal and shape it into a decision that meets the concerns of all group members as much as possible cooperation : participants in an effective consensus process should strive to reach the best possible decision for the group and all of its members , rather than competing for personal preferences egalitarianism : all members of a consensus decision-making body should be afforded , as much as possible , equal input into the process all members have the opportunity to present , and amend proposals participation : the consensus process should actively solicit the input and participation of all decision-makers consensus decision-making is an alternative to commonly practiced group decision-making processes proponents claim that outcomes of the consensus process include : better decisions : through including the input of all stakeholders the resulting proposals may better address all potential concerns better group relationships : a cooperative , collaborative group atmosphere can foster greater group cohesion and interpersonal connection consensus is not synonymous with '' unanimity '' & ndash ; though that may be a rule agreed to in a decision making process to ensure the agreement or consent of all participants is valued , many groups choose unanimity or near-unanimity as their decision rule groups that require unanimity allow individual participants the option of blocking a group decision this provision motivates a group to make sure that all group members consent to any new proposal before it is adopted the ethics of consensus decision-making encourage participants to place the good of the whole group above their own individual preferences when there is potential for a block to a group decision , both the group and dissenters in the group are encouraged to collaborate until agreement can be reached some common guidelines for the use of consensus blocking include : providing an option for those who do not support a proposal to “ stand aside ” rather than block limiting each person 's option to block consensus to a handful of times in one 's life limiting the option of blocking to decisions that are substantial to the mission or operation of the group and not allowing blocking on routine decisions limiting the allowable rationale for blocking to issues that are fundamental to the group 's mission or potentially disastrous to the group some common options may include the ability to : declare reservations : group members who are willing to let a motion pass but desire to register their concerns with the group may choose '' declare reservations '' if there are significant reservations about a motion , the decision-making body may choose to modify or re-word the proposal stand aside : a '' stand aside '' may be registered by a group member who has a '' serious personal disagreement '' with a proposal , but is willing to let the motion pass object : any group member may '' object '' to a proposal while speaking rights might be limited to each group 's designee , the meeting may allot breakout time for the constituent groups to discuss an issue and return to the circle via their spokesperson if its level of support surpasses a minimum consensus coefficient , it may be adopted once an agenda for discussion has been set and , optionally , the ground rules for the meeting have been agreed upon , each item of the agenda is addressed in turn formation of a proposal : based on the discussion a formal decision proposal on the issue is presented to the group each member of the group usually must actively state whether they agree or consent , stand aside , or object , often by using a hand gesture or raising a colored card , to avoid the group warnock 's dilemma the number of objections is counted to determine if this step 's consent threshold is satisfied identification and addressing of concerns : if consensus is not achieved , each dissenter presents his or her concerns on the proposal , potentially starting another round of discussion to address or clarify the concern modification of the proposal : the proposal is amended , re-phrased or ridered in an attempt to address the concerns of the decision-makers quaker-based consensus is said to be effective because it puts in place a simple , time-tested structure that moves a group towards unity its process includes : multiple concerns and information are shared until the sense of the group is clear ideally , differences are resolved by discussion the group as a whole is responsible for the decision and the decision belongs to the group the facilitator can discern if one who is not uniting with the decision is acting without concern for the group or in selfish interest in the quaker model , as with other consensus decision-making processes , articulating the emerging consensus allows members to be clear on the decision in front of them the common roles in a consensus meeting are : facilitator : as the name implies , the role of the facilitator is to help make the process of reaching a consensus decision easier timekeeper : the purpose of the timekeeper is to ensure the decision-making body keeps to the schedule set in the agenda note taker : the role of the notes taker or secretary is to document the decisions , discussion and action points of the decision-making body they work well with groups of fewer than 250 people and especially with multi-lingual groups consensus voting , in contrast , the modified borda count , mbc , can identify the consensus of any electorate , whenever such a consensus exists

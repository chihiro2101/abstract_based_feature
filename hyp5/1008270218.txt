characteristics of consensus decision-making include : collaboration : participants contribute to a shared proposal and shape it into a decision that meets the concerns of all group members as much as possible cooperation : participants in an effective consensus process should strive to reach the best possible decision for the group and all of its members , rather than competing for personal preferences egalitarianism : all members of a consensus decision-making body should be afforded , as much as possible , equal input into the process inclusion : as many stakeholders as possible should be involved in the consensus decision-making process participation : the consensus process should actively solicit the input and participation of all decision-makers consensus decision-making is an alternative to commonly practiced group decision-making processes robert 's rules of order , for instance , is a guide book used by many organizations this book allows the structuring of debate and passage of proposals that can be approved through majority vote consensus decision-making attempts to address the beliefs of such problems better group relationships : a cooperative , collaborative group atmosphere can foster greater group cohesion and interpersonal connection consensus is not synonymous with '' unanimity '' & ndash ; though that may be a rule agreed to in a decision making process groups that require unanimity allow individual participants the option of blocking a group decision when there is potential for a block to a group decision , both the group and dissenters in the group are encouraged to collaborate until agreement can be reached some common guidelines for the use of consensus blocking include : providing an option for those who do not support a proposal to “ stand aside ” rather than block limiting each person 's option to block consensus to a handful of times in one 's life limiting the option of blocking to decisions that are substantial to the mission or operation of the group and not allowing blocking on routine decisions some common options may include the ability to : declare reservations : group members who are willing to let a motion pass but desire to register their concerns with the group may choose '' declare reservations stand asides may also be registered by users who feel they are incapable of adequately understanding or participating in the proposal in groups with a unanimity decision rule , a single block is sufficient to stop a proposal other decision rules may require more than one objection for a proposal to be blocked or not pass ( see previous section , many of the participants learned about the spokescouncil model on the fly by participating in it directly , and came to better understand their planned action by hearing others ' concerns and voicing their own the debate proceeds , with queries , comments , criticisms and/or even new options if the debate fails to come to a verbal consensus , the referees draw up a final list of options - usually between 4 and 6 - to represent the debate the general direction of the group and potential proposals for action are often identified during the discussion formation of a proposal : based on the discussion a formal decision proposal on the issue is presented to the group call for consensus : the facilitator of the decision-making body calls for consensus on the proposal each member of the group usually must actively state whether they agree or consent , stand aside , or object , often by using a hand gesture or raising a colored card , to avoid the group warnock 's dilemma the process then returns to the call for consensus and the cycle is repeated until a satisfactory decision passes the consent threshold for the group norms limit number of times one asks to speak to ensure that each speaker is fully heard the facilitator articulates the sense of the discussion , asks if there are other concerns , and proposes a '' minute '' of the decision should some dissenter 's perspective not harmonize with the others , that dissenter may '' stand aside '' to allow the group to proceed , or may opt to '' block '' key components of quaker-based consensus include a belief in a common humanity and the ability to decide together in the quaker model , as with other consensus decision-making processes , articulating the emerging consensus allows members to be clear on the decision in front of them the consensus decision-making process often has several roles designed to make the process run more effectively some decision-making bodies rotate these roles through the group members in order to build the experience and skills of the participants , and prevent any perceived concentration of power the common roles in a consensus meeting are : facilitator : as the name implies , the role of the facilitator is to help make the process of reaching a consensus decision easier some consensus decision-making bodies use a system of colored cards to indicate speaker priority they work well with groups of fewer than 250 people and especially with multi-lingual groups if the potential outcome of the fall-back method can be anticipated , then those who support that outcome have incentives to block consensus so that the fall-back method gets applied some advocates of consensus would assert that a majority decision reduces the commitment of each individual decision-maker to the decision japanese companies normally use consensus decision-making , meaning that unanimous support on the board of directors is sought for any decision

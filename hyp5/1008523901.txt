'' stadium '' is the latin form of the greek word '' stadion '' ( στάδιον ) , a measure of length equalling the length of 600 human feet the equivalent roman measure , the stadium , had a similar length & nbsp ; – about – but instead of being defined in feet was defined using the roman standard passus to be a distance of 125 passūs ( double-paces ) the english use of stadium comes from the tiered infrastructure surrounding a roman track of such length the oldest known stadium is the stadium at olympia in greece , where the ancient olympic games were held from 776 bc initially the games consisted of a single event , a sprint along the length of the stadium greek and roman stadiums have been found in numerous ancient cities , perhaps the most famous being the stadium of domitian , in rome the excavated and refurbished ancient panathenaic stadium hosted zappas olympics in 1870 the modern olympic games , a struggle for revival by david c the excavation and refurbishment of the stadium was part of the legacy of the greek national benefactor evangelos zappas , and it was the first ancient stadium to be used in modern times the first stadiums to be built in the modern era were basic facilities , designed for the single purpose of fitting as many spectators in as possible with tremendous growth in the popularity of organised sport in the late victorian era , especially association football in the united kingdom and baseball in the united states , the first such structures were built banned from locating sporting events at trinity college , dunlop built the stadium in 1872 '' some 300 cartloads of soil from a trench beneath the railway were used to raise the ground , allowing dunlop to use his engineering expertise to create a pitch envied around ireland other early stadiums from this period in the uk include the stamford bridge stadium ( opened in 1877 for the london athletic club ) and anfield ( 1884 as a venue for everton f.c , many professional baseball teams built baseball park wooden ballparks , with the first such venue being the south end grounds in boston , opened in 1871 for the team then known as the boston beaneaters ( now the atlanta braves ) goodison park was the first purpose-built association football stadium in the world upon its completion the stadium was the first joint purpose-built football stadium in the world the architect archibald leitch brought his experience with the construction of industrial buildings to bear on the design of functional stadiums up and down the country these early venues , originally designed to host football matches , were adopted for use by the olympic games , the first one being held in 1896 in athens , greece the white city stadium , built for the 1908 summer olympics in london is often cited as the first modern seater stadium , at least in the uk the stadium 's second incarnation featured the world 's first cantilevered second deck ( tier ) in a sports venue , and was the first baseball park to use steel and brick for the majority of its construction it was the world 's first stadium to use concrete-and-steel construction stadiums in ancient greece and rome were built for different purposes , and at first only the greeks built structures called '' stadium '' ; romans built structures called '' circus '' the greek stadium and theatre and the roman circus and amphitheatre are all ancestral to the modern stadium but , in the context of sports stadiums , the term '' dome '' has become standard for all covered stadiums , '' dome '' , merriam-webster particularly because the first such enclosed stadium , the houston astrodome , was built with an actual dome-shaped roof even though enclosed , dome stadiums are called stadiums because they are large enough for , and designed for , what are generally considered to be outdoor sports such as athletics , american football , association football , rugby , and baseball those designed for what are usually indoor sports like basketball , ice hockey and volleyball are generally called arenas however , that venue has a movable seating block that allows a configuration appropriate for indoor court sports rectangular stadiums are more common in europe , especially for football where many stadiums have four often distinct and very different stands on the four sides of the stadium the vastly differing character of european football stadiums has led to the growing hobby of ground hopping where spectators make a journey to visit the stadium for itself rather than for the event held there in north america , where baseball and american football are the two most popular outdoor spectator sports , a number of football/baseball multi-use stadiums were built , especially during the 1960s , and some of them were successful however , since the requirements for baseball and football are significantly different , the trend has been toward the construction of single-purpose stadiums , beginning with truman sports complex and accelerating in the 1990s poor stadium design has contributed to disasters , such as the hillsborough disaster and the heysel stadium disaster they require thousands of tons of materials to build , they greatly increase traffic in the area around the stadium , as well as maintaining the stadium in recent decades , to help take the burden of the massive expense of building and maintaining a stadium , many american and european sports teams have sold the rights to the name of the facility also , many newer european football stadiums , such as the university of bolton and emirates stadiums in england and westfalenstadion and allianz arena in germany have been corporately named

two species are accepted : grey parrot , congo grey parrot , african grey parrot or congo african grey parrot ( psittacus erithacus , previously psittacus erithacus erithacus ) : this is the nominate species , larger than the timneh at about long , with light-grey feathers , cherry-red tails , and an all-black beak immature birds of this species have tails with a darker , duller red towards the tip ( juniper and parr 1999 ) until their first moult , which occurs by 18 months of age these birds also initially have grey irises , which change to a pale yellow colour by the time the bird is a year old timneh parrot or timneh african grey parrot ( psittacus timneh , previously psittacus erithacus timneh ) : the timneh parrot is slightly smaller in size than the congo , but intelligence and talking ability remain comparable the timneh has a darker charcoal grey colouring , a darker maroon tail , and a light , horn-coloured area to part of the upper mandible the timneh parrot also has a reputation of being less nervous around strangers and novel situations than the congo , but whether this is true or not is still debated the grey parrot ( psittacus erithacus ) has been known at times to contract a non-infectious inflammatory lung disease called lipid pneumonia lipid pneumonia can be classified as exogenous or endogenous depending on whether or not the animal inhaled outside material the grey parrot is also one of the three parrots that scientists found to commonly suffer from dehydration another disease that the grey parrots get is cardiomyopathy which is a heart disease usually presented at a young age the grey parrot has been known to contract beak and feather disease virus ( bfdv ) which causes a highly contagious and sometimes fatal , psittacine beak and feather disease in parrots in a pcr-based study , chlamydiosis an infectious disease of avians was found to infect the grey parrot also acknowledged are claims of captive grey parrots reaching the ages of 73 and 93 , whereas the world parrot trust lists a longevity of 50–60 years for a grey in captivity unlike other parrots , wild greys have been documented imitating the calls of several other species according to pepperberg and other ornithologists , they perform many cognitive tasks at the level of dolphins , chimpanzees , and even human toddlers as well as labeling objects , alex could verbally express what his wants were , suggesting that grey parrots know the difference between features and feelings for example , in one experiment involving food hidden under cups , it was shown that greys can identify where the food is , usually if shown its original location at first pet greys may learn to speak within their first year , but many do n't say their first word until 12–18 months old grey parrots tend to use more specific calls for different species coming their way which can be known as stimulus specificity , since there is a stimulus vocalization the birds have one notable grey parrot is n'kisi , which in 2004 was said to have a vocabulary of over 950 words and , like pepperberg 's alex , was noted for creative use of language they were able to solve problems set by scientists & mdash ; for example , two birds could pull strings at the same time to obtain food the birds in question were observed waiting for their partners to perform the necessary actions so their behaviour could be synchronized in an experiment about local enhancement in grey parrots , food was visibly hidden under two separate cups instead of remembering which cup had the food , the birds would show preference to the one that was touched last wild grey parrots often whistle , click , or make other sounds studies in guinea and guinea-bissau have found that greys ' preferred species of nesting trees are also species preferred for timber the children 's book friendly feathers : life with pierre , an african grey parrot by fran smith , illustrated by deon matzen , is about a grey parrot in the book , sick as a parrot by liz evans , the parrot in the title is a grey parrot web comic matthew inman ; also known as '' the oatmeal '' , wrote a web comic about his pet grey parrot athan , mattie sue & deter , dianalee ( 2000 ) : the african grey parrot handbook birdlife international ( 2007b ) : grey parrot – birdlife species factsheet

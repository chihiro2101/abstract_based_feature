two species are accepted : grey parrot , congo grey parrot , african grey parrot or congo african grey parrot ( psittacus erithacus , previously psittacus erithacus erithacus ) : this is the nominate species , larger than the timneh at about long , with light-grey feathers , cherry-red tails , and an all-black beak immature birds of this species have tails with a darker , duller red towards the tip ( juniper and parr 1999 ) until their first moult , which occurs by 18 months of age these birds also initially have grey irises , which change to a pale yellow colour by the time the bird is a year old timneh parrot or timneh african grey parrot ( psittacus timneh , previously psittacus erithacus timneh ) : the timneh parrot is slightly smaller in size than the congo , but intelligence and talking ability remain comparable the timneh has a darker charcoal grey colouring , a darker maroon tail , and a light , horn-coloured area to part of the upper mandible the timneh parrot also has a reputation of being less nervous around strangers and novel situations than the congo , but whether this is true or not is still debated in 2012 , birdlife international gave the timneh parrot full species status and it was classified as vulnerable lipid pneumonia can be classified as exogenous or endogenous depending on whether or not the animal inhaled outside material a necropsy shows that the lungs of a grey parrot with endogenous lipid pneumonia ( enlp ) are firm with a diffuse grey discoloration the grey parrot is also one of the three parrots that scientists found to commonly suffer from dehydration another disease that the grey parrots get is cardiomyopathy which is a heart disease usually presented at a young age in a pcr-based study , chlamydiosis an infectious disease of avians was found to infect the grey parrot thirty-two ( 12.6 % ) samples were positive for chlamydi and two new genotypes were discovered : chlamydophila psittaci and chlamydophila abortus birds between 2–15 years of age contract it centers around a lack of calcium grey parrots are monogamy breeders which nests in tree cavities also acknowledged are claims of captive grey parrots reaching the ages of 73 and 93 , whereas the world parrot trust lists a longevity of 50–60 years for a grey in captivity the guinness book of world records listed a grey parrot that allegedly lived in captivity for 72 years as the longest-lived specimen for the species unlike other parrots , wild greys have been documented imitating the calls of several other species for example , in one experiment involving food hidden under cups , it was shown that greys can identify where the food is , usually if shown its original location at first both subspecies seem to have the same ability and tendency to produce human speech , but vocal ability and proclivity may range widely among individual birds one notable grey parrot is n'kisi , which in 2004 was said to have a vocabulary of over 950 words and , like pepperberg 's alex , was noted for creative use of language in an experiment about local enhancement in grey parrots , food was visibly hidden under two separate cups for the most part , grey parrots performed more successfully if the cup was shaken horizontally before it is given the choice of selecting which contained food , however , further experimentation indicated that it is not a requirement and proved that grey parrots have very high cognitive abilities a grey 's owner should expect to hear regular renditions of microwave ovens , telephones , alarm clocks , video games , and other electronic sounds , as well as dripping water , wild birds , and any other sound often heard by the parrot grey parrots use different alarm calls for different predators coming their way in an experiment to test the vocalizations of grey parrots , four bred in captivity were placed in an aviary in the united states , importation of wild-caught grey parrots is prohibited under the us wild bird conservation act of 1992 the children 's book friendly feathers : life with pierre , an african grey parrot by fran smith , illustrated by deon matzen , is about a grey parrot in thomas bernhard 's play immanuel kant , the philosopher praises his psittacus eritacus without end , saying only he understands his logic mercedes lackey 's short stories '' grey '' and '' grey 's ghost '' feature a grey parrot that has a remarkable bond with her owner the iucn red list of threatened species : psittacus erithacus ( retrieved 6 july 2011 ) birdlife international ( 2007a ) : 2006–2007 red list status changes

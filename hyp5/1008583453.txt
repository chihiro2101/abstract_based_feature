) autolysis , the breaking down of tissues by the body 's own internal chemicals and enzymes , and 2 prime decomposers are bacteria or fungi , though larger scavengers also play an important role in decomposition if the body is accessible to insects , acari and other animals five general stages are used to describe the process of decomposition in vertebrate animals : fresh , bloat , active decay , advanced decay , and dry/remains the general stages of decomposition are coupled with two stages of chemical decomposition : autolysis and putrefaction these two stages contribute to the chemical process of decomposition , which breaks down the main components of the body with death the microbiome of the living organism collapses and is followed by the necrobiome that undergoes predictable changes over time from the moment of death , the body begins cooling or warming to match the temperature of the ambient environment , during a stage called algor mortis shortly after death , within three to six hours , the muscular tissues become rigid and incapable of relaxing , during a stage called rigor mortis since blood is no longer being pumped through the body , gravity causes it to drain to the dependent portions of the body , creating an overall bluish-purple discolouration termed livor mortis or , more commonly , lividity the small amount of oxygen remaining in the body is quickly depleted by cellular metabolism and aerobic organism naturally present in respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts , creating an ideal environment for the proliferation of anaerobic organisms these multiply , consuming the body 's carbohydrates , lipids , and proteins , to produce a variety of substances including propionic acid , lactic acid , methane , hydrogen sulfide , and ammonia the process of microbial proliferation within a body is referred to as putrefaction and leads to the second stage of decomposition , known as bloat in this stage , anaerobic metabolism takes place , leading to the accumulation of gases , such as hydrogen sulfide , carbon dioxide , methane , and nitrogen the buildup of pressure combined with the loss of integrity of the skin may also cause the body to rupture the associated gases which accumulate within the body at this time aid in the transport of sulfhemoglobin throughout the body via the circulatory and lymphatic systems , giving the body an overall marbled appearance if insects have access , maggots hatch and begin to feed on the body 's tissues maggot feeding , and the accumulation of gases within the body , eventually leads to post-mortem skin ruptures which will then further allow purging of gases and fluids into the surrounding environment this loss occurs as a result of both the voracious feeding of maggots and the purging of decomposition fluids into the surrounding environment liquefaction of tissues and disintegration become apparent during this time and strong odors persist decomposition is largely inhibited during advanced decay due to the loss of readily available cadaveric material all that remains of the cadaver at this stage is dry skin , cartilage , and bones , which will become dry and bleached if exposed to the elements a dead body that has been exposed to the open elements , such as water and air , will decompose more quickly and attract much more insect activity than a body that is buried or confined in special protective gear or artifacts colder temperatures decrease the rate of decomposition while warmer temperatures increase it moisture helps the growth of microorganisms that decompose the organic matter , but too much moisture could lead to anaerobic conditions slowing down the decomposition process the bodies of newborns who never ingested food are an important exception to the normal process of decomposition bodies submerged in a peat bog may become naturally '' embalmed '' , arresting decomposition and resulting in a preserved specimen known as a bog body decomposition of plant matter occurs in many stages the decomposition of food , either plant or animal , called spoilage in this context , is an important field of study within food science the higher the water content of a soil , the lower the oxygen content and consequently , the lower the rate of decomposition the quality and quantity of the material available to decomposers is another major factor that influences the rate of decomposition microbial cell walls also contain recalcitrant materials like chitin , and these also accumulate as the microbes die , further reducing the quality of older soil organic matter .

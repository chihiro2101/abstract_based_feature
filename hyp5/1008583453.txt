these processes release compounds such as cadaverine and putrescine , that are the chief source of the unmistakably putrid odor of decaying animal tissue prime decomposers are bacteria or fungi , though larger scavengers also play an important role in decomposition if the body is accessible to insects , acari and other animals some of these scavengers also remove and scatter bones , which they ingest at a later time five general stages are used to describe the process of decomposition in vertebrate animals : fresh , bloat , active decay , advanced decay , and dry/remains the general stages of decomposition are coupled with two stages of chemical decomposition : autolysis and putrefaction these two stages contribute to the chemical process of decomposition , which breaks down the main components of the body with death the microbiome of the living organism collapses and is followed by the necrobiome that undergoes predictable changes over time from the moment of death , the body begins cooling or warming to match the temperature of the ambient environment , during a stage called algor mortis once the heart stops , the blood can no longer supply oxygen or remove carbon dioxide from the tissues visible changes caused by decomposition are limited during the fresh stage , although autolysis may cause blisters to appear at the surface of the skin the small amount of oxygen remaining in the body is quickly depleted by cellular metabolism and aerobic organism naturally present in respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts , creating an ideal environment for the proliferation of anaerobic organisms in this stage , anaerobic metabolism takes place , leading to the accumulation of gases , such as hydrogen sulfide , carbon dioxide , methane , and nitrogen the buildup of pressure combined with the loss of integrity of the skin may also cause the body to rupture the associated gases which accumulate within the body at this time aid in the transport of sulfhemoglobin throughout the body via the circulatory and lymphatic systems , giving the body an overall marbled appearance ruptures in the skin allow oxygen to re-enter the body and provide more surface area for the development of fly larvae and the activity of aerobic microorganisms the purged fluids accumulate around the body and create a cadaver decomposition island ( cdi ) the cdi surrounding the carcass will display an increase in soil carbon and nutrients , such as phosphorus , potassium , calcium , and magnesium ; changes in ph ; and a significant increase in soil nitrogen all that remains of the cadaver at this stage is dry skin , cartilage , and bones , which will become dry and bleached if exposed to the elements if all soft tissue is removed from the cadaver , it is referred to as completely skeletonized , but if only portions of the bones are exposed , it is referred to as partially skeletonised the rate and manner of decomposition in an animal body are strongly affected by several factors moisture helps the growth of microorganisms that decompose the organic matter , but too much moisture could lead to anaerobic conditions slowing down the decomposition process under certain conditions ( normally cool , damp soil ) , bodies may undergo saponification and develop a waxy substance called adipocere , caused by the action of soil chemicals on the body 's proteins and fats the formation of adipocere slows decomposition by inhibiting the bacteria that cause putrefaction they lack the internal microbial flora that produces much of decomposition and quite commonly mummifies if kept in even moderately dry conditions living organisms that use oxygen to survive feed on the body this process of putrefaction has a bad odor accompanied by it due to the hydrogen sulfide and organic matter containing sulfur embalmers typically pay great attention to parts of the body seen by mourners , such as the face and hands in sufficiently dry environments , an embalmed body may end up mummy and it is not uncommon for bodies to remain preserved to a viewable extent after decades wood decomposition is a complex process involving fungi which transport nutrients to the nutritionally scarce wood from outside environment soil disturbance like tillage increases decomposition by increasing the amount of oxygen in the soil and by exposing new organic matter to soil microbes microbial cell walls also contain recalcitrant materials like chitin , and these also accumulate as the microbes die , further reducing the quality of older soil organic matter .

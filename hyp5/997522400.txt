like vhs , the s-vhs format uses a color under modulation scheme the often quoted horizontal resolution of '' over 400 '' means s-vhs captures greater picture detail than even ntsc analog cable and broadcast tv , which is limited to about 330 television lines ( tvl ) poor color resolution was a deficiency shared by s-vhs 's contemporaries , such as hi8 and ed-beta â€“ all of which were limited to 0.4 & nbsp ; megahertz or 30 & nbsp ; tvl resolution some professional s-vhs decks can record a pulse-code modulation ( pcm ) digital audio track ( stereo 48 & nbsp ; khz ) , along with the normal video and hi-fi stereo and mono analog audio as an added bonus , due to the increased bandwidth of s-vhs , teletext data ( pal ) signals can be recorded along with the normal video signal s-vhs video cassette recorders ( vcrs ) and cassette tapes are nearly identical in appearance and operation , and backward compatible with vhs older vhs vcrs can not play back s-vhs recordings at all , but can record onto an s-vhs tape in the basic vhs format this feature is useful for viewing s-vhs camcorder recordings which used either the full-size s-vhs videotape cassette or the smaller vhs-c videotape cassette later model s-vhs vcrs offered a recording option called s-vhs et , which allowed svhs vcrs to record on vhs tape s-vhs et recordings can be viewed on most sqpb-equipped vhs vcrs and s-vhs vcrs to get the most benefit from s-vhs , a direct video connection to the monitor or tv is required , ideally via an s-video connectors and/or s-video enabled scart , for the best recordings and playback , an s-vhs vcr requires s-vhs video tape cassettes s-vhs video cassettes are sensed and identified by the video cassette recorder via a specific internal profile within a hole in the underside of the s-vhs video cassette body for most of these stations , while the u-matics that they had been using were being phased out , but digital video was still years away , s-vhs was used to record from the composite setups that were still in place for u-matic production s-vhs was jvc 's next generation video format designed to dominate the competing superbetamax format ( which already offered better-than-vhs quality ) professional s-vhs decks did offer digital pcm audio , a feature not matched by ed-beta decks in 1991 , alesis introduced adat , an eight-track digital audio recording system that used s-vhs cassettes

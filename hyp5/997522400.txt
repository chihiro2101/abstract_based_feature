the often quoted horizontal resolution of '' over 400 '' means s-vhs captures greater picture detail than even ntsc analog cable and broadcast tv , which is limited to about 330 television lines ( tvl ) in practice , when time shifting tv programs on s-vhs equipment , the improvement over vhs is quite noticeable poor color resolution was a deficiency shared by s-vhs 's contemporaries , such as hi8 and ed-beta â€“ all of which were limited to 0.4 & nbsp ; megahertz or 30 & nbsp ; tvl resolution some professional s-vhs decks can record a pulse-code modulation ( pcm ) digital audio track ( stereo 48 & nbsp ; khz ) , along with the normal video and hi-fi stereo and mono analog audio as an added bonus , due to the increased bandwidth of s-vhs , teletext data ( pal ) signals can be recorded along with the normal video signal older vhs vcrs can not play back s-vhs recordings at all , but can record onto an s-vhs tape in the basic vhs format this feature is useful for viewing s-vhs camcorder recordings which used either the full-size s-vhs videotape cassette or the smaller vhs-c videotape cassette later model s-vhs vcrs offered a recording option called s-vhs et , which allowed svhs vcrs to record on vhs tape s-vhs et is a further modification of the vhs standards that permitted near s-vhs quality recordings on more common and less expensive basic vhs tapes s-vhs et recordings can be viewed on most sqpb-equipped vhs vcrs and s-vhs vcrs , for the best recordings and playback , an s-vhs vcr requires s-vhs video tape cassettes s-vhs video cassettes are sensed and identified by the video cassette recorder via a specific internal profile within a hole in the underside of the s-vhs video cassette body videophiles were the first to theorize that since the only distinguishing feature of an s-vhs tape is a small 3 & nbsp ; mm hole on the underside of the video cassette , it should be possible to use more common and inexpensive vhs tapes by duplicating that hole s-vhs tapes are compatible with vhs vcrs , but an svhs recording will not playback properly combination dvd/vcr units rarely offered s-vhs format standard , only vhs nevertheless , viewing an s-vhs recording through a vcr 's built-in rf modulator yields a discernible quality improvement over vhs in 1991 , alesis introduced adat , an eight-track digital audio recording system that used s-vhs cassettes

like vhs , the s-vhs format uses a color under modulation scheme in practice , when time shifting tv programs on s-vhs equipment , the improvement over vhs is quite noticeable regarding audio recording , s-vhs retains vhs 's conventional linear ( baseband ) and high fidelity ( hi-fi ) â€“ audio frequency modulation ( afm ) soundtracks some professional s-vhs decks can record a pulse-code modulation ( pcm ) digital audio track ( stereo 48 & nbsp ; khz ) , along with the normal video and hi-fi stereo and mono analog audio s-vhs video cassette recorders ( vcrs ) and cassette tapes are nearly identical in appearance and operation , and backward compatible with vhs older vhs vcrs can not play back s-vhs recordings at all , but can record onto an s-vhs tape in the basic vhs format sqpb lets basic vhs players view ( but not record ) s-vhs recordings , though reduced to the lesser vhs quality this feature is useful for viewing s-vhs camcorder recordings which used either the full-size s-vhs videotape cassette or the smaller vhs-c videotape cassette later model s-vhs vcrs offered a recording option called s-vhs et , which allowed svhs vcrs to record on vhs tape s-vhs et is a further modification of the vhs standards that permitted near s-vhs quality recordings on more common and less expensive basic vhs tapes s-vhs et recordings can be viewed on most sqpb-equipped vhs vcrs and s-vhs vcrs to get the most benefit from s-vhs , a direct video connection to the monitor or tv is required , ideally via an s-video connectors and/or s-video enabled scart , for the best recordings and playback , an s-vhs vcr requires s-vhs video tape cassettes s-vhs video cassettes are sensed and identified by the video cassette recorder via a specific internal profile within a hole in the underside of the s-vhs video cassette body s-vhs tapes are compatible with vhs vcrs , but an svhs recording will not playback properly in 1991 , alesis introduced adat , an eight-track digital audio recording system that used s-vhs cassettes these used s-vhs cassettes for 8-track and 24-track digital audio recording , at a significantly lower cost than their dash reel-to-reel digital recorders

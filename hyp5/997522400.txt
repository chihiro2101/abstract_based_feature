like vhs , the s-vhs format uses a color under modulation scheme in practice , when time shifting tv programs on s-vhs equipment , the improvement over vhs is quite noticeable this is because s-vhs does not improve other key aspects of the video signal , particularly the chrominance ( chroma ) signal regarding audio recording , s-vhs retains vhs 's conventional linear ( baseband ) and high fidelity ( hi-fi ) â€“ audio frequency modulation ( afm ) soundtracks as an added bonus , due to the increased bandwidth of s-vhs , teletext data ( pal ) signals can be recorded along with the normal video signal s-vhs video cassette recorders ( vcrs ) and cassette tapes are nearly identical in appearance and operation , and backward compatible with vhs older vhs vcrs can not play back s-vhs recordings at all , but can record onto an s-vhs tape in the basic vhs format newer vhs vcrs , depending upon their specification , offered a feature called s-vhs quasi-playback or super quasi-play back , abbreviated to sqpb sqpb lets basic vhs players view ( but not record ) s-vhs recordings , though reduced to the lesser vhs quality s-vhs et is a further modification of the vhs standards that permitted near s-vhs quality recordings on more common and less expensive basic vhs tapes s-vhs et recordings can be viewed on most sqpb-equipped vhs vcrs and s-vhs vcrs , for the best recordings and playback , an s-vhs vcr requires s-vhs video tape cassettes s-vhs tapes are compatible with vhs vcrs , but an svhs recording will not playback properly the largest vcr manufacturers , such as matsushita ( panasonic ) and mitsubishi , gradually moved to dvd recorders , and hard-disk based digital video recorders ( dvrs ) ( vhs decks continued to outsell s-vhs decks until the end of the vcr product life cycle nevertheless , viewing an s-vhs recording through a vcr 's built-in rf modulator yields a discernible quality improvement over vhs in 1991 , alesis introduced adat , an eight-track digital audio recording system that used s-vhs cassettes

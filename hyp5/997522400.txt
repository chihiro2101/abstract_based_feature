in practice , when time shifting tv programs on s-vhs equipment , the improvement over vhs is quite noticeable poor color resolution was a deficiency shared by s-vhs 's contemporaries , such as hi8 and ed-beta – all of which were limited to 0.4 & nbsp ; megahertz or 30 & nbsp ; tvl resolution regarding audio recording , s-vhs retains vhs 's conventional linear ( baseband ) and high fidelity ( hi-fi ) – audio frequency modulation ( afm ) soundtracks s-vhs video cassette recorders ( vcrs ) and cassette tapes are nearly identical in appearance and operation , and backward compatible with vhs older vhs vcrs can not play back s-vhs recordings at all , but can record onto an s-vhs tape in the basic vhs format newer vhs vcrs , depending upon their specification , offered a feature called s-vhs quasi-playback or super quasi-play back , abbreviated to sqpb sqpb lets basic vhs players view ( but not record ) s-vhs recordings , though reduced to the lesser vhs quality later model s-vhs vcrs offered a recording option called s-vhs et , which allowed svhs vcrs to record on vhs tape s-vhs et is a further modification of the vhs standards that permitted near s-vhs quality recordings on more common and less expensive basic vhs tapes to get the most benefit from s-vhs , a direct video connection to the monitor or tv is required , ideally via an s-video connectors and/or s-video enabled scart , for the best recordings and playback , an s-vhs vcr requires s-vhs video tape cassettes s-vhs video cassettes are sensed and identified by the video cassette recorder via a specific internal profile within a hole in the underside of the s-vhs video cassette body videophiles were the first to theorize that since the only distinguishing feature of an s-vhs tape is a small 3 & nbsp ; mm hole on the underside of the video cassette , it should be possible to use more common and inexpensive vhs tapes by duplicating that hole however , s-vhs cassettes also contain a higher grade and coercivity of tape stock to effectively record the higher video bandwidth offered by s-vhs s-vhs tapes are compatible with vhs vcrs , but an svhs recording will not playback properly combination dvd/vcr units rarely offered s-vhs format standard , only vhs nevertheless , viewing an s-vhs recording through a vcr 's built-in rf modulator yields a discernible quality improvement over vhs

like vhs , the s-vhs format uses a color under modulation scheme in practice , when time shifting tv programs on s-vhs equipment , the improvement over vhs is quite noticeable as an added bonus , due to the increased bandwidth of s-vhs , teletext data ( pal ) signals can be recorded along with the normal video signal older vhs vcrs can not play back s-vhs recordings at all , but can record onto an s-vhs tape in the basic vhs format newer vhs vcrs , depending upon their specification , offered a feature called s-vhs quasi-playback or super quasi-play back , abbreviated to sqpb sqpb lets basic vhs players view ( but not record ) s-vhs recordings , though reduced to the lesser vhs quality this feature is useful for viewing s-vhs camcorder recordings which used either the full-size s-vhs videotape cassette or the smaller vhs-c videotape cassette later model s-vhs vcrs offered a recording option called s-vhs et , which allowed svhs vcrs to record on vhs tape s-vhs et is a further modification of the vhs standards that permitted near s-vhs quality recordings on more common and less expensive basic vhs tapes s-vhs et recordings can be viewed on most sqpb-equipped vhs vcrs and s-vhs vcrs , for the best recordings and playback , an s-vhs vcr requires s-vhs video tape cassettes videophiles were the first to theorize that since the only distinguishing feature of an s-vhs tape is a small 3 & nbsp ; mm hole on the underside of the video cassette , it should be possible to use more common and inexpensive vhs tapes by duplicating that hole however , s-vhs cassettes also contain a higher grade and coercivity of tape stock to effectively record the higher video bandwidth offered by s-vhs s-vhs tapes are compatible with vhs vcrs , but an svhs recording will not playback properly despite its designation as the logical successor to vhs , s-vhs did not come close to replacing vhs nevertheless , viewing an s-vhs recording through a vcr 's built-in rf modulator yields a discernible quality improvement over vhs in 1991 , alesis introduced adat , an eight-track digital audio recording system that used s-vhs cassettes

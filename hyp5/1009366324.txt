staurakios was born in the early 790sad , probably between 791 and 793 , to nikephoros i and an unknown woman , often referred to as prokopia due to confusion with her daughter , prokopia nikephoros was logothetēs tou genikou ( finance minister ) at the time of staurakios birth , before he revolted against byzantine empress irene in 802 ad , and seized the throne for himself ; staurakios was around 10–12 years old at this time staurakios was not given an official government position upon his father 's accession to the throne , but , in the summer of 803 , bardanes tourkos revolted against nikephoros in the anatolic theme ; although his revolt was put down by early september , it convinced nikephoros to consolidate his hold on the throne by declaring staurakios co-emperor and heir , which he did on 25 december 803 theophano of athens was selected , likely due to the fact that she was a kinswoman of irene , and therefore would help add legitimacy to both nikephoros and staurakios rule after his marriage , staurakios is not mentioned again until 811 , when nikephoros prepared his invasion of the bulgarian khanate in may of that year the severity of staurakios wounds led to speculation as to whether he would live , although eventually they judged he would make the best candidate , as the legitimate successor , and declared him emperor almost immediately after staurakios ascended the throne , michael was pressured to usurp it , due to the legitimacy granted to him by his marriage to staurakios ' sister , prokopia , and his military abilities after hearing of the two options staurakios was considering , patriarch nikephoros i aligned himself with stephanos , theoktistos , and michael on 1 september 811 , staurakios summoned stephanos , whom he trusted completely , likely because stephanos was the first to proclaim staurakios emperor , to propose blinding michael ; staurakios was unaware that michael had the support of stephanos himself staurakios also sent a letter of protest to patriarch nikephoros for his role in the coup d ’ état ; nikephoros answered in person , writing alongside michael and prokopia , and assured staurakios that he had not betrayed him , but rather protected him although many historians believe that both nikephoros i and staurakios have been falsely portrayed as malevolent , few other sources exist for their reign

staurakios was born in the early 790sad , probably between 791 and 793 , to nikephoros i and an unknown woman , often referred to as prokopia due to confusion with her daughter , prokopia nikephoros was logothetēs tou genikou ( finance minister ) at the time of staurakios birth , before he revolted against byzantine empress irene in 802 ad , and seized the throne for himself ; staurakios was around 10–12 years old at this time staurakios was not given an official government position upon his father 's accession to the throne , but , in the summer of 803 , bardanes tourkos revolted against nikephoros in the anatolic theme ; although his revolt was put down by early september , it convinced nikephoros to consolidate his hold on the throne by declaring staurakios co-emperor and heir , which he did on 25 december 803 by doing so , nikephoros removed any question of the imperial succession and increased his own legitimacy—although staurakios , now somewhere between the ages of 11 and 13 , was not yet old enough to actually exercise power after staurakios elevation to co-emperor , he is not mentioned again in the sources until 807 , when nikephoros decided that staurakios needed to marry , and thus held an imperial bride show to select a wife on 20 december 807 theophano of athens was selected , likely due to the fact that she was a kinswoman of irene , and therefore would help add legitimacy to both nikephoros and staurakios rule this battle , known as the battle of pliska , resulted in a bulgarian massacre of the byzantine forces the severity of staurakios wounds led to speculation as to whether he would live , although eventually they judged he would make the best candidate , as the legitimate successor , and declared him emperor staurakios gave a speech to the surviving troops , where he insulted nikephoros military judgment , before being acclaimed by the army 28 july 811 this decision united the chief leaders and officials of the byzantine empire behind michael , as they did not desire to return to the uncertainty which had pervaded irene 's rule , due to her ruling despite being a woman on 1 september 811 , staurakios summoned stephanos , whom he trusted completely , likely because stephanos was the first to proclaim staurakios emperor , to propose blinding michael ; staurakios was unaware that michael had the support of stephanos himself

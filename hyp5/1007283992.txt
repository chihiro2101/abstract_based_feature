compressed air cars are powered by motors driven by compressed air , which is stored in a tank at high pressure such as 31 mpa ( 4500 psi or 310 bar ) rather than driving engine pistons with an ignited fuel-air mixture , compressed air cars use the expansion of compressed air , in a similar manner to the expansion of steam in a steam engine there have been prototype cars since the 1920s , with compressed air used in torpedo propulsion in compressed air vehicles , tank designs tend to be isothermal ; a heat exchanger of some kind is used to maintain the temperature ( and pressure ) of the tank as the air is extracted compressed air has relatively low energy density the energy density of a compressed air system can be more than doubled if the air is heated prior to expansion since a compressed air car 's source of energy is usually electricity , its total environmental impact depends on how clean the source of this electricity is however , most air cars have petrol engines for different tasks as with gasoline , service stations would have to install the necessary air facilities if such cars became sufficiently popular to warrant it compressed air engines reduce the cost of vehicle production , because there is no need to build a cooling system , spark plugs , starter motor , or mufflers therefore , the vehicle may be left unused for longer periods of time than electric cars expansion of the compressed air lowers its temperature ; this may be exploited for use as air conditioning for combustion engine cars , the energy is lost when chemical energy in fossil fuels is converted by the engine to mechanical energy for compressed-air cars , the power plant 's electricity is transmitted to a compressor , which mechanically compresses the air into the car 's tank the car 's engine then converts the compressed air to mechanical energy additional concerns : when air expands in the engine it cools dramatically and must be heated to ambient temperature using a heat exchanger removing the humidity completely requires additional energy that can not be reused and is lost if the stored air is not cooled while the tank is being filled , then when the air cools off later , its pressure decreases and the available energy decreases the overall efficiency of a vehicle using compressed air energy storage , using the above refueling figures , is around 5-7 % peugeot and citroÃ«n announced that they intended to build a car that uses compressed air as an energy source however , the car they are designing uses a hybrid system which also uses a gasoline engine ( which is used for propelling the car over 70 & nbsp ; km/h , or when the compressed air tank has been depleted ) air engine charging station compressed air energy storage compressed air battery compressed air vehicles engine swap plug-in hybrid pneumatics

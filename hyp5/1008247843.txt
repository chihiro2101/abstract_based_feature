according to damasio , sentience is a minimalistic way of defining consciousness , which otherwise commonly and collectively describes sentience plus further features of the mind and consciousness , such as creativity , intelligence , sapience , self-awareness , and intentionality ( the ability to have thoughts about something ) these further features of consciousness may not be necessary for sentience , which rests on the capacity to feel sensations and emotions while it has been traditionally assumed that sentience and sapience are , in principle , independent of each other , there are criticisms of that assumption one such criticism is about recognition paradoxes , one example of which is that an entity that can not distinguish a spider from a non-spider can not be arachnophobia more generally , it is argued that since it is not possible to attach an emotional response to stimuli that can not be recognized , emotions can not exist independently of cognition that can recognize it is shown that both brain size and brain-wide connectivity contribute to make perception more discriminating , as predicted by the theory of a brain-wide perception system but not by the theory of separate systems for emotion and cognition '' they do not deny that most other aspects of consciousness are subject to scientific investigation but they argue that qualia will never be explained accordingly , only organisms that possess these substrates , all within the animal kingdom , are said to be conscious sponges , placozoans , and mesozoans , with simple body plans and no nervous system , are the only members of the animal kingdom that possess no consciousness eastern religions including hinduism , buddhism , sikhism , and jainism recognise non-humans as sentient beings in jainism many things are endowed with a soul , jÄ«va , which is sometimes translated as 'sentience' he asserts that , '' all sentient beings , humans or nonhuman , have one right : the basic right not to be treated as the property of others the interfaith association of animal chaplains encourages animal ministry groups to adopt a policy of recognising and valuing sentient beings it was proposed as a measure for the sentience of all living beings and computers from a single neuron up to a hypothetical being at the theoretical computational limit of the entire universe quote : '' granted , these animals do not have all the desires we humans have ; granted , they do not comprehend everything we humans comprehend ; nevertheless , we and they do have some of the same desires and do comprehend some of the same things

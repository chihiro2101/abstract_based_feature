according to damasio , sentience is a minimalistic way of defining consciousness , which otherwise commonly and collectively describes sentience plus further features of the mind and consciousness , such as creativity , intelligence , sapience , self-awareness , and intentionality ( the ability to have thoughts about something ) these further features of consciousness may not be necessary for sentience , which rests on the capacity to feel sensations and emotions one such criticism is about recognition paradoxes , one example of which is that an entity that can not distinguish a spider from a non-spider can not be arachnophobia more generally , it is argued that since it is not possible to attach an emotional response to stimuli that can not be recognized , emotions can not exist independently of cognition that can recognize data losses inherent in all information transfer from more precise systems to less precise systems are also argued to make it impossible for any imprecise system to use a more precise system as an '' emissary '' , as a less precise system would not be able to tell whether the outdata from the more precise system was in the interest of the less precise system or not some philosophers , notably colin mcginn , believe that the physical process causing consciousness to happen will never be understood , a position known as '' new mysterianism regarding animal consciousness , according to the animal consciousness , which was publicly proclaimed on 7 july 2012 at the cambridge university , consciousness is that which requires specialized nervous system , chiefly neuroanatomical , neurochemical , and neurophysiological substrates , which manifests in more complex organisms as the central nervous system , to exhibit consciousness eastern religions including hinduism , buddhism , sikhism , and jainism recognise non-humans as sentient beings the term sentient beings is translated from various sanskrit terms ( jantu , bahu jana , jagat , sattva ) and '' conventionally refers to the mass of living things subject to illusion , suffering , and rebirth ( saṃsāra ) '' in jainism many things are endowed with a soul , jīva , which is sometimes translated as 'sentience' some in the animal rights movement contend that the ability to experience pleasure and pain implies sentience the documentary earthlings argues that while animals do not have all the desires and ability to comprehend as do humans , they do share the desires for food and water , shelter and companionship , freedom of movement and avoidance of pain it was proposed as a measure for the sentience of all living beings and computers from a single neuron up to a hypothetical being at the theoretical computational limit of the entire universe convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical , neurochemical , and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors ( original 1983 ) copyright david cole university of minnesota , duluth science , policy and cultural implications of animal sentience , suggested reading , compassion in world farming

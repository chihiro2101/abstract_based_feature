according to damasio , sentience is a minimalistic way of defining consciousness , which otherwise commonly and collectively describes sentience plus further features of the mind and consciousness , such as creativity , intelligence , sapience , self-awareness , and intentionality ( the ability to have thoughts about something ) these further features of consciousness may not be necessary for sentience , which rests on the capacity to feel sensations and emotions while it has been traditionally assumed that sentience and sapience are , in principle , independent of each other , there are criticisms of that assumption one such criticism is about recognition paradoxes , one example of which is that an entity that can not distinguish a spider from a non-spider can not be arachnophobia more generally , it is argued that since it is not possible to attach an emotional response to stimuli that can not be recognized , emotions can not exist independently of cognition that can recognize data losses inherent in all information transfer from more precise systems to less precise systems are also argued to make it impossible for any imprecise system to use a more precise system as an '' emissary '' , as a less precise system would not be able to tell whether the outdata from the more precise system was in the interest of the less precise system or not it is shown that both brain size and brain-wide connectivity contribute to make perception more discriminating , as predicted by the theory of a brain-wide perception system but not by the theory of separate systems for emotion and cognition according to thomas nagel in his paper what is it like to be a bat ? , consciousness can refer to the ability of any entity to have subjective perceptual experiences , or as some philosophers refer to them , '' qualia '' —in other words , the ability to have states that it feels like something to be in regarding animal consciousness , according to the animal consciousness , which was publicly proclaimed on 7 july 2012 at the cambridge university , consciousness is that which requires specialized nervous system , chiefly neuroanatomical , neurochemical , and neurophysiological substrates , which manifests in more complex organisms as the central nervous system , to exhibit consciousness sponges , placozoans , and mesozoans , with simple body plans and no nervous system , are the only members of the animal kingdom that possess no consciousness the term sentient beings is translated from various sanskrit terms ( jantu , bahu jana , jagat , sattva ) and '' conventionally refers to the mass of living things subject to illusion , suffering , and rebirth ( saṃsāra ) '' kyoto : eastern buddhist society ; cited in dumoulin , henrich ( author ) ; heisig , james ( translator ) ; and knitter , paul ( translator ) ( 2005 ) some in the animal rights movement contend that the ability to experience pleasure and pain implies sentience convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical , neurochemical , and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors sugunasiri is founder of nalanda college of buddhist studies , toronto , canada jeremy bentham - introduction to the principles of morals and legislation book about a theory of sentience readership : philosophers , psychologists , and neuroscientists interested in sensation and perception

according to damasio , sentience is a minimalistic way of defining consciousness , which otherwise commonly and collectively describes sentience plus further features of the mind and consciousness , such as creativity , intelligence , sapience , self-awareness , and intentionality ( the ability to have thoughts about something ) these further features of consciousness may not be necessary for sentience , which rests on the capacity to feel sensations and emotions while it has been traditionally assumed that sentience and sapience are , in principle , independent of each other , there are criticisms of that assumption more generally , it is argued that since it is not possible to attach an emotional response to stimuli that can not be recognized , emotions can not exist independently of cognition that can recognize the original studies by ivan pavlov that showed that conditioned reflexes in human children are more discriminating than those in dogs , human children salivating only at ticking frequencies very close to those at which food was served while dogs drool at a wider range of frequencies , have been followed up in recent years with comparative studies on more species it is shown that both brain size and brain-wide connectivity contribute to make perception more discriminating , as predicted by the theory of a brain-wide perception system but not by the theory of separate systems for emotion and cognition according to thomas nagel in his paper what is it like to be a bat ? , consciousness can refer to the ability of any entity to have subjective perceptual experiences , or as some philosophers refer to them , '' qualia '' â€”in other words , the ability to have states that it feels like something to be in some philosophers , notably colin mcginn , believe that the physical process causing consciousness to happen will never be understood , a position known as '' new mysterianism regarding animal consciousness , according to the animal consciousness , which was publicly proclaimed on 7 july 2012 at the cambridge university , consciousness is that which requires specialized nervous system , chiefly neuroanatomical , neurochemical , and neurophysiological substrates , which manifests in more complex organisms as the central nervous system , to exhibit consciousness eastern religions including hinduism , buddhism , sikhism , and jainism recognise non-humans as sentient beings water , for example , is a sentient being of the first order , as it is considered to possess only one sense , that of touch some in the animal rights movement contend that the ability to experience pleasure and pain implies sentience the documentary earthlings argues that while animals do not have all the desires and ability to comprehend as do humans , they do share the desires for food and water , shelter and companionship , freedom of movement and avoidance of pain the interfaith association of animal chaplains encourages animal ministry groups to adopt a policy of recognising and valuing sentient beings non-human animals , including all mammals and birds , and many other creatures , including octopuses , also possess these neurological substrates

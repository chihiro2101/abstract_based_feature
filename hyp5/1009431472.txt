john burgoyne was born in sutton , bedfordshire , location of the burgoyne baronets family home sutton manor , on 24 february 1722 his mother , anna maria burgoyne , was the daughter of a wealthy hackney merchant his father was supposedly an army officer , captain john burgoyne , although there were rumours that he might be the illegitimate son of lord bingley , who was his godparent from the age of 10 , burgoyne attended the prestigious westminster school , as did many british army officers of the time such as thomas gage with whom burgoyne would later serve burgoyne was athletic and outgoing and enjoyed life at the school where he made numerous important friends , in particular lord james strange in 1741 burgoyne sold his commission , possibly to settle gambling debts the outbreak of the war of the austrian succession led to an expansion in the size of the british army through his friendship with lord strange , burgoyne came to know strange 's sister , lady charlotte stanley , the daughter of lord derby , one of britain 's leading politicians unable to support his wife otherwise , burgoyne again sold his commission , raising £2,600 , which they lived off for the next few years in october 1751 , burgoyne and his new wife went to live in continental europe travelling through france and italy while in france , burgoyne met and befriended the duc de choiseul who would later become the foreign minister and directed france in the seven years war in late 1754 , burgoyne 's wife gave birth to a daughter , charlotte elizabeth , who was to prove to be the couple 's only child burgoyne soon became a favourite of derby , who used his influence to boost burgoyne 's prospects burgoyne admired independent thought amongst common soldiers , and encouraged his men to use their own initiative , in stark contrast to the established system employed at the time by the british army on the outbreak of the american war , he was appointed to a command , and arrived in boston in may 1775 , a few weeks after the first shots of the war had been fired he led forces under general guy carleton in the drive that chased the continental army from the province of quebec carleton then led the british forces onto lake champlain , but was , in burgoyne 's opinion , insufficiently bold when he failed to attempt the capture of fort ticonderoga after winning the naval battle of valcour island in october on 17 october 1777 , burgoyne surrendered his entire army , numbering 5,800 rather than an outright unconditional surrender , burgoyne had agreed to a convention that involved his men surrendering their weapons , and returning to europe with a pledge not to return to north america although burgoyne at the time was widely held to blame for the defeat , historians have over the years shifted responsibility for the disaster at saratoga to lord germain , the secretary of state for the colonies had it not been for his role in the american war of independence , burgoyne would most likely be foremost remembered today as a dramatist the british campaign of 1777 , volume two – the burgoyne expedition : burgoyne 's native and loyalist auxiliaries , global heritage press , milton , 2013

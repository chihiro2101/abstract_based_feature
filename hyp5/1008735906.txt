removed from its burrow , the fully grown teredo ranges from several centimetres to about a metre in length , depending on the species the two siphons are very long and protrude from the posterior end of the animal where they leave the end of the main part of the body , the siphons pass between a pair of calcareous plates called pallets the pallets are not to be confused with the two valves of the main shell , which are at the anterior end of the animal because they are the organs that the animal applies to boring its tunnel , they generally are located at the tunnel 's end they are borne on the slightly thickened , muscular anterior end of the cylindrical body and they are roughly triangular in shape and markedly concave on their interior surfaces the outer surfaces are convex and in most species are deeply sculpted into sharp grinding surfaces with which the animals bore their way through the wood or similar medium in which they live and feed climate change has also changed the range of species ; some once found only in warmer and more salty waters like the caribbean have established habitats in the mediterranean the longest marine bivalve , kuphus polythalamia , was found from a lagoon near mindanao island in the southeastern part of the philippines , which belongs to the same group of mussels and clams shipworms are marine animals in the phylum mollusca , order bivalvia , family teredinidae shipworm species comprise several genus , of which teredo is the most commonly mentioned historically , teredo concentrations in the caribbean sea have been substantially higher than in most other salt water bodies copper sheathing was used on wooden ships in the latter 18th century and afterwards , as a method of preventing damage by '' teredo worms '' '' in the netherlands the shipworm caused a crisis in the 18th century by attacking the timber that faced the sea dikes

first , euler pointed out that the choice of route inside each land mass is irrelevant this allowed him to reformulate the problem in abstract terms ( laying the foundations of graph theory ) , eliminating all features except the list of land masses and the bridges connecting them → → since only the connection information is relevant , the shape of pictorial representations of a graph may be distorted in any way , without changing the graph itself for example , it does not matter whether the edges drawn are straight or curved , or whether one node is to the left or right of another next , euler observed that ( except at the endpoints of the walk ) , whenever one enters a vertex by a bridge , one leaves the vertex by a bridge however , all four of the land masses in the original problem are touched by an odd number of bridges ( one is touched by 5 bridges , and each of the other three is touched by 3 ) euler 's argument shows that a necessary condition for the walk of the desired form is that the graph be connected and have exactly zero or two nodes of odd degree an alternative form of the problem asks for a path that traverses all bridges and also has the same starting and ending point in the history of mathematics , euler 's solution of the königsberg bridge problem is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory and the first true proof in the theory of networks , a subject now generally regarded as a branch of combinatorics two of the seven original bridges did not survive the bombing of königsberg in world war ii the three other bridges remain , although only two of them are from euler 's time ( one was rebuilt in 1935 )

first , euler pointed out that the choice of route inside each land mass is irrelevant this allowed him to reformulate the problem in abstract terms ( laying the foundations of graph theory ) , eliminating all features except the list of land masses and the bridges connecting them in modern terms , one replaces each land mass with an abstract '' vertex '' or node , and each bridge with an abstract connection , an '' edge '' , which only serves to record which pair of vertices ( land masses ) is connected by that bridge next , euler observed that ( except at the endpoints of the walk ) , whenever one enters a vertex by a bridge , one leaves the vertex by a bridge however , all four of the land masses in the original problem are touched by an odd number of bridges ( one is touched by 5 bridges , and each of the other three is touched by 3 ) euler 's argument shows that a necessary condition for the walk of the desired form is that the graph be connected and have exactly zero or two nodes of odd degree since the graph corresponding to historical königsberg has four nodes of odd degree , it can not have an eulerian path in addition , euler 's recognition that the key information was the number of bridges and the list of their endpoints ( rather than their exact positions ) presaged the development of topology the three other bridges remain , although only two of them are from euler 's time ( one was rebuilt in 1935 ) thus , , five bridges exist at the same sites that were involved in euler 's problem kaliningrad and the konigsberg bridge problem at convergence euler 's original publication ( in latin ) the bridges of königsberg how the bridges of königsberg help to understand the brain euler 's königsberg 's bridges problem at math dept

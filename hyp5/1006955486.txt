this allowed him to reformulate the problem in abstract terms ( laying the foundations of graph theory ) , eliminating all features except the list of land masses and the bridges connecting them in modern terms , one replaces each land mass with an abstract '' vertex '' or node , and each bridge with an abstract connection , an '' edge '' , which only serves to record which pair of vertices ( land masses ) is connected by that bridge → → since only the connection information is relevant , the shape of pictorial representations of a graph may be distorted in any way , without changing the graph itself next , euler observed that ( except at the endpoints of the walk ) , whenever one enters a vertex by a bridge , one leaves the vertex by a bridge however , all four of the land masses in the original problem are touched by an odd number of bridges ( one is touched by 5 bridges , and each of the other three is touched by 3 ) in modern language , euler shows that the possibility of a walk through a graph , traversing each edge exactly once , depends on the degrees of the nodes euler 's argument shows that a necessary condition for the walk of the desired form is that the graph be connected and have exactly zero or two nodes of odd degree since the graph corresponding to historical königsberg has four nodes of odd degree , it can not have an eulerian path in the history of mathematics , euler 's solution of the königsberg bridge problem is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory and the first true proof in the theory of networks , a subject now generally regarded as a branch of combinatorics eulerian path five room puzzle glossary of graph theory hamiltonian path icosian game water , gas , and electricity kaliningrad and the konigsberg bridge problem at convergence euler 's original publication ( in latin ) the bridges of königsberg how the bridges of königsberg help to understand the brain euler 's königsberg 's bridges problem at math dept

a tunnel is relatively long and narrow ; the length is often much greater than twice the diameter , although similar shorter excavations can be constructed , such as cross passages between tunnels for example , the definition of a road tunnel in the united kingdom is defined as '' a subsurface highway structure enclosed for a length of or more '' in the united states , the nfpa definition of a tunnel is '' an underground structure with a design length greater than and a diameter greater than where it is important to stress that it is passing underneath , it may be called an underpass , though the official term when passing under a railway is an underbridge a longer underpass containing a road , canal or railway is normally called a '' tunnel '' , whether or not it passes under another item of infrastructure an underpass of any length under a river is also usually called a '' tunnel '' , whatever mode of transport it is for much of the early technology of tunneling evolved from mining and military engineering the etymology of the terms '' mining '' ( for mineral extraction or for siege attacks ) , '' military engineering '' , and '' civil engineering '' reveals these deep historic connections predecessors of modern tunnels were adits to transport water for irrigation or drinking , and sewerage the tunnel of eupalinos is a tunnel aqueduct long running through mount kastro in samos , greece , built in the 6th century bc to serve as an aqueduct it is the second known tunnel to have been excavated from both ends , after the siloam tunnel in the neighbourhood of silwan in eastern jerusalem in ethiopia , the siqurto foot tunnel , hand-hewn in the middle ages , crosses a mountain ridge a major tunnel project must start with a comprehensive investigation of ground conditions by collecting samples from boreholes and by other geophysical techniques an informed choice can then be made of machinery and methods for excavation and ground support , which will reduce the risk of encountering unforeseen ground conditions it is common practice to locate a tunnel deeper than otherwise would be required , in order to excavate through solid rock or other material that is easier to support during construction to give more information , a pilot tunnel ( or '' drift tunnel '' ) may be driven ahead of the main excavation alternatively , horizontal boreholes may sometimes be drilled ahead of the advancing tunnel face other key geotechnical factors : stand-up time is the amount of time a newly excavated cavity can support itself without any added structures groundwater control is very important in tunnel construction water leaking into a tunnel or vertical shaft will greatly decrease stand-up time , causing the excavation to become unstable and risking collapse this freezes the ground around each pipe until the whole space is surrounded with frozen soil , keeping water out until a permanent structure can be built for water crossings , a tunnel is generally more costly to construct than a bridge some water crossings are a mixture of bridges and tunnels , such as the oresund bridge and the chesapeake bay bridge-tunnel in virginia one of the worst railway disasters ever , the balvano train disaster , was caused by a train stalling in the armi tunnel in italy in 1944 , killing 426 passengers designers try to reduce these risks by installing emergency ventilation systems or isolated emergency escape tunnels parallel to the main passage government funds are often required for the creation of tunnels the project duration must be identified using a work breakdown structure ( wbs ) and critical path method ( cpm ) tunnels are dug in types of materials varying from soft clay to hard rock the method of tunnel construction depends on such factors as the ground conditions , the groundwater conditions , the length and diameter of the tunnel drive , the depth of the tunnel , the logistics of supporting the tunnel excavation , the final use and the shape of the tunnel and appropriate risk management there are three basic types of tunnel construction in common use cut-and-cover tunnels are constructed in a shallow trench and then covered over two basic forms of cut-and-cover tunneling are available : bottom-up method : a trench is excavated , with ground support as necessary , and the tunnel is constructed in it the tunnel may be of in situ concrete , precast concrete , precast arches , or corrugated steel arches ; in early days brickwork was used top-down method : side support walls and capping beams are constructed from ground level by such methods as slurry walling or contiguous bored piling only a shallow excavation is needed to construct the tunnel roof using precast beams or in situ concrete sitting on the walls shallow tunnels are often of the cut-and-cover type ( if under water , of the immersed-tube type ) , while deep tunnels are excavated , often using a tunnelling shield tunnel boring machines ( tbms ) and associated back-up systems are used to highly automate the entire tunnelling process , reducing tunnelling costs this requires special precautions , such as local ground treatment or halting the tbm at a position free from water a temporary access shaft is sometimes necessary during the excavation of a tunnel they are usually circular and go straight down until they reach the level at which the tunnel is going to be built the dahuofang water tunnel in china , opened in 2009 , is the third longest water tunnel in the world at length the chicago tunnel company is the largest urban street tunnel network , comprising of tunnels beneath the majority of downtown chicago streets the fenghuoshan tunnel , completed in 2005 on the qinghai-tibet railway is the world 's highest railway tunnel , about above sea level and long excavation techniques , as well as the construction of underground bunkers and other habitable areas , are often associated with tunnel warfare , or civilian responses to threat of attack natural tunnel state park ( virginia , us ) features an natural tunnel , really a limestone cave , that has been used as a railroad tunnel since 1890 clayton tunnel rail crash ( 1861 ) – confusion about block signals welwyn tunnel rail crash ( 1866 ) – train failed in tunnel , guard did not protect train

a tunnel is relatively long and narrow ; the length is often much greater than twice the diameter , although similar shorter excavations can be constructed , such as cross passages between tunnels for example , the definition of a road tunnel in the united kingdom is defined as '' a subsurface highway structure enclosed for a length of or more '' in the united states , the nfpa definition of a tunnel is '' an underground structure with a design length greater than and a diameter greater than a longer underpass containing a road , canal or railway is normally called a '' tunnel '' , whether or not it passes under another item of infrastructure an underpass of any length under a river is also usually called a '' tunnel '' , whatever mode of transport it is for in the us , the term '' subway '' means an underground rapid transit system , and the term pedestrian underpass is used for a passage beneath a barrier predecessors of modern tunnels were adits to transport water for irrigation or drinking , and sewerage the tunnel of eupalinos is a tunnel aqueduct long running through mount kastro in samos , greece , built in the 6th century bc to serve as an aqueduct it is the second known tunnel to have been excavated from both ends , after the siloam tunnel in the neighbourhood of silwan in eastern jerusalem in ethiopia , the siqurto foot tunnel , hand-hewn in the middle ages , crosses a mountain ridge a major tunnel project must start with a comprehensive investigation of ground conditions by collecting samples from boreholes and by other geophysical techniques an informed choice can then be made of machinery and methods for excavation and ground support , which will reduce the risk of encountering unforeseen ground conditions to give more information , a pilot tunnel ( or '' drift tunnel '' ) may be driven ahead of the main excavation knowing this parameter allows the engineers to determine how far an excavation can proceed before support is needed , which in turn affects the speed , efficiency , and cost of construction water leaking into a tunnel or vertical shaft will greatly decrease stand-up time , causing the excavation to become unstable and risking collapse the most common way to control groundwater is to install dewatering pipes into the ground and to simply pump the water out tunnel cross-sectional shape is also very important in determining stand-up time bridges usually require a larger footprint on each shore than tunnels boston 's big dig project replaced elevated roadways with a tunnel system to increase traffic capacity , hide traffic , reclaim land , redecorate , and reunite the city with the waterfront the 1934 queensway tunnel under the river mersey at liverpool was chosen over a massively high bridge for defense reasons ; it was feared that aircraft could destroy a bridge in times of war maintenance costs of a massive bridge to allow the world 's largest ships to navigate under were considered higher than for a tunnel there are particular hazards with tunnels , especially from vehicle fires when combustion gases can asphyxiate users , as happened at the gotthard road tunnel in switzerland in 2001 the project duration must be identified using a work breakdown structure ( wbs ) and critical path method ( cpm ) large infrastructure projects require millions or even billions of dollars , involving long-term financing , usually through issuance of bonds political disputes can occur , as in 2005 when the us house of representatives approved a 100 million federal grant to build a tunnel under new york harbor the method of tunnel construction depends on such factors as the ground conditions , the groundwater conditions , the length and diameter of the tunnel drive , the depth of the tunnel , the logistics of supporting the tunnel excavation , the final use and the shape of the tunnel and appropriate risk management there are three basic types of tunnel construction in common use bored tunnels are constructed in situ , without removing the ground above finally , a tube can be sunk into a body of water , which is called an immersed tunnel only a shallow excavation is needed to construct the tunnel roof using precast beams or in situ concrete sitting on the walls shallow tunnels are often of the cut-and-cover type ( if under water , of the immersed-tube type ) , while deep tunnels are excavated , often using a tunnelling shield large cut-and-cover boxes are often used for underground metro stations , such as canary wharf tube station in london this contrasts with many traditional stations on london underground , where bored tunnels were used for stations and passenger access a temporary access shaft is sometimes necessary during the excavation of a tunnel a shaft normally has concrete walls and is usually built to be permanent if a tunnel is going to be long , multiple shafts at various locations may be bored so that entrance to the tunnel is closer to the unexcavated area once construction is complete , construction access shafts are often used as ventilation shafts , and may also be used as emergency exits the new austrian tunnelling method ( natm ) —also referred to as the sequential excavation method ( sem ) —was developed in the 1960s the excavation is protected by a layer of sprayed concrete , commonly referred to as shotcrete the measured rock properties lead to appropriate tools for tunnel strengthening box jacking is similar to pipe jacking , but instead of jacking tubes , a box-shaped tunnel is used the lötschberg base tunnel in switzerland was the longest land rail tunnel , with a length of , from its inauguration in 2007 until the completion of the gotthard base tunnel in 2016 the longest canal tunnel is the rove tunnel in france , over long the tunnel and reservoir plan is a network of of drainage tunnels designed to reduce flooding in the chicago area secret passage have given entrance to or escape from an area , such as the cu chi tunnels or the gaza strip smuggling tunnels which connect it to egypt clayton tunnel rail crash ( 1861 ) – confusion about block signals welwyn tunnel rail crash ( 1866 ) – train failed in tunnel , guard did not protect train

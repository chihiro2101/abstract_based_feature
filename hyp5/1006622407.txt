a tunnel is relatively long and narrow ; the length is often much greater than twice the diameter , although similar shorter excavations can be constructed , such as cross passages between tunnels the definition of what constitutes a tunnel can vary widely from source to source for example , the definition of a road tunnel in the united kingdom is defined as '' a subsurface highway structure enclosed for a length of or more '' in the united states , the nfpa definition of a tunnel is '' an underground structure with a design length greater than and a diameter greater than the place where a road , railway , canal or watercourse passes under a footpath , cycleway , or another road or railway is most commonly called a bridge or , if passing under a canal , an aqueduct where it is important to stress that it is passing underneath , it may be called an underpass , though the official term when passing under a railway is an underbridge an underpass of any length under a river is also usually called a '' tunnel '' , whatever mode of transport it is for in the us , the term '' subway '' means an underground rapid transit system , and the term pedestrian underpass is used for a passage beneath a barrier rail station platforms may be connected by pedestrian tunnels or footbridges the etymology of the terms '' mining '' ( for mineral extraction or for siege attacks ) , '' military engineering '' , and '' civil engineering '' reveals these deep historic connections predecessors of modern tunnels were adits to transport water for irrigation or drinking , and sewerage it is the second known tunnel to have been excavated from both ends , after the siloam tunnel in the neighbourhood of silwan in eastern jerusalem in ethiopia , the siqurto foot tunnel , hand-hewn in the middle ages , crosses a mountain ridge a major tunnel project must start with a comprehensive investigation of ground conditions by collecting samples from boreholes and by other geophysical techniques in planning the route , the horizontal and vertical alignments can be selected to make use of the best ground and water conditions it is common practice to locate a tunnel deeper than otherwise would be required , in order to excavate through solid rock or other material that is easier to support during construction to give more information , a pilot tunnel ( or '' drift tunnel '' ) may be driven ahead of the main excavation water leaking into a tunnel or vertical shaft will greatly decrease stand-up time , causing the excavation to become unstable and risking collapse tunnel cross-sectional shape is also very important in determining stand-up time however , navigational considerations may limit the use of high bridges or drawbridge spans intersecting with shipping channels , necessitating a tunnel in areas with expensive real estate , such as manhattan and urban hong kong , this is a strong factor in favor of a tunnel boston 's big dig project replaced elevated roadways with a tunnel system to increase traffic capacity , hide traffic , reclaim land , redecorate , and reunite the city with the waterfront the 1934 queensway tunnel under the river mersey at liverpool was chosen over a massively high bridge for defense reasons ; it was feared that aircraft could destroy a bridge in times of war maintenance costs of a massive bridge to allow the world 's largest ships to navigate under were considered higher than for a tunnel in hampton roads , virginia , tunnels were chosen over bridges for strategic considerations ; in the event of damage , bridges might prevent us navy vessels from leaving naval station norfolk there are particular hazards with tunnels , especially from vehicle fires when combustion gases can asphyxiate users , as happened at the gotthard road tunnel in switzerland in 2001 when a tunnel is being planned or constructed , economics and politics play a large factor in the decision making process civil engineers usually use project management techniques for developing a major structure political disputes can occur , as in 2005 when the us house of representatives approved a 100 million federal grant to build a tunnel under new york harbor the method of tunnel construction depends on such factors as the ground conditions , the groundwater conditions , the length and diameter of the tunnel drive , the depth of the tunnel , the logistics of supporting the tunnel excavation , the final use and the shape of the tunnel and appropriate risk management bored tunnels are constructed in situ , without removing the ground above the tunnel may be of in situ concrete , precast concrete , precast arches , or corrugated steel arches ; in early days brickwork was used the surface is then reinstated except for access openings shallow tunnels are often of the cut-and-cover type ( if under water , of the immersed-tube type ) , while deep tunnels are excavated , often using a tunnelling shield this contrasts with many traditional stations on london underground , where bored tunnels were used for stations and passenger access nevertheless , the original parts of the london underground network , the metropolitan and district railways , were constructed using cut-and-cover these lines pre-dated electric traction and the proximity to the surface was useful to ventilate the inevitable smoke and steam this , and the availability of electric traction , brought about london underground 's switch to bored tunnels at a deeper level towards the end of the 19th century tunnel boring machines ( tbms ) and associated back-up systems are used to highly automate the entire tunnelling process , reducing tunnelling costs submerged floating tunnels are a novel approach under consideration ; however , no such tunnels have been constructed to date the dahuofang water tunnel in china , opened in 2009 , is the third longest water tunnel in the world at length the zhongnanshan tunnel in people 's republic of china opened in january 2007 is the world 's second longest highway tunnel and the longest mountain road tunnel in asia , at both tunnels handle around 150,000 vehicles a day , making them two of the most trafficked tunnels in the world it crosses beneath a mountain at above sea level with six traffic lanes , and it has a parallel emergency tunnel secret passage have given entrance to or escape from an area , such as the cu chi tunnels or the gaza strip smuggling tunnels which connect it to egypt secret tunnels have also been used by thieves to break into bank vaults and retail stores after hours

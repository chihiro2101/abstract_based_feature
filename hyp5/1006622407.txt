a tunnel is relatively long and narrow ; the length is often much greater than twice the diameter , although similar shorter excavations can be constructed , such as cross passages between tunnels for example , the definition of a road tunnel in the united kingdom is defined as '' a subsurface highway structure enclosed for a length of or more '' in the united states , the nfpa definition of a tunnel is '' an underground structure with a design length greater than and a diameter greater than the place where a road , railway , canal or watercourse passes under a footpath , cycleway , or another road or railway is most commonly called a bridge or , if passing under a canal , an aqueduct where it is important to stress that it is passing underneath , it may be called an underpass , though the official term when passing under a railway is an underbridge a longer underpass containing a road , canal or railway is normally called a '' tunnel '' , whether or not it passes under another item of infrastructure an underpass of any length under a river is also usually called a '' tunnel '' , whatever mode of transport it is for the tunnel of eupalinos is a tunnel aqueduct long running through mount kastro in samos , greece , built in the 6th century bc to serve as an aqueduct it is the second known tunnel to have been excavated from both ends , after the siloam tunnel in the neighbourhood of silwan in eastern jerusalem an informed choice can then be made of machinery and methods for excavation and ground support , which will reduce the risk of encountering unforeseen ground conditions to give more information , a pilot tunnel ( or '' drift tunnel '' ) may be driven ahead of the main excavation alternatively , horizontal boreholes may sometimes be drilled ahead of the advancing tunnel face knowing this parameter allows the engineers to determine how far an excavation can proceed before support is needed , which in turn affects the speed , efficiency , and cost of construction if a tunnel excavation is wider than it is high , it will have a harder time supporting itself , decreasing its stand-up time for water crossings , a tunnel is generally more costly to construct than a bridge however , navigational considerations may limit the use of high bridges or drawbridge spans intersecting with shipping channels , necessitating a tunnel maintenance costs of a massive bridge to allow the world 's largest ships to navigate under were considered higher than for a tunnel some water crossings are a mixture of bridges and tunnels , such as the oresund bridge and the chesapeake bay bridge-tunnel in virginia there are particular hazards with tunnels , especially from vehicle fires when combustion gases can asphyxiate users , as happened at the gotthard road tunnel in switzerland in 2001 designers try to reduce these risks by installing emergency ventilation systems or isolated emergency escape tunnels parallel to the main passage the project duration must be identified using a work breakdown structure ( wbs ) and critical path method ( cpm ) political disputes can occur , as in 2005 when the us house of representatives approved a 100 million federal grant to build a tunnel under new york harbor tunnels are dug in types of materials varying from soft clay to hard rock there are three basic types of tunnel construction in common use the surface is then reinstated except for access openings excavation then takes place under the permanent tunnel roof , and the base slab is constructed shallow tunnels are often of the cut-and-cover type ( if under water , of the immersed-tube type ) , while deep tunnels are excavated , often using a tunnelling shield this contrasts with many traditional stations on london underground , where bored tunnels were used for stations and passenger access these lines pre-dated electric traction and the proximity to the surface was useful to ventilate the inevitable smoke and steam tunnel boring machines ( tbms ) and associated back-up systems are used to highly automate the entire tunnelling process , reducing tunnelling costs in certain predominantly urban applications , tunnel boring is viewed as a quick and cost-effective alternative to laying surface rails and roads expensive eminent domain of buildings and land , with potentially lengthy planning inquiries , is eliminated disadvantages of tbms arise from their usually large size – the difficulty of transporting the large tbm to the site of tunnel construction , or ( alternatively ) the high cost of assembling the tbm on-site , often within the confines of the tunnel being constructed there are a variety of tbm designs that can operate in a variety of conditions , from hard rock to soft water-bearing ground some types of tbms , the bentonite slurry , and earth-pressure balance machines have pressurized compartments at the front end , allowing them to be used in difficult conditions below the water table a larger tbm was built to bore the green heart tunnel ( dutch : tunnel groene hart ) as part of the hsl-zuid in the netherlands , with a diameter of unlike previous manual methods of using mattocks which relied on the soil structure to be hard , clay-kicking was relatively silent and hence did not harm soft clay-based structures used in victorian civil engineering , the method found favor in the renewal of britain 's ancient sewerage systems , by not having to remove all property or infrastructure to create a small tunnel system it is long , and was the longest tunnel in the world until 1982 the lötschberg base tunnel in switzerland was the longest land rail tunnel , with a length of , from its inauguration in 2007 until the completion of the gotthard base tunnel in 2016 both tunnels handle around 150,000 vehicles a day , making them two of the most trafficked tunnels in the world the stormwater management and road tunnel or smart tunnel , is a combined storm drainage and road structure opened in 2007 in kuala lumpur , malaysia secret passage have given entrance to or escape from an area , such as the cu chi tunnels or the gaza strip smuggling tunnels which connect it to egypt secret tunnels have also been used by thieves to break into bank vaults and retail stores after hours natural tunnel state park ( virginia , us ) features an natural tunnel , really a limestone cave , that has been used as a railroad tunnel since 1890 balvano train disaster ( 1944 ) caldecott tunnel fire ( 1982 ) – major motor vehicle tunnel crash and fire

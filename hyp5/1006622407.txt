a tunnel is relatively long and narrow ; the length is often much greater than twice the diameter , although similar shorter excavations can be constructed , such as cross passages between tunnels the definition of what constitutes a tunnel can vary widely from source to source for example , the definition of a road tunnel in the united kingdom is defined as '' a subsurface highway structure enclosed for a length of or more '' in the united states , the nfpa definition of a tunnel is '' an underground structure with a design length greater than and a diameter greater than where it is important to stress that it is passing underneath , it may be called an underpass , though the official term when passing under a railway is an underbridge a longer underpass containing a road , canal or railway is normally called a '' tunnel '' , whether or not it passes under another item of infrastructure an underpass of any length under a river is also usually called a '' tunnel '' , whatever mode of transport it is for the tunnel of eupalinos is a tunnel aqueduct long running through mount kastro in samos , greece , built in the 6th century bc to serve as an aqueduct it is the second known tunnel to have been excavated from both ends , after the siloam tunnel in the neighbourhood of silwan in eastern jerusalem in ethiopia , the siqurto foot tunnel , hand-hewn in the middle ages , crosses a mountain ridge a major tunnel project must start with a comprehensive investigation of ground conditions by collecting samples from boreholes and by other geophysical techniques in planning the route , the horizontal and vertical alignments can be selected to make use of the best ground and water conditions to give more information , a pilot tunnel ( or '' drift tunnel '' ) may be driven ahead of the main excavation this smaller tunnel is less likely to collapse catastrophically should unexpected conditions be met , and it can be incorporated into the final tunnel or used as a backup or emergency escape passage alternatively , horizontal boreholes may sometimes be drilled ahead of the advancing tunnel face other key geotechnical factors : stand-up time is the amount of time a newly excavated cavity can support itself without any added structures generally , certain configurations of rock and clay will have the greatest stand-up time , while sand and fine soils will have a much lower stand-up time water leaking into a tunnel or vertical shaft will greatly decrease stand-up time , causing the excavation to become unstable and risking collapse this freezes the ground around each pipe until the whole space is surrounded with frozen soil , keeping water out until a permanent structure can be built tunnel cross-sectional shape is also very important in determining stand-up time for water crossings , a tunnel is generally more costly to construct than a bridge however , navigational considerations may limit the use of high bridges or drawbridge spans intersecting with shipping channels , necessitating a tunnel bridges usually require a larger footprint on each shore than tunnels boston 's big dig project replaced elevated roadways with a tunnel system to increase traffic capacity , hide traffic , reclaim land , redecorate , and reunite the city with the waterfront the 1934 queensway tunnel under the river mersey at liverpool was chosen over a massively high bridge for defense reasons ; it was feared that aircraft could destroy a bridge in times of war maintenance costs of a massive bridge to allow the world 's largest ships to navigate under were considered higher than for a tunnel some water crossings are a mixture of bridges and tunnels , such as the oresund bridge and the chesapeake bay bridge-tunnel in virginia there are particular hazards with tunnels , especially from vehicle fires when combustion gases can asphyxiate users , as happened at the gotthard road tunnel in switzerland in 2001 designers try to reduce these risks by installing emergency ventilation systems or isolated emergency escape tunnels parallel to the main passage tunnels are dug in types of materials varying from soft clay to hard rock there are three basic types of tunnel construction in common use cut-and-cover tunnels are constructed in a shallow trench and then covered over bored tunnels are constructed in situ , without removing the ground above the tunnel may be of in situ concrete , precast concrete , precast arches , or corrugated steel arches ; in early days brickwork was used excavation then takes place under the permanent tunnel roof , and the base slab is constructed large cut-and-cover boxes are often used for underground metro stations , such as canary wharf tube station in london nevertheless , the original parts of the london underground network , the metropolitan and district railways , were constructed using cut-and-cover this , and the availability of electric traction , brought about london underground 's switch to bored tunnels at a deeper level towards the end of the 19th century tunnel boring machines ( tbms ) and associated back-up systems are used to highly automate the entire tunnelling process , reducing tunnelling costs in certain predominantly urban applications , tunnel boring is viewed as a quick and cost-effective alternative to laying surface rails and roads disadvantages of tbms arise from their usually large size â€“ the difficulty of transporting the large tbm to the site of tunnel construction , or ( alternatively ) the high cost of assembling the tbm on-site , often within the confines of the tunnel being constructed this pressurizes the ground ahead of the tbm cutter head to balance the water pressure the dahuofang water tunnel in china , opened in 2009 , is the third longest water tunnel in the world at length the la linea tunnel in colombia , 2016 , is the longest , , mountain tunnel in south america it crosses beneath a mountain at above sea level with six traffic lanes , and it has a parallel emergency tunnel natural tunnel state park ( virginia , us ) features an natural tunnel , really a limestone cave , that has been used as a railroad tunnel since 1890

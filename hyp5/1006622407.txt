a tunnel is relatively long and narrow ; the length is often much greater than twice the diameter , although similar shorter excavations can be constructed , such as cross passages between tunnels for example , the definition of a road tunnel in the united kingdom is defined as '' a subsurface highway structure enclosed for a length of or more '' in the united states , the nfpa definition of a tunnel is '' an underground structure with a design length greater than and a diameter greater than '' in the uk , a pedestrian , cycle or animal tunnel beneath a road or railway is called a subway , while an underground railway system is differently named in different cities , the '' underground '' or the '' tube '' in london , the '' subway '' in glasgow , and the '' metro '' in newcastle a longer underpass containing a road , canal or railway is normally called a '' tunnel '' , whether or not it passes under another item of infrastructure in the us , the term '' subway '' means an underground rapid transit system , and the term pedestrian underpass is used for a passage beneath a barrier rail station platforms may be connected by pedestrian tunnels or footbridges predecessors of modern tunnels were adits to transport water for irrigation or drinking , and sewerage the tunnel of eupalinos is a tunnel aqueduct long running through mount kastro in samos , greece , built in the 6th century bc to serve as an aqueduct it is the second known tunnel to have been excavated from both ends , after the siloam tunnel in the neighbourhood of silwan in eastern jerusalem a major tunnel project must start with a comprehensive investigation of ground conditions by collecting samples from boreholes and by other geophysical techniques it is common practice to locate a tunnel deeper than otherwise would be required , in order to excavate through solid rock or other material that is easier to support during construction this may be a particular concern in large-diameter tunnels to give more information , a pilot tunnel ( or '' drift tunnel '' ) may be driven ahead of the main excavation this smaller tunnel is less likely to collapse catastrophically should unexpected conditions be met , and it can be incorporated into the final tunnel or used as a backup or emergency escape passage other key geotechnical factors : stand-up time is the amount of time a newly excavated cavity can support itself without any added structures groundwater control is very important in tunnel construction this freezes the ground around each pipe until the whole space is surrounded with frozen soil , keeping water out until a permanent structure can be built if a tunnel excavation is wider than it is high , it will have a harder time supporting itself , decreasing its stand-up time for water crossings , a tunnel is generally more costly to construct than a bridge however , navigational considerations may limit the use of high bridges or drawbridge spans intersecting with shipping channels , necessitating a tunnel boston 's big dig project replaced elevated roadways with a tunnel system to increase traffic capacity , hide traffic , reclaim land , redecorate , and reunite the city with the waterfront similar conclusions were reached for the 1971 kingsway tunnel under the mersey some water crossings are a mixture of bridges and tunnels , such as the oresund bridge and the chesapeake bay bridge-tunnel in virginia designers try to reduce these risks by installing emergency ventilation systems or isolated emergency escape tunnels parallel to the main passage the method of tunnel construction depends on such factors as the ground conditions , the groundwater conditions , the length and diameter of the tunnel drive , the depth of the tunnel , the logistics of supporting the tunnel excavation , the final use and the shape of the tunnel and appropriate risk management there are three basic types of tunnel construction in common use finally , a tube can be sunk into a body of water , which is called an immersed tunnel the tunnel may be of in situ concrete , precast concrete , precast arches , or corrugated steel arches ; in early days brickwork was used top-down method : side support walls and capping beams are constructed from ground level by such methods as slurry walling or contiguous bored piling only a shallow excavation is needed to construct the tunnel roof using precast beams or in situ concrete sitting on the walls shallow tunnels are often of the cut-and-cover type ( if under water , of the immersed-tube type ) , while deep tunnels are excavated , often using a tunnelling shield large cut-and-cover boxes are often used for underground metro stations , such as canary wharf tube station in london this contrasts with many traditional stations on london underground , where bored tunnels were used for stations and passenger access nevertheless , the original parts of the london underground network , the metropolitan and district railways , were constructed using cut-and-cover tunnel boring machines ( tbms ) and associated back-up systems are used to highly automate the entire tunnelling process , reducing tunnelling costs the four tbms used for excavating the gotthard base tunnel , in switzerland , had a diameter of about a larger tbm was built to bore the green heart tunnel ( dutch : tunnel groene hart ) as part of the hsl-zuid in the netherlands , with a diameter of a temporary access shaft is sometimes necessary during the excavation of a tunnel they are usually circular and go straight down until they reach the level at which the tunnel is going to be built once construction is complete , construction access shafts are often used as ventilation shafts , and may also be used as emergency exits in 1906 the fourth alpine tunnel opened , the simplon tunnel , between switzerland and italy the chicago tunnel company is the largest urban street tunnel network , comprising of tunnels beneath the majority of downtown chicago streets the eiksund tunnel on national road rv 653 in norway is the world 's deepest subsea road tunnel , measuring long , with deepest point at below the sea level , opened in february 2008 although the underground railroad network used to transport escaped slaves was '' underground '' mostly in the sense of secrecy , hidden tunnels were occasionally used balvano train disaster ( 1944 ) caldecott tunnel fire ( 1982 ) â€“ major motor vehicle tunnel crash and fire

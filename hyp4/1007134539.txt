history of algebraic number theory the beginnings of algebraic number theory can be traced to diophantine equations , stark , pp one of the founding works of algebraic number theory , the disquisitiones arithmeticae ( latin : arithmetical investigations ) is a textbook of number theory written in latin by carl friedrich gauss in 1798 when gauss was 21 and first published in 1801 when he was 24 many of the annotations given by gauss are in effect announcements of further research of his own , some of which remained unpublished based on his research of the structure of the unit group of quadratic fields , he proved the dirichlet unit theorem , a fundamental result in algebraic number theory he first used the pigeonhole principle , a basic counting argument , in the proof of a theorem in diophantine approximation , later named after him dirichlet 's approximation theorem richard dedekind 's study of lejeune dirichlet 's work was what led him to his later study of algebraic number fields and ideals this law is a general theorem in number theory that forms a central part of global class field theory several more recent generalizations express reciprocity laws using cohomology of groups or representations of adelic groups or algebraic k-groups , and their relationship with the original quadratic reciprocity law can be hard to see algebraic number theory is also used in the study of arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifolds

history of algebraic number theory the beginnings of algebraic number theory can be traced to diophantine equations , stark , pp fermat 's last theorem was first conjectured by pierre de fermat in 1637 , famously in the margin of a copy of arithmetica where he claimed he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin the unsolved problem stimulated the development of algebraic number theory in the 19th century and the proof of the modularity theorem in the 20th century one of the founding works of algebraic number theory , the disquisitiones arithmeticae ( latin : arithmetical investigations ) is a textbook of number theory written in latin by carl friedrich gauss in 1798 when gauss was 21 and first published in 1801 when he was 24 the disquisitiones was the starting point for the work of other nineteenth century european mathematicians including ernst kummer , peter gustav lejeune dirichlet and richard dedekind based on his research of the structure of the unit group of quadratic fields , he proved the dirichlet unit theorem , a fundamental result in algebraic number theory richard dedekind 's study of lejeune dirichlet 's work was what led him to his later study of algebraic number fields and ideals as with the finiteness theorem , he used an existence proof that shows there must be solutions for the problem rather than providing a mechanism to produce the answers this law is a general theorem in number theory that forms a central part of global class field theory

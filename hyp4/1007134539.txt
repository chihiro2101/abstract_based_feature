history of algebraic number theory the beginnings of algebraic number theory can be traced to diophantine equations , stark , pp named after the 3rd-century alexandrian mathematician , diophantus , who studied them and developed methods for the solution of some kinds of diophantine equations the unsolved problem stimulated the development of algebraic number theory in the 19th century and the proof of the modularity theorem in the 20th century in this book gauss brings together results in number theory obtained by mathematicians such as fermat , euler , lagrange and legendre and adds important new results of his own based on his research of the structure of the unit group of quadratic fields , he proved the dirichlet unit theorem , a fundamental result in algebraic number theory he first used the pigeonhole principle , a basic counting argument , in the proof of a theorem in diophantine approximation , later named after him dirichlet 's approximation theorem richard dedekind 's study of lejeune dirichlet 's work was what led him to his later study of algebraic number fields and ideals david hilbert unified the field of algebraic number theory with his 1897 treatise zahlbericht ( literally '' report on numbers '' ) this law is a general theorem in number theory that forms a central part of global class field theory

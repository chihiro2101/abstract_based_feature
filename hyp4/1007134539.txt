history of algebraic number theory the beginnings of algebraic number theory can be traced to diophantine equations , stark , pp the unsolved problem stimulated the development of algebraic number theory in the 19th century and the proof of the modularity theorem in the 20th century one of the founding works of algebraic number theory , the disquisitiones arithmeticae ( latin : arithmetical investigations ) is a textbook of number theory written in latin by carl friedrich gauss in 1798 when gauss was 21 and first published in 1801 when he was 24 based on his research of the structure of the unit group of quadratic fields , he proved the dirichlet unit theorem , a fundamental result in algebraic number theory the dirichlet divisor problem , for which he found the first results , is still an unsolved problem in number theory despite later contributions by other researchers ) dedekind defined an ideal as a subset of a set of numbers , composed of algebraic integers that satisfy polynomial equations with integer coefficients david hilbert unified the field of algebraic number theory with his 1897 treatise zahlbericht ( literally '' report on numbers '' ) this law is a general theorem in number theory that forms a central part of global class field theory number fields , it relies on techniques and ideas from algebraic geometry

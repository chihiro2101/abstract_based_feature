history of algebraic number theory the beginnings of algebraic number theory can be traced to diophantine equations , stark , pp named after the 3rd-century alexandrian mathematician , diophantus , who studied them and developed methods for the solution of some kinds of diophantine equations before the disquisitiones was published , number theory consisted of a collection of isolated theorems and conjectures many of the annotations given by gauss are in effect announcements of further research of his own , some of which remained unpublished based on his research of the structure of the unit group of quadratic fields , he proved the dirichlet unit theorem , a fundamental result in algebraic number theory richard dedekind 's study of lejeune dirichlet 's work was what led him to his later study of algebraic number fields and ideals algebraic number theory interacts with many other mathematical disciplines number fields , it relies on techniques and ideas from algebraic geometry algebraic number theory is also used in the study of arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifolds

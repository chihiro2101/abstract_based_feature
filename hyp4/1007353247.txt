the introduction of the mainframe-based relational database during the 1970s led to a proliferation of data access methods these systems may or may not allow other applications to access the data directly , and those that did use a wide variety of methodologies this led to the concept of embedded sql , which allowed sql code to be embedded within another language results returned from the statements would be interpreted back into c data formats like char using similar library code another key problem to the embedded sql concept was that the sql code could only be changed in the program 's source code , so that even small changes to the query required considerable programmer effort to modify the sql market referred to this as static sql , versus dynamic sql which could be changed at any time , like the command-line interfaces that shipped with almost all sql systems , or a programming interface that left the sql as plain text until it was called instead , the data was accessed directly by the program – a programming library in the case of large mainframe systems , or a command line interface or interactive forms system in the case of dbase and similar applications under this model , large mainframes and minicomputers would be used primarily to serve up data over local area networks to microcomputers that would interpret , display and manipulate that data some of these were mainframe related , designed to allow programs running on those machines to translate between the variety of sql 's and provide a single common interface which could then be called by other mainframe or microcomputer programs much more common , however , were systems that ran entirely on microcomputers , including a complete protocol stack that included any required networking or file translation support 1 , 69 unlike the later odbc , blueprint was a purely code-based system , lacking anything approximating a command language like sql instead , programmers used data structures to store the query information , constructing a query by linking many of these structures together much of the system was based on sybase 's db-library system , with the sybase-specific sections removed and several additions to support other platforms db-library was aided by an industry-wide move from library systems that were tightly linked to a specific language , to library systems that were provided by the operating system and required the languages on that platform to conform to its standards after considerable industry input , in the summer of 1989 the standard became sql connectivity ( sqlc ) in 1988 several vendors , mostly from the unix and database communities , formed the sql access group ( sag ) in an effort to produce a single basic standard for the sql language in the end , sqlc won the votes and became the draft standard , but only after large portions of the api were removed – the standards document was trimmed from 120 pages to 50 during this time ms continued working with the original sqlc standard , retaining many of the advanced features that were removed from the cli version however , jet did not use sql ; like datalens , the interface was in c and consisted of data structures and function calls this would not only make windows a premier platform for cli development , but also allow users to use sql to access both jet and other databases as well what was missing was the sql parser that could convert those calls from their text form into the c-interface used in jet and because jet could forward those c-based calls to other databases , this also allowed simba to query other systems microsoft included drivers for excel to turn its spreadsheet documents into sql-accessible database tables jdbc-to-odbc bridges allow java-based programs to access data sources through odbc drivers on platforms lacking a native jdbc driver , although these are now relatively rare inversely , odbc-to-jdbc bridges allow c-based programs to access data sources through jdbc drivers on platforms or from databases lacking suitable odbc drivers it is not uncommon to find odbc drivers for database engines that are meant to be embedded , like sqlite , as a way to allow existing tools to act as front-ends to these engines for testing and debugging werner , christian ( 2018 ) '' sqlite odbc driver '' , 2018-02-24 however , the rise of thin client computing using html as an intermediate format has reduced the need for odbc an odbc driver enables an odbc-compliant application to use a data source , normally a dbms programmers usually use such a bridge when a given database lacks a jdbc driver , but is accessible through an odbc driver an ado.net-odbc bridge consists of an ado.net provider which uses the services of an odbc driver to connect to a target database programmers usually use such a bridge when a given database lacks an ado.net provider , but is accessible through an odbc driver

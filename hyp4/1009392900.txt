uses of triglyceride vegetable oil oils extracted from plants have been used since ancient times and in many cultures in addition to use as food , fats and oils ( both vegetable and mineral ) have long been used as fuel , typically in lamps which were a principal source of illumination in ancient times vegetable oils were probably more valuable as food and lamp-oil ; babylonian mineral oil was known to be used as fuel , but there are no references to lubrication many vegetable oils are consumed directly , or indirectly as ingredients in food – a role that they share with some fat , including butter , ghee , lard , and schmaltz flavor base – oils can also '' carry '' flavors of other ingredients , since many flavors are due to chemicals that are soluble in oil such oils include the major cooking oils – soybean , rapeseed , canola , sunflower , safflower , peanut , cottonseed , etc because the center arm of the triglyceride is shielded somewhat by the end fatty acids , most of the hydrogenation occurs on the end fatty acids , thus making the resulting fat more brittle while full hydrogenation produces largely saturated fatty acids , partial hydrogenation results in the transformation of unsaturated cis fatty acids to trans fats in the oil mixture due to the heat used in hydrogenation in the us , the standard of identity for a product labeled as '' vegetable oil margarine '' specifies only canola , safflower , sunflower , corn , soybean , or peanut oil may be used dammar oil ( a mixture of linseed oil and dammar resin ) , for example , is used almost exclusively in treating the hulls of wooden boats however , vegetable oils are less stable chemically , so they are generally used in systems where they are not exposed to oxygen , and they are more expensive than crude oil distillate synthetic tetraesters , which are similar to vegetable oils but with four fatty acid chains compared to the normal three found in a natural ester , are manufactured by fischer esterification castor oil has numerous industrial uses , owing to the presence of hydroxyl group on the fatty acid vegetable oil is used in the production of some pet foods aafco defines vegetable oil , in this context , as the product of vegetable origin obtained by extracting the oil from seeds or fruits which are processed for edible purposes vegetable oils are also used to make biodiesel , which can be used like conventional diesel the use of vegetable oils as alternative energy is growing and the availability of biodiesel by region is increasing the production process of vegetable oil involves the removal of oil from plant components , typically seeds the chinese started to use vegetable oil for stir-frying instead of animal fats during the song dynasty ( 960–1279 ) the early 20th century also saw the start of the use of vegetable oil fuel in diesel engines and in heating oil burners periodic petroleum shortages spurred research into vegetable oil as a diesel substitute during the 1930s and 1940s , and again in the 1970s and early 1980s when straight vegetable oil enjoyed its highest level of scientific interest used cooking oils from food manufacturing , however , as well as fresh or unused cooking oil , continue to be used in animal feed in canada , palm oil is one of five vegetable oils , along with palm kernel oil , coconut oil , peanut oil , and cocoa butter , which must be specifically named in the list of ingredients for a food product a mix of oils other than the aforementioned exceptions may simply be listed as '' vegetable oil '' in canada ; however , if the food product is a cooking oil , salad oil or table oil , the type of oil must be specified and listing '' vegetable oil '' as an ingredient is not acceptable

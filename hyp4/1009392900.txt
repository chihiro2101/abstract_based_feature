uses of triglyceride vegetable oil oils extracted from plants have been used since ancient times and in many cultures in addition to use as food , fats and oils ( both vegetable and mineral ) have long been used as fuel , typically in lamps which were a principal source of illumination in ancient times oils may have been used for lubrication , but there is no evidence for this vegetable oils were probably more valuable as food and lamp-oil ; babylonian mineral oil was known to be used as fuel , but there are no references to lubrication many vegetable oils are consumed directly , or indirectly as ingredients in food – a role that they share with some fat , including butter , ghee , lard , and schmaltz flavor – while less flavorful oils command premium prices , some oils , such as olive , sesame , or almond oil , may be chosen specifically for the flavor they impart flavor base – oils can also '' carry '' flavors of other ingredients , since many flavors are due to chemicals that are soluble in oil such oils include the major cooking oils – soybean , rapeseed , canola , sunflower , safflower , peanut , cottonseed , etc an oil may be hydrogenated to increase resistance to rancidity ( oxidation ) or to change its physical characteristics in the us , the standard of identity for a product labeled as '' vegetable oil margarine '' specifies only canola , safflower , sunflower , corn , soybean , or peanut oil may be used vegetable oils are used as an ingredient or component in many manufactured products however , vegetable oils are less stable chemically , so they are generally used in systems where they are not exposed to oxygen , and they are more expensive than crude oil distillate synthetic tetraesters , which are similar to vegetable oils but with four fatty acid chains compared to the normal three found in a natural ester , are manufactured by fischer esterification oils that are more stable , such as ben oil or mineral oil , are thus preferred for industrial uses vegetable oil is used in the production of some pet foods aafco defines vegetable oil , in this context , as the product of vegetable origin obtained by extracting the oil from seeds or fruits which are processed for edible purposes the use of vegetable oils as alternative energy is growing and the availability of biodiesel by region is increasing the production process of vegetable oil involves the removal of oil from plant components , typically seeds vegetable oils have been used for lighting fuel , cooking , medicine and lubrication by the 1950s and 1960s , soybean oil had become the most popular vegetable oil in the us , now mying only behind palm oil canola is very thin ( unlike corn oil ) and flavorless ( unlike olive oil ) , so it largely succeeds by displacing soy oil , just as soy oil largely succeeded by displacing cottonseed oil recycled oil has numerous uses , including use as a direct fuel , as well as in the production of biodiesel , soap , animal feed , pet food , detergent , and cosmetics used cooking oils from food manufacturing , however , as well as fresh or unused cooking oil , continue to be used in animal feed from december 2014 , all food products produced in the european union were legally required to indicate the specific vegetable oil used in their manufacture , following the introduction of the food information to consumers regulation

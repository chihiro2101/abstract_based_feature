uses of triglyceride vegetable oil in addition to use as food , fats and oils ( both vegetable and mineral ) have long been used as fuel , typically in lamps which were a principal source of illumination in ancient times vegetable oils were probably more valuable as food and lamp-oil ; babylonian mineral oil was known to be used as fuel , but there are no references to lubrication pliny the elder reported that fats such as lard were used to lubricate the axles of carts many vegetable oils are consumed directly , or indirectly as ingredients in food – a role that they share with some fat , including butter , ghee , lard , and schmaltz flavor – while less flavorful oils command premium prices , some oils , such as olive , sesame , or almond oil , may be chosen specifically for the flavor they impart such oils include the major cooking oils – soybean , rapeseed , canola , sunflower , safflower , peanut , cottonseed , etc tropical oils , such as coconut , palm , and rice bran oils , are particularly valued in asian cultures for high-temperature cooking , because of their unusually high flash points a margarine made from naturally more saturated oils will be more plastic ( more '' spreadable '' ) than a margarine made from hydrogenated soy oil in the us , the standard of identity for a product labeled as '' vegetable oil margarine '' specifies only canola , safflower , sunflower , corn , soybean , or peanut oil may be used products not labeled '' vegetable oil margarine '' do not have that restriction vegetable oils are increasingly being used in the electrical industry as insulators as vegetable oils are not toxic to the environment , biodegradable if spilled and have high flash and fire points however , vegetable oils are less stable chemically , so they are generally used in systems where they are not exposed to oxygen , and they are more expensive than crude oil distillate synthetic tetraesters , which are similar to vegetable oils but with four fatty acid chains compared to the normal three found in a natural ester , are manufactured by fischer esterification one limiting factor in industrial uses of vegetable oils is that all such oils are susceptible to becoming rancid oils that are more stable , such as ben oil or mineral oil , are thus preferred for industrial uses aafco defines vegetable oil , in this context , as the product of vegetable origin obtained by extracting the oil from seeds or fruits which are processed for edible purposes vegetable oils are also used to make biodiesel , which can be used like conventional diesel some vegetable oil blends are used in unmodified vehicles but straight vegetable oil , also known as pure plant oil , needs specially prepared vehicles which have a method of heating the oil to reduce its viscosity the use of vegetable oils as alternative energy is growing and the availability of biodiesel by region is increasing the production process of vegetable oil involves the removal of oil from plant components , typically seeds this can be done via mechanical extraction using an oil mill or chemical extraction using a solvent the chinese started to use vegetable oil for stir-frying instead of animal fats during the song dynasty ( 960–1279 ) however , biodiesel , produced from oils or fats using transesterification is more widely used in canada , palm oil is one of five vegetable oils , along with palm kernel oil , coconut oil , peanut oil , and cocoa butter , which must be specifically named in the list of ingredients for a food product

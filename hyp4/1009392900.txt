uses of triglyceride vegetable oil oils extracted from plants have been used since ancient times and in many cultures in addition to use as food , fats and oils ( both vegetable and mineral ) have long been used as fuel , typically in lamps which were a principal source of illumination in ancient times vegetable oils were probably more valuable as food and lamp-oil ; babylonian mineral oil was known to be used as fuel , but there are no references to lubrication flavor – while less flavorful oils command premium prices , some oils , such as olive , sesame , or almond oil , may be chosen specifically for the flavor they impart flavor base – oils can also '' carry '' flavors of other ingredients , since many flavors are due to chemicals that are soluble in oil such oils include the major cooking oils – soybean , rapeseed , canola , sunflower , safflower , peanut , cottonseed , etc unsaturated vegetable oils can be transformed through partial or complete '' hydrogenation '' into oils of higher melting point the elimination of double bonds by adding hydrogen atoms is called saturation ; as the degree of saturation increases , the oil progresses toward being fully hydrogenated a margarine made from naturally more saturated oils will be more plastic ( more '' spreadable '' ) than a margarine made from hydrogenated soy oil in the us , the standard of identity for a product labeled as '' vegetable oil margarine '' specifies only canola , safflower , sunflower , corn , soybean , or peanut oil may be used products not labeled '' vegetable oil margarine '' do not have that restriction vegetable oils are used as an ingredient or component in many manufactured products many vegetable oils are used to make soaps , skin products , candles , perfumes and other personal care and cosmetic products vegetable oils are increasingly being used in the electrical industry as insulators as vegetable oils are not toxic to the environment , biodegradable if spilled and have high flash and fire points however , vegetable oils are less stable chemically , so they are generally used in systems where they are not exposed to oxygen , and they are more expensive than crude oil distillate vegetable oil is being used to produce biodegradable hydraulic fluid and lubricant one limiting factor in industrial uses of vegetable oils is that all such oils are susceptible to becoming rancid oils that are more stable , such as ben oil or mineral oil , are thus preferred for industrial uses aafco defines vegetable oil , in this context , as the product of vegetable origin obtained by extracting the oil from seeds or fruits which are processed for edible purposes vegetable oils are also used to make biodiesel , which can be used like conventional diesel vegetable oils have been used for lighting fuel , cooking , medicine and lubrication by the 1950s and 1960s , soybean oil had become the most popular vegetable oil in the us , now mying only behind palm oil canola oil is lower in saturated fats , and higher in monounsaturates used cooking oils from food manufacturing , however , as well as fresh or unused cooking oil , continue to be used in animal feed

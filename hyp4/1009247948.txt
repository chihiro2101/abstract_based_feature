these machines belong to a class of electrostatic generators called influence machines , which separate electric charges through electrostatic induction , or influence , not depending on friction for their operation an imbalance of charges is induced , amplified , and collected by two pairs of metal combs with points placed near the surfaces of each disc the positive feedback increases the accumulating charges exponentially until the dielectric breakdown voltage of the air is reached and an electric spark jumps across the gap the machine is theoretically not self-starting , meaning that if none of the sectors on the discs has any electrical charge there is nothing to induce charges on other sectors the steady state output of the wimshurst machine is a direct ( non-alternating ) current that is proportional to the area covered by the metal sector , the rotation speed , and a complicated function of the initial charge distribution the machine is provided with four small earthed brushes ( two on each side of the machine on conducting shafts at 90° to each other ) , plus a pair of charge-collection combs the shaft 's polarized charges attach to the nearest sectors on disc b , resulting in negative charge on b y closer to the original positive charge on a , and positive charge on the opposite side of b y1 disc a rotates 90° so that its charges line up with the brush of disc b y , y1 , where an opposite charge-polarization is induced on the b conducting shaft and the nearest sectors of b , similar to the description two paragraphs above all of these induced positive and negative charges are collected by combs to charge the leyden jars , electrical charge-storage devices similar to capacitors the wimshurst machine website : photos and video clips of a wimshurst machine mit video demonstration and explanation of a wimshurst machine ( mit techtv physics demo ) how does a wimshurst machine work ? saint mary 's physics demo site

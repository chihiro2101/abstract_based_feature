the term manglish is first recorded in 1989 other colloquial portmanteau words for manglish include ( chronologically ) : malish ( 1992 ) , malaylish ( 1992 ) , malenglish ( 1994 ) , malglish ( 1997 ) , malayglish ( 2005 ) , and malanglish ( 2013 ) manglish shares substantial linguistic similarities with singlish in singapore , although distinctions can be made , particularly in vocabulary initially , '' singlish '' and '' manglish '' were essentially the same language , when both singapore and the states now comprising peninsular malaysia were under various forms of direct and indirect british rule , though not forming a single administrative unit except between 1963 and 1965 ) in old british malaya , english was the language of the british administration whilst malay was the lingua franca of the street even ethnic chinese would speak malay when addressing other chinese people who did not speak the same chinese dialect english as spoken in malaysia is based on british english and called malaysian english however , the influence of american english modes of expression and slang is strong , particularly among malaysian youth while english is widely used , many malay words have become part of common usage in informal english or manglish an example is suffixing sentences with lah , as in , '' do n't be so worried-lah '' , which is usually used to present a sentence as rather light-going and not so serious ; the suffix has no specific meaning however , chinese dialects also make abundant use of the suffix lah and there is some disagreement as to which language it was originally borrowed from there is also a strong influence from malay , mandarin , cantonese , hokkien , and tamil , which are other major dialects and languages spoken in malaysia manglish also uses some archaic british terms from the era of british rule ( see '' gostan '' and '' outstation '' below ) malaysian english and manglish in malaysia , manglish is considered to be a less formal form of malaysian english which has features of a pidgin or a creole , rather than a fully-fledged creole language at the lexical level , limited lexis is used and consequently , a number of words serve a variety of functions , giving extended meanings not normally accepted in standard british english there are some differences of contemporary words used between malaysia and the united kingdom the use of manglish is discouraged at schools , where only malaysian standard english is taught the term malaysian english is not used in any official context except for the ever-changing school curriculum modules in attempts to improve the command of english but without going into advanced lessons it is however , possible to speak manglish without substituting english words with those from another language verbs or adjectives from other languages often have english affixes , and conversely sentences may be constructed using english words in another language 's syntax aside from borrowing lexicons and expressions at varying levels depending on the speaker 's mother tongue , malay , chinese and tamil also influence manglish at a sentence formation level for example , chinese languages do not mark the verb for tenses instead , information about time is often acquired through contextual knowledge or time-specific markers such as ‘ yesterday ’ , ‘ today ’ and ‘ tomorrow ’ this is also replicated in manglish with sentences like ‘ she go to the shop yesterday ’ and ‘ i come here every day ’ chinese , malay and tamil languages often duplicate words for different functions such as to show pluralisation , emphasis or repetition similarly , this has influenced the duplication of english words when speaking manglish , especially when placing emphasis on certain words or to show pluralisation '' chop '' – stamp ( also used as verb ) '' dollar '' – a loaned currency used especially in relation to business transactions , in lieu of '' ringgit '' ( ringgit malaysia ) going outstation ) , from the colonial era when british officials went to hill stations to escape the heat '' terrer '' – ( pronounced as the english '' terror '' ) refers to someone or something being awesomely amazing or good ( e.g '' action/ackshun/eksyen '' – showing-off , arrogant , from english '' action '' '' best '' - superlatively good , see also syok/shiok i got the chop for my letter from the office lah comes from hokkien chhìn-chhái for '' simply '' , '' casual '' or '' slipshod '' '' la-la zai '' and '' la-la mui '' is commonly used to make distinctions between the genders , with the former referring to guys and the latter referring to girls '' slumber '' – relaxed , laid-back ; possibly a conflation of the malay '' selamba '' , meaning nonchalant , and the english '' slumber '' used when wanting to put an emphasis on something saying it is great or big—whether it is in a good or bad way does not matter as long as it is '' huge '' e.g '' cabut/cantas '' – to run off , flee or to escape ( 'cabut ' is a malay word meaning to pull or pulling out as a transitive verb , or to become detached as an intransitive verb ) '' gostan '' – reverse a vehicle , probably from the nautical term '' go astern '' ( mostly used in terengganu , kelantan , kedah and penang ) or '' go stunt '' '' kantoi '' – to get caught ( '' i kena kantoi '' means , '' i got shafted/reprimanded/caught '' ) '' kena '' – to experience/get caught/punished ; often used like a noun ( '' i sure kena if i cheat '' ) example : he got it kow kow ( '' he got it badly '' ) '' lempang '' – literally '' bash '' in malay but usually refers to a slap example : let 's go eat at a mamak lah ) the chinese influence in manglish , however , can be seen among other races in malaysia , especially when conversing with chinese-speaking people the difference between manglish and singlish can be subtle and sometimes difficult to be distinguish even among the locals manglish : for and against , should malaysians speak manglish or proper english ? benjamin zimmer ( 2006-10-05 ) , '' malaysia cracks down on 'salad language ' ''

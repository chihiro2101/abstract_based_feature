commonly used protein production systems include those derived from bacteria , yeast , baculovirus/insect , mammalian cells , and more recently filamentous fungi such as myceliophthora thermophila when biopharmaceuticals are produced with one of these systems , process-related impurities termed host cell proteins also arrive in the final product in trace amounts the oldest and most widely used expression systems are cell-based and may be defined as the '' combination of an expression vector , its cloned dna , and the host for the vector that provide a context to allow foreign gene function in a host cell , that is , produce proteins at a high level '' there are many ways to introduce foreign dna to a cell for expression , and many different host cells may be used for expression â€” each expression system has distinct advantages and liabilities expression systems are normally referred to by the host and the dna source or the delivery mechanism for the genetic material the best expression system depends on the gene involved , for example the saccharomyces cerevisiae is often preferred for proteins that require significant posttranslational modification to address these concerns , expressions systems using multiple eukaryotic cells were developed for applications requiring the proteins be conformed as in , or closer to eukaryotic organisms : cells of plants ( i.e to combine the high yield/productivity and scalable protein features of bacteria and yeast , and advanced epigenetic features of plants , insects and mammalians systems , other protein production systems are developed using unicellular eukaryotes ( i.e filamentous fungi , especially aspergillus and trichoderma , but also more recently myceliophthora thermophila c1 have been developed into expression platforms for screening and production of diverse industrial enzymes baculovirus-infected insect cells ( sf9 , sf21 , high five strains ) or mammalian cells ( hela , hek 293 ) allow production of glycosylated or membrane proteins that can not be produced using fungal or bacterial systems the non-lytic system has been used to give higher protein yield and quicker expression of recombinant genes compared to baculovirus-infected cell expression due to the low expression levels and high cost of cell-free systems , cell-based systems are more widely used .

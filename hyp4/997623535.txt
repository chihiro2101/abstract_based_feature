commonly used protein production systems include those derived from bacteria , yeast , baculovirus/insect , mammalian cells , and more recently filamentous fungi such as myceliophthora thermophila when biopharmaceuticals are produced with one of these systems , process-related impurities termed host cell proteins also arrive in the final product in trace amounts the oldest and most widely used expression systems are cell-based and may be defined as the '' combination of an expression vector , its cloned dna , and the host for the vector that provide a context to allow foreign gene function in a host cell , that is , produce proteins at a high level '' there are many ways to introduce foreign dna to a cell for expression , and many different host cells may be used for expression â€” each expression system has distinct advantages and liabilities the best expression system depends on the gene involved , for example the saccharomyces cerevisiae is often preferred for proteins that require significant posttranslational modification insect or mammal cell lines are used when human-like splicing of mrna is required to address these concerns , expressions systems using multiple eukaryotic cells were developed for applications requiring the proteins be conformed as in , or closer to eukaryotic organisms : cells of plants ( i.e to combine the high yield/productivity and scalable protein features of bacteria and yeast , and advanced epigenetic features of plants , insects and mammalians systems , other protein production systems are developed using unicellular eukaryotes ( i.e for example , a dna sequence for a protein of interest could be cloned or subcloned into a high copy-number plasmid containing the lac ( often lacuv5 ) promoter , which is then transformed into the bacterium e baculovirus-infected insect cells ( sf9 , sf21 , high five strains ) or mammalian cells ( hela , hek 293 ) allow production of glycosylated or membrane proteins that can not be produced using fungal or bacterial systems the non-lytic system has been used to give higher protein yield and quicker expression of recombinant genes compared to baculovirus-infected cell expression leishmania tarentolae ( can not infect mammals ) expression systems allow stable and lasting production of proteins at high yield , in chemically defined media

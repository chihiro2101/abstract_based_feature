commonly used protein production systems include those derived from bacteria , yeast , baculovirus/insect , mammalian cells , and more recently filamentous fungi such as myceliophthora thermophila when biopharmaceuticals are produced with one of these systems , process-related impurities termed host cell proteins also arrive in the final product in trace amounts the oldest and most widely used expression systems are cell-based and may be defined as the '' combination of an expression vector , its cloned dna , and the host for the vector that provide a context to allow foreign gene function in a host cell , that is , produce proteins at a high level '' overexpression is an abnormally and excessively high level of gene expression which produces a pronounced gene-related phenotype there are many ways to introduce foreign dna to a cell for expression , and many different host cells may be used for expression â€” each expression system has distinct advantages and liabilities expression systems are normally referred to by the host and the dna source or the delivery mechanism for the genetic material also , many proteins become insoluble as inclusion bodies that are difficult to recover without harsh denaturants and subsequent cumbersome protein-refolding mammalian in vivo expression systems have however low yield and other limitations ( time-consuming , toxicity to host cells , to combine the high yield/productivity and scalable protein features of bacteria and yeast , and advanced epigenetic features of plants , insects and mammalians systems , other protein production systems are developed using unicellular eukaryotes ( i.e the non-pathogenic and gram-negative bacteria , pseudomonas fluorescens , is used for high level production of recombinant proteins ; commonly for the development bio-therapeutics and vaccines the non-lytic system has been used to give higher protein yield and quicker expression of recombinant genes compared to baculovirus-infected cell expression due to the low expression levels and high cost of cell-free systems , cell-based systems are more widely used .

commonly used protein production systems include those derived from bacteria , yeast , baculovirus/insect , mammalian cells , and more recently filamentous fungi such as myceliophthora thermophila when biopharmaceuticals are produced with one of these systems , process-related impurities termed host cell proteins also arrive in the final product in trace amounts the oldest and most widely used expression systems are cell-based and may be defined as the '' combination of an expression vector , its cloned dna , and the host for the vector that provide a context to allow foreign gene function in a host cell , that is , produce proteins at a high level '' there are many ways to introduce foreign dna to a cell for expression , and many different host cells may be used for expression â€” each expression system has distinct advantages and liabilities the best expression system depends on the gene involved , for example the saccharomyces cerevisiae is often preferred for proteins that require significant posttranslational modification also , many proteins become insoluble as inclusion bodies that are difficult to recover without harsh denaturants and subsequent cumbersome protein-refolding to address these concerns , expressions systems using multiple eukaryotic cells were developed for applications requiring the proteins be conformed as in , or closer to eukaryotic organisms : cells of plants ( i.e the non-pathogenic and gram-negative bacteria , pseudomonas fluorescens , is used for high level production of recombinant proteins ; commonly for the development bio-therapeutics and vaccines expression systems using either s cerevisiae or pichia pastoris allow stable and lasting production of proteins that are processed similarly to mammalian cells , at high yield , in chemically defined media of proteins baculovirus-infected insect cells ( sf9 , sf21 , high five strains ) or mammalian cells ( hela , hek 293 ) allow production of glycosylated or membrane proteins that can not be produced using fungal or bacterial systems the non-lytic system has been used to give higher protein yield and quicker expression of recombinant genes compared to baculovirus-infected cell expression

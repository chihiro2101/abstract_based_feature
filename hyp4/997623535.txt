commonly used protein production systems include those derived from bacteria , yeast , baculovirus/insect , mammalian cells , and more recently filamentous fungi such as myceliophthora thermophila the oldest and most widely used expression systems are cell-based and may be defined as the '' combination of an expression vector , its cloned dna , and the host for the vector that provide a context to allow foreign gene function in a host cell , that is , produce proteins at a high level '' there are many ways to introduce foreign dna to a cell for expression , and many different host cells may be used for expression â€” each expression system has distinct advantages and liabilities expression systems are normally referred to by the host and the dna source or the delivery mechanism for the genetic material the best expression system depends on the gene involved , for example the saccharomyces cerevisiae is often preferred for proteins that require significant posttranslational modification tobacco ) , of insects or mammalians ( i.e to combine the high yield/productivity and scalable protein features of bacteria and yeast , and advanced epigenetic features of plants , insects and mammalians systems , other protein production systems are developed using unicellular eukaryotes ( i.e coli is one of the most widely used expression hosts , and dna is normally introduced in a plasmid expression vector in non-lytic expression , vectors are transiently or stably transfected into the chromosomal dna of insect cells for subsequent gene expression the non-lytic system has been used to give higher protein yield and quicker expression of recombinant genes compared to baculovirus-infected cell expression leishmania tarentolae ( can not infect mammals ) expression systems allow stable and lasting production of proteins at high yield , in chemically defined media due to the low expression levels and high cost of cell-free systems , cell-based systems are more widely used .

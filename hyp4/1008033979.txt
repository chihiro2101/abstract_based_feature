ritzer was born in 1940 to a jewish family in upper manhattan , new york city his father and mother were employed as a taxi cab driver and secretary , respectively , in order to support him and his younger brother despite dealing with some tough economic times , he never felt deprived relative to others while growing up in a '' working-class , multi-ethnic neighborhood '' ritzer graduated from the bronx high school of science in 1958 , stating to have '' encountered the brightest people i have ever met in my life '' while at bronx high school of science , ritzer received a new york state regents scholarship which would follow him to whichever college he chose to attend ritzer began his higher education at city college of new york , a free college at the time his scholarship in addition to the free college tuition proved to be a benefit to the economic positioning of the ritzer family while at michigan , his official academic interest was human relations ; however , he had many other intellectual hobbies , such as reading russian novels ritzer reported that at michigan , as he was able to grow and improve as a student however , during his time at michigan , he remembers being heavily involved in global events occurring at the time after graduating from the university of michigan in 1964 , ritzer began working in personnel management for the ford motor company ; however , this proved to be a negative experience for him ritzer said , '' i 'd like to see a society in which people are free to be creative , rather than having their creativity constrained or eliminated as a testament to his interest and dedication to the subject , he received an a+ on a 102-page paper he wrote for a course on american society this experience as well as out-reading the other sociology students in a small seminar with margaret cussler allowed ritzer to become more confident as a sociology student due to his ability to outwork the competition as ritzer said in a later interview , '' i basically trained myself as a social theorist , and so i had to learn it all as i went '' despite this challenge , ritzer found that not being trained in social theory was actually advantageous for him , simply because his reasoning was not limited to a particular theoretical perspective george ritzer wrote the mcdonaldization of society ritzer 's idea of mcdonaldization is an extension of max weber 's ( 1864–1920 ) classical theory of the rationalization of modern society and culture weber famously used the terminology '' iron cage '' to describe the stultifying , kafkaesque effects of bureaucratized life , and ritzer applied this idea to an influential social system in the twenty-first century : mcdonald 's '' ” ritzer identifies four rationalizing dimensions of mcdonald 's that contribute to the process of mcdonaldization , claiming that mcdonald 's aims to increase : efficiency : mcdonald 's delivers products quickly and easily without inputting an excessive amount of money the '' mcdonald 's model '' and therefore the mcdonald 's operations follow a predesigned process that leads to a specified end , using productive means the high calculability of the mcdonald 's franchise also extends over into academics it is thought that the academic experience , in high school and higher education , can be quantified into one number , the gpa for example , customers know that every big mac from mcdonald 's is going to be the same as the next one ; there is an understood predictability to the menu as well as the overall experience the predictability of the mcdonald 's franchise also appears through the golden arches in front of every franchise as well as the scripts that the employees use on the customers the walt disney company also has regulations in place , like dress code for men and women , in order to add to the predictability of each amusement park or disney operation predictability has also extended into movie sequels and tv shows with each movie sequel , like spy kids 4 , or tv show , law & order and its spinoffs , the plot is predictable and usually follow a preconceived model every step of the learning process at sylvan , the u-shaped tables and instruction manuals , is controlled as well as each step of the birthing process , in modern-day hospitals , and the process of dying the mcdonaldization of society also allows operations to be more productive , improve the quality of some products , and produce services and products at lower cost ritzer is also a founding editor , with don slater , of sage 's journal of consumer culture first coined by alvin toffler in 1980 , the term prosumer is used by ritzer and jurgenson , to break down the false dichotomy between production and consumption and describe the dual identity of economic activities it has only recently become popularly acknowledged that the existence of prosumption as activities on the internet and web 2.0 resemble prosumption much more so than production or consumption individually various online activities require the input of consumers such as wikipedia entries , facebook profiles , twitter , blog , myspace , amazon preferences , ebay auctions , second life , etc ritzer argues that we should view all economic activities on a continuum of prosumption with prosumption as production ( p-a-p ) and prosumption as consumption ( p-a-c ) on each pole according to ritzer , '' something '' is a locally conceived and controlled social form that is comparatively rich in distinctive substantive content examples of '' nothing '' are mcdonald 's , wal-mart , starbucks , credit cards , and the internet the globalization of nothing , pine forge press , thousand oaks , 2004 , this book presents a sophisticated argument about the nature of globalization in terms of the consumption of goods and services society is becoming bombarded with '' nothing '' and ritzer seems to believe that the globalization of '' nothing '' is almost unstoppable ritzer 's aforementioned the globalization of nothing ( 2004/2007 ) stakes out a provocative perspective in the ongoing and voluminous globalization discourse , one instance of nothing again and again- dominates social life ( ritzer , george ritzer further explains glocalization as a relatively benign process that is closest to the '' something '' end of things the third subtype of m u is the external-intellectual view of sociology ;

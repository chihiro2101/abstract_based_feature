the star systems of coma berenices include binary , double and triple stars 21 comae berenices ( proper name kissin ) is a double star with nearly equal components and an orbital period of 26 years the coma cluster contains at least eight spectroscopic binary , and the constellation has seven eclipsing binary : cc , dd , ek , rw , rz , ss and ux comae berenices there are over thirty double stars in coma berenices , including 24 comae berenices with contrasting colors its primary is an orange-hued giant star with a magnitude of 5.0 , 610 light-years from earth , and its secondary is a blue-white-hued star with a magnitude of 6.6 triple stars include 12 comae berenices , 17 comae berenices , kr comae berenices and struve 1639 over 200 variable stars are known in coma berenices , although many are obscure alpha comae berenices is a possible algol variable fk comae berenices , which varies from magnitude 8.14 to 8.33 over a period of 2.4 days , is the prototype for the fk comae berenices class of variable stars and the star in which the '' starspot '' was discovered fs comae berenices is a semi-regular variable , a red giant with a period of about two months whose magnitude varies between 6.1 and 5.3 r comae berenices is a mira variable with a maximum magnitude of almost 7 coma berenices also contains alpha2 canum venaticorum variable , such as 13 comae berenices and ai comae berenices a number of supernovae have been discovered in coma berenices coma berenices also contains the neutron star rbs 1223 and the pulsar psr b1237+25 coma berenices has seven known exoplanets the coma star cluster represents berenice 's sacrificed tresses and as a naked eye object has been known since antiquity , appearing in ptolemy 's almagest the cluster is spread over a huge region ( more than five degrees across ) near gamma comae berenices coma berenices contains the northern portion of the virgo cluster ( also known as the comaâ€“virgo cluster ) , about 60 million light-years away it is unique for its region of intense star formation , creating a ring around its nucleus which was discovered by the hubble space telescope the galaxy 's prodigious star formation began five million years ago , in a region with a diameter of 1,000 light-years in 2006 a dwarf galaxy , also named coma berenices , was discovered in the constellation w comae berenices ( or on 231 ) , a blazar in the constellation 's northwest , was originally designated a variable star and later found to be a bl lacertae object

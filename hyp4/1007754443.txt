the star systems of coma berenices include binary , double and triple stars there are over thirty double stars in coma berenices , including 24 comae berenices with contrasting colors triple stars include 12 comae berenices , 17 comae berenices , kr comae berenices and struve 1639 over 200 variable stars are known in coma berenices , although many are obscure fk comae berenices , which varies from magnitude 8.14 to 8.33 over a period of 2.4 days , is the prototype for the fk comae berenices class of variable stars and the star in which the '' starspot '' was discovered fs comae berenices is a semi-regular variable , a red giant with a period of about two months whose magnitude varies between 6.1 and 5.3 one of these stars , tu comae berenices , may have a binary system the m100 galaxy contains about twenty cepheid variables , which were observed by the hubble space telescope coma berenices also contains alpha2 canum venaticorum variable , such as 13 comae berenices and ai comae berenices in 2019 scientists at aryabhatta research institute of observational sciences announced the discovery of 28 new variable stars in coma berenices ' globular cluster ngc 4147 five were discovered in the m100 galaxy ( ngc 4321 ) : sn 1901b , sn 1914a , sn 1959e , sn 1979c and sn 2006x m53 ( ngc 5024 ) is a globular cluster which was discovered independently by johann elert bode in 1775 and charles messier in february 1777 ; william herschel was the first to resolve it into stars the coma supercluster , itself part of the coma filament , contains the coma and leo cluster of galaxies ngc 4889 is a giant elliptical galaxy with one of the largest-known black holes ( 21 billion solar masses ) , and ngc 4921 is the cluster 's brightest spiral galaxy m85 ( ngc 4382 ) , considered elliptical or lenticular , is one of the cluster 's brighter members at magnitude nine m85 is interacting with the spiral galaxy ngc 4394 and the elliptical galaxy mcg-3-32-38 m88 ( ngc 4501 ) is a multi-arm spiral galaxy seen at about 30Â° from edge-on m91 ( ngc 4548 ) , a barred spiral galaxy with a bright , diffuse nucleus , is the faintest object in messier 's catalog at magnitude 10.2 m99 ( ngc 4254 ) is a spiral galaxy seen face-on ngc 4314 is a face-on barred spiral galaxy at a distance of 40 million light-years in 2006 a dwarf galaxy , also named coma berenices , was discovered in the constellation relativity principles , spiral nebula in coma berenices , that kind of hassle

the star systems of coma berenices include binary , double and triple stars 21 comae berenices ( proper name kissin ) is a double star with nearly equal components and an orbital period of 26 years there are over thirty double stars in coma berenices , including 24 comae berenices with contrasting colors its primary is an orange-hued giant star with a magnitude of 5.0 , 610 light-years from earth , and its secondary is a blue-white-hued star with a magnitude of 6.6 triple stars include 12 comae berenices , 17 comae berenices , kr comae berenices and struve 1639 alpha comae berenices is a possible algol variable fk comae berenices , which varies from magnitude 8.14 to 8.33 over a period of 2.4 days , is the prototype for the fk comae berenices class of variable stars and the star in which the '' starspot '' was discovered fs comae berenices is a semi-regular variable , a red giant with a period of about two months whose magnitude varies between 6.1 and 5.3 one of these stars , tu comae berenices , may have a binary system coma berenices also contains alpha2 canum venaticorum variable , such as 13 comae berenices and ai comae berenices in 2019 scientists at aryabhatta research institute of observational sciences announced the discovery of 28 new variable stars in coma berenices ' globular cluster ngc 4147 five were discovered in the m100 galaxy ( ngc 4321 ) : sn 1901b , sn 1914a , sn 1959e , sn 1979c and sn 2006x sn 1940b , discovered on 5 may 1940 , was the first observed type ii supernova coma berenices also contains the neutron star rbs 1223 and the pulsar psr b1237+25 in 1975 , the first extra-solar source of extreme ultraviolet , the white dwarf hz 43 , was discovered in coma berenices coma berenices has seven known exoplanets the cluster is spread over a huge region ( more than five degrees across ) near gamma comae berenices its brightest members are ngc 4874 and ngc 4889 , both with a magnitude of 13 ; most others are magnitude 15 or dimmer ngc 4889 is a giant elliptical galaxy with one of the largest-known black holes ( 21 billion solar masses ) , and ngc 4921 is the cluster 's brightest spiral galaxy thumb m64 ( ngc 4826 ) is known as the black eye galaxy because of the prominent dark dust lane in front of the galaxy 's bright nucleus in 2006 a dwarf galaxy , also named coma berenices , was discovered in the constellation w comae berenices ( or on 231 ) , a blazar in the constellation 's northwest , was originally designated a variable star and later found to be a bl lacertae object

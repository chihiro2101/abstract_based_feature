the star systems of coma berenices include binary , double and triple stars 21 comae berenices ( proper name kissin ) is a double star with nearly equal components and an orbital period of 26 years there are over thirty double stars in coma berenices , including 24 comae berenices with contrasting colors its primary is an orange-hued giant star with a magnitude of 5.0 , 610 light-years from earth , and its secondary is a blue-white-hued star with a magnitude of 6.6 triple stars include 12 comae berenices , 17 comae berenices , kr comae berenices and struve 1639 over 200 variable stars are known in coma berenices , although many are obscure alpha comae berenices is a possible algol variable fk comae berenices , which varies from magnitude 8.14 to 8.33 over a period of 2.4 days , is the prototype for the fk comae berenices class of variable stars and the star in which the '' starspot '' was discovered r comae berenices is a mira variable with a maximum magnitude of almost 7 one of these stars , tu comae berenices , may have a binary system coma berenices also contains alpha2 canum venaticorum variable , such as 13 comae berenices and ai comae berenices a number of supernovae have been discovered in coma berenices due to its great distance from earth ( 4.7 billion light-years ) , it was not visible to the naked eye and was discovered telescopically coma berenices also contains the neutron star rbs 1223 and the pulsar psr b1237+25 in 1975 , the first extra-solar source of extreme ultraviolet , the white dwarf hz 43 , was discovered in coma berenices it is a large , diffuse open cluster of about 50 stars ranging between magnitudes five and ten , including several of coma berenices ' stars which are visible to the naked eye ngc 4147 is a somewhat dimmer globular cluster , with a much-smaller apparent size coma berenices contains the northern portion of the virgo cluster ( also known as the comaâ€“virgo cluster ) , about 60 million light-years away ngc 4314 is a face-on barred spiral galaxy at a distance of 40 million light-years the galaxy 's prodigious star formation began five million years ago , in a region with a diameter of 1,000 light-years in 2006 a dwarf galaxy , also named coma berenices , was discovered in the constellation since callimachus ' poem , coma berenices has been occasionally featured in culture

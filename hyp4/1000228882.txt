origin in the chiaroscuro drawing the term chiaroscuro originated during the renaissance as drawing on coloured paper , where the artist worked from the paper 's base tone toward light using white gouache , and toward dark using ink , bodycolour or watercolour such works are called '' chiaroscuro drawings '' , but may only be described in modern museum terminology by such formulae as '' pen on prepared paper , heightened with white bodycolour '' when discussing italian art , the term sometimes is used to mean painted images in monochrome or two colours , more generally known in english by the french equivalent , grisaille the term broadened in meaning early on to cover all strong contrasts in illumination between light and dark areas in art , which is now the primary meaning the more technical use of the term chiaroscuro is the effect of light modelling in painting , drawing , or printmaking , where three-dimensional volume is suggested by the value gradation of colour and the analytical division of light and shadow shapes—often called '' shading '' chiaroscuro is one of four modes of painting colours available to italian high renaissance painters , along with cangiante , sfumato and unione the term is mostly used to describe compositions where at least some principal elements of the main composition show the transition between light and dark , as in the baglioni and geertgen tot sint jans paintings illustrated above and below 1600 , in nicholas hilliard , roy strong , 2002 , p.24 , michael joseph ltd , london , in drawings and prints , modelling chiaroscuro often is achieved by the use of hatching , or shading by parallel lines chiaroscuro woodcuts are old master prints in woodcut using two or more blocks printed in different colours ; they do not necessarily feature strong contrasts of light and dark they were first produced to achieve similar effects to chiaroscuro drawings in italy , chiaroscuro woodcuts were produced without keyblocks to achieve a very different effect she described the infant jesus as emitting light ; depictions increasingly reduced other light sources in the scene to emphasize this effect , and the nativity remained very commonly treated with chiaroscuro through to the baroque as with some later painters , in their hands the effect was of stillness and calm rather than the drama with which it would be used during the baroque the use of dark subjects dramatically lit by a shaft of light from a single constricted and often unseen source , was a compositional device developed by ugo da carpi ( c the influences of caravaggio and elsheimer were strong on peter paul rubens , who exploited their respective approaches to tenebrosity for dramatic effect in paintings such as the raising of the cross ( 1610–1611 ) especially since the strong twentieth-century rise in the reputation of caravaggio , in non-specialist use the term is mainly used for strong chiaroscuro effects such as his , or rembrandt 's chiaroscuro also is used in cinematography to indicate extreme low key and high-contrast lighting to create distinct areas of light and darkness in films , especially in black and white films caligari ( 1920 ) , nosferatu ( 1922 ) , metropolis ( 1927 ) the hunchback of notre dame ( 1939 ) , the devil and daniel webster ( 1941 ) , and the black and white scenes in andrei tarkovsky 's stalker ( 1979 ) 1777 file : goya christ.jpg christ on the mount of olives by francisco goya , 1819 chiaroscuro as a major element in composition : photography file : golden retriever carlos im wald ( 10580536693 ) chiaroscuro woodcut from the metropolitan museum of art timeline of art history chiaroscuro woodcut from spencer museum of art , kansas ( modelling ) chiaroscuro from evansville university

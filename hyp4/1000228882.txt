the term chiaroscuro originated during the renaissance as drawing on coloured paper , where the artist worked from the paper 's base tone toward light using white gouache , and toward dark using ink , bodycolour or watercolour such works are called '' chiaroscuro drawings '' , but may only be described in modern museum terminology by such formulae as '' pen on prepared paper , heightened with white bodycolour '' when discussing italian art , the term sometimes is used to mean painted images in monochrome or two colours , more generally known in english by the french equivalent , grisaille the term broadened in meaning early on to cover all strong contrasts in illumination between light and dark areas in art , which is now the primary meaning the more technical use of the term chiaroscuro is the effect of light modelling in painting , drawing , or printmaking , where three-dimensional volume is suggested by the value gradation of colour and the analytical division of light and shadow shapes—often called '' shading '' the technique also survived in rather crude standardized form in byzantine art and was refined again in the middle ages to become standard by the early fifteenth-century in painting and manuscript illumination in italy and flanders , and then spread to all western art chiaroscuro is one of four modes of painting colours available to italian high renaissance painters , along with cangiante , sfumato and unione to further complicate matters , however , the compositional chiaroscuro of the contrast between model and background probably would not be described using this term , as the two elements are almost completely separated the term is mostly used to describe compositions where at least some principal elements of the main composition show the transition between light and dark , as in the baglioni and geertgen tot sint jans paintings illustrated above and below 1600 , in nicholas hilliard , roy strong , 2002 , p.24 , michael joseph ltd , london , in drawings and prints , modelling chiaroscuro often is achieved by the use of hatching , or shading by parallel lines after some early experiments in book-printing , the true chiaroscuro woodcut conceived for two blocks was probably first invented by lucas cranach the elder in germany in 1508 or 1509 , though he backdated some of his first prints and added tone blocks to some prints first produced for monochrome printing , swiftly followed by hans burgkmair the elder landau and parshall , 179-192 ; renaissance impressions : chiaroscuro woodcuts from the collections of georg baselitz and the albertina , vienna , royal academy , london , march–june 2014 , exhibition guide in italy , chiaroscuro woodcuts were produced without keyblocks to achieve a very different effect strong chiaroscuro became a popular effect during the sixteenth century in mannerism and baroque art the use of dark subjects dramatically lit by a shaft of light from a single constricted and often unseen source , was a compositional device developed by ugo da carpi ( c a particular genre that developed was the nocturnal scene lit by candlelight , which looked back to earlier northern artists such as geertgen tot sint jans and more immediately , to the innovations of caravaggio and elsheimer chiaroscuro also is used in cinematography to indicate extreme low key and high-contrast lighting to create distinct areas of light and darkness in films , especially in black and white films in photography , chiaroscuro can be achieved with the use of '' rembrandt lighting '' eugene smith , josef koudelka , garry winogrand , lothar wolleh , annie leibovitz , floria sigismondi , and ralph gibson may be considered some of the modern masters of chiaroscuro in documentary photography 1450 uses chiaroscuro modelling in all elements of the painting file : sandro botticelli 054.jpg saint sebastian by botticelli , 1474 file : retrato de juan pareja , by diego velázquez.jpg portrait of juan de pareja , c 1777 file : goya christ.jpg christ on the mount of olives by francisco goya , 1819 chiaroscuro as a major element in composition : photography file : golden retriever carlos im wald ( 10580536693 )

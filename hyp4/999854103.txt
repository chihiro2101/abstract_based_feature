pneumatic and hydraulic shock absorbers are used in conjunction with cushions and springs an automobile shock absorber contains spring-loaded check valves and orifices to control the flow of oil through an internal piston ( see below ) , automotive handbook 4th edition , robert bosch gmbh , 1996 , , page 584 one design consideration , when designing or choosing a shock absorber , is where that energy will go in most shock absorbers , energy is converted to heat inside the viscous fluid in hydraulic cylinders , the hydraulic fluid heats up , while in air cylinders , the hot air is usually exhausted to the atmosphere in other types of shock absorbers , such as electromagnetic types , the dissipated energy can be stored and used later in a vehicle , shock absorbers reduce the effect of traveling over rough ground , leading to improved ride quality and vehicle handling shock absorbers use valving of oil and gasses to absorb excess energy from the springs spring-based shock absorbers commonly use coil springs or leaf springs , though torsion bars are used in torsional shocks as well ideal springs alone , however , are not shock absorbers , as springs only store and do not dissipate or absorb energy vehicles typically employ both hydraulic shock absorbers and springs or torsion bars these friction disk shock absorbers were also fitted to many cars one of the problems with motor cars was the large variation in sprung weight between lightly loaded and fully loaded , especially for the rear springs it does not seem to have gone into production right away , whereas mechanical dampers such as the gabriel snubber started being fitted in the late 1900s ( also the similar stromberg anti-shox ) these used a belt coiled inside a device such that it freely wound in under the action of a coiled spring , but met friction when drawn out this contained a spring inside the telescopic unit like the pure spring type 'shock absorbers ' mentioned above , but also oil and an internal valve so that the oil damped in the rebound direction most vehicular shock absorbers are either twin-tube or mono-tube types with some variations on these themes when the piston is forced up or down by bumps in the road , hydraulic fluid moves between different chambers via small holes or '' orifices '' in the piston and via the valve , converting the '' shock '' energy into heat which must then be dissipated twin-tube gas charged shock absorbers represent the vast majority of original modern vehicle suspensions installations or so ) which can actually help it to support some of the vehicle 's weight , something which no other shock absorber is designed to do : compression of a gas , for example pneumatic shock absorbers , which can act like springs as the air pressure is building to resist the force on it in aircraft landing gear , air shock absorbers may be combined with hydraulic damping to reduce bounce some shock absorbers allow tuning of the ride via control of the valve by a manual adjustment provided at the shock absorber

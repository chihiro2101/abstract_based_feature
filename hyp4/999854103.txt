pneumatic and hydraulic shock absorbers are used in conjunction with cushions and springs an automobile shock absorber contains spring-loaded check valves and orifices to control the flow of oil through an internal piston ( see below ) , automotive handbook 4th edition , robert bosch gmbh , 1996 , , page 584 one design consideration , when designing or choosing a shock absorber , is where that energy will go in most shock absorbers , energy is converted to heat inside the viscous fluid in hydraulic cylinders , the hydraulic fluid heats up , while in air cylinders , the hot air is usually exhausted to the atmosphere in other types of shock absorbers , such as electromagnetic types , the dissipated energy can be stored and used later in general terms , shock absorbers help cushion vehicles on uneven roads shock absorbers use valving of oil and gasses to absorb excess energy from the springs spring-based shock absorbers commonly use coil springs or leaf springs , though torsion bars are used in torsional shocks as well ideal springs alone , however , are not shock absorbers , as springs only store and do not dissipate or absorb energy vehicles typically employ both hydraulic shock absorbers and springs or torsion bars in this combination , '' shock absorber '' refers specifically to the hydraulic piston that absorbs and dissipates vibration one of the features of these springs was that the friction between the leaves offered a degree of damping , and in a 1912 review of vehicle suspension , the lack of this characteristic in helical springs was the reason it was '' impossible '' to use them as main springs motorcycle front suspension adopted coil sprung druid forks from about 1906 , and similar designs later added rotary friction dampers , which damped both ways - but they were adjustable ( e.g one of the problems with motor cars was the large variation in sprung weight between lightly loaded and fully loaded , especially for the rear springs horock came up with a design in 1901 that had hydraulic damping , it worked in one direction only types of vehicle shock absorbers its overall structure is very similar to the twin-tube , but a low-pressure charge of nitrogen gas is added to the reserve tube coilover shock absorbers are usually a kind of twin-tube gas charged shock absorber inside the helical road spring simple vehicles with no separate shock absorbers are damped , to some extent , by the hysteresis of their springs and frames today , many shock absorbers are pressurized with compressed nitrogen , to reduce the tendency for the oil to cavitate under heavy use some shock absorbers allow tuning of the ride via control of the valve by a manual adjustment provided at the shock absorber shock absorbers are mounted through silent blocks without a swivel device and are equipped with a small diameter rod

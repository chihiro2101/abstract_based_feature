pneumatic and hydraulic shock absorbers are used in conjunction with cushions and springs an automobile shock absorber contains spring-loaded check valves and orifices to control the flow of oil through an internal piston ( see below ) , automotive handbook 4th edition , robert bosch gmbh , 1996 , , page 584 one design consideration , when designing or choosing a shock absorber , is where that energy will go in most shock absorbers , energy is converted to heat inside the viscous fluid in hydraulic cylinders , the hydraulic fluid heats up , while in air cylinders , the hot air is usually exhausted to the atmosphere in other types of shock absorbers , such as electromagnetic types , the dissipated energy can be stored and used later in a vehicle , shock absorbers reduce the effect of traveling over rough ground , leading to improved ride quality and vehicle handling while shock absorbers serve the purpose of limiting excessive suspension movement , their intended sole purpose is to damp spring oscillations shock absorbers use valving of oil and gasses to absorb excess energy from the springs along with hysteresis in the tire itself , they damp the energy stored in the motion of the unsprung weight up and down ideal springs alone , however , are not shock absorbers , as springs only store and do not dissipate or absorb energy vehicles typically employ both hydraulic shock absorbers and springs or torsion bars in this combination , '' shock absorber '' refers specifically to the hydraulic piston that absorbs and dissipates vibration when heavily loaded the springs could bottom out , and apart from fitting rubber 'bump stops ' , there were attempts to use heavy main springs with auxiliary springs to smooth the ride when lightly loaded , which were often called 'shock absorbers ' most vehicular shock absorbers are either twin-tube or mono-tube types with some variations on these themes when the piston is forced up or down by bumps in the road , hydraulic fluid moves between different chambers via small holes or '' orifices '' in the piston and via the valve , converting the '' shock '' energy into heat which must then be dissipated twin-tube gas charged shock absorbers represent the vast majority of original modern vehicle suspensions installations , on bumpy sections of roadsâ€” the stiffening gives the driver greater control of movement over the vehicle so its range on either side of the comfort zone is called the '' control zone '' ) the next phase in shock absorber evolution was the development of a shock absorber that could sense and respond to not just situational changes from '' bumpy '' to '' smooth '' but to individual bumps in the road in a near instantaneous reaction control '' tradeoff , it also reduced pitch during vehicle braking and roll during turns coilover shock absorbers are usually a kind of twin-tube gas charged shock absorber inside the helical road spring thumb left the principal design alternative to the twin-tube form has been the mono-tube shock absorber which was considered a revolutionary advancement when it appeared in the 1950s some shock absorbers allow tuning of the ride via control of the valve by a manual adjustment provided at the shock absorber

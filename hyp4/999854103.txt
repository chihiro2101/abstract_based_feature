pneumatic and hydraulic shock absorbers are used in conjunction with cushions and springs an automobile shock absorber contains spring-loaded check valves and orifices to control the flow of oil through an internal piston ( see below ) , automotive handbook 4th edition , robert bosch gmbh , 1996 , , page 584 one design consideration , when designing or choosing a shock absorber , is where that energy will go in most shock absorbers , energy is converted to heat inside the viscous fluid in other types of shock absorbers , such as electromagnetic types , the dissipated energy can be stored and used later in a vehicle , shock absorbers reduce the effect of traveling over rough ground , leading to improved ride quality and vehicle handling shock absorbers use valving of oil and gasses to absorb excess energy from the springs along with hysteresis in the tire itself , they damp the energy stored in the motion of the unsprung weight up and down spring-based shock absorbers commonly use coil springs or leaf springs , though torsion bars are used in torsional shocks as well ideal springs alone , however , are not shock absorbers , as springs only store and do not dissipate or absorb energy vehicles typically employ both hydraulic shock absorbers and springs or torsion bars in this combination , '' shock absorber '' refers specifically to the hydraulic piston that absorbs and dissipates vibration these friction disk shock absorbers were also fitted to many cars realising that the spring and vehicle combination bounced with a characteristic frequency , these auxiliary springs were designed with a different period , but were not a solution to the problem that the spring rebound after striking a bump could throw you out of your seat the telesco unit was fitted at the rear end of the leaf spring , in place of the rear spring to chassis mount , so that it formed part of the springing system , albeit a hydraulically damped part also known as a '' two-tube '' shock absorber , this device consists of two nested cylindrical tubes , an inner tube that is called the '' working tube '' or the '' pressure tube '' , and an outer tube called the '' reserve tube '' the result of this alteration is a dramatic reduction in '' foaming '' or '' aeration '' , the undesirable outcome of a twin-tube overheating and failing which presents as foaming hydraulic fluid dripping out of the assembly in a psd shock absorber , which still consists of two nested tubes and still contains nitrogen gas , a set of grooves has been added to the pressure tube coilover shock absorbers are usually a kind of twin-tube gas charged shock absorber inside the helical road spring : compression of a gas , for example pneumatic shock absorbers , which can act like springs as the air pressure is building to resist the force on it conventional shock absorbers can be combined with air suspension springs - an alternate way to achieve ride-height control , and self leveling suspension some shock absorbers allow tuning of the ride via control of the valve by a manual adjustment provided at the shock absorber shock absorbers are mounted through silent blocks without a swivel device and are equipped with a small diameter rod

pneumatic and hydraulic shock absorbers are used in conjunction with cushions and springs an automobile shock absorber contains spring-loaded check valves and orifices to control the flow of oil through an internal piston ( see below ) , automotive handbook 4th edition , robert bosch gmbh , 1996 , , page 584 one design consideration , when designing or choosing a shock absorber , is where that energy will go in other types of shock absorbers , such as electromagnetic types , the dissipated energy can be stored and used later in a vehicle , shock absorbers reduce the effect of traveling over rough ground , leading to improved ride quality and vehicle handling while shock absorbers serve the purpose of limiting excessive suspension movement , their intended sole purpose is to damp spring oscillations shock absorbers use valving of oil and gasses to absorb excess energy from the springs spring rates are chosen by the manufacturer based on the weight of the vehicle , loaded and unloaded spring-based shock absorbers commonly use coil springs or leaf springs , though torsion bars are used in torsional shocks as well ideal springs alone , however , are not shock absorbers , as springs only store and do not dissipate or absorb energy vehicles typically employ both hydraulic shock absorbers and springs or torsion bars one of the features of these springs was that the friction between the leaves offered a degree of damping , and in a 1912 review of vehicle suspension , the lack of this characteristic in helical springs was the reason it was '' impossible '' to use them as main springs one of the problems with motor cars was the large variation in sprung weight between lightly loaded and fully loaded , especially for the rear springs when heavily loaded the springs could bottom out , and apart from fitting rubber 'bump stops ' , there were attempts to use heavy main springs with auxiliary springs to smooth the ride when lightly loaded , which were often called 'shock absorbers ' this contained a spring inside the telescopic unit like the pure spring type 'shock absorbers ' mentioned above , but also oil and an internal valve so that the oil damped in the rebound direction types of vehicle shock absorbers also known as a '' two-tube '' shock absorber , this device consists of two nested cylindrical tubes , an inner tube that is called the '' working tube '' or the '' pressure tube '' , and an outer tube called the '' reserve tube '' coilover shock absorbers are usually a kind of twin-tube gas charged shock absorber inside the helical road spring it also does not have a compression valve , whose role has been taken up by the dividing piston , and although it contains nitrogen gas , the gas in a mono-tube shock is under high pressure ( 260-360 p.s.i or so ) which can actually help it to support some of the vehicle 's weight , something which no other shock absorber is designed to do in very heavy duty units used for racing or off-road use , there may even be a secondary cylinder connected to the shock absorber to act as a reservoir for the oil and pressurized gas conventional shock absorbers can be combined with air suspension springs - an alternate way to achieve ride-height control , and self leveling suspension some shock absorbers allow tuning of the ride via control of the valve by a manual adjustment provided at the shock absorber

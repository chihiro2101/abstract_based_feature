pneumatic and hydraulic shock absorbers are used in conjunction with cushions and springs an automobile shock absorber contains spring-loaded check valves and orifices to control the flow of oil through an internal piston ( see below ) , automotive handbook 4th edition , robert bosch gmbh , 1996 , , page 584 one design consideration , when designing or choosing a shock absorber , is where that energy will go in most shock absorbers , energy is converted to heat inside the viscous fluid in hydraulic cylinders , the hydraulic fluid heats up , while in air cylinders , the hot air is usually exhausted to the atmosphere in other types of shock absorbers , such as electromagnetic types , the dissipated energy can be stored and used later in a vehicle , shock absorbers reduce the effect of traveling over rough ground , leading to improved ride quality and vehicle handling while shock absorbers serve the purpose of limiting excessive suspension movement , their intended sole purpose is to damp spring oscillations shock absorbers use valving of oil and gasses to absorb excess energy from the springs along with hysteresis in the tire itself , they damp the energy stored in the motion of the unsprung weight up and down spring-based shock absorbers commonly use coil springs or leaf springs , though torsion bars are used in torsional shocks as well ideal springs alone , however , are not shock absorbers , as springs only store and do not dissipate or absorb energy vehicles typically employ both hydraulic shock absorbers and springs or torsion bars one of the features of these springs was that the friction between the leaves offered a degree of damping , and in a 1912 review of vehicle suspension , the lack of this characteristic in helical springs was the reason it was '' impossible '' to use them as main springs these friction disk shock absorbers were also fitted to many cars one of the problems with motor cars was the large variation in sprung weight between lightly loaded and fully loaded , especially for the rear springs horock came up with a design in 1901 that had hydraulic damping , it worked in one direction only this contained a spring inside the telescopic unit like the pure spring type 'shock absorbers ' mentioned above , but also oil and an internal valve so that the oil damped in the rebound direction types of vehicle shock absorbers when the piston is forced up or down by bumps in the road , hydraulic fluid moves between different chambers via small holes or '' orifices '' in the piston and via the valve , converting the '' shock '' energy into heat which must then be dissipated it also does not have a compression valve , whose role has been taken up by the dividing piston , and although it contains nitrogen gas , the gas in a mono-tube shock is under high pressure ( 260-360 p.s.i conventional shock absorbers can be combined with air suspension springs - an alternate way to achieve ride-height control , and self leveling suspension some shock absorbers allow tuning of the ride via control of the valve by a manual adjustment provided at the shock absorber

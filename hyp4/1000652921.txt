the former is a systemic response mediated in large part through the toll and imd pathways , which are parallel systems for detecting microbes other pathways including the stress response pathways jak-stat and p38 , nutritional signalling via foxo , and jnk cell death signalling are all involved in key physiological responses to infection the fat body is the primary secretory organ and produces key immune molecules upon infection , such as serine proteases and antimicrobial peptides ( amps ) the cellular immune response instead refers to the direct activity of blood cells ( hemocytes ) in drosophila , which are analogous to mammalian monocytes/macrophages hemocytes also possess a significant role in mediating humoral immune responses such as the melanization reaction the immune response to infection can involve up to 2,423 genes , or 13.7 % of the genome although the fly 's transcriptional response to microbial challenge is highly specific to individual pathogens , drosophila differentially expresses a core group of 252 genes upon infection with most bacteria drosophila also possesses several immune mechanisms to both shape the microbiota and prevent excessive immune responses upon detection of microbial stimuli unlike mammals , drosophila have innate immunity but lack an adaptive immune response however , the core elements of this innate immune response are conserved between humans and fruit flies various genetic tools , protocols , and assays make drosophila a classical model for studying the innate immune system , which has even included immune research on the international space station the first description of toll-like receptors involved in the response to infection was performed in drosophila this activation leads to serine protease signalling cascades ultimately activating the cytokine spätzle alternatively , microbial proteases can directly cleave serine proteases like persephone that then propagate signalling the pathway culminates with the translocation of the nf-κb transcription factors dorsal and dif ( dorsal-related immunity factor ) into the nucleus the toll pathway was identified by its regulation of antimicrobial peptides ( amps ) , including the antifungal peptide drosomycin . the drosophila imd pathway consequently , flies deficient for amps resemble imd pathway mutants in terms of susceptibility to bacterial infection the relish transcription factor has also been implicated in processes regarding cell proliferation and neurodegeneration either through autophagy , or autoimmune toxicity multiple elements of the drosophila jak-stat signalling pathway bear direct homology to human jak-stat pathway genes jak-stat signalling is induced upon various organismal stresses such as heat stress , dehydration , or infection jak-stat induction leads to the production of a number of stress response proteins including thioester-containing proteins ( teps ) , turandots , and the putative antimicrobial peptide listericin as a consequence , flies lacking teps are susceptible to infection by toll pathway challenges this has been demonstrated both through genetic tools to generate flies lacking hemocytes , or through injecting microglass beads or lipid droplets that saturate hemocyte ability to phagocytose a secondary infection these hemocytes derive from two waves of hematopoiesis , one occurring in the early embryo and one occurring during development from larva to adult wild-type flies show an activity rhythm with a frequency of about a day ( 24 hours ) mutating the genderblind gene , also known as cg6070 , alters the sexual behavior of drosophila , turning the flies bisexual as with most insects , aggressive behaviors between male flies commonly occur in the presence of courting a female and when competing for resources thus , it often causes wing damage , which reduces their fitness by removing their ability to fly and mate in order for aggression to occur , male flies produce sounds to communicate their intent a 2017 study found that songs promoting aggression contain pulses occurring at longer intervals however , upon inserting a mutation that makes the flies irresponsive to cva , no aggressive behaviors were seen the r1-r6 photoreceptor cells express rhodopsin1 ( rh1 ) , which absorbs blue light ( 480 & nbsp ; nm ) calcium binds to proteins such as calmodulin ( cam ) and an eye-specific kinase ( pkc ) known as inac for example , disruption of the interaction between inac , the protein kinase c , and inad results in a delay in inactivation of the light response

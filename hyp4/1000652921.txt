the former is a systemic response mediated in large part through the toll and imd pathways , which are parallel systems for detecting microbes other pathways including the stress response pathways jak-stat and p38 , nutritional signalling via foxo , and jnk cell death signalling are all involved in key physiological responses to infection amps are secreted into the hemolymph and bind infectious bacteria and fungi , killing them by forming pores in their cell walls or inhibiting intracellular processes the cellular immune response instead refers to the direct activity of blood cells ( hemocytes ) in drosophila , which are analogous to mammalian monocytes/macrophages hemocytes also possess a significant role in mediating humoral immune responses such as the melanization reaction although the fly 's transcriptional response to microbial challenge is highly specific to individual pathogens , drosophila differentially expresses a core group of 252 genes upon infection with most bacteria this core group of genes is associated with gene ontology categories such as antimicrobial response , stress response , secretion , neuron-like , reproduction , and metabolism among others drosophila also possesses several immune mechanisms to both shape the microbiota and prevent excessive immune responses upon detection of microbial stimuli the first description of toll-like receptors involved in the response to infection was performed in drosophila the toll pathway in drosophila is homologous to toll-like pathways in mammals this regulatory cascade is initiated following pathogen recognition by pattern recognition receptors , particularly of gram-positive bacteria , parasites , and fungal infection this activation leads to serine protease signalling cascades ultimately activating the cytokine spätzle the pathway culminates with the translocation of the nf-κb transcription factors dorsal and dif ( dorsal-related immunity factor ) into the nucleus upon infection , amps increase in expression sometimes by 1000-fold , providing unmistakable readouts of pathway activation the toll pathway also interacts with renal filtration of microbiota-derived peptidoglycan , maintaining immune homeostasis the imd pathway is orthologous to human tnf receptor superfamily signalling , and is triggered by gram-negative bacteria through recognition by peptidoglycan recognition proteins ( pgrp ) including both soluble receptors and cell surface receptors ( pgrp-le and lc , respectively ) imd signalling culminates in the translocation of the nf-κb transcription factor relish into the nucleus , leading to the upregulation of imd-responsive genes including the amp diptericin consequently , flies deficient for amps resemble imd pathway mutants in terms of susceptibility to bacterial infection imd signalling and relish specifically are also involved in the regulation of immunity at surface epithelia including in the gut and respiratory tracts the imd-regulated amp diptericin b is also produced by the fat body specifically in the head , and diptericin b is required for long-term memory formation jak-stat signalling is induced upon various organismal stresses such as heat stress , dehydration , or infection jak-stat induction leads to the production of a number of stress response proteins including thioester-containing proteins ( teps ) , turandots , and the putative antimicrobial peptide listericin as a consequence , flies lacking teps are susceptible to infection by toll pathway challenges this has been demonstrated both through genetic tools to generate flies lacking hemocytes , or through injecting microglass beads or lipid droplets that saturate hemocyte ability to phagocytose a secondary infection flies treated like this fail to phagocytose bacteria upon infection , and are correspondingly susceptible to infection cancerous cells ) by producing eiger , a tumor necrosis factor signalling molecule that promotes jnk signalling and ultimately cell death and apoptosis this clock is found in a wide range of fly cells , but the clock-bearing cells that control activity are several dozen neurons in the fly 's central brain since then , benzer and others have used behavioral screens to isolate genes involved in vision , olfaction , audition , learning/memory , courtship , pain , and other processes , such as longevity ) were isolated by william '' chip '' quinn while in benzer 's lab , and were eventually shown to encode components of an intracellular signaling pathway involving cyclic amp , protein kinase a , and a transcription factor known as creb male flies sing to the females during courtship using their wings to generate sound , and some of the genetics of sexual behavior have been characterized mutating the genderblind gene , also known as cg6070 , alters the sexual behavior of drosophila , turning the flies bisexual an example is cva , an anti-aphrodisiac pheromone used by males to mark females after copulation and to deter other males from mating wild-type flies have reddish pigment cells , which serve to absorb excess blue light so the fly is not blinded by ambient light disruption of the complex by mutations in either the pdz domains or the target proteins reduces the efficiency of signaling this means that grooming behaviors that occur at the beginning of the sequence prevent those that come later in the sequence from occurring simultaneously , as the grooming sequence consists of mutually exclusive behaviors

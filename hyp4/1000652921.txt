the former is a systemic response mediated in large part through the toll and imd pathways , which are parallel systems for detecting microbes other pathways including the stress response pathways jak-stat and p38 , nutritional signalling via foxo , and jnk cell death signalling are all involved in key physiological responses to infection amps are secreted into the hemolymph and bind infectious bacteria and fungi , killing them by forming pores in their cell walls or inhibiting intracellular processes this core group of genes is associated with gene ontology categories such as antimicrobial response , stress response , secretion , neuron-like , reproduction , and metabolism among others for instance , secreted pgrps with amidase activity scavenge and degrade immunostimulatory dap-type pgn in order to block imd activation unlike mammals , drosophila have innate immunity but lack an adaptive immune response however , the core elements of this innate immune response are conserved between humans and fruit flies various genetic tools , protocols , and assays make drosophila a classical model for studying the innate immune system , which has even included immune research on the international space station the first description of toll-like receptors involved in the response to infection was performed in drosophila this regulatory cascade is initiated following pathogen recognition by pattern recognition receptors , particularly of gram-positive bacteria , parasites , and fungal infection the pathway culminates with the translocation of the nf-κb transcription factors dorsal and dif ( dorsal-related immunity factor ) into the nucleus another group of toll-regulated amp-like effectors includes the bomanins , which appear to be responsible for the bulk of toll-mediated immune defence , however bomanins alone do not exhibit antimicrobial activity without this , toll signalling is constitutively activated , resulting in a severe drain on nutrient reserves and a significant stress on host physiology the relish transcription factor has also been implicated in processes regarding cell proliferation and neurodegeneration either through autophagy , or autoimmune toxicity relish-regulated amps such as defensin and diptericin also have anti-cancer properties promoting tumour clearance the imd-regulated amp diptericin b is also produced by the fat body specifically in the head , and diptericin b is required for long-term memory formation multiple elements of the drosophila jak-stat signalling pathway bear direct homology to human jak-stat pathway genes jak-stat induction leads to the production of a number of stress response proteins including thioester-containing proteins ( teps ) , turandots , and the putative antimicrobial peptide listericin for instance , the teps appear to promote phagocytosis of gram-positive bacteria and the induction of the toll pathway cancerous cells ) by producing eiger , a tumor necrosis factor signalling molecule that promotes jnk signalling and ultimately cell death and apoptosis in 1971 , ron konopka and seymour benzer published '' clock mutants of drosophila melanogaster '' , a paper describing the first mutations that affected an animal 's behavior wild-type flies show an activity rhythm with a frequency of about a day ( 24 hours ) they found mutants with faster and slower rhythms , as well as broken rhythms—flies that move and rest in random spurts this clock is found in a wide range of fly cells , but the clock-bearing cells that control activity are several dozen neurons in the fly 's central brain since then , benzer and others have used behavioral screens to isolate genes involved in vision , olfaction , audition , learning/memory , courtship , pain , and other processes , such as longevity males distinguish between conspecific males and females and direct persistent courtship preferentially toward females thanks to a female-specific sex pheromone which is mostly produced by the female 's tergites young for their works using fruit flies in understanding the '' molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm '' male flies sing to the females during courtship using their wings to generate sound , and some of the genetics of sexual behavior have been characterized in particular , the fruitless gene has several different splice forms , and male flies expressing female splice forms have female-like behavior and vice versa an example is cva , an anti-aphrodisiac pheromone used by males to mark females after copulation and to deter other males from mating this male-specific pheromone causes an increase in male-male aggression when detected by another male 's taste however , upon inserting a mutation that makes the flies irresponsive to cva , no aggressive behaviors were seen specifically , this occurs through the impairment of octopamine and dopamine signaling , which are important pathways for regulating arousal in insects the enzymes needed for pigment synthesis are then transported to the cell 's pigment granule , which holds pigment precursor molecules however , in vertebrates , the g protein is transducin , while the g protein in invertebrates is gq ( dgq in drosophila )

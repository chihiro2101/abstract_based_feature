the former is a systemic response mediated in large part through the toll and imd pathways , which are parallel systems for detecting microbes other pathways including the stress response pathways jak-stat and p38 , nutritional signalling via foxo , and jnk cell death signalling are all involved in key physiological responses to infection the fat body is the primary secretory organ and produces key immune molecules upon infection , such as serine proteases and antimicrobial peptides ( amps ) amps are secreted into the hemolymph and bind infectious bacteria and fungi , killing them by forming pores in their cell walls or inhibiting intracellular processes the cellular immune response instead refers to the direct activity of blood cells ( hemocytes ) in drosophila , which are analogous to mammalian monocytes/macrophages hemocytes also possess a significant role in mediating humoral immune responses such as the melanization reaction although the fly 's transcriptional response to microbial challenge is highly specific to individual pathogens , drosophila differentially expresses a core group of 252 genes upon infection with most bacteria drosophila also possesses several immune mechanisms to both shape the microbiota and prevent excessive immune responses upon detection of microbial stimuli for instance , secreted pgrps with amidase activity scavenge and degrade immunostimulatory dap-type pgn in order to block imd activation unlike mammals , drosophila have innate immunity but lack an adaptive immune response however , the core elements of this innate immune response are conserved between humans and fruit flies the first description of toll-like receptors involved in the response to infection was performed in drosophila the toll pathway in drosophila is homologous to toll-like pathways in mammals this regulatory cascade is initiated following pathogen recognition by pattern recognition receptors , particularly of gram-positive bacteria , parasites , and fungal infection the toll pathway was identified by its regulation of antimicrobial peptides ( amps ) , including the antifungal peptide drosomycin . the drosophila imd pathway imd signalling culminates in the translocation of the nf-Îºb transcription factor relish into the nucleus , leading to the upregulation of imd-responsive genes including the amp diptericin consequently , flies deficient for amps resemble imd pathway mutants in terms of susceptibility to bacterial infection imd signalling and relish specifically are also involved in the regulation of immunity at surface epithelia including in the gut and respiratory tracts the relish transcription factor has also been implicated in processes regarding cell proliferation and neurodegeneration either through autophagy , or autoimmune toxicity the imd-regulated amp diptericin b is also produced by the fat body specifically in the head , and diptericin b is required for long-term memory formation multiple elements of the drosophila jak-stat signalling pathway bear direct homology to human jak-stat pathway genes this has been demonstrated both through genetic tools to generate flies lacking hemocytes , or through injecting microglass beads or lipid droplets that saturate hemocyte ability to phagocytose a secondary infection flies treated like this fail to phagocytose bacteria upon infection , and are correspondingly susceptible to infection cancerous cells ) by producing eiger , a tumor necrosis factor signalling molecule that promotes jnk signalling and ultimately cell death and apoptosis this clock is found in a wide range of fly cells , but the clock-bearing cells that control activity are several dozen neurons in the fly 's central brain males distinguish between conspecific males and females and direct persistent courtship preferentially toward females thanks to a female-specific sex pheromone which is mostly produced by the female 's tergites the nobel prize in physiology or medicine for 2017 was awarded to jeffrey c male flies sing to the females during courtship using their wings to generate sound , and some of the genetics of sexual behavior have been characterized mutating the genderblind gene , also known as cg6070 , alters the sexual behavior of drosophila , turning the flies bisexual an example is cva , an anti-aphrodisiac pheromone used by males to mark females after copulation and to deter other males from mating this male-specific pheromone causes an increase in male-male aggression when detected by another male 's taste wild-type flies have reddish pigment cells , which serve to absorb excess blue light so the fly is not blinded by ambient light this hierarchy does not prevent drosophila from returning to grooming behaviors that have already been accessed in the grooming sequence like many other hexapod insects , drosophila typically walk using a tripod gait

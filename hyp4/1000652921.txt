other pathways including the stress response pathways jak-stat and p38 , nutritional signalling via foxo , and jnk cell death signalling are all involved in key physiological responses to infection the fat body is the primary secretory organ and produces key immune molecules upon infection , such as serine proteases and antimicrobial peptides ( amps ) the cellular immune response instead refers to the direct activity of blood cells ( hemocytes ) in drosophila , which are analogous to mammalian monocytes/macrophages the immune response to infection can involve up to 2,423 genes , or 13.7 % of the genome although the fly 's transcriptional response to microbial challenge is highly specific to individual pathogens , drosophila differentially expresses a core group of 252 genes upon infection with most bacteria this core group of genes is associated with gene ontology categories such as antimicrobial response , stress response , secretion , neuron-like , reproduction , and metabolism among others drosophila also possesses several immune mechanisms to both shape the microbiota and prevent excessive immune responses upon detection of microbial stimuli for instance , secreted pgrps with amidase activity scavenge and degrade immunostimulatory dap-type pgn in order to block imd activation unlike mammals , drosophila have innate immunity but lack an adaptive immune response however , the core elements of this innate immune response are conserved between humans and fruit flies as a result , the fruit fly offers a useful model of innate immunity for disentangling genetic interactions of signalling and effector function , as flies do not have to contend with interference of adaptive immune mechanisms that could confuse results the first description of toll-like receptors involved in the response to infection was performed in drosophila the pathway culminates with the translocation of the nf-κb transcription factors dorsal and dif ( dorsal-related immunity factor ) into the nucleus the toll pathway was identified by its regulation of antimicrobial peptides ( amps ) , including the antifungal peptide drosomycin upon infection , amps increase in expression sometimes by 1000-fold , providing unmistakable readouts of pathway activation imd signalling culminates in the translocation of the nf-κb transcription factor relish into the nucleus , leading to the upregulation of imd-responsive genes including the amp diptericin consequently , flies deficient for amps resemble imd pathway mutants in terms of susceptibility to bacterial infection imd signalling and relish specifically are also involved in the regulation of immunity at surface epithelia including in the gut and respiratory tracts the relish transcription factor has also been implicated in processes regarding cell proliferation and neurodegeneration either through autophagy , or autoimmune toxicity multiple elements of the drosophila jak-stat signalling pathway bear direct homology to human jak-stat pathway genes this has been demonstrated both through genetic tools to generate flies lacking hemocytes , or through injecting microglass beads or lipid droplets that saturate hemocyte ability to phagocytose a secondary infection flies treated like this fail to phagocytose bacteria upon infection , and are correspondingly susceptible to infection these hemocytes derive from two waves of hematopoiesis , one occurring in the early embryo and one occurring during development from larva to adult cancerous cells ) by producing eiger , a tumor necrosis factor signalling molecule that promotes jnk signalling and ultimately cell death and apoptosis in 1971 , ron konopka and seymour benzer published '' clock mutants of drosophila melanogaster '' , a paper describing the first mutations that affected an animal 's behavior they found mutants with faster and slower rhythms , as well as broken rhythms—flies that move and rest in random spurts work over the following 30 years has shown that these mutations ( and others like them ) affect a group of genes and their products that form a biochemical or circadian rhythm this clock is found in a wide range of fly cells , but the clock-bearing cells that control activity are several dozen neurons in the fly 's central brain for example , this technique showed that male courtship behavior is controlled by the brain specifically , when competing for food , aggression occurs based on amount of food available and is independent of any social interactions between males wild-type flies have reddish pigment cells , which serve to absorb excess blue light so the fly is not blinded by ambient light these proteins interact with other proteins and have been shown to be necessary for shut off of the light response this hierarchy does not prevent drosophila from returning to grooming behaviors that have already been accessed in the grooming sequence like many other hexapod insects , drosophila typically walk using a tripod gait in addition to stability , the robustness of a walking gait is also thought to be important in determining the gait of a fly at a particular walking speed

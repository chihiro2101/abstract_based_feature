other pathways including the stress response pathways jak-stat and p38 , nutritional signalling via foxo , and jnk cell death signalling are all involved in key physiological responses to infection the fat body is the primary secretory organ and produces key immune molecules upon infection , such as serine proteases and antimicrobial peptides ( amps ) the cellular immune response instead refers to the direct activity of blood cells ( hemocytes ) in drosophila , which are analogous to mammalian monocytes/macrophages hemocytes also possess a significant role in mediating humoral immune responses such as the melanization reaction the immune response to infection can involve up to 2,423 genes , or 13.7 % of the genome although the fly 's transcriptional response to microbial challenge is highly specific to individual pathogens , drosophila differentially expresses a core group of 252 genes upon infection with most bacteria this core group of genes is associated with gene ontology categories such as antimicrobial response , stress response , secretion , neuron-like , reproduction , and metabolism among others drosophila also possesses several immune mechanisms to both shape the microbiota and prevent excessive immune responses upon detection of microbial stimuli unlike mammals , drosophila have innate immunity but lack an adaptive immune response however , the core elements of this innate immune response are conserved between humans and fruit flies . the drosophila toll pathway the toll pathway in drosophila is homologous to toll-like pathways in mammals the cytokine spatzle then acts as the ligand for the toll pathway in flies without this , toll signalling is constitutively activated , resulting in a severe drain on nutrient reserves and a significant stress on host physiology imd signalling culminates in the translocation of the nf-Îºb transcription factor relish into the nucleus , leading to the upregulation of imd-responsive genes including the amp diptericin imd signalling and relish specifically are also involved in the regulation of immunity at surface epithelia including in the gut and respiratory tracts multiple elements of the drosophila jak-stat signalling pathway bear direct homology to human jak-stat pathway genes jak-stat induction leads to the production of a number of stress response proteins including thioester-containing proteins ( teps ) , turandots , and the putative antimicrobial peptide listericin for instance , the teps appear to promote phagocytosis of gram-positive bacteria and the induction of the toll pathway as a consequence , flies lacking teps are susceptible to infection by toll pathway challenges however drosophila hemocytes do not renew over the adult lifespan , and so the fly has a finite number of hemocytes that decrease over the course of its lifespan cancerous cells ) by producing eiger , a tumor necrosis factor signalling molecule that promotes jnk signalling and ultimately cell death and apoptosis males distinguish between conspecific males and females and direct persistent courtship preferentially toward females thanks to a female-specific sex pheromone which is mostly produced by the female 's tergites these molecules were shown to be also involved in synaptic plasticity in aplysia and mammals mutating the genderblind gene , also known as cg6070 , alters the sexual behavior of drosophila , turning the flies bisexual thus , it often causes wing damage , which reduces their fitness by removing their ability to fly and mate in order for aggression to occur , male flies produce sounds to communicate their intent however , upon inserting a mutation that makes the flies irresponsive to cva , no aggressive behaviors were seen however , like most behaviors requiring arousal and wakefulness , aggression was found to be impaired via sleep deprivation specifically , this occurs through the impairment of octopamine and dopamine signaling , which are important pathways for regulating arousal in insects wild-type flies have reddish pigment cells , which serve to absorb excess blue light so the fly is not blinded by ambient light in addition , proteins called arrestins bind metarhodopsin and prevent it from activating more gq drosophila consistently begin a grooming sequence by using their front legs to clean the eyes , then the head and antennae this hierarchy does not prevent drosophila from returning to grooming behaviors that have already been accessed in the grooming sequence flies fly via straight sequences of movement interspersed by rapid turns called saccades

the ringtail is black to dark brown in color with pale underparts ringtails have a pointed muzzle with long whiskers resembles that of a fox ( its latin name means ‘ clever little fox ’ ) and its body that resembles that of a cat the ringtailed 's face resembles a mask as dark brown and black hair surround its eyes smaller than a cat , it is one of the smallest extant procyonids ( only the smallest in the olingo species group average smaller ) ringtails are primarily nocturnal , with large eyes and upright ears that make it easier for them to navigate and forage in the dark the white rings act as a target , so when the tail rather than the body is caught , the ringtail has a greater chance of escaping fur trapping has slowed down considerably , but current population sizes and growth rates remain unclear in 2003 , a study done in mexico city found that ringtails tended to defecate in similar areas in a seemingly nonrandom pattern , mimicking that of other carnivores that utilized excretions to mark territories faecal marking behaviour in ringtails ( bassariscus astutus ) during the non-breeding period : spatial characteristics of latrines and single faeces ringtails can survive for long periods on water derived from food alone , and have urine which is more concentrated than any other mammal studied , an adaptation that allows for maximum water retention also occasional prey to coatis , lynxes , and mountain lions , the ringtail is rather adept at avoiding predators it is commonly found in rocky desert habitats , where it nests in the hollows of trees or abandoned wooden structures the ringtail also prefers rocky habitats associated with water , such as the riparian canyons , caves , or mine shafts small vertebrates such as passerina , rats , mice , squirrels , rabbits , snakes , lizards , frogs , and toads are the most important foods during winters during the spring time the ringtail 's diet consisted largely of insects , showing up in about 50 % of the analyzed feces '' spring diet of the endemic ring-tailed cat ( bassariscus astutus insulicola ) population on an island in the gulf of california , mexico at least one biologist in oregon has joked that the ringtail is one of two species – the domestic cat and the ringtail – that thus '' domesticated humans '' due to that pattern of behavior

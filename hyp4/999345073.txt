the gato-class boats were considered to be '' fleet submarines '' the original rationale behind their design was that they were intended to operate as adjuncts to the main battle fleet , based on standard-type battleships since world war i they were to scout out ahead of the fleet and report on the enemy fleet 's composition , speed , and course , then they were to attack and whittle down the enemy in preparation for the main fleet action , a titanic gun battle between battleships and cruisers to operate effectively in this role , a submarine had to have high surface speed , long range and endurance , and heavy armament limitations in submarine design and construction in the 1920s and 1930s made this combination of qualities very difficult to achieve navy experimented constantly with this concept in the post-world war i years , producing a series of submarines with less than stellar qualities and reliability , the ( also known as the t class ) and the v-boats , of which v-1 through v-3 were an unsuccessful attempt to produce a fleet submarine by 1931 , the experimental phase of fleet submarine development was over and the navy began to make solid progress towards what would eventually be the gato class by 1940 , a much better developed industrial base and experience gained from the porpoise- , - , and boats resulted in the tambor-class submarine timing , however , conspired against the actual use of these boats in their assigned role the attack on pearl harbor on 7 december 1941 destroyed the pacific fleet battle line and along with it the concept of the battleship-led gun battle , as well as 20 years of submarine strategic concept development fortunately , the same capabilities that would have enabled these submarines to operate with the fleet made them superbly qualified for their new mission of commerce raiding against the japanese empire the gatos , along with nearly all of the u.s navy fleet-type submarines of world war ii , were of partial double-hull construction the voids between the two hulls provided space for fuel and ballast tanks the outer hull merged with the pressure hull at both ends in the area of the torpedo room bulkheads , hence the '' partial '' double hull operational experience with earlier boats led the naval architects and engineers at the navy 's bureau of construction and repair to believe that they had been unduly conservative in their estimates of hull strength without changing the construction or thickness of the pressure hull steel , they decided that the gato-class boats would be fully capable of routinely operating at 300 feet , a increase in test depth over the preceding classes at the start of the war , these boats could go from fully surfaced to periscope depth in about 45–50 seconds the superstructure that sat atop the pressure hull provided the main walking deck when the boat was surfaced and was free-flooding and full of water when the boat was submerged by midwar , these measures combined with improved crew training got dive times down to 30–35 seconds , very fast for such a large boat and acceptable to the boat 's crew the air conditioning in particular had a very practical application , too , besides comfort submerge a submarine for any length of time , and the heat generated by the recently shut-down engines , electronic gear , and 70 warm bodies will quickly raise internal temperatures above high humidity generated by tropical waters will quickly condense and begin dripping into equipment , eventually causing electrical shorts and fires it proved to be a key factor in the success of these boats during world war ii twelve submarines of this class built by electric boat received what would be the final installations of the hooven-owens-rentschler ( hor ) double-acting diesel engine the navy had been tinkering with this engine off and on since 1937 because its unique design promised nearly twice the horsepower in a package the same size as other diesel engine types the other gato-class boats received either the fairbanks-morse 38d 8-1/8 nine-cylinder opposed-piston engine or the general motors cleveland 16-248 v-type as original installations these engines were hardy , rugged , and well liked by the crews and served the boats quite well at the beginning of the war , gato-class boats , as well as the gar and tambor classes , had fully shrouded fairwaters visually similar to modern nuclear submarines submarines lost in world war ii were of this class , plus , a damaged boat that returned to the u.s the government-owned shipyards ( portsmouth naval shipyard and mare island naval shipyard ) began to make the transition to the new balao design in the summer of 1942 due to their large construction capacity , more than half ( 41 ) of the class was built at electric boat facilities ; three new slipways were added to the north yard and four slipways were added to the south yard to accommodate their production a total of 77 gatos were built at four different locations ( electric boat , manitowoc , portsmouth , and mare island ) gato-class boats sank four japanese submarines : , , , and ; while only losing one in exchange , to their principal weapon was the steam-powered mark 14 torpedo in the early war years , with the electric mark 18 torpedo supplementing the mark 14 in late 1943 due to a stunted research-and-development phase in the depression-era 1930s , and in great part due to the arrogance and stubbornness of its designer , the naval torpedo station newport under the bureau of ordnance , the '' wonder weapon '' mark 14 proved to be full of bugs and very unreliable the mark 18 electric torpedo was a hastily copied version of captured g7e torpedo weapons and was rushed into service in the fall of 1943 mod 4 – same as the mod 3 , but with the height of the bridge itself lowered in a last attempt to lessen the silhouette 2–16 the conning tower fairwater of flasher is preserved in groton , connecticut , in the mod 4a configuration , with two single 40 & nbsp ; mm bofors mounts many targets in the pacific war were sampans or otherwise not worth a torpedo , so the deck gun was an important weapon most boats began the war with a 3 '' /50 caliber gun ( although some boats received older mk additional antiaircraft guns included single 40 mm bofors and twin 20 mm oerlikon mounts , usually one of each , on her 12th patrol in july 1945 , landed a small team from her crew on the shore of patience bay on karafuto they placed charges under a railroad track and blew up a passing train sank a ship carrying japanese tank reinforcements that were en route to iwo jima submarine sunk by a japanese submarine during the second world war along with conducted an aggressive and successful attack against japanese fleet units during the lead up to the u.s the greater underwater propulsion power program ( guppy ) modernization program of the late 1940s largely passed these boats by while most of these boats were of the more capable balao and tench classes , some gatos went overseas , as well uss cavalla memorial website is at the wisconsin maritime museum in manitowoc , wisconsin the submarine retains its historical structural integrity from its world war ii configuration , as it does not have doors cut through its pressure hull nor stairwells added radar picket submarines , undersea warfare , winter-spring 2002 , issue 14 navsource.org fleet submarines photo index page list of world war ii u.s

the gato-class boats were considered to be '' fleet submarines '' the original rationale behind their design was that they were intended to operate as adjuncts to the main battle fleet , based on standard-type battleships since world war i they were to scout out ahead of the fleet and report on the enemy fleet 's composition , speed , and course , then they were to attack and whittle down the enemy in preparation for the main fleet action , a titanic gun battle between battleships and cruisers to operate effectively in this role , a submarine had to have high surface speed , long range and endurance , and heavy armament limitations in submarine design and construction in the 1920s and 1930s made this combination of qualities very difficult to achieve by 1931 , the experimental phase of fleet submarine development was over and the navy began to make solid progress towards what would eventually be the gato class by 1940 , a much better developed industrial base and experience gained from the porpoise- , - , and boats resulted in the tambor-class submarine the attack on pearl harbor on 7 december 1941 destroyed the pacific fleet battle line and along with it the concept of the battleship-led gun battle , as well as 20 years of submarine strategic concept development fortunately , the same capabilities that would have enabled these submarines to operate with the fleet made them superbly qualified for their new mission of commerce raiding against the japanese empire operational experience with earlier boats led the naval architects and engineers at the navy 's bureau of construction and repair to believe that they had been unduly conservative in their estimates of hull strength without changing the construction or thickness of the pressure hull steel , they decided that the gato-class boats would be fully capable of routinely operating at 300 feet , a increase in test depth over the preceding classes the gatos were slow divers when compared to some german and british designs , but that was mostly because the gatos were significantly larger boats acknowledging this limitation , the bureau designers incorporated a negative ( sometimes called a '' down express '' ) tank into the design , which was flooded to provide a large amount of negative buoyancy at the start of the dive based on later wartime experience , the tank was normally kept full or nearly full at the surface , then emptied to a certain mark after the boat was submerged to restore neutral buoyancy at the start of the war , these boats could go from fully surfaced to periscope depth in about 45–50 seconds the superstructure that sat atop the pressure hull provided the main walking deck when the boat was surfaced and was free-flooding and full of water when the boat was submerged in an attempt to speed this process , additional limber , or free-flooding , holes were drilled and cut into the superstructure to allow it to flood faster by midwar , these measures combined with improved crew training got dive times down to 30–35 seconds , very fast for such a large boat and acceptable to the boat 's crew no practical fix for this was available due to the limitations of the installed hydraulic systems used to move the rudder they could be added without impact to the boat 's war fighting abilities due to the extra room of the big fleet boat the air conditioning in particular had a very practical application , too , besides comfort high humidity generated by tropical waters will quickly condense and begin dripping into equipment , eventually causing electrical shorts and fires it proved to be a key factor in the success of these boats during world war ii twelve submarines of this class built by electric boat received what would be the final installations of the hooven-owens-rentschler ( hor ) double-acting diesel engine the other gato-class boats received either the fairbanks-morse 38d 8-1/8 nine-cylinder opposed-piston engine or the general motors cleveland 16-248 v-type as original installations experience during the war led to the progressive reduction of this structure to reduce visibility and radar profile at the expense of underwater performance and foul-weather operating comfort fleet submarines part one : gato class '' by david l fleet submarine index page at navsource.org manitowoc was a designated follow-on yard to electric boat ; they used construction blueprints and plans supplied by electric boat and used many of the same suppliers the government-owned shipyards ( portsmouth naval shipyard and mare island naval shipyard ) began to make the transition to the new balao design in the summer of 1942 electric boat , due to the huge backlog of gato-class construction , was not ready to make the transition to the new design until january 1943 manitowoc had already completed their allotted production run of gatos and could not switch over to the balao design until electric boat supplied them with the plans faced with a work stoppage while they waited for electric boat to catch up , managers at manitowoc got permission to complete four additional boats ( ss-361 through ss-364 ) to electric boat 's gato-class plans gato herself was laid down on 5 october 1940 by the electric boat company at groton , connecticut , and commissioned 31 december 1941 called the victory yard , it became an integral part of electric boat operations once they began to arrive in theater in large numbers in mid-to-late 1942 , the gatos were in the thick of the fight against the japanese many of these boats racked up impressive war records : , , and were the top three boats based on tonnage sunk by u.s the mark 18 electric torpedo was a hastily copied version of captured g7e torpedo weapons and was rushed into service in the fall of 1943 once perfected , both types of torpedoes proved to be reliable and effective weapons , allowing the gatos and other submarines to sink an enormous amount of japanese shipping by the end of the war the large , bulky original configuration proved to be too easy to spot when the boat was surfaced ; it needed to be smaller secondly , the desire to incorporate new masts for surface- and air-search radars drove changes to the fairwater and periscope shears mod 3 – same as mod 2 , but with the covered navigation bridge on the forward part of the fairwater cut away and the plating around the periscope shears removed deck guns varied during the war many targets in the pacific war were sampans or otherwise not worth a torpedo , so the deck gun was an important weapon the 3-inch gun was the model originally specified for the gato class , but war experience led to the removal of 4 '' /50 caliber gun from old s-class submarines to equip front-line boats beginning in late 1943 , almost all were refitted with a 5 '' /25 caliber gun , and some boats had two of these weapons went to the rescue of a grounded dutch submarine , taking its crew on board and destroying the submarine when it could not be removed from the reef , the only international submarine-to-submarine rescue in history along with conducted an aggressive and successful attack against japanese fleet units during the lead up to the u.s surface ships radar picket were put into service , but they proved vulnerable in this role , as they could be attacked , as well , leaving the fleet blind the threat of the soviet navy building hundreds of type xxi-derived submarines ( eventually the 215-strong and dozens of others ) in the atlantic led the u.s grouper had all her forward torpedo tubes removed and the space was used as berthing for technicians and as a sonar lab the following is a complete list of gato-class museum boats : is at seawolf park near galveston , texas ( in ssk configuration ) list of most successful american submarines in world war ii allied submarines in the pacific war unrestricted submarine warfare list of lost united states submarines list of submarines of the second world war

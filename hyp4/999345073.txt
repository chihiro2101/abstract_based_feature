the gato-class boats were considered to be '' fleet submarines '' the original rationale behind their design was that they were intended to operate as adjuncts to the main battle fleet , based on standard-type battleships since world war i they were to scout out ahead of the fleet and report on the enemy fleet 's composition , speed , and course , then they were to attack and whittle down the enemy in preparation for the main fleet action , a titanic gun battle between battleships and cruisers this was an operational concept born from experience in world war i limitations in submarine design and construction in the 1920s and 1930s made this combination of qualities very difficult to achieve navy experimented constantly with this concept in the post-world war i years , producing a series of submarines with less than stellar qualities and reliability , the ( also known as the t class ) and the v-boats , of which v-1 through v-3 were an unsuccessful attempt to produce a fleet submarine by 1931 , the experimental phase of fleet submarine development was over and the navy began to make solid progress towards what would eventually be the gato class navy had hit the right combination of factors and now had the long-desired fleet submarine timing , however , conspired against the actual use of these boats in their assigned role the attack on pearl harbor on 7 december 1941 destroyed the pacific fleet battle line and along with it the concept of the battleship-led gun battle , as well as 20 years of submarine strategic concept development it left the fleet submarine without a mission the gato-class design was a near-duplicate of the preceding tambor- and gar-class boats navy fleet-type submarines of world war ii , were of partial double-hull construction the outer hull merged with the pressure hull at both ends in the area of the torpedo room bulkheads , hence the '' partial '' double hull operational experience with earlier boats led the naval architects and engineers at the navy 's bureau of construction and repair to believe that they had been unduly conservative in their estimates of hull strength at the start of the war , these boats could go from fully surfaced to periscope depth in about 45–50 seconds the superstructure that sat atop the pressure hull provided the main walking deck when the boat was surfaced and was free-flooding and full of water when the boat was submerged they could be added without impact to the boat 's war fighting abilities due to the extra room of the big fleet boat air conditioning , acting mostly as a dehumidifier , virtually eliminates this problem and greatly increases mechanical and electrical reliability twelve submarines of this class built by electric boat received what would be the final installations of the hooven-owens-rentschler ( hor ) double-acting diesel engine the navy had been tinkering with this engine off and on since 1937 because its unique design promised nearly twice the horsepower in a package the same size as other diesel engine types frequent breakdowns and utter unreliability had destroyed these engines ' reputation with the navy and they were all removed at the first opportunity and replaced by general motors cleveland 16-278a v-type diesels the other gato-class boats received either the fairbanks-morse 38d 8-1/8 nine-cylinder opposed-piston engine or the general motors cleveland 16-248 v-type as original installations these engines were hardy , rugged , and well liked by the crews and served the boats quite well a side benefit of these modifications was the creation of convenient locations for antiaircraft guns fleet submarines part one : gato class '' by david l submarines lost in world war ii were of this class , plus , a damaged boat that returned to the u.s these were originally intended to be balao-class subs and were assigned hull numbers that fall in the middle of the range of numbers for the balao class ( ss-285 to ss-416 , ss-425 , and s-426 ) called the victory yard , it became an integral part of electric boat operations a total of 77 gatos were built at four different locations ( electric boat , manitowoc , portsmouth , and mare island ) their principal weapon was the steam-powered mark 14 torpedo in the early war years , with the electric mark 18 torpedo supplementing the mark 14 in late 1943 due to a stunted research-and-development phase in the depression-era 1930s , and in great part due to the arrogance and stubbornness of its designer , the naval torpedo station newport under the bureau of ordnance , the '' wonder weapon '' mark 14 proved to be full of bugs and very unreliable the mark 18 electric torpedo was a hastily copied version of captured g7e torpedo weapons and was rushed into service in the fall of 1943 once perfected , both types of torpedoes proved to be reliable and effective weapons , allowing the gatos and other submarines to sink an enormous amount of japanese shipping by the end of the war the gatos were subjected to numerous exterior configuration changes during their careers , with most of these changes centered on the conning tower fairwater secondly , the desire to incorporate new masts for surface- and air-search radars drove changes to the fairwater and periscope shears a visual guide to the u.s in this configuration , the gatos now had two excellent positions for the mounting of single 40 mm bofors or twin 20 mm oerlikon antiaircraft cannon , an improvement over the m2 browning the lowering of the bridge exposed three i-beams on either side of the periscope shears variations on the above mods included the 1a ( shortened navigation bridge ) , 2a ( plating removed from periscope shears ) , and the 3a and 4a ( which moved the sj radar mast aft of the periscopes ) deck guns varied during the war many targets in the pacific war were sampans or otherwise not worth a torpedo , so the deck gun was an important weapon most boats began the war with a 3 '' /50 caliber gun ( although some boats received older mk the 3-inch gun was the model originally specified for the gato class , but war experience led to the removal of 4 '' /50 caliber gun from old s-class submarines to equip front-line boats additional antiaircraft guns included single 40 mm bofors and twin 20 mm oerlikon mounts , usually one of each taihō was the flagship of vice-admiral

the gato-class boats were considered to be '' fleet submarines '' the original rationale behind their design was that they were intended to operate as adjuncts to the main battle fleet , based on standard-type battleships since world war i this was an operational concept born from experience in world war i to operate effectively in this role , a submarine had to have high surface speed , long range and endurance , and heavy armament limitations in submarine design and construction in the 1920s and 1930s made this combination of qualities very difficult to achieve . tambor and gar class by 1931 , the experimental phase of fleet submarine development was over and the navy began to make solid progress towards what would eventually be the gato class by 1940 , a much better developed industrial base and experience gained from the porpoise- , - , and boats resulted in the tambor-class submarine navy had hit the right combination of factors and now had the long-desired fleet submarine timing , however , conspired against the actual use of these boats in their assigned role it left the fleet submarine without a mission fortunately , the same capabilities that would have enabled these submarines to operate with the fleet made them superbly qualified for their new mission of commerce raiding against the japanese empire the gato-class design was a near-duplicate of the preceding tambor- and gar-class boats navy fleet-type submarines of world war ii , were of partial double-hull construction the voids between the two hulls provided space for fuel and ballast tanks the outer hull merged with the pressure hull at both ends in the area of the torpedo room bulkheads , hence the '' partial '' double hull operational experience with earlier boats led the naval architects and engineers at the navy 's bureau of construction and repair to believe that they had been unduly conservative in their estimates of hull strength at the start of the war , these boats could go from fully surfaced to periscope depth in about 45–50 seconds in an attempt to speed this process , additional limber , or free-flooding , holes were drilled and cut into the superstructure to allow it to flood faster by midwar , these measures combined with improved crew training got dive times down to 30–35 seconds , very fast for such a large boat and acceptable to the boat 's crew the large size of these boats did negatively affect both surfaced and underwater maneuverability when compared to smaller submarines after the war , a few fleet boats were fitted with an additional rudder topside at the very stern air conditioning , acting mostly as a dehumidifier , virtually eliminates this problem and greatly increases mechanical and electrical reliability it proved to be a key factor in the success of these boats during world war ii twelve submarines of this class built by electric boat received what would be the final installations of the hooven-owens-rentschler ( hor ) double-acting diesel engine the navy had been tinkering with this engine off and on since 1937 because its unique design promised nearly twice the horsepower in a package the same size as other diesel engine types unfortunately , the hor company ran into severe design and manufacturing problems , and these engines proved to be operational and maintenance nightmares at the beginning of the war , gato-class boats , as well as the gar and tambor classes , had fully shrouded fairwaters visually similar to modern nuclear submarines fleet submarines part one : gato class '' by david l submarines lost in world war ii were of this class , plus , a damaged boat that returned to the u.s electric boat , due to the huge backlog of gato-class construction , was not ready to make the transition to the new design until january 1943 all of the gatos ( with one exception , would eventually fight in the asiatic-pacific theater considered a waste of valuable resources , in mid-1943 , all six boats were recalled and transferred to the pacific once they began to arrive in theater in large numbers in mid-to-late 1942 , the gatos were in the thick of the fight against the japanese many of these boats racked up impressive war records : , , and were the top three boats based on tonnage sunk by u.s , flasher , and were third , fourth , and seventh place on the list for the number of ships sunk bowing to pressure from the submariners in the pacific , the bureau eventually acknowledged the problems in the mark 14 and largely corrected them by late 1943 the mark 18 electric torpedo was a hastily copied version of captured g7e torpedo weapons and was rushed into service in the fall of 1943 the large , bulky original configuration proved to be too easy to spot when the boat was surfaced ; it needed to be smaller third , additional gun armament was needed , and cutting down the fairwater provided excellent mounting locations for machine guns and antiaircraft cannon many targets in the pacific war were sampans or otherwise not worth a torpedo , so the deck gun was an important weapon the 3-inch gun was the model originally specified for the gato class , but war experience led to the removal of 4 '' /50 caliber gun from old s-class submarines to equip front-line boats additional antiaircraft guns included single 40 mm bofors and twin 20 mm oerlikon mounts , usually one of each shōkaku was one of six japanese carriers that had participated in the attack on pearl harbor sank a ship carrying japanese tank reinforcements that were en route to iwo jima went to the rescue of a grounded dutch submarine , taking its crew on board and destroying the submarine when it could not be removed from the reef , the only international submarine-to-submarine rescue in history submarine sunk by a japanese submarine during the second world war submarine loss of the war guppy and other diesel boat conversions page the last two gato-class boats active in the u.s the threat of the soviet navy building hundreds of type xxi-derived submarines ( eventually the 215-strong and dozens of others ) in the atlantic led the u.s the submarine retains its historical structural integrity from its world war ii configuration , as it does not have doors cut through its pressure hull nor stairwells added '' cold war curiosities : u.s

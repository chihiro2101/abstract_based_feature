the gato-class boats were considered to be '' fleet submarines '' the original rationale behind their design was that they were intended to operate as adjuncts to the main battle fleet , based on standard-type battleships since world war i to operate effectively in this role , a submarine had to have high surface speed , long range and endurance , and heavy armament limitations in submarine design and construction in the 1920s and 1930s made this combination of qualities very difficult to achieve navy experimented constantly with this concept in the post-world war i years , producing a series of submarines with less than stellar qualities and reliability , the ( also known as the t class ) and the v-boats , of which v-1 through v-3 were an unsuccessful attempt to produce a fleet submarine by 1931 , the experimental phase of fleet submarine development was over and the navy began to make solid progress towards what would eventually be the gato class by 1940 , a much better developed industrial base and experience gained from the porpoise- , - , and boats resulted in the tambor-class submarine navy had hit the right combination of factors and now had the long-desired fleet submarine timing , however , conspired against the actual use of these boats in their assigned role the attack on pearl harbor on 7 december 1941 destroyed the pacific fleet battle line and along with it the concept of the battleship-led gun battle , as well as 20 years of submarine strategic concept development it left the fleet submarine without a mission fortunately , the same capabilities that would have enabled these submarines to operate with the fleet made them superbly qualified for their new mission of commerce raiding against the japanese empire navy fleet-type submarines of world war ii , were of partial double-hull construction without changing the construction or thickness of the pressure hull steel , they decided that the gato-class boats would be fully capable of routinely operating at 300 feet , a increase in test depth over the preceding classes the gatos were slow divers when compared to some german and british designs , but that was mostly because the gatos were significantly larger boats sufficient fuel bunkerage to provide the range necessary for 75-day patrols from hawaii to japan and back could be obtained only with a larger boat , which would take longer to submerge than a smaller one at the start of the war , these boats could go from fully surfaced to periscope depth in about 45–50 seconds in an attempt to speed this process , additional limber , or free-flooding , holes were drilled and cut into the superstructure to allow it to flood faster the bureau designers felt that if a crew of 60–80 men were to be expected to conduct 75-day patrols in the warm waters of the pacific , these types of features were vital to the health and efficiency of the crew they could be added without impact to the boat 's war fighting abilities due to the extra room of the big fleet boat the air conditioning in particular had a very practical application , too , besides comfort submerge a submarine for any length of time , and the heat generated by the recently shut-down engines , electronic gear , and 70 warm bodies will quickly raise internal temperatures above it proved to be a key factor in the success of these boats during world war ii twelve submarines of this class built by electric boat received what would be the final installations of the hooven-owens-rentschler ( hor ) double-acting diesel engine the navy had been tinkering with this engine off and on since 1937 because its unique design promised nearly twice the horsepower in a package the same size as other diesel engine types unfortunately , the hor company ran into severe design and manufacturing problems , and these engines proved to be operational and maintenance nightmares frequent breakdowns and utter unreliability had destroyed these engines ' reputation with the navy and they were all removed at the first opportunity and replaced by general motors cleveland 16-278a v-type diesels the other gato-class boats received either the fairbanks-morse 38d 8-1/8 nine-cylinder opposed-piston engine or the general motors cleveland 16-248 v-type as original installations at the beginning of the war , gato-class boats , as well as the gar and tambor classes , had fully shrouded fairwaters visually similar to modern nuclear submarines experience during the war led to the progressive reduction of this structure to reduce visibility and radar profile at the expense of underwater performance and foul-weather operating comfort submarines lost in world war ii were of this class , plus , a damaged boat that returned to the u.s faced with a work stoppage while they waited for electric boat to catch up , managers at manitowoc got permission to complete four additional boats ( ss-361 through ss-364 ) to electric boat 's gato-class plans the gato boats were authorized in appropriations for fiscal year 1941 , as part of president franklin roosevelt 's proclamation of '' limited emergency '' in september 1939 the first boat laid down was actually at portsmouth naval shipyard on 11 september 1940 a total of 77 gatos were built at four different locations ( electric boat , manitowoc , portsmouth , and mare island ) however , in the summer of 1942 , six new gatos were assigned to submarine squadron 50 and sent to rosneath , scotland , to patrol the bay of biscay and to assist in the operation torch landings in north africa once they began to arrive in theater in large numbers in mid-to-late 1942 , the gatos were in the thick of the fight against the japanese many of these boats racked up impressive war records : , , and were the top three boats based on tonnage sunk by u.s their principal weapon was the steam-powered mark 14 torpedo in the early war years , with the electric mark 18 torpedo supplementing the mark 14 in late 1943 due to a stunted research-and-development phase in the depression-era 1930s , and in great part due to the arrogance and stubbornness of its designer , the naval torpedo station newport under the bureau of ordnance , the '' wonder weapon '' mark 14 proved to be full of bugs and very unreliable the mark 18 electric torpedo was a hastily copied version of captured g7e torpedo weapons and was rushed into service in the fall of 1943 the gatos were subjected to numerous exterior configuration changes during their careers , with most of these changes centered on the conning tower fairwater third , additional gun armament was needed , and cutting down the fairwater provided excellent mounting locations for machine guns and antiaircraft cannon mod 3 – same as mod 2 , but with the covered navigation bridge on the forward part of the fairwater cut away and the plating around the periscope shears removed in this configuration , the gatos now had two excellent positions for the mounting of single 40 mm bofors or twin 20 mm oerlikon antiaircraft cannon , an improvement over the m2 browning variations on the above mods included the 1a ( shortened navigation bridge ) , 2a ( plating removed from periscope shears ) , and the 3a and 4a ( which moved the sj radar mast aft of the periscopes ) , on her 12th patrol in july 1945 , landed a small team from her crew on the shore of patience bay on karafuto sank a ship carrying japanese tank reinforcements that were en route to iwo jima submarine sunk by a japanese submarine during the second world war such was the pace of technological development during the war that a submarine with only a 300-foot test depth was going to be of little use , despite being modern in most other aspects while most of these boats were of the more capable balao and tench classes , some gatos went overseas , as well radar picket submarines , undersea warfare , winter-spring 2002 , issue 14 navsource.org fleet submarines photo index page

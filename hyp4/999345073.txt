the gato-class boats were considered to be '' fleet submarines '' the original rationale behind their design was that they were intended to operate as adjuncts to the main battle fleet , based on standard-type battleships since world war i to operate effectively in this role , a submarine had to have high surface speed , long range and endurance , and heavy armament limitations in submarine design and construction in the 1920s and 1930s made this combination of qualities very difficult to achieve navy experimented constantly with this concept in the post-world war i years , producing a series of submarines with less than stellar qualities and reliability , the ( also known as the t class ) and the v-boats , of which v-1 through v-3 were an unsuccessful attempt to produce a fleet submarine by 1931 , the experimental phase of fleet submarine development was over and the navy began to make solid progress towards what would eventually be the gato class by 1940 , a much better developed industrial base and experience gained from the porpoise- , - , and boats resulted in the tambor-class submarine the attack on pearl harbor on 7 december 1941 destroyed the pacific fleet battle line and along with it the concept of the battleship-led gun battle , as well as 20 years of submarine strategic concept development the only significant differences were an increase in diving depth from to , and an extra five feet in length to allow the addition of a watertight bulkhead dividing the one large engine room in two , with two diesel generators in each room navy fleet-type submarines of world war ii , were of partial double-hull construction operational experience with earlier boats led the naval architects and engineers at the navy 's bureau of construction and repair to believe that they had been unduly conservative in their estimates of hull strength acknowledging this limitation , the bureau designers incorporated a negative ( sometimes called a '' down express '' ) tank into the design , which was flooded to provide a large amount of negative buoyancy at the start of the dive at the start of the war , these boats could go from fully surfaced to periscope depth in about 45–50 seconds the superstructure that sat atop the pressure hull provided the main walking deck when the boat was surfaced and was free-flooding and full of water when the boat was submerged by midwar , these measures combined with improved crew training got dive times down to 30–35 seconds , very fast for such a large boat and acceptable to the boat 's crew after the war , a few fleet boats were fitted with an additional rudder topside at the very stern the bureau designers felt that if a crew of 60–80 men were to be expected to conduct 75-day patrols in the warm waters of the pacific , these types of features were vital to the health and efficiency of the crew they could be added without impact to the boat 's war fighting abilities due to the extra room of the big fleet boat the air conditioning in particular had a very practical application , too , besides comfort submerge a submarine for any length of time , and the heat generated by the recently shut-down engines , electronic gear , and 70 warm bodies will quickly raise internal temperatures above high humidity generated by tropical waters will quickly condense and begin dripping into equipment , eventually causing electrical shorts and fires it proved to be a key factor in the success of these boats during world war ii the navy had been tinkering with this engine off and on since 1937 because its unique design promised nearly twice the horsepower in a package the same size as other diesel engine types unfortunately , the hor company ran into severe design and manufacturing problems , and these engines proved to be operational and maintenance nightmares frequent breakdowns and utter unreliability had destroyed these engines ' reputation with the navy and they were all removed at the first opportunity and replaced by general motors cleveland 16-278a v-type diesels at the beginning of the war , gato-class boats , as well as the gar and tambor classes , had fully shrouded fairwaters visually similar to modern nuclear submarines fleet submarines part one : gato class '' by david l these were originally intended to be balao-class subs and were assigned hull numbers that fall in the middle of the range of numbers for the balao class ( ss-285 to ss-416 , ss-425 , and s-426 ) fleet submarine index page at navsource.org manitowoc was a designated follow-on yard to electric boat ; they used construction blueprints and plans supplied by electric boat and used many of the same suppliers faced with a work stoppage while they waited for electric boat to catch up , managers at manitowoc got permission to complete four additional boats ( ss-361 through ss-364 ) to electric boat 's gato-class plans she was commissioned on 1 november 1941 , and was the only gato-class boat in commission when the war started due to their large construction capacity , more than half ( 41 ) of the class was built at electric boat facilities ; three new slipways were added to the north yard and four slipways were added to the south yard to accommodate their production a total of 77 gatos were built at four different locations ( electric boat , manitowoc , portsmouth , and mare island ) however , in the summer of 1942 , six new gatos were assigned to submarine squadron 50 and sent to rosneath , scotland , to patrol the bay of biscay and to assist in the operation torch landings in north africa many of these boats racked up impressive war records : , , and were the top three boats based on tonnage sunk by u.s , flasher , and were third , fourth , and seventh place on the list for the number of ships sunk gato-class boats sank four japanese submarines : , , , and ; while only losing one in exchange , to their principal weapon was the steam-powered mark 14 torpedo in the early war years , with the electric mark 18 torpedo supplementing the mark 14 in late 1943 bowing to pressure from the submariners in the pacific , the bureau eventually acknowledged the problems in the mark 14 and largely corrected them by late 1943 the mark 18 electric torpedo was a hastily copied version of captured g7e torpedo weapons and was rushed into service in the fall of 1943 secondly , the desire to incorporate new masts for surface- and air-search radars drove changes to the fairwater and periscope shears third , additional gun armament was needed , and cutting down the fairwater provided excellent mounting locations for machine guns and antiaircraft cannon mod 3 – same as mod 2 , but with the covered navigation bridge on the forward part of the fairwater cut away and the plating around the periscope shears removed most boats began the war with a 3 '' /50 caliber gun ( although some boats received older mk additional antiaircraft guns included single 40 mm bofors and twin 20 mm oerlikon mounts , usually one of each , on her 12th patrol in july 1945 , landed a small team from her crew on the shore of patience bay on karafuto barb also conducted several rocket attacks against shore targets on this same patrol , the first ever by an american submarine they used 5-inch unguided rockets fired from a special launching rack on the main deck guppy and other diesel boat conversions page the last two gato-class boats active in the u.s two gatos , and ( previously the prototype hunter-killer boat ) were assigned to these duties and proved to be key players in the development of new sonar capabilities list of most successful american submarines in world war ii allied submarines in the pacific war unrestricted submarine warfare list of lost united states submarines list of submarines of the second world war radar picket submarines , undersea warfare , winter-spring 2002 , issue 14 navsource.org fleet submarines photo index page list of world war ii u.s

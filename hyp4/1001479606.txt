metamathematical metatheorems about mathematics itself were originally differentiated from ordinary mathematical theorems in the 19th century to focus on what was then called the foundational crisis of mathematics more recently , mathematical logic has often included the study of new pure mathematics , such as set theory , category theory , recursion theory and pure model theory , which is not directly related to metamathematics david hilbert was the first to invoke the term '' metamathematics '' with regularity ( see hilbert 's program ) , in the early 20th century the '' uproar of the boeotians '' came and went , and gave an impetus to metamathematics and great improvements in mathematical rigour , analytical philosophy and logic begriffsschrift ( german for , roughly , '' concept-script '' ) is a book on logic by gottlob frege , published in 1879 , and the formal system set out in that book principia mathematica , or '' pm '' as it is often abbreviated , was an attempt to describe a set of axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic from which all mathematical truths could in principle be proven however , in 1931 , gödel 's incompleteness theorem proved definitively that pm , and in fact any other attempt , could never achieve this lofty goal ; that is , for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics , there would in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them contemporary mathematics , however , avoids paradoxes such as russell 's in less unwieldy ways , such as the system of zermelo–fraenkel set theory the theorems , proven by kurt gödel in 1931 , are important both in mathematical logic and in the philosophy of mathematics by gödel 's completeness theorem , a statement is universally valid if and only if it can be deduced from the axioms , so the can also be viewed as asking for an algorithm to decide whether a given statement is provable from the axioms using the rules of logic

metamathematical metatheorems about mathematics itself were originally differentiated from ordinary mathematical theorems in the 19th century to focus on what was then called the foundational crisis of mathematics metamathematics was intimately connected to mathematical logic , so that the early histories of the two fields , during the late 19th and early 20th centuries , largely overlap more recently , mathematical logic has often included the study of new pure mathematics , such as set theory , category theory , recursion theory and pure model theory , which is not directly related to metamathematics david hilbert was the first to invoke the term '' metamathematics '' with regularity ( see hilbert 's program ) , in the early 20th century in his hands , it meant something akin to contemporary proof theory , in which finitary methods are used to study various axiomatized mathematical theorems ( kleene 1952 , p other prominent figures in the field include bertrand russell , thoralf skolem , emil post , alonzo church , stephen kleene , willard quine , paul benacerraf , hilary putnam , gregory chaitin , alfred tarski and kurt gödel the '' uproar of the boeotians '' came and went , and gave an impetus to metamathematics and great improvements in mathematical rigour , analytical philosophy and logic principia mathematica , or '' pm '' as it is often abbreviated , was an attempt to describe a set of axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic from which all mathematical truths could in principle be proven however , in 1931 , gödel 's incompleteness theorem proved definitively that pm , and in fact any other attempt , could never achieve this lofty goal ; that is , for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics , there would in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them the theorems , proven by kurt gödel in 1931 , are important both in mathematical logic and in the philosophy of mathematics

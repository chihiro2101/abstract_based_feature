metamathematical metatheorems about mathematics itself were originally differentiated from ordinary mathematical theorems in the 19th century to focus on what was then called the foundational crisis of mathematics richard 's paradox ( richard 1905 ) concerning certain 'definitions ' of real numbers in the english language is an example of the sort of contradictions that can easily occur if one fails to distinguish between mathematics and metamathematics metamathematics was intimately connected to mathematical logic , so that the early histories of the two fields , during the late 19th and early 20th centuries , largely overlap more recently , mathematical logic has often included the study of new pure mathematics , such as set theory , category theory , recursion theory and pure model theory , which is not directly related to metamathematics david hilbert was the first to invoke the term '' metamathematics '' with regularity ( see hilbert 's program ) , in the early 20th century the discovery of hyperbolic geometry had important philosophy consequences for metamathematics the '' uproar of the boeotians '' came and went , and gave an impetus to metamathematics and great improvements in mathematical rigour , analytical philosophy and logic as such , this ambitious project is of great importance in the history of mathematics and philosophy , being one of the foremost products of the belief that such an undertaking may be achievable contemporary mathematics , however , avoids paradoxes such as russell 's in less unwieldy ways , such as the system of zermeloâ€“fraenkel set theory for any such system , there will always be statements about the natural numbers that are true , but that are unprovable within the system

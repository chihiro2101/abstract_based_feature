metamathematical metatheorems about mathematics itself were originally differentiated from ordinary mathematical theorems in the 19th century to focus on what was then called the foundational crisis of mathematics metamathematics was intimately connected to mathematical logic , so that the early histories of the two fields , during the late 19th and early 20th centuries , largely overlap more recently , mathematical logic has often included the study of new pure mathematics , such as set theory , category theory , recursion theory and pure model theory , which is not directly related to metamathematics david hilbert was the first to invoke the term '' metamathematics '' with regularity ( see hilbert 's program ) , in the early 20th century in his hands , it meant something akin to contemporary proof theory , in which finitary methods are used to study various axiomatized mathematical theorems ( kleene 1952 , p today , metalogic and metamathematics broadly overlap , and both have been substantially subsumed by mathematical logic in academia the discovery of hyperbolic geometry had important philosophy consequences for metamathematics begriffsschrift ( german for , roughly , '' concept-script '' ) is a book on logic by gottlob frege , published in 1879 , and the formal system set out in that book contemporary mathematics , however , avoids paradoxes such as russell 's in less unwieldy ways , such as the system of zermelo–fraenkel set theory the theorems , proven by kurt gödel in 1931 , are important both in mathematical logic and in the philosophy of mathematics

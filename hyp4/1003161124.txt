the canal started from a point on the tidal east looe river just below terras bridge , about a mile ( about 1.5 & nbsp ; km ) above looe bridge when the railway branch line was built , a bridge over the canal was made , and this bridge can still be seen , showing the alignment of the canal at its lower termination the canal ran broadly north , following closely the course of the river itself , for a distance of , terminating at moorswater , in the valley to the west of liskeard the canal ran on the east side of the river , except between a point below plashford bridge to near landreast bridge , the present day railway branch line closely follows the route of the canal moorswater was chosen as a feasible terminal because of its altitude—below liskeard town—and proximity to the agricultural lands the canal was built to serve there was a basin at moorswater , located in the area near the present-day railway level crossing , close to the point where old road crosses under the a38 main road it was designed for 20 tonne barges ; water supply was from the upper reaches of the east looe river and the crylla there was a wharf at sandplace ( sand place ) but it was immediately adjacent to the main line of the canal ; messenger points out that a quay was dug into the river bank at sandplace to serve a kiln , and priestley was misled into thinking that this was a branch of the canal ; actually it was the main river to get to liskeard above the navigable river , the means of transport was on the backs of horses : the first wheeled wagon was introduced into the liskeard district in 1790 from messenger 's figures , page 9 : four to five tons of lime per acre annually ; 14.5 tons of limestone required for 100 '' double winchester bushels '' of 150 lbs of lime the idea for a canal to liskeard was first investigated in 1777 when edmund leach and '' a gentleman from liskeard '' proposed a canal which would run between banka mill , west of liskeard , and sandplace , to the north of looe on the east looe river at the time no canal inclined plane had been installed anywhere in the world : the first actually installed on a canal was on the ketley canal in 1788 after a second meeting at east looe on 9 august , the engineer james green was asked to present proposals for a canal , a railway or a turnpike road to link looe to liskeard he swiftly presented his views , on 30 august , recommending a tub-boat canal , suitable for four-ton boats in trains ( i.e a subscription list was quickly filled , but soon this proposal too stalled , due to strong opposition from interests in lostwithiel and fowey , and '' weakness of the proprietors in a pecuniary point of view and other insuperable obstacles '' in order to appease john buller , a substantial local landowner , the canal would have a '' towing path of sufficient width for gentlemen 's carriages '' the act created the liskeard and looe union canal company , with an authorised capital of £13,000 in shares of £25 , and authority to borrow a further £10,000 on mortgage if required the act gave powers '' for making and maintaining a navigable canal from tarras pill , in the parish of duloe it also allowed feed water to be taken from the river looe and the '' crylla rivulet '' ; but there were restrictions on the latter , so '' that no injury may be done to the navigation of the fowey , of which river the crylla is a tributary stream '' the new road gave access to highwood from the canal , using the turnpike road from moorswater to looe mills the canal vastly increased the facility of bringing lime and sea sand to the agricultural hinterland above liskeard ; in addition coal was brought for lime burning and for domestic use the canal after the railway the liskeard and caradon railway closed in 1917 but the liskeard and looe railway still operates , with passenger trains on the line being marketed under the brand name '' the looe valley line ''

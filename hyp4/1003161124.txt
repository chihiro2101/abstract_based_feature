the canal started from a point on the tidal east looe river just below terras bridge , about a mile ( about 1.5 & nbsp ; km ) above looe bridge when the railway branch line was built , a bridge over the canal was made , and this bridge can still be seen , showing the alignment of the canal at its lower termination the canal ran broadly north , following closely the course of the river itself , for a distance of , terminating at moorswater , in the valley to the west of liskeard the canal ran on the east side of the river , except between a point below plashford bridge to near landreast bridge , the present day railway branch line closely follows the route of the canal moorswater was chosen as a feasible terminal because of its altitude—below liskeard town—and proximity to the agricultural lands the canal was built to serve there was a basin at moorswater , located in the area near the present-day railway level crossing , close to the point where old road crosses under the a38 main road traditionally the limestone to prepare this had come from the plymouth area by coastal shipping to the east looe valley where it was burnt in kilns to make the lime in places it may well have had no defined edge or surface at all , leaving travellers to struggle as best they could in mist or darkness from messenger 's figures , page 9 : four to five tons of lime per acre annually ; 14.5 tons of limestone required for 100 '' double winchester bushels '' of 150 lbs of lime the idea for a canal to liskeard was first investigated in 1777 when edmund leach and '' a gentleman from liskeard '' proposed a canal which would run between banka mill , west of liskeard , and sandplace , to the north of looe on the east looe river at the time no canal inclined plane had been installed anywhere in the world : the first actually installed on a canal was on the ketley canal in 1788 after a second meeting at east looe on 9 august , the engineer james green was asked to present proposals for a canal , a railway or a turnpike road to link looe to liskeard in order to appease john buller , a substantial local landowner , the canal would have a '' towing path of sufficient width for gentlemen 's carriages '' green prepared plans for a bill , and the necessary act of parliament was obtained on 22 june 1825 , but after green 's departure , the proprietors asked robert coad to design the route in detail the act created the liskeard and looe union canal company , with an authorised capital of £13,000 in shares of £25 , and authority to borrow a further £10,000 on mortgage if required it also allowed feed water to be taken from the river looe and the '' crylla rivulet '' ; but there were restrictions on the latter , so '' that no injury may be done to the navigation of the fowey , of which river the crylla is a tributary stream '' robert rean , an apothecary and surgeon from east looe , for his services company minute books quoted in a road had to be made from moorswater into liskeard at dean well , at a cost of £1,200 , completed in 1829 about 1835 a section of road from looe mills to highwood was constructed by the canal company this was due to a general agricultural depression , and also competition from st germans and lerryn ( on an arm of the river fowey ) ; the company repeatedly reduced dues on the canal moving the minerals by pack horse was expensive and inconvenient , and the liskeard and caradon railway was promoted to bring the ore to moorswater ; the canal company made room at their terminal for the railway the canal after the railway the great western railway purchased the canal company in 1909 , in order to acquire the railway line , passenger traffic , and especially tourism , having taken over as the dominant traffic

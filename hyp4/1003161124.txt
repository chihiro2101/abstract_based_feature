the canal started from a point on the tidal east looe river just below terras bridge , about a mile ( about 1.5 & nbsp ; km ) above looe bridge when the railway branch line was built , a bridge over the canal was made , and this bridge can still be seen , showing the alignment of the canal at its lower termination the canal ran broadly north , following closely the course of the river itself , for a distance of , terminating at moorswater , in the valley to the west of liskeard the canal ran on the east side of the river , except between a point below plashford bridge to near landreast bridge , the present day railway branch line closely follows the route of the canal moorswater was chosen as a feasible terminal because of its altitude—below liskeard town—and proximity to the agricultural lands the canal was built to serve the distance which it passes over is five miles and seven furlongs , 9.5 & nbsp ; km and in its course there are twenty-five locks there was a wharf at sandplace ( sand place ) but it was immediately adjacent to the main line of the canal ; messenger points out that a quay was dug into the river bank at sandplace to serve a kiln , and priestley was misled into thinking that this was a branch of the canal ; actually it was the main river the vertical interval he quotes may be due to the definition of '' sea level '' at the time ; in any case the lower end of the canal joined the river some distance above the sea agricultural land around the looe valleys was considered to be of high quality , but the acid soil required annual improvement with lime to get to liskeard above the navigable river , the means of transport was on the backs of horses : the first wheeled wagon was introduced into the liskeard district in 1790 the idea for a canal to liskeard was first investigated in 1777 when edmund leach and '' a gentleman from liskeard '' proposed a canal which would run between banka mill , west of liskeard , and sandplace , to the north of looe on the east looe river after a second meeting at east looe on 9 august , the engineer james green was asked to present proposals for a canal , a railway or a turnpike road to link looe to liskeard report by john buller , quoted in the following year the plan was revived , this time for a canal with locks in order to appease john buller , a substantial local landowner , the canal would have a '' towing path of sufficient width for gentlemen 's carriages '' the act created the liskeard and looe union canal company , with an authorised capital of £13,000 in shares of £25 , and authority to borrow a further £10,000 on mortgage if required the canal had been planned to run on the west side of the river towards looe , but a landowner , mr eliot , was holding out for excessive compensation for his land , and the construction was transferred to the east side over the affected length , in the lands of john buller , to by-pass eliot 's land part of the canal opened for traffic on 27 august 1827 , and in march 1828 the royal cornwall gazette reported that it was complete company minute books quoted in a road had to be made from moorswater into liskeard at dean well , at a cost of £1,200 , completed in 1829 moving the minerals by pack horse was expensive and inconvenient , and the liskeard and caradon railway was promoted to bring the ore to moorswater ; the canal company made room at their terminal for the railway mineral ore could now be brought relatively conveniently to market : by railway to moorswater ; by canal boat to looe ; and onwards by coastal shipping the railway did not take over the canal alignment : it crossed the canal by bridge in five places , three below sandplace and two above , although the railway seems to have obliterated the canal in the northern extremity between 1901 and 1909 , the annual gross dues averaged 35 shillings ( £1.75 ) , mainly derived from tolls of 3 pence ( 1.25p ) for small boats of about 1.5 tons carrying sand and seaweed , which was used to improve the land the liskeard and caradon railway closed in 1917 but the liskeard and looe railway still operates , with passenger trains on the line being marketed under the brand name '' the looe valley line ''

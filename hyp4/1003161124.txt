the canal started from a point on the tidal east looe river just below terras bridge , about a mile ( about 1.5 & nbsp ; km ) above looe bridge when the railway branch line was built , a bridge over the canal was made , and this bridge can still be seen , showing the alignment of the canal at its lower termination the canal ran broadly north , following closely the course of the river itself , for a distance of , terminating at moorswater , in the valley to the west of liskeard the canal ran on the east side of the river , except between a point below plashford bridge to near landreast bridge , the present day railway branch line closely follows the route of the canal moorswater was chosen as a feasible terminal because of its altitude—below liskeard town—and proximity to the agricultural lands the canal was built to serve it was designed for 20 tonne barges ; water supply was from the upper reaches of the east looe river and the crylla the vertical interval he quotes may be due to the definition of '' sea level '' at the time ; in any case the lower end of the canal joined the river some distance above the sea agricultural land around the looe valleys was considered to be of high quality , but the acid soil required annual improvement with lime at the time no canal inclined plane had been installed anywhere in the world : the first actually installed on a canal was on the ketley canal in 1788 after a second meeting at east looe on 9 august , the engineer james green was asked to present proposals for a canal , a railway or a turnpike road to link looe to liskeard in order to appease john buller , a substantial local landowner , the canal would have a '' towing path of sufficient width for gentlemen 's carriages '' the act gave powers '' for making and maintaining a navigable canal from tarras pill , in the parish of duloe to or near moorswater , in the parish of liskeard , and for making several roads to communicate therewith '' '' however priestley does not offer this as a direct quotation from the act , and he may have heard this reported from an earlier , unsuccessful bill , and mistakenly understood the plan to be still current the canal had been planned to run on the west side of the river towards looe , but a landowner , mr eliot , was holding out for excessive compensation for his land , and the construction was transferred to the east side over the affected length , in the lands of john buller , to by-pass eliot 's land company minute books quoted in a road had to be made from moorswater into liskeard at dean well , at a cost of £1,200 , completed in 1829 highwood is a little less than a mile ( about 1 & nbsp ; km ) north of looe mills , on the turnpike road north-west of moorswater the new road gave access to highwood from the canal , using the turnpike road from moorswater to looe mills the canal vastly increased the facility of bringing lime and sea sand to the agricultural hinterland above liskeard ; in addition coal was brought for lime burning and for domestic use moving the minerals by pack horse was expensive and inconvenient , and the liskeard and caradon railway was promoted to bring the ore to moorswater ; the canal company made room at their terminal for the railway the railway reached that place in 1846 , on 8 march , from when the ore was taken to looe on the canal the canal after the railway the liskeard and caradon railway closed in 1917 but the liskeard and looe railway still operates , with passenger trains on the line being marketed under the brand name '' the looe valley line ''

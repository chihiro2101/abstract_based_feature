the canal started from a point on the tidal east looe river just below terras bridge , about a mile ( about 1.5 & nbsp ; km ) above looe bridge when the railway branch line was built , a bridge over the canal was made , and this bridge can still be seen , showing the alignment of the canal at its lower termination the canal ran broadly north , following closely the course of the river itself , for a distance of , terminating at moorswater , in the valley to the west of liskeard the canal ran on the east side of the river , except between a point below plashford bridge to near landreast bridge , the present day railway branch line closely follows the route of the canal moorswater was chosen as a feasible terminal because of its altitude—below liskeard town—and proximity to the agricultural lands the canal was built to serve there was a basin at moorswater , located in the area near the present-day railway level crossing , close to the point where old road crosses under the a38 main road agricultural land around the looe valleys was considered to be of high quality , but the acid soil required annual improvement with lime from messenger 's figures , page 9 : four to five tons of lime per acre annually ; 14.5 tons of limestone required for 100 '' double winchester bushels '' of 150 lbs of lime the idea for a canal to liskeard was first investigated in 1777 when edmund leach and '' a gentleman from liskeard '' proposed a canal which would run between banka mill , west of liskeard , and sandplace , to the north of looe on the east looe river at the time no canal inclined plane had been installed anywhere in the world : the first actually installed on a canal was on the ketley canal in 1788 after a second meeting at east looe on 9 august , the engineer james green was asked to present proposals for a canal , a railway or a turnpike road to link looe to liskeard the rise of 180 & nbsp ; feet in in 10 & nbsp ; km ) threatened water supply difficulties if negotiated by locks , so green repeated the earlier proposal for two inclined planes a subscription list was quickly filled , but soon this proposal too stalled , due to strong opposition from interests in lostwithiel and fowey , and '' weakness of the proprietors in a pecuniary point of view and other insuperable obstacles '' the act created the liskeard and looe union canal company , with an authorised capital of £13,000 in shares of £25 , and authority to borrow a further £10,000 on mortgage if required traffic immediately transferred to this road from the steep and inconvenient turnpike road ( '' old road '' ) and the canal company demanded a subscription for maintenance from the turnpike trustees about 1835 a section of road from looe mills to highwood was constructed by the canal company the new road gave access to highwood from the canal , using the turnpike road from moorswater to looe mills the company watched expenditure carefully , but managed to pay a dividend of 6 per cent in 1830 and 5 per cent thereafter for most of the canal 's life considerable attention was given to improving the terminal facilities at moorswater , as the trade increased moving the minerals by pack horse was expensive and inconvenient , and the liskeard and caradon railway was promoted to bring the ore to moorswater ; the canal company made room at their terminal for the railway the canal after the railway the railway did not take over the canal alignment : it crossed the canal by bridge in five places , three below sandplace and two above , although the railway seems to have obliterated the canal in the northern extremity the great western railway purchased the canal company in 1909 , in order to acquire the railway line , passenger traffic , and especially tourism , having taken over as the dominant traffic

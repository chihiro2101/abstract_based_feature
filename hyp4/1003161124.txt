the canal started from a point on the tidal east looe river just below terras bridge , about a mile ( about 1.5 & nbsp ; km ) above looe bridge when the railway branch line was built , a bridge over the canal was made , and this bridge can still be seen , showing the alignment of the canal at its lower termination the canal ran broadly north , following closely the course of the river itself , for a distance of , terminating at moorswater , in the valley to the west of liskeard the canal ran on the east side of the river , except between a point below plashford bridge to near landreast bridge , the present day railway branch line closely follows the route of the canal moorswater was chosen as a feasible terminal because of its altitude—below liskeard town—and proximity to the agricultural lands the canal was built to serve roads for onward transport were built , eastward to liskeard itself and northward to highwood there was a wharf at sandplace ( sand place ) but it was immediately adjacent to the main line of the canal ; messenger points out that a quay was dug into the river bank at sandplace to serve a kiln , and priestley was misled into thinking that this was a branch of the canal ; actually it was the main river the vertical interval he quotes may be due to the definition of '' sea level '' at the time ; in any case the lower end of the canal joined the river some distance above the sea agricultural land around the looe valleys was considered to be of high quality , but the acid soil required annual improvement with lime the idea for a canal to liskeard was first investigated in 1777 when edmund leach and '' a gentleman from liskeard '' proposed a canal which would run between banka mill , west of liskeard , and sandplace , to the north of looe on the east looe river at the time no canal inclined plane had been installed anywhere in the world : the first actually installed on a canal was on the ketley canal in 1788 after a second meeting at east looe on 9 august , the engineer james green was asked to present proposals for a canal , a railway or a turnpike road to link looe to liskeard he swiftly presented his views , on 30 august , recommending a tub-boat canal , suitable for four-ton boats in trains ( i.e the act created the liskeard and looe union canal company , with an authorised capital of £13,000 in shares of £25 , and authority to borrow a further £10,000 on mortgage if required work on building the canal began on 6 september 1825 , with robert coad as the engineer and robert retallick as superintendent of works the canal had been planned to run on the west side of the river towards looe , but a landowner , mr eliot , was holding out for excessive compensation for his land , and the construction was transferred to the east side over the affected length , in the lands of john buller , to by-pass eliot 's land users of the canal company 's road were subject to tolls the new road gave access to highwood from the canal , using the turnpike road from moorswater to looe mills mineral ore could now be brought relatively conveniently to market : by railway to moorswater ; by canal boat to looe ; and onwards by coastal shipping the railway opened on 27 december 1860 for goods traffic , passenger traffic following in 1879 ; it is more fully described in the article liskeard and looe railway the canal after the railway a note in the accounts for 1862 states : '' 1861 : lluc 's canal replaced by railway and steam introduced on the lcr the liskeard and caradon railway closed in 1917 but the liskeard and looe railway still operates , with passenger trains on the line being marketed under the brand name '' the looe valley line ''

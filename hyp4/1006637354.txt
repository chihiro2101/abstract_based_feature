' '' american nightmare '' may have been the first psychobilly song the meteors also articulated psychobilly 's politics stance , a reaction to the right- and left-wing political attitudes which divided other british youth cultures fans of the meteors , known as '' the wrecking crew '' , are often attributed with inventing the style of moshing known as '' wrecking '' , which became synonymous with the psychobilly movement the short-lived sharks , formed in bristol in 1980 , followed closely behind the meteors with their influential album phantom rockers '' another london band the ricochets were the first band after the meteors to call their music psychobilly their debut album made in the shade from 1982 is another influential psychobilly album '' demented are go are a welsh psychobilly band that was formed around 1982 in cardiff they were one of the earliest in the initial wave of bands to mix punk rock with rockabilly , and as a result , are considered to be highly influential to the psychobilly scene their first album , 1985 's held down to vinyl at last , has been described by tiger army frontman nick 13 as '' the most important release since the meteors ' first two albums '' the klub foot nightclub , opened in 1982 at the clarendon hotel in hammersmith , served as a center for britain 's emerging psychobilly movement and hosted many bands associated with the style a live compilation album entitled stomping at the klub foot was released in 1984 , documenting the club 's scene and the bands who played there at the same time psychobilly bands were forming elsewhere in europe , such as batmobile who emerged in the netherlands in 1983 , released their debut album in 1985 , and soon began headlining at psychobilly festivals and at the klub foot another significant release of this era was the compilation album rockabilly psychosis and the garage disease , which acknowledged the genre 's roots in rockabilly and garage rock however , one american act that emulated the style was the reverend horton heat , formed in dallas , texas in 1985 their 1990 single '' psychobilly freakout '' helped introduce american audiences to the genre their touring in support of the album helped to establish a foothold for psychobilly across the united states another notable california psychobilly band formed in the 1990s was the chop tops they have toured with bands like german psychobillies mad sin and the nekromantix , and have opened for the dead kennedys , suicidal tendencies , dick dale , john lee hooker , and chuck berry in 1992 , the kryptonix emerged in france while the godless wicked creeps formed in denmark the following year , downey , p.82 edmonton 's dusty chaps might also be seen as an early exponent of the style with the inclusion of their sinister '' psychopath of love '' on nervous records ' compilation boppin ' in canada ( 1991 ) tiger army frontman nick 13 explains : '' the number-one misconception people have is that psychobilly is the same thing as rockabilly nate katz states that '' while traces of glam , metal , and punk can be found in psychobilly , at its core , psychobilly emerged from rockabilly , particularly the neo-rockabilly movement in london during the late 1970s '' '' moreover , '' in the song '' take a razor to your head , '' they clearly seek out those breaking away from neo-rockabilly into psychobilly '' downey acknowledges that contemporary psychobilly 's roots extend into 2 tone ska , garage rock , hardcore punk , street punk and oi ! often the guitarist or bassist will be the lead singing , with few acts having a dedicated singer ( mad sin being one of the examples with a dedicated singer ) as with rockabilly guitarists , the overdrive tone usually comes from what is produced naturally by overdriving the tube amp , rather than by plugging into a distortion pedal an upright double bass is often used instead of the electric bass found in most rock bands ( though an electric bass is sometimes optional ) this live tiger army song shows kresge 's rapid slap bass technique some acts have made their upright bass the centerpiece of their stage shows ; some psychobilly musicians elaborately decorate their upright bass , such as nekromantix frontman kim nekroman , whose '' coffinbass '' is in the shape of a coffin , with a headstock in the shape of a cross another notable act to use a coffin-shaped bass is the brazilian psychobilly band os catalepticos horrorpops frontwoman patricia day also uses an elaborately painted and decorated double bass the cramps performed without a bass player in their early career , using two guitars instead cramps guitarist/bassist poison ivy sees this as one of the distinctions that separate the band from the psychobilly movement : '' i think psychobilly has evolved into a gamut of things psychobilly band members of both sexes often have prominent tattoos , often with a vintage theme ( it contains a history of psychobilly up until the early 1990s ) '' psychobilly meltdown

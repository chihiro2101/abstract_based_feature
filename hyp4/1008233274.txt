the basidiocarp ( reproductive structure ) of the fungus is a mushroom that grows on wood , typically in small dense clumps or tufts all armillaria species have a white spore print and none have a volva ( cup at base ) ( compare amanita ) are separated from armillaria by its yellowish to greenish-yellow tone and a dark brown to grey-brown spore print honey fungus is a '' white rot '' fungus , which is a pathogenic organism that affects trees , shrubs , woody climbers and , rarely , woody herbaceous perennials honey fungus can grow on living , decaying , and dead plant material honey fungus spreads from living trees , dead and live roots and stumps by means of reddish-brown to black rhizomorphs ( root-like structures ) at the rate of approximately a year , but infection by root contact is possible rhizomorphs grow close to the soil surface ( in the top and invade new roots , or the root collar ( where the roots meet the stem ) of plants an infected tree will die once the fungus has girdled it , or when significant root damage has occurred thin sheets of cream colored mycelium , beneath the bark at the base of the trunk or stem indicated that honey fungus is likely the pathogen new questions remain unanswered regarding the phylogeny of north american armillaria species and their relationships to their european counterparts , particularly within the “ armillaria mellea complex ” armillaria root rot in the canadian prairie provinces armillaria root rot pathogens of the canadian prairie provinces honey fungus are regarded in ukraine , russia , poland , germany and other european countries as one of the best wild mushrooms armillaria root rot armillaria mellea ( vahl ex fr armillaria root rot : biology and control of honey fungus

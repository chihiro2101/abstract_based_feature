the basidiocarp ( reproductive structure ) of the fungus is a mushroom that grows on wood , typically in small dense clumps or tufts all armillaria species have a white spore print and none have a volva ( cup at base ) ( compare amanita ) which also grow in cespitose ( mat-like ) clusters on wood and fruit in the fall are separated from armillaria by its yellowish to greenish-yellow tone and a dark brown to grey-brown spore print galerina have a dark brown spore print and are deadly poisonous ( alpha-amanitin ) â€“ see : mushroom poisoning honey fungus is a '' white rot '' fungus , which is a pathogenic organism that affects trees , shrubs , woody climbers and , rarely , woody herbaceous perennials data from such studies , especially those using molecular diagnostic tools , have removed much uncertainty for mycologists and forest pathologists phylogenetic reconstruction of north american armillaria species and related european taxa based on nuclear ribosomal dna internal transcribed spacers intersterile species of armillaria occurring in north america ( north american biological species nabs ) were listed by mallett ( 1992 ) : mallett , k.i armillaria root rot in the canadian prairie provinces armillaria ostoyae is the species most commonly found in all canadian provinces surveyed ( mallett 1990 ) armillaria root rot armillaria mellea ( vahl ex fr armillaria root rot enters hosts through the roots reviews of the biology , diversity , pathology , and control of armillaria in fox ( 2000 ) fox , r.t.v armillaria root rot : biology and control of honey fungus

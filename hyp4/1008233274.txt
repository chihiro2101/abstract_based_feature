the basidiocarp ( reproductive structure ) of the fungus is a mushroom that grows on wood , typically in small dense clumps or tufts all armillaria species have a white spore print and none have a volva ( cup at base ) ( compare amanita ) are separated from armillaria by its yellowish to greenish-yellow tone and a dark brown to grey-brown spore print which can grow side by side with armillaria spp galerina have a dark brown spore print and are deadly poisonous ( alpha-amanitin ) – see : mushroom poisoning honey fungus is a '' white rot '' fungus , which is a pathogenic organism that affects trees , shrubs , woody climbers and , rarely , woody herbaceous perennials honey fungus can grow on living , decaying , and dead plant material however these symptoms and signs do not necessarily mean that the pathogenic strains of honey fungus are the cause , so other identification methods are advised before diagnosis on conifers honey fungus often exudes a gum or resin from cracks in the bark new questions remain unanswered regarding the phylogeny of north american armillaria species and their relationships to their european counterparts , particularly within the “ armillaria mellea complex ” armillaria root rot in the canadian prairie provinces armillaria ostoyae is the species most commonly found in all canadian provinces surveyed ( mallett 1990 ) armillaria root rot armillaria mellea ( vahl ex fr impact of armillaria root rot in intensively managed white spruce/asspen stands armillaria root rot : biology and control of honey fungus

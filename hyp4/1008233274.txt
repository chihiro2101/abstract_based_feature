the basidiocarp ( reproductive structure ) of the fungus is a mushroom that grows on wood , typically in small dense clumps or tufts all armillaria species have a white spore print and none have a volva ( cup at base ) ( compare amanita ) similar species include pholiota spp are separated from armillaria by its yellowish to greenish-yellow tone and a dark brown to grey-brown spore print honey fungus is a '' white rot '' fungus , which is a pathogenic organism that affects trees , shrubs , woody climbers and , rarely , woody herbaceous perennials honey fungus can grow on living , decaying , and dead plant material an infected tree will die once the fungus has girdled it , or when significant root damage has occurred initial symptoms of honey fungus infection include dieback or shortage of leaves in spring the linkage of morphological , genetic , and molecular characters of armillaria over the past few decades has led to the recognition of intersterile groups designated as “ biological species ” data from such studies , especially those using molecular diagnostic tools , have removed much uncertainty for mycologists and forest pathologists new questions remain unanswered regarding the phylogeny of north american armillaria species and their relationships to their european counterparts , particularly within the “ armillaria mellea complex ” ) herink ii armillaria gemina bérubé & dessureault iii armillaria calvescens bérubé & dessureault v armillaria sinapina bérubé & dessureault vi armillaria mellea ( vahl armillaria root rot armillaria mellea ( vahl ex fr impact of armillaria root rot in intensively managed white spruce/asspen stands armillaria root rot : biology and control of honey fungus

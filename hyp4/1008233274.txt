the basidiocarp ( reproductive structure ) of the fungus is a mushroom that grows on wood , typically in small dense clumps or tufts are separated from armillaria by its yellowish to greenish-yellow tone and a dark brown to grey-brown spore print which can grow side by side with armillaria spp honey fungus is a '' white rot '' fungus , which is a pathogenic organism that affects trees , shrubs , woody climbers and , rarely , woody herbaceous perennials honey fungus can grow on living , decaying , and dead plant material rhizomorphs grow close to the soil surface ( in the top and invade new roots , or the root collar ( where the roots meet the stem ) of plants initial symptoms of honey fungus infection include dieback or shortage of leaves in spring data from such studies , especially those using molecular diagnostic tools , have removed much uncertainty for mycologists and forest pathologists new questions remain unanswered regarding the phylogeny of north american armillaria species and their relationships to their european counterparts , particularly within the “ armillaria mellea complex ” intersterile species of armillaria occurring in north america ( north american biological species nabs ) were listed by mallett ( 1992 ) : mallett , k.i armillaria root rot in the canadian prairie provinces ) herink ii armillaria gemina bérubé & dessureault iii armillaria calvescens bérubé & dessureault v armillaria sinapina bérubé & dessureault vi armillaria mellea ( vahl armillaria root rot armillaria mellea ( vahl ex fr impact of armillaria root rot in intensively managed white spruce/asspen stands armillaria root rot : biology and control of honey fungus

the people are known as the nenets , which means '' people '' in old russian , the term samoyed was often applied indiscriminately to different peoples of northern russia who speak related uralic languages : nenets , nganasans , enets , selkups ( speakers of samoyedic languages ) currently , the term '' samoyedic peoples '' applies to the whole group of these different peoples it is the general term that includes the nenets , enets , selkup , and nganasan peoples the nenets language is on the samoyedic branch of the uralic language family , with two major dialects , forest nenets and tundra nenets ethnologue says that in siberia , most young people are still fluent in nenets , whereas in european russia , they tend to speak russian overall , the majority of native speakers are from older generations there are two distinct groups of nenets sensu stricto , based on their economy : the tundra nenets ( living far to the north ) and the khandeyar or forest nenets a distinct third group of nenets ( yaran people ) has emerged as a result of intermarriages between nenets and izhma komi people using reindeer as a draft animal throughout the year enables them to cover great distances tundra wolf can cause considerable economic loss , as they prey on the reindeer herds which are the livelihood of some nenets families they have a shamanistic and animistic belief system which stresses respect for the land and its resources the contents of this sacred sleigh are only unpacked during special occasions or for religious rituals ( like sacrifices ) due to the collectivization policy , many herders moved north while many of those that remained were '' deprived of their reindeer '' nenets people once owned many reindeer but after the war , many nenets had to transition to small-scale herding although the nenets herders were greatly affected , their lifestyle was not at threat for too long anna nerkagi is one of the most celebrated nenets writers although the nenets people were able to remain resilient in the face of continuous change and maltreatment , a new challenge now awaits them environmental damage to the nenets ' is significant due to industrialisation of their land , colonization and climate change approximately half of the 10,000 nenets people in the yamal peninsula are nomadic and herd reindeer with oil industries continuing to expand , the impact on the nenets people is expected to increase . the impact on the nenets people with the nenets people being nomadic and reliant on reindeer husbandry , the migratory routes for the reindeer are very important to them the nenets people have a tradition of designating a scared spot where they make a request of the spirits for a successful migration lastly , an impact that is loosely related with the migration routes is accessibility to health care clinics by the nenets people nenets people worry that the deal will lead to a passing in their autonomy as well as their language and traditions the nenets people have previously attempted to organize and protest against these oil and gas companies although there are many nenets people who are against the industrial development going on in the yamal peninsula such as the activists aforementioned , there are also many who are in support of the developments

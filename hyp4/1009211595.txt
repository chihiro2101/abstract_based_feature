however it refused to give him significant support sigismund 's army was composed mostly of mercenaries ( germans and hungarians ) , supported by a relatively small polish force ( although with some artillery ) in 1648 john casimir was elected by the polish parliament to succeed his half-brother on the polish throne future commanders who studied and admired gustav ii adolf include napoleon i of france and carl von clausewitz when sigismund ii of poland died without issue , the son of john iii of sweden and catherine jagellonka was elected king of poland and grand duke of lithuania as sigismund iii in 1587

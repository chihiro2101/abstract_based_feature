harry frazee was born june 29 , 1880 , in peoria , illinois , son of william and margaret frazee he attended peoria high school , where he was a baseball teammate of harry bay , who later played for major league baseball teams in cincinnati and cleveland frazee bought the boston red sox baseball team from joseph lannin for a reported 675,000 after their victory in the 1916 world series the team finished sixth in 1919 , and after that season frazee started selling players to the new york yankees , most notoriously babe ruth he then left the red sox in bankruptcy while continuing to produce theatre shows after the sale of ruth , the team crashed into the american league cellar and did not finish above the truth is more nuanced and has as much to do with a long-running dispute between frazee and american league founder and president ban johnson as it does with frazee 's finances frazee was the first american league owner who johnson had not essentially hand-picked , and was unwilling to simply do johnson 's bidding although they seemed to settle their differences when frazee hired ed barrow , a friend of johnson 's , as manager , their relationship worsened again when frazee loudly criticized johnson 's handling of the issues brought about by the american entry into world war i harry frazee and the boston red sox johnson had promised yankee owners jacob ruppert and cap huston to get them better players , but never followed through in effect , johnson limited frazee to dealing with either the white sox or the yankees the white sox offered joe jackson and 60,000 , but the yankees offered an all-cash deal : 25,000 up front and three promissory notes of 25,000 each , plus a 300,000 loan to be secured by a mortgage on fenway park with the note from lannin that he had used in part to finance his purchase of the red sox having come due in november 1919 , frazee had little choice but to take the yankees ' offer the ruth sale cemented the red sox–yankees alliance , and shifted the relationship from yankees–red sox rivalry when frazee bought the red sox , fenway park was not part of the deal in this way , if johnson ever yanked the franchise out from under frazee , any prospective owner of a boston american league team would risk being left without a place to play however , frazee had stopped paying installments because of a dispute over who owed boston 's share of mlb 's settlement with the federal league since the lien barred frazee from trading players or buying fenway without lannin 's permission , lannin effectively controlled the team lannin also threatened to sell his interest in the fenway realty trust , which would have opened the door for a new owner to buy into the park if frazee lost the franchise with the white sox ' reputation in tatters following the black sox scandal , frazee was left with little choice but to deal with the yankees over the next three years , frazee sold virtually all of the red sox ' top players to the yankees , netting him a total of 305,000 the above only includes the trades frazee made to the yankees from 1918 to 1923 , when he was owner of the red sox frazee wanted to trade ruth to the white sox for jackson , but the black sox scandal scuttled those plans

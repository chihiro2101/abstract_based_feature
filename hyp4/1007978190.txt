first made in france in 1869 , it was created by hippolyte mège-mouriès in response to a challenge by emperor napoleon iii to create a butter substitute from beef tallow for the armed forces and lower classes entry μαργαρίς at lsj scientists at the time regarded margaric acid , like oleic acid and stearic acid , as one of the three fatty acids that , in combination , form most animal fats french chemist hippolyte mège-mouriès invented a substance he called oleomargarine , which became shortened to the trade name margarine bradley of binghamton , new york received for a process of creating margarine that combined vegetable oils ( primarily cottonseed oil ) with animal fats by the late 19th century , some 37 companies were manufacturing margarine in opposition to the butter industry , which protested and lobbied for government intervention , eventually leading to the 1886 margarine act imposing punitive fees against margarine manufacturers while butter that cows produced had a slightly yellow color , margarine had a white color , making the margarine look more like lard , which many people found unappetizing around the late 1880s , manufacturers began coloring margarine yellow to improve sales in response , the margarine companies distributed the margarine together with a packet of yellow food coloring the product was placed in a bowl and the coloring mixed in manually this took some time and effort , and it was not unusual for the final product to be served as a light and dark yellow , or even white , striped product during world war ii , there was a shortage of butter in the united states , and '' oleomargarine '' became popular dennison company received for a method to place a capsule of yellow dye inside a plastic package of margarine the products were fractionally distilled and the edible fats were obtained from the - fraction which were reacted with glycerol such as that synthesized from propylene during wwii rationing in great britain , only two types of margarine were available : a premium brand and a cheaper budget brand the competition between the major producers was given further impetus with the beginning of commercial television advertising in 1955 and , throughout the 1950s and 1960s , competing companies vied with each other to produce the margarine that tasted most like butter in the mid-1960s , the introduction of two lower-fat blends of butter oil and vegetable oils in scandinavia , called lätt & lagom and bregott , clouded the issue of what should be called '' margarine '' and began the debate that led to the introduction of the term '' spread '' the vegetable oil and cream spread i ca n't believe it 's not butter ! was introduced into the united states in 1981 , and in the united kingdom and canada in 1991 other varieties of spreads include those with added omega-3 fatty acids , low or no salt , added phytosterol ( claimed to reduce blood cholesterol ) , olive oil , or certified vegan oils margarines and vegetable fat spreads found in the market can range from 10 % to 90 % fat , depending on dietary marketing and purpose ( spreading , cooking or baking ) three types of margarine are common : bottled liquid margarine to cook or top dishes soft vegetable fat spreads , high in mono- or polyunsaturated fats , which are made from safflower , sunflower , soybean , cottonseed , rapeseed , or olive oil hard margarine ( sometimes uncolored ) for cooking or baking to produce margarine , first oils and fats are extracted , e.g this is due to the increase in van der waals ' forces between the saturated molecules compared with the unsaturated molecules however , as there are possible health benefits in limiting the amount of saturated fats in the human diet , the process is controlled so that only enough of the bonds are hydrogenated to give the required texture if hydrogenation is incomplete ( partial hardening ) , the relatively high temperatures used in the hydrogenation process tend to flip some of the carbon-carbon double bonds into the '' trans '' form if these particular bonds are not hydrogenated during the process , they remain present in the final margarine in molecules of trans fats , the consumption of which has been shown to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease for this reason , partially hardened fats are used less and less in the margarine industry replacing saturated and trans unsaturated fats with unhydrogenated monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats is more effective in preventing coronary heart disease than reducing overall fat intake typical soft tub margarine contains 10 % to 20 % of saturated fat some widely grown vegetable oils , such as canola , sunflower , safflower , and olive oils contain high amounts of unsaturated fats however , one type of omega-3 fatty acid , alpha-linolenic acid ( ala ) can be found in some vegetable oils omega-6 fatty acids omega-6 fatty acids are also important for health unlike essential fatty acids , trans fatty acids are not essential and provide no known benefit to human health besides providing calories the united states food and drug administration ordered that trans fat is to be eliminated from food processing after a three-year grace period beginning in june 2015 , to then be implemented by june 18 , 2018 '' calorie reduced margarine is specified in standard b.09.017 as : '' containing not less than 40 % fat and having 50 % of the calories normally present in margarine spread that contains 39 to 41 % of fat may be called '' half-fat margarine '' , '' low-fat margarine '' , or '' light margarine '' many member states currently require the mandatory addition of vitamins a and d to margarine and fat spreads for reasons of public health if margarine were colored the same as butter , consumers would see it as being virtually the same thing as butter , and as a natural product post-war , the margarine lobby gained power and , little by little , the main margarine restrictions were lifted , the most recent states to do so being minnesota in 1963 and wisconsin in 1967

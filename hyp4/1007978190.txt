was introduced into the united states in 1981 , and in the united kingdom and canada in 1991 ( '' filbert has moved into the syracuse , albany , and pittsburgh markets with a one-pound blend called '' i ca n't believe it 's not butter many brands launched refrigerator-stable margarine spreads that contain only 1/3 of the fat and calorie content of traditional spreads other varieties of spreads include those with added omega-3 fatty acids , low or no salt , added phytosterol ( claimed to reduce blood cholesterol ) , olive oil , or certified vegan oils in the early 21st century , manufacturers provided margarines in plastic squeeze bottles to ease dispensing and offered pink margarine as a novelty margarines and vegetable fat spreads found in the market can range from 10 % to 90 % fat , depending on dietary marketing and purpose ( spreading , cooking or baking ) three types of margarine are common : bottled liquid margarine to cook or top dishes hard margarine ( sometimes uncolored ) for cooking or baking the water-soluble additives are added to the water or milk mixture , and emulsifiers such as lecithin are added to help disperse the water phase evenly throughout the oil other water-soluble additives include powdered skim milk , salt , citric acid , lactic acid , and preservatives such as potassium sorbate finally , the product may be aerated with nitrogen to facilitate spreading it commonly , natural oils are hydrogenated by passing hydrogen gas through the oil in the presence of a nickel catalyst , under controlled conditions the addition of hydrogen to the unsaturated bonds ( alkenic double c c bonds ) results in saturated c-c bonds , effectively increasing the melting point of the oil and thus '' hardening '' it this method is used today for some margarines although the process has been developed and sometimes other metal catalysts are used such as palladium if these particular bonds are not hydrogenated during the process , they remain present in the final margarine in molecules of trans fats , the consumption of which has been shown to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease some tropical oils , such as palm oil and coconut oil , are naturally semi-solid and do not require hydrogenation the roles of butter and traditional margarine ( 80 % fat ) are similar with respect to their energy content , but low-fat margarines and spreads are also widely available some widely grown vegetable oils , such as canola , sunflower , safflower , and olive oils contain high amounts of unsaturated fats regular margarine contains trace amounts of animal products such as whey or dairy casein extracts spread that contains 60 to 62 % of fat may be called '' three-quarter-fat margarine '' or '' reduced-fat margarine '' this mandatory fortification was justified in the view that margarine was being used to replace butter in the diet with the coming of world war i , margarine consumption increased enormously , even in countries away from the front , such as the united states post-war , the margarine lobby gained power and , little by little , the main margarine restrictions were lifted , the most recent states to do so being minnesota in 1963 and wisconsin in 1967

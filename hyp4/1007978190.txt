entry μαργαρίς at lsj scientists at the time regarded margaric acid , like oleic acid and stearic acid , as one of the three fatty acids that , in combination , form most animal fats emperor napoleon iii of france offered a prize to anyone who could make a satisfactory butter alternative , suitable for use by the military and the poor french chemist hippolyte mège-mouriès invented a substance he called oleomargarine , which became shortened to the trade name margarine bradley of binghamton , new york received for a process of creating margarine that combined vegetable oils ( primarily cottonseed oil ) with animal fats by the late 19th century , some 37 companies were manufacturing margarine in opposition to the butter industry , which protested and lobbied for government intervention , eventually leading to the 1886 margarine act imposing punitive fees against margarine manufacturers the great depression , followed by rationing in america and the united kingdom , among other countries , during world war ii , led to a reduction in supply of animal fat and butter , and , by 1945 , '' original '' margarine had almost completely disappeared from the market in response , the margarine companies distributed the margarine together with a packet of yellow food coloring this took some time and effort , and it was not unusual for the final product to be served as a light and dark yellow , or even white , striped product during world war ii , there was a shortage of butter in the united states , and '' oleomargarine '' became popular dennison company received for a method to place a capsule of yellow dye inside a plastic package of margarine the products were fractionally distilled and the edible fats were obtained from the - fraction which were reacted with glycerol such as that synthesized from propylene margarine made from them was found to be nutritious and of agreeable taste , and it was incorporated into diets contributing as much as 700 calories per day the process required at least 60 & nbsp ; kg of coal per kg of synthetic butter during wwii rationing in great britain , only two types of margarine were available : a premium brand and a cheaper budget brand with the end of rationing in 1955 , the market was opened to the forces of supply and demand , and brand marketing became prevalent the vegetable oil and cream spread i ca n't believe it 's not butter ! was introduced into the united states in 1981 , and in the united kingdom and canada in 1991 '' '' ) in the 21st century , margarine spreads had many developments to improve their consumer appeal in the early 21st century , manufacturers provided margarines in plastic squeeze bottles to ease dispensing and offered pink margarine as a novelty margarines and vegetable fat spreads found in the market can range from 10 % to 90 % fat , depending on dietary marketing and purpose ( spreading , cooking or baking ) three types of margarine are common : bottled liquid margarine to cook or top dishes technically , margarine is a form of shortening , but the commercial products sold as “ shortening ” are generally uncolored and do not taste like butter oils may undergo a full or partial hydrogenation process to solidify them the water-soluble additives are added to the water or milk mixture , and emulsifiers such as lecithin are added to help disperse the water phase evenly throughout the oil the melting points are related to the presence of carbon-carbon double bonds in the fatty acids components the addition of hydrogen to the unsaturated bonds ( alkenic double c c bonds ) results in saturated c-c bonds , effectively increasing the melting point of the oil and thus '' hardening '' it however , as there are possible health benefits in limiting the amount of saturated fats in the human diet , the process is controlled so that only enough of the bonds are hydrogenated to give the required texture this method is used today for some margarines although the process has been developed and sometimes other metal catalysts are used such as palladium if hydrogenation is incomplete ( partial hardening ) , the relatively high temperatures used in the hydrogenation process tend to flip some of the carbon-carbon double bonds into the '' trans '' form if these particular bonds are not hydrogenated during the process , they remain present in the final margarine in molecules of trans fats , the consumption of which has been shown to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease some tropical oils , such as palm oil and coconut oil , are naturally semi-solid and do not require hydrogenation in a 100-gram reference amount , margarine & ndash ; manufactured from soybean oil and pasteurized & ndash ; provides 628 calories and is composed of 70 % fat , 2 % carbohydrates , 26 % water , and negligible protein ( table ) unless fortified with micronutrients during manufacturing , there are no other nutrients in significant content vitamin a and vitamin d may be added for fortification replacing saturated and trans unsaturated fats with unhydrogenated monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats is more effective in preventing coronary heart disease than reducing overall fat intake the national academy of medicine and the european food safety authority recommend saturated fat intake to be as low as possible during the manufacture of margarine , makers may convert some unsaturated fat into hydrogenated fats or trans fats to give them a higher melting point so they stay solid at room temperatures by the end of the 20th century , an average american ate around of butter and nearly of margarine '' and margarine : '' to avoid any possible confusion , the regulation limits the use of the terms '' butter '' and '' margarine '' to products with a fat content of not less than 80 % spread that contains 39 to 41 % of fat may be called '' half-fat margarine '' , '' low-fat margarine '' , or '' light margarine '' amlu cooking oil list of spreads spread ( food ) : category : margarine brands

a spectral line may be observed either as an emission line or an absorption line which type of line is observed depends on the type of material and its temperature relative to another emission source an absorption line is produced when photons from a hot , broad spectrum source pass through a cold material the intensity of light , over a narrow frequency range , is reduced due to absorption by the material and re-emission in random directions by contrast , a bright emission line is produced when photons from a hot material are detected in the presence of a broad spectrum from a cold source spectral lines are highly atom-specific , and can be used to identify the chemical composition of any medium capable of letting light pass through it depending on the exact physical interaction ( with molecules , single particles , etc many spectral lines of atomic hydrogen also have designations within their respective series , such as the lyman series or balmer series originally all spectral lines were classified into series : the principle series , sharp series , and diffuse series for this reason , the nist spectral line database contains a column for ritz calculated lines line broadening and shift there are a number of effects which control spectral line shape a spectral line extends over a range of frequencies , not a single frequency ( i.e these reasons may be divided into two general categories â€“ broadening due to local conditions and broadening due to extended conditions broadening due to extended conditions may result from changes to the spectral distribution of the radiation as it traverses its path to the observer there may also be a shift in the line center the line is broadened because the photons at the line center have a greater reabsorption probability than the photons at the line wings without qualification , '' spectral lines '' generally implies that one is talking about lines with wavelengths which fall into the range of the visible spectrum other frequencies have atomic spectral lines as well , such as the lyman series , which falls in the ultraviolet range .

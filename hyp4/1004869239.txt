a spectral line may be observed either as an emission line or an absorption line which type of line is observed depends on the type of material and its temperature relative to another emission source an absorption line is produced when photons from a hot , broad spectrum source pass through a cold material by contrast , a bright emission line is produced when photons from a hot material are detected in the presence of a broad spectrum from a cold source the intensity of light , over a narrow frequency range , is increased due to emission by the material spectral lines are highly atom-specific , and can be used to identify the chemical composition of any medium capable of letting light pass through it spectral lines also depend on the physical conditions of the gas , so they are widely used to determine the chemical composition of stars and other celestial bodies that can not be analyzed by other means , as well as their physical conditions mechanisms other than atom-photon interaction can produce spectral lines ) , the frequency of the involved photons will vary widely , and lines can be observed across the electromagnetic spectrum , from radio waves to gamma rays more detailed designations usually include the line wavelength and may include a multiplet number ( for atomic lines ) or band designation ( for molecular lines ) for this reason , the nist spectral line database contains a column for ritz calculated lines there are a number of effects which control spectral line shape a spectral line extends over a range of frequencies , not a single frequency ( i.e these reasons may be divided into two general categories â€“ broadening due to local conditions and broadening due to extended conditions broadening due to extended conditions may result from changes to the spectral distribution of the radiation as it traverses its path to the observer quasistatic pressure broadening : the presence of other particles shifts the energy levels in the emitting particle , thereby altering the frequency of the emitted radiation if different parts of the emitting body have different velocities ( along the line of sight ) , the resulting line will be broadened , with the line width proportional to the width of the velocity distribution assuming each effect is independent , the observed line profile is a convolution of the line profiles of each mechanism for example , a combination of the thermal doppler broadening and the impact pressure broadening yields a voigt profile

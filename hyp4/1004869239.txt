a spectral line may be observed either as an emission line or an absorption line which type of line is observed depends on the type of material and its temperature relative to another emission source an absorption line is produced when photons from a hot , broad spectrum source pass through a cold material the intensity of light , over a narrow frequency range , is reduced due to absorption by the material and re-emission in random directions by contrast , a bright emission line is produced when photons from a hot material are detected in the presence of a broad spectrum from a cold source the intensity of light , over a narrow frequency range , is increased due to emission by the material spectral lines are highly atom-specific , and can be used to identify the chemical composition of any medium capable of letting light pass through it spectral lines also depend on the physical conditions of the gas , so they are widely used to determine the chemical composition of stars and other celestial bodies that can not be analyzed by other means , as well as their physical conditions mechanisms other than atom-photon interaction can produce spectral lines depending on the exact physical interaction ( with molecules , single particles , etc more detailed designations usually include the line wavelength and may include a multiplet number ( for atomic lines ) or band designation ( for molecular lines ) originally all spectral lines were classified into series : the principle series , sharp series , and diffuse series these series exist across atoms of all elements , and the patterns for all atoms are well-predicted by the rydberg-ritz formula a spectral line extends over a range of frequencies , not a single frequency ( i.e for example , in the following article , decay was suppressed via a microwave cavity , thus reducing the natural broadening : quasistatic pressure broadening : the presence of other particles shifts the energy levels in the emitting particle , thereby altering the frequency of the emitted radiation if different parts of the emitting body have different velocities ( along the line of sight ) , the resulting line will be broadened , with the line width proportional to the width of the velocity distribution without qualification , '' spectral lines '' generally implies that one is talking about lines with wavelengths which fall into the range of the visible spectrum however , there are also many spectral lines which show up at wavelengths outside this range

a spectral line may be observed either as an emission line or an absorption line which type of line is observed depends on the type of material and its temperature relative to another emission source the intensity of light , over a narrow frequency range , is reduced due to absorption by the material and re-emission in random directions spectral lines are highly atom-specific , and can be used to identify the chemical composition of any medium capable of letting light pass through it spectral lines also depend on the physical conditions of the gas , so they are widely used to determine the chemical composition of stars and other celestial bodies that can not be analyzed by other means , as well as their physical conditions mechanisms other than atom-photon interaction can produce spectral lines ) , the frequency of the involved photons will vary widely , and lines can be observed across the electromagnetic spectrum , from radio waves to gamma rays more detailed designations usually include the line wavelength and may include a multiplet number ( for atomic lines ) or band designation ( for molecular lines ) originally all spectral lines were classified into series : the principle series , sharp series , and diffuse series these series exist across atoms of all elements , and the patterns for all atoms are well-predicted by the rydberg-ritz formula for this reason , the nist spectral line database contains a column for ritz calculated lines there are a number of effects which control spectral line shape these reasons may be divided into two general categories â€“ broadening due to local conditions and broadening due to extended conditions broadening due to extended conditions may result from changes to the spectral distribution of the radiation as it traverses its path to the observer since the spectral line is a combination of all of the emitted radiation , the higher the temperature of the gas , the broader the spectral line emitted from that gas the presence of nearby particles will affect the radiation emitted by an individual particle the duration of the influence is much longer than the lifetime of the emission process radiative broadening of the spectral absorption profile occurs because the on-resonance absorption in the center of the profile is saturated at much lower intensities than the off-resonant wings other frequencies have atomic spectral lines as well , such as the lyman series , which falls in the ultraviolet range .

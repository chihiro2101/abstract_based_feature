then it will be spontaneously re-emitted , either in the same frequency as the original or in a cascade , where the sum of the energies of the photons emitted will be equal to the energy of the one absorbed ( assuming the system returns to its original state ) a spectral line may be observed either as an emission line or an absorption line an absorption line is produced when photons from a hot , broad spectrum source pass through a cold material the intensity of light , over a narrow frequency range , is increased due to emission by the material spectral lines are highly atom-specific , and can be used to identify the chemical composition of any medium capable of letting light pass through it more detailed designations usually include the line wavelength and may include a multiplet number ( for atomic lines ) or band designation ( for molecular lines ) line broadening and shift a spectral line extends over a range of frequencies , not a single frequency ( i.e these reasons may be divided into two general categories â€“ broadening due to local conditions and broadening due to extended conditions broadening due to local conditions is due to effects which hold in a small region around the emitting element , usually small enough to assure local thermodynamic equilibrium the uncertainty principle relates the lifetime of an excited state ( due to spontaneous emission or the auger effect ) with the uncertainty of its energy a short lifetime will have a large energy uncertainty and a broad emission since the spectral line is a combination of all of the emitted radiation , the higher the temperature of the gas , the broader the spectral line emitted from that gas this broadening effect is described by a gaussian profile and there is no associated shift the broadening effect is described by a lorentzian profile and there may be an associated shift inhomogeneous broadening is a general term for broadening because some emitting particles are in a different local environment from others , and therefore emit at a different frequency radiative broadening of the spectral absorption profile occurs because the on-resonance absorption in the center of the profile is saturated at much lower intensities than the off-resonant wings assuming each effect is independent , the observed line profile is a convolution of the line profiles of each mechanism without qualification , '' spectral lines '' generally implies that one is talking about lines with wavelengths which fall into the range of the visible spectrum

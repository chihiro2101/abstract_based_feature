the first wireless telephone conversation occurred in 1880 , when alexander graham bell and charles sumner tainter invented the photophone , a telephone that sent audio over a beam of light a number of wireless electrical signaling schemes including sending electric currents through water and the ground using electrostatic and electromagnetic induction were investigated for telegraphy in the late 19th century before practical radio systems became available the edison system was used by stranded trains during the great blizzard of 1888 and earth conductive systems found limited use between trenches during world war i but these systems were never successful economically in 1894 , guglielmo marconi began developing a wireless telegraph system using radio waves , which had been known about since proof of their existence in 1888 by heinrich hertz , but discounted as a communication format since they seemed , at the time , to be a short range phenomenon marconi soon developed a system that was transmitting signals way beyond distances anyone could have predicted ( due in part to the signals bouncing off the then unknown ionosphere ) marconi and karl ferdinand braun were awarded the 1909 nobel prize for physics for their contribution to this form of wireless telegraphy file : d2pak.jpg thumb power mosfets , which are used in rf power amplifiers to boost radio frequency ( rf ) signals in long-distance wireless networks the wireless revolution began in the 1990s , with the advent of digital wireless networks leading to a social revolution , and a paradigm shift from wired to wireless technology , including the proliferation of commercial wireless technologies such as cell phones , mobile telephony , pagers , wireless computer networks , cellular networks , the wireless internet , and laptop and handheld computers with wireless connections for example , free space optical links are used in cities between office buildings which are not wired for networking , where the cost of running cable through the building and under the street would be prohibitive electromagnetic induction only allows short-range communication and power transmission airband and radio navigation equipment used by aviators and air traffic control cellular telephones and pagers : provide connectivity for portable and mobile applications , both personal and business one of the best-known examples of wireless technology is the mobile phone , also known as a cellular phone , with more than 6.6 & nbsp ; billion mobile cellular subscriptions worldwide as of the end of 2010 wireless internet service : an introduction supporting technologies include : : wi-fi is a wireless local area network that enables portable computing devices to connect easily with other devices , peripheries , and the internet new york , ny : mcgraw-hill irwin : cellular data service offers coverage within a range of 10-15 miles from the nearest cell site wireless energy transfer may be combined with wireless information transmission in what is known as wireless powered communication wireless networks : wireless lan ( wlan ) , ( ieee 802.11 branded as wi-fi and hiperlan ) , wireless metropolitan area networks ( wman ) and ( lmds , wimax , and hiperman )

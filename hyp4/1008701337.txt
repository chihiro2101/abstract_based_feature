the first wireless telephone conversation occurred in 1880 , when alexander graham bell and charles sumner tainter invented the photophone , a telephone that sent audio over a beam of light it would be several decades before the photophone 's principles found their first practical applications in military communications and later in fiber-optic communications a number of wireless electrical signaling schemes including sending electric currents through water and the ground using electrostatic and electromagnetic induction were investigated for telegraphy in the late 19th century before practical radio systems became available these included a patented induction system by thomas edison allowing a telegraph on a running train to connect with telegraph wires running parallel to the tracks , a william preece induction telegraph system for sending messages across bodies of water , and several operational and proposed telegraphy and voice earth conduction systems the edison system was used by stranded trains during the great blizzard of 1888 and earth conductive systems found limited use between trenches during world war i but these systems were never successful economically in 1894 , guglielmo marconi began developing a wireless telegraph system using radio waves , which had been known about since proof of their existence in 1888 by heinrich hertz , but discounted as a communication format since they seemed , at the time , to be a short range phenomenon he also introduced the use of semiconductor junctions to detect radio waves , reprinted in igor grigorov , ed file : d2pak.jpg thumb power mosfets , which are used in rf power amplifiers to boost radio frequency ( rf ) signals in long-distance wireless networks the wireless revolution began in the 1990s , with the advent of digital wireless networks leading to a social revolution , and a paradigm shift from wired to wireless technology , including the proliferation of commercial wireless technologies such as cell phones , mobile telephony , pagers , wireless computer networks , cellular networks , the wireless internet , and laptop and handheld computers with wireless connections common examples of wireless equipment include : tech target – definition of wireless – posted by margaret rouse ( april 2 control and traffic control systems infrared and ultrasonic remote control devices professional lmr ( land mobile radio ) and smr ( specialized mobile radio ) typically used by business , industrial and public safety entities consumer two-way radio including frs family radio service , gmrs ( general mobile radio service ) and citizens band ( '' cb '' ) radios cordless computer peripherals : the cordless mouse is a common example ; wireless headphones , keyboards , and printers can also be linked to a computer via wireless using technology such as wireless usb or bluetooth ilcev , stojce dimov , global mobile satellite communications for maritime , land and aeronautical applications , springer , 2006 : wireless sensor networks are responsible for sensing noise , interference , and activity in data collection networks wireless energy transfer is a process whereby electrical energy is transmitted from a power source to an electrical load that does not have a built-in power source , without the use of interconnecting wires wireless energy transfer may be combined with wireless information transmission in what is known as wireless powered communication wireless networks : wireless lan ( wlan ) , ( ieee 802.11 branded as wi-fi and hiperlan ) , wireless metropolitan area networks ( wman ) and ( lmds , wimax , and hiperman )

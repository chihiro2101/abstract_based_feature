the first wireless telephone conversation occurred in 1880 , when alexander graham bell and charles sumner tainter invented the photophone , a telephone that sent audio over a beam of light it would be several decades before the photophone 's principles found their first practical applications in military communications and later in fiber-optic communications a number of wireless electrical signaling schemes including sending electric currents through water and the ground using electrostatic and electromagnetic induction were investigated for telegraphy in the late 19th century before practical radio systems became available the edison system was used by stranded trains during the great blizzard of 1888 and earth conductive systems found limited use between trenches during world war i but these systems were never successful economically in 1894 , guglielmo marconi began developing a wireless telegraph system using radio waves , which had been known about since proof of their existence in 1888 by heinrich hertz , but discounted as a communication format since they seemed , at the time , to be a short range phenomenon he also introduced the use of semiconductor junctions to detect radio waves , reprinted in igor grigorov , ed file : d2pak.jpg thumb power mosfets , which are used in rf power amplifiers to boost radio frequency ( rf ) signals in long-distance wireless networks the wireless revolution began in the 1990s , with the advent of digital wireless networks leading to a social revolution , and a paradigm shift from wired to wireless technology , including the proliferation of commercial wireless technologies such as cell phones , mobile telephony , pagers , wireless computer networks , cellular networks , the wireless internet , and laptop and handheld computers with wireless connections radio and microwave communication carry information by modulation properties of electromagnetic waves transmitted through space another widely used example is consumer ir devices such as remote controls and irda ( infrared data association ) networking , which is used as an alternative to wifi networking to allow laptops , pdas , printers , and digital cameras to exchange data consumer two-way radio including frs family radio service , gmrs ( general mobile radio service ) and citizens band ( '' cb '' ) radios airband and radio navigation equipment used by aviators and air traffic control cellular telephones and pagers : provide connectivity for portable and mobile applications , both personal and business one of the best-known examples of wireless technology is the mobile phone , also known as a cellular phone , with more than 6.6 & nbsp ; billion mobile cellular subscriptions worldwide as of the end of 2010 wireless internet service : an introduction supporting technologies include : : wi-fi is a wireless local area network that enables portable computing devices to connect easily with other devices , peripheries , and the internet wireless energy transfer may be combined with wireless information transmission in what is known as wireless powered communication wireless networks : wireless lan ( wlan ) , ( ieee 802.11 branded as wi-fi and hiperlan ) , wireless metropolitan area networks ( wman ) and ( lmds , wimax , and hiperman )

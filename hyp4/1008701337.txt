the first wireless telephone conversation occurred in 1880 , when alexander graham bell and charles sumner tainter invented the photophone , a telephone that sent audio over a beam of light it would be several decades before the photophone 's principles found their first practical applications in military communications and later in fiber-optic communications a number of wireless electrical signaling schemes including sending electric currents through water and the ground using electrostatic and electromagnetic induction were investigated for telegraphy in the late 19th century before practical radio systems became available the edison system was used by stranded trains during the great blizzard of 1888 and earth conductive systems found limited use between trenches during world war i but these systems were never successful economically in 1894 , guglielmo marconi began developing a wireless telegraph system using radio waves , which had been known about since proof of their existence in 1888 by heinrich hertz , but discounted as a communication format since they seemed , at the time , to be a short range phenomenon file : d2pak.jpg thumb power mosfets , which are used in rf power amplifiers to boost radio frequency ( rf ) signals in long-distance wireless networks the wireless revolution began in the 1990s , with the advent of digital wireless networks leading to a social revolution , and a paradigm shift from wired to wireless technology , including the proliferation of commercial wireless technologies such as cell phones , mobile telephony , pagers , wireless computer networks , cellular networks , the wireless internet , and laptop and handheld computers with wireless connections radio and microwave communication carry information by modulation properties of electromagnetic waves transmitted through space consumer two-way radio including frs family radio service , gmrs ( general mobile radio service ) and citizens band ( '' cb '' ) radios airband and radio navigation equipment used by aviators and air traffic control cellular telephones and pagers : provide connectivity for portable and mobile applications , both personal and business global positioning system ( gps ) : allows drivers of cars and trucks , captains of boats and ships , and pilots of aircraft to ascertain their location anywhere on earth cordless computer peripherals : the cordless mouse is a common example ; wireless headphones , keyboards , and printers can also be linked to a computer via wireless using technology such as wireless usb or bluetooth robust demand for mobile phone service will continue ; un agency predicts un news centre february 15 , 2010 , these wireless phones use radio waves from signal-transmission towers to enable their users to make phone calls from many locations worldwide wireless data communications allows wireless networking between desktop computers , laptops , tablet computers , cell phones and other related devices wireless energy transfer may be combined with wireless information transmission in what is known as wireless powered communication suzhi bi , yong zeng , and rui zhang ( may 2016 ) '' wireless powered communication networks : an overview '' in 2015 , researchers at the university of washington demonstrated far-field energy transfer using wi-fi signals to power cameras

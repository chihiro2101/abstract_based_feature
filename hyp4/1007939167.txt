the oldest archaeological finds by emil stevens in 1896 date to 900-850 bc paolo caputo u the greek settlement was founded in the 8th century bc by emigrants from cities of eretria and chalcis in euboea and were led to cumae by the joint oecists ( founders ) : megasthenes of chalcis and hippocles of cyme the site chosen was on the hill and later acropolis of monte di cuma surrounded on one side by the sea and on the other by particularly fertile ground on the edge of the campanian plain while continuing their maritime and commercial traditions , the settlers of cumae strengthened their political and economic power by exploitation of the land and extended their territory at the expense of neighbouring peoples the colony thrived and in the 8th & nbsp ; century it was already strong enough to send perieres to found zancle in sicily , : thucydides , 4 , 4 and another group to found tritaea in achaea , pausanias was told cuma established its dominance over almost the entire campanian coast up to punta campanella over the 7th and 6th & nbsp ; centuries & nbsp ; bc , gaining sway over puteoli and misenum the colony spread greek culture in italy and introduced the euboean alphabet , a dialect of greek and a variant of which was adapted and modified by the etruscans and then by the romans and became the latin alphabet still used worldwide today according to dionysius : the growing power of the cumaean greeks led many indigenous tribes of the region to organise against them , notably the dauni and aurunci with the leadership of the capuan etruscans at this time the roman senate sent agents to cumae to purchase grain in anticipation of a siege of rome lucius tarquinius superbus , the last legendary king of rome , lived his life in exile with aristodemus at cumae after the battle of lake regillus and died there in 495 bc livy , ab urbe condita , 2:34 eventually the exiled nobles and their sons were able to take possession of cumae and aristodemus was assassinated in 490 bc the combined fleets of cumae and syracuse ( on sicily ) defeated the etruscans at the battle of cumae in 474 & nbsp ; bc cumae founded naples in 470 bc the greek period at cumae came to an end in 421 & nbsp ; bc , when the oscans allied to the samnites broke down the walls and took the city , ravaging the countryside cumae came under roman rule with capua and in 338 bc was granted partial citizenship , a civitas bc along with all the cities of campania and especially the bay of naples as it became a desirable area for wealthy romans who built large villas along the coast another very important innovation was the construction of the great serino aqueduct , the aqua augusta supplying many of the cities in the area from about 20 bc misenus was excommunicated on his return but was later rehabilitated and took part as bishop of cumae in two synods of pope symmachus later , both misenum and cumae ceased to be residential sees and the territory of cumae became part of the diocese of aversa after the destruction of cumae in 1207 the first excavations date to 1606 when thirteen statues and two marble bas-reliefs were found ; later finds included the large statue of jupiter from the masseria del gigante exhibited at the national archaeological museum of naples later emilio stevens was given the concession and worked at cumae between 1878 and 1893 , completing the excavation of the necropolis , even though news of the various finds led to a continuous looting of the area between 1924 and 1934 amedeo maiuri and vittorio spinazzola investigated the temple of jupiter , the cave of the sibyl and the crypta romana , while between 1938 and 1953 the lower city was explored the lower city was defended by walls and during the greek age the acropolis had probably the same type of defences , even if the remains today dating back to the 6th century bc are only on the southeastern part of the hill perhaps also used as retaining walls of the ridge the city and acropolis walls were built from 505 bc , as well as the sibyl 's cave the crypta romana is a tunnel dug into the tufa under the cuma hill , crossing the acropolis in an east-west direction , giving an easier route from the city to the sea

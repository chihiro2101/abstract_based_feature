a circuit is a non-empty trail in which the first vertex is equal to the last vertex ( closed trail ) a cycle or simple circuit is a circuit in which the only repeated vertex is the first/last vertex a directed circuit is a non-empty directed trail in which the first vertex is equal to the last vertex a directed circuit is a non-empty directed trail with a vertex sequence a chordless cycle in a graph , also called a hole or an induced cycle , is a cycle such that no two vertices of the cycle are connected by an edge that does not itself belong to the cycle a chordal graph , a special type of perfect graph , has no holes of any size greater than three a peripheral cycle is a cycle in a graph with the property that every two edges not on the cycle can be connected by a path whose interior vertices avoid the cycle in a graph that is not formed by adding one edge to a cycle , a peripheral cycle must be an induced cycle . the cycle double cover conjecture states that , for every bridgeless graph , there exists a multiset of simple cycles that covers each edge of the graph exactly twice cactus graph , a graph in which every nontrivial biconnected component is a cycle cycle graph , a graph that consists of a single cycle

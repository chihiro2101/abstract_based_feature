a circuit is a non-empty trail in which the first vertex is equal to the last vertex ( closed trail ) directed circuit , cycle : let be a directed graph a directed circuit is a non-empty directed trail with a vertex sequence a directed cycle or simple directed circuit is a directed circuit in which the only repeated vertex is the first/last vertex a chordless cycle in a graph , also called a hole or an induced cycle , is a cycle such that no two vertices of the cycle are connected by an edge that does not itself belong to the cycle chordless cycles may be used to characterize perfect graphs : by the strong perfect graph theorem , a graph is perfect if and only if none of its holes or antiholes have an odd number of vertices that is greater than three a chordal graph , a special type of perfect graph , has no holes of any size greater than three these include : bipartite graph , a graph without odd cycles ( cycles with an odd number of vertices ) cactus graph , a graph in which every nontrivial biconnected component is a cycle cycle graph , a graph that consists of a single cycle

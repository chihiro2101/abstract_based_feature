a circuit is a non-empty trail in which the first vertex is equal to the last vertex ( closed trail ) the length of a circuit or cycle is the number of edges involved a directed circuit is a non-empty directed trail in which the first vertex is equal to the last vertex : let be a directed graph a directed cycle or simple directed circuit is a directed circuit in which the only repeated vertex is the first/last vertex a chordless cycle in a graph , also called a hole or an induced cycle , is a cycle such that no two vertices of the cycle are connected by an edge that does not itself belong to the cycle a peripheral cycle is a cycle in a graph with the property that every two edges not on the cycle can be connected by a path whose interior vertices avoid the cycle in a graph that is not formed by adding one edge to a cycle , a peripheral cycle must be an induced cycle these include : bipartite graph , a graph without odd cycles ( cycles with an odd number of vertices ) cactus graph , a graph in which every nontrivial biconnected component is a cycle cycle graph , a graph that consists of a single cycle

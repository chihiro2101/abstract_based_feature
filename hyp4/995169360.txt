a circuit is a non-empty trail in which the first vertex is equal to the last vertex ( closed trail ) a directed circuit is a non-empty directed trail in which the first vertex is equal to the last vertex : let be a directed graph a directed cycle or simple directed circuit is a directed circuit in which the only repeated vertex is the first/last vertex a chordless cycle in a graph , also called a hole or an induced cycle , is a cycle such that no two vertices of the cycle are connected by an edge that does not itself belong to the cycle the girth of a graph is the length of its shortest cycle ; this cycle is necessarily chordless in a graph that is not formed by adding one edge to a cycle , a peripheral cycle must be an induced cycle by veblen 's theorem , every element of the cycle space may be formed as an edge-disjoint union of simple cycles a cycle basis of the graph is a set of simple cycles that forms a basis of the cycle space cactus graph , a graph in which every nontrivial biconnected component is a cycle cycle graph , a graph that consists of a single cycle

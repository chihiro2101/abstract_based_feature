the following is an example of a generic single-objective genetic algorithm ( parents ) breed new individuals through crossover and mutation operations to give birth to offspring similar techniques differ in genetic representation and other implementation details , and the nature of the particular applied problem genetic algorithm – this is the most popular type of ea this type of ea is often used in optimization problems genetic programming – here the solutions are in the form of computer programs , and their fitness is determined by their ability to solve a computational problem evolution strategy – works with vectors of real numbers as representations of solutions , and typically uses self-adaptive mutation rates differential evolution – based on vector differences and is therefore primarily suited for numerical optimization problems generative or developmental ) encodings also enable evolution to exploit the regularity in the environment primarily proposed for numerical optimization and extended to solve combinatorial , constrained and multi-objective optimization problems adaptive dimensional search – unlike nature-inspired metaheuristic techniques , an adaptive dimensional search algorithm does not implement any metaphor as an underlying principle this algorithm is suitable for combinatorial optimization as well as parameter optimization gif a two-population ea search over a constrained rosenbrock function with bounded global optimum gif a two-population ea search over a constrained rosenbrock function file : estimation of distribution algorithm animation.gif estimation of distribution algorithm over keane 's function file : two population ea animation.gif a two-population ea search of a bounded optima of simionescu 's function .

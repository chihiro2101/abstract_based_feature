the following is an example of a generic single-objective genetic algorithm similar techniques differ in genetic representation and other implementation details , and the nature of the particular applied problem genetic algorithm – this is the most popular type of ea this type of ea is often used in optimization problems genetic programming – here the solutions are in the form of computer programs , and their fitness is determined by their ability to solve a computational problem evolution strategy – works with vectors of real numbers as representations of solutions , and typically uses self-adaptive mutation rates differential evolution – based on vector differences and is therefore primarily suited for numerical optimization problems a possible limitation of many evolutionary algorithms is their lack of a clear genotype-phenotype distinction proceedings of the ieee congress on evolutionary computing special section on evolutionary robotics , 2009 generative or developmental ) encodings also enable evolution to exploit the regularity in the environment '' gene expression programming : a new adaptive algorithm for solving problems '' primarily suited for combinatorial optimization and graph problems the runner-root algorithm ( rra ) is inspired by the function of runners and roots of plants in nature f ( 2015 ) , '' adaptive dimensional search : a new metaheuristic algorithm for discrete truss sizing optimization '' , computers and structures , 154 , 1–16 gif a two-population ea search over a constrained rosenbrock function with bounded global optimum

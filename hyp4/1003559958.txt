the following is an example of a generic single-objective genetic algorithm replace the least-fit individuals of the population with new individuals similar techniques differ in genetic representation and other implementation details , and the nature of the particular applied problem genetic algorithm – this is the most popular type of ea this type of ea is often used in optimization problems genetic programming – here the solutions are in the form of computer programs , and their fitness is determined by their ability to solve a computational problem evolution strategy – works with vectors of real numbers as representations of solutions , and typically uses self-adaptive mutation rates differential evolution – based on vector differences and is therefore primarily suited for numerical optimization problems fitness is typically determined with either a strength or accuracy based reinforcement learning or supervised learning approach a possible limitation of many evolutionary algorithms is their lack of a clear genotype-phenotype distinction proceedings of the ieee congress on evolutionary computing special section on evolutionary robotics , 2009 the runner-root algorithm ( rra ) is inspired by the function of runners and roots of plants in nature f merrikh-bayat , '' the runner-root algorithm : a metaheuristic for solving unimodal and multimodal optimization problems inspired by runners and roots of plants in nature '' , applied soft computing , vol this algorithm is suitable for combinatorial optimization as well as parameter optimization gif a two-population ea search over a constrained rosenbrock function with bounded global optimum

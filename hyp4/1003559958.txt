the following is an example of a generic single-objective genetic algorithm similar techniques differ in genetic representation and other implementation details , and the nature of the particular applied problem genetic algorithm – this is the most popular type of ea this type of ea is often used in optimization problems genetic programming – here the solutions are in the form of computer programs , and their fitness is determined by their ability to solve a computational problem evolutionary programming – similar to genetic programming , but the structure of the program is fixed and its numerical parameters are allowed to evolve differential evolution – based on vector differences and is therefore primarily suited for numerical optimization problems neuroevolution – similar to genetic programming but the genomes represent artificial neural networks by describing structure and connection weights fitness is typically determined with either a strength or accuracy based reinforcement learning or supervised learning approach a possible limitation of many evolutionary algorithms is their lack of a clear genotype-phenotype distinction '' gene expression programming : a new adaptive algorithm for solving problems '' particle swarm optimization – based on the ideas of animal flocking behaviour also primarily suited for numerical optimization problems this algorithm is suitable for combinatorial optimization as well as parameter optimization gif a two-population ea search over a constrained rosenbrock function with bounded global optimum

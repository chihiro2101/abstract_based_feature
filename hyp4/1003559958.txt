the following is an example of a generic single-objective genetic algorithm similar techniques differ in genetic representation and other implementation details , and the nature of the particular applied problem genetic algorithm – this is the most popular type of ea genetic programming – here the solutions are in the form of computer programs , and their fitness is determined by their ability to solve a computational problem evolutionary programming – similar to genetic programming , but the structure of the program is fixed and its numerical parameters are allowed to evolve differential evolution – based on vector differences and is therefore primarily suited for numerical optimization problems neuroevolution – similar to genetic programming but the genomes represent artificial neural networks by describing structure and connection weights a possible limitation of many evolutionary algorithms is their lack of a clear genotype-phenotype distinction swarm algorithms include ant colony optimization – based on the ideas of ant foraging by pheromone communication to form paths the runner-root algorithm ( rra ) is inspired by the function of runners and roots of plants in nature f 292–303 , 2015 artificial bee colony algorithm – based on the honey bee foraging behaviour primarily proposed for numerical optimization and extended to solve combinatorial , constrained and multi-objective optimization problems ( 2015 ) , '' adaptive dimensional search : a new metaheuristic algorithm for discrete truss sizing optimization '' , computers and structures , 154 , 1–16 this algorithm is suitable for combinatorial optimization as well as parameter optimization gif a two-population ea search over a constrained rosenbrock function with bounded global optimum

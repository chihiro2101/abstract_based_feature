the center of this common nine-point circle lies at the centroid of the four orthocentric points the radius of the common nine-point circle is the distance from the nine-point center to the midpoint of any of the six connectors that join any pair of orthocentric points through which the common nine-point circle passes this common nine-point center lies at the midpoint of the connector that joins any orthocentric point to the circumcenter of the triangle formed from the other three orthocentric points the common nine-point circle is tangent to all 16 incircles and excircles of the four triangles whose vertices form the orthocentric system the joining of these three orthogonal points into a triangle generates an orthic triangle that is common to all the four possible triangles formed from the four orthocentric points taken three at a time the incenter of this common orthic triangle must be one of the original four orthocentric points the orthocentric point that becomes the incenter of the orthic triangle is that orthocentric point closest to the common nine-point center this relationship between the orthic triangle and the original four orthocentric points leads directly to the fact that the incenter and excenters of a reference triangle form an orthocentric system join each of the four orthocentric points to their common nine-point center and extend them into four lines this generated orthocentric system is always homothetic to the original system of four points with the common nine-point center as the homothetic center and Î± the ratio of similitude the four euler lines of an orthocentric system are orthogonal to the four orthic axes of an orthocentric system because the nine-point circle is common to all four possible triangles in an orthocentric system it is tangent to 16 circles comprising the incircles and excircles of the four possible triangles

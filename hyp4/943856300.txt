the center of this common nine-point circle lies at the centroid of the four orthocentric points the nine-point circle also passes through the three orthogonal intersections at the feet of the altitudes of the four possible triangles the common nine-point circle is tangent to all 16 incircles and excircles of the four triangles whose vertices form the orthocentric system four of these points are the original orthocentric points and the additional three points are the orthogonal intersections at the feet of the altitudes the joining of these three orthogonal points into a triangle generates an orthic triangle that is common to all the four possible triangles formed from the four orthocentric points taken three at a time the incenter of this common orthic triangle must be one of the original four orthocentric points this relationship between the orthic triangle and the original four orthocentric points leads directly to the fact that the incenter and excenters of a reference triangle form an orthocentric system the four possible triangles referred above are then triangles abc , abh , ach , and bch the orthic axis associated with a normalized orthocentric system a , b , c , and h , where abc is the reference triangle , is a line that passes through three intersection points formed when each side of the orthic triangle meets each side of the reference triangle because the nine-point circle is common to all four possible triangles in an orthocentric system it is tangent to 16 circles comprising the incircles and excircles of the four possible triangles so if a rectangular hyperbola is drawn through four orthocentric points it will have one fixed center on the common nine-point circle but it will have four perspectors one on each of the orthic axes of the four possible triangles the one point on the nine-point circle that is the center of this rectangular hyperbola will have four different definitions dependent on which of the four possible triangles is used as the reference triangle

the center of this common nine-point circle lies at the centroid of the four orthocentric points the nine-point circle also passes through the three orthogonal intersections at the feet of the altitudes of the four possible triangles the common nine-point circle is tangent to all 16 incircles and excircles of the four triangles whose vertices form the orthocentric system four of these points are the original orthocentric points and the additional three points are the orthogonal intersections at the feet of the altitudes the joining of these three orthogonal points into a triangle generates an orthic triangle that is common to all the four possible triangles formed from the four orthocentric points taken three at a time the incenter of this common orthic triangle must be one of the original four orthocentric points this relationship between the orthic triangle and the original four orthocentric points leads directly to the fact that the incenter and excenters of a reference triangle form an orthocentric system it is normal to distinguish one of the orthocentric points from the others , specifically the one that is the incenter of the orthic triangle ; this one is denoted h as the orthocenter of the outer three orthocentric points that are chosen as a reference triangle abc join each of the four orthocentric points to their common nine-point center and extend them into four lines because the nine-point circle is common to all four possible triangles in an orthocentric system it is tangent to 16 circles comprising the incircles and excircles of the four possible triangles the one point on the nine-point circle that is the center of this rectangular hyperbola will have four different definitions dependent on which of the four possible triangles is used as the reference triangle the centers of these orthic inconics are the symmedian points , k of the four possible triangles

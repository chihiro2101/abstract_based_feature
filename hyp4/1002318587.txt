early in his career , brouwer proved a number of theorems in the emerging field of topology the most important were his fixed point theorem , the topological invariance of degree , and the invariance of domain among mathematicians generally , the best known is the first one , usually referred to now as the brouwer fixed point theorem it is a simple corollary to the second , concerning the topological invariance of degree , which is the best known among algebraic topologists brouwer also proved the simplicial approximation theorem in the foundations of algebraic topology , which justifies the reduction to combinatorial terms , after sufficient subdivision of simplicial complexes , of the treatment of general continuous mappings he was an invited speaker of the icm in 1908 at rome brouwer , l brouwer founded intuitionism , a philosophy of mathematics that challenged the then-prevailing formalism of david hilbert and his collaborators , who included paul bernays , wilhelm ackermann , and john von neumann ( cf it is sometimes and rather simplistically characterized by saying that its adherents refuse to use the law of excluded middle in mathematical reasoning in 1905 , at the age of 24 , brouwer expressed his philosophy of life in a short tract life , art and mysticism , which has been described by the mathematician martin davis as '' drenched in romantic pessimism '' ( davis ( 2002 ) , p '' teun koetsier , mathematics and the divine , chapter 30 , '' arthur schopenhauer and l.e.j 36 ) “ brouwer ’ s debt to schopenhauer is fully manifest brouwer , a comparison , ” combined proceedings for the sixth and seventh midwest history of mathematics conferences , pages 272–290 ( mark van atten and robert tragesser , “ mysticism and mathematics : brouwer , gödel , and the common core thesis , ” published in w all interwoven with some kind of pessimism and mystical attitude to life which is not mathematics , nor has anything to do with the foundations of mathematics '' ( davis , p he was involved in a very public and eventually demeaning controversy in the later 1920s with hilbert over editorial policy at mathematische annalen , at that time a leading learned journal he became relatively isolated ; the development of intuitionism at its source was taken up by his student arend heyting brouwer : '' on the significance of the principle of excluded middle in mathematics , especially in function theory but in this address weyl '' while defending brouwer against some of hilbert 's criticisms.attempts to bring out the significance of hilbert 's approach to the problems of the foundations of mathematics van stigt , 1990 , brouwer 's intuitionism , amsterdam : north-holland , 1990 brouwer luitzen egbertus jan brouwer entry in stanford encyclopedia of philosophy

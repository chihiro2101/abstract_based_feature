early in his career , brouwer proved a number of theorems in the emerging field of topology the most important were his fixed point theorem , the topological invariance of degree , and the invariance of domain among mathematicians generally , the best known is the first one , usually referred to now as the brouwer fixed point theorem it is a simple corollary to the second , concerning the topological invariance of degree , which is the best known among algebraic topologists brouwer also proved the simplicial approximation theorem in the foundations of algebraic topology , which justifies the reduction to combinatorial terms , after sufficient subdivision of simplicial complexes , of the treatment of general continuous mappings in 1912 , at age 31 , he was elected a member of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences he was an invited speaker of the icm in 1908 at rome brouwer , l a variety of constructive mathematics , intuitionism is a philosophy of the foundations of mathematics it is sometimes and rather simplistically characterized by saying that its adherents refuse to use the law of excluded middle in mathematical reasoning brouwer was a member of the significs group brouwer and schopenhauer are in many respects two of a kind brouwer wrote that '' the original interpretation of the continuum of kant and schopenhauer as pure a priori intuition can in essence be upheld 36 ) “ brouwer ’ s debt to schopenhauer is fully manifest brouwer , a comparison , ” combined proceedings for the sixth and seventh midwest history of mathematics conferences , pages 272–290 it was then that '' brouwer felt free to return to his revolutionary project which he was now calling intuitionism '' ( ibid ) he became relatively isolated ; the development of intuitionism at its source was taken up by his student arend heyting brouwer : '' on the significance of the principle of excluded middle in mathematics , especially in function theory kolmogorov supports most of brouwer 's results but disputes a few ; he discusses the ramifications of intuitionism with respect to '' transfinite judgements '' , e.g but in this address weyl '' while defending brouwer against some of hilbert 's criticisms.attempts to bring out the significance of hilbert 's approach to the problems of the foundations of mathematics brouwer luitzen egbertus jan brouwer entry in stanford encyclopedia of philosophy

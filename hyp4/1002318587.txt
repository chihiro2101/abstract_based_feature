early in his career , brouwer proved a number of theorems in the emerging field of topology among mathematicians generally , the best known is the first one , usually referred to now as the brouwer fixed point theorem it is a simple corollary to the second , concerning the topological invariance of degree , which is the best known among algebraic topologists he was an invited speaker of the icm in 1908 at rome brouwer , l brouwer founded intuitionism , a philosophy of mathematics that challenged the then-prevailing formalism of david hilbert and his collaborators , who included paul bernays , wilhelm ackermann , and john von neumann ( cf a variety of constructive mathematics , intuitionism is a philosophy of the foundations of mathematics brouwer and schopenhauer are in many respects two of a kind brouwer : a comparison , '' p brouwer wrote that '' the original interpretation of the continuum of kant and schopenhauer as pure a priori intuition can in essence be upheld '' ( quoted in vladimir tasić 's mathematics and the roots of postmodernist thought , § 4.1 , p ( mark van atten and robert tragesser , “ mysticism and mathematics : brouwer , gödel , and the common core thesis , ” published in w all interwoven with some kind of pessimism and mystical attitude to life which is not mathematics , nor has anything to do with the foundations of mathematics '' ( davis , p & nbsp ; 95 ) ; by 1910 he had published a number of important papers , in particular the fixed point theorem it was then that '' brouwer felt free to return to his revolutionary project which he was now calling intuitionism '' ( ibid ) he was involved in a very public and eventually demeaning controversy in the later 1920s with hilbert over editorial policy at mathematische annalen , at that time a leading learned journal he became relatively isolated ; the development of intuitionism at its source was taken up by his student arend heyting kolmogorov supports most of brouwer 's results but disputes a few ; he discusses the ramifications of intuitionism with respect to '' transfinite judgements '' , e.g in 1920 weyl , hilbert 's prize pupil , sided with brouwer against hilbert van stigt , 1990 , brouwer 's intuitionism , amsterdam : north-holland , 1990 chapter five : '' hilbert to the rescue '' wherein davis discusses brouwer and his relationship with hilbert and weyl with brief biographical information of brouwer

early in his career , brouwer proved a number of theorems in the emerging field of topology among mathematicians generally , the best known is the first one , usually referred to now as the brouwer fixed point theorem it is a simple corollary to the second , concerning the topological invariance of degree , which is the best known among algebraic topologists in 1912 , at age 31 , he was elected a member of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences a variety of constructive mathematics , intuitionism is a philosophy of the foundations of mathematics in 1905 , at the age of 24 , brouwer expressed his philosophy of life in a short tract life , art and mysticism , which has been described by the mathematician martin davis as '' drenched in romantic pessimism '' ( davis ( 2002 ) , p brouwer : a comparison , '' p 36 ) “ brouwer ’ s debt to schopenhauer is fully manifest ( mark van atten and robert tragesser , “ mysticism and mathematics : brouwer , gödel , and the common core thesis , ” published in w all interwoven with some kind of pessimism and mystical attitude to life which is not mathematics , nor has anything to do with the foundations of mathematics '' ( davis , p brouwer , in a paper entitled 'the untrustworthiness of the principles of logic ' , challenged the belief that the rules of the classical logic , which have come down to us essentially from aristotle ( 384 -- 322 b.c & nbsp ; 95 ) ; by 1910 he had published a number of important papers , in particular the fixed point theorem it seemed that he was no longer convinced of his results in topology because they were not correct from the point of view of intuitionism , and he judged everything he had done before , his greatest output , false according to his philosophy jean van heijenoort , 1967 3rd printing 1976 with corrections , a source book in mathematical logic , 1879-1931 brouwer : '' on the significance of the principle of excluded middle in mathematics , especially in function theory but in this address weyl '' while defending brouwer against some of hilbert 's criticisms.attempts to bring out the significance of hilbert 's approach to the problems of the foundations of mathematics , '' life , art , and mysticism , '' notre dame journal of formal logic , vol van stigt , 1990 , brouwer 's intuitionism , amsterdam : north-holland , 1990 chapter five : '' hilbert to the rescue '' wherein davis discusses brouwer and his relationship with hilbert and weyl with brief biographical information of brouwer koetsier , teun , editor , mathematics and the divine : a historical study , amsterdam : elsevier science and technology , 2004 ,

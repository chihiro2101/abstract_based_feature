consider a simple example : a class of students takes a 100-item true/false test on a subject then , each student 's score would be a realization of one of a set of independent and identically distributed random variables , with an expected mean of 50 if one selects only the top scoring 10 % of the students and gives them a second test on which they again choose randomly on all items , the mean score would again be expected to be close to 50 thus the mean of these students would '' regress '' all the way back to the mean of all students who took the original test no matter what a student scores on the original test , the best prediction of their score on the second test is 50 if there were no luck ( good or bad ) or random guessing involved in the answers supplied by the students â€“ then all students would be expected to score the same on the second test as they scored on the original test , and there would be no regression toward the mean in this case , the subset of students scoring above average would be composed of those who were skilled and had not especially bad luck , together with those who were unskilled , but were extremely lucky the following is an example of this second kind of regression toward the mean for the first test , some will be lucky , and score more than their ability , and some will be unlucky and score less than their ability the larger the influence of luck in producing an extreme event , the less likely the luck will repeat itself in multiple events if one medical trial suggests that a particular drug or treatment is outperforming all other treatments for a condition , then in a second trial it is more likely that the outperforming drug or treatment will perform closer to the mean the next quarter if a business organisation has a highly profitable quarter , despite the underlying reasons for its performance being unchanged , it is likely to do less well the next quarter baseball players who hit well in their rookie season are likely to do worse their second ; the '' sophomore slump '' the concept of regression comes from genetics and was popularized by sir francis galton during the late 19th century with the publication of regression towards mediocrity in hereditary stature rather , the characteristics in the offspring regress towards a mediocre point ( a point which has since been identified as the mean ) by measuring the heights of hundreds of people , he was able to quantify regression to the mean , and estimate the size of the effect galton wrote that , '' the average regression of the offspring is a constant fraction of their respective midparent deviations '' for height , galton estimated this coefficient to be about 2/3 : the height of an individual will measure around a midpoint that is two thirds of the parents ' deviation from the population average though his mathematical analysis was correct , galton 's biological explanation for the regression phenomenon he observed is now known to be incorrect regression toward the mean is a significant consideration in the design of experiments statistics could be used to measure the success of an intervention on the 50 who were rated at the greatest risk even if the interventions are worthless , the test group would be expected to show an improvement on their next physical exam , because of regression toward the mean the treatment would then be judged effective only if the treatment group improves more than the control group alternatively , a group of disadvantaged children could be tested to identify the ones with most college potential however , in these circumstances it may be considered unethical to have a control group of disadvantaged children whose special needs are ignored the best performing mutual fund over the last three years is more likely to see relative performance decline than improve over the next three years so for extreme individuals , we expect the second score to be closer to the mean than the first score , but for all individuals , we expect the distribution of distances from the mean to be the same on both sets of measurements this is the definition of regression toward the mean that closely follows sir francis galton 's original usage regression toward the mean and the study of change , psychological bulletin a non-mathematical explanation of regression toward the mean a simulation of regression toward the mean

then , each student 's score would be a realization of one of a set of independent and identically distributed random variables , with an expected mean of 50 if one selects only the top scoring 10 % of the students and gives them a second test on which they again choose randomly on all items , the mean score would again be expected to be close to 50 thus the mean of these students would '' regress '' all the way back to the mean of all students who took the original test if there were no luck ( good or bad ) or random guessing involved in the answers supplied by the students â€“ then all students would be expected to score the same on the second test as they scored on the original test , and there would be no regression toward the mean most realistic situations fall between these two extremes : for example , one might consider exam scores as a combination of skill and luck on a retest of this subset , the unskilled will be unlikely to repeat their lucky break , while the skilled will have a second chance to have bad luck the following is an example of this second kind of regression toward the mean the phenomenon occurs because student scores are determined in part by underlying ability and in part by chance for the first test , some will be lucky , and score more than their ability , and some will be unlucky and score less than their ability similarly , students who unluckily score less than their ability on the first test will tend to see their scores increase on the second test the larger the influence of luck in producing an extreme event , the less likely the luck will repeat itself in multiple events rather , the characteristics in the offspring regress towards a mediocre point ( a point which has since been identified as the mean ) galton wrote that , '' the average regression of the offspring is a constant fraction of their respective midparent deviations '' for height , galton estimated this coefficient to be about 2/3 : the height of an individual will measure around a midpoint that is two thirds of the parents ' deviation from the population average galton coined the term '' regression '' to describe an observable fact in the inheritance of multi-factorial quantitative genetic traits : namely that the offspring of parents who lie at the tails of the distribution will tend to lie closer to the centre , the mean , of the distribution he quantified this trend , and in doing so invented linear regression analysis , thus laying the groundwork for much of modern statistical modelling since then , the term '' regression '' has taken on a variety of meanings , and it may be used by modern statisticians to describe phenomena of sampling bias which have little to do with galton 's original observations in the field of genetics though his mathematical analysis was correct , galton 's biological explanation for the regression phenomenon he observed is now known to be incorrect in addition , height is not entirely genetically determined , but also subject to environmental influences during development , which make offspring of exceptional parents even more likely to be closer to the average than their parents this population genetic phenomenon of regression to the mean is best thought of as a combination of a binomially distributed process of inheritance plus normally distributed environmental influences regression toward the mean is a significant consideration in the design of experiments statistics could be used to measure the success of an intervention on the 50 who were rated at the greatest risk even if the interventions are worthless , the test group would be expected to show an improvement on their next physical exam , because of regression toward the mean statistical regression toward the mean is not a causal phenomenon the effect is the exact reverse of regression toward the mean , and exactly offsets it the calculation and interpretation of '' improvement scores '' on standardized educational tests in massachusetts probably provides another example of the regression fallacy just because criticizing or praising precedes the regression toward the mean , the act of criticizing or of praising is falsely attributed causality similarly , the law of large numbers states that in the long term , the average will tend towards the expected value , but makes no statement about individual trials this is the definition of regression toward the mean that closely follows sir francis galton 's original usage regression toward the mean and the study of change , psychological bulletin a non-mathematical explanation of regression toward the mean

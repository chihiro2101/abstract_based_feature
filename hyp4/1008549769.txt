then , each student 's score would be a realization of one of a set of independent and identically distributed random variables , with an expected mean of 50 if one selects only the top scoring 10 % of the students and gives them a second test on which they again choose randomly on all items , the mean score would again be expected to be close to 50 thus the mean of these students would '' regress '' all the way back to the mean of all students who took the original test no matter what a student scores on the original test , the best prediction of their score on the second test is 50 if there were no luck ( good or bad ) or random guessing involved in the answers supplied by the students â€“ then all students would be expected to score the same on the second test as they scored on the original test , and there would be no regression toward the mean in this case , the subset of students scoring above average would be composed of those who were skilled and had not especially bad luck , together with those who were unskilled , but were extremely lucky the following is an example of this second kind of regression toward the mean it has frequently been observed that the worst performers on the first day will tend to improve their scores on the second day , and the best performers on the first day will tend to do worse on the second day for the first test , some will be lucky , and score more than their ability , and some will be unlucky and score less than their ability some of the lucky students on the first test will be lucky again on the second test , but more of them will have ( for them ) average or below average scores if one medical trial suggests that a particular drug or treatment is outperforming all other treatments for a condition , then in a second trial it is more likely that the outperforming drug or treatment will perform closer to the mean the next quarter if a business organisation has a highly profitable quarter , despite the underlying reasons for its performance being unchanged , it is likely to do less well the next quarter rather , the characteristics in the offspring regress towards a mediocre point ( a point which has since been identified as the mean ) by measuring the heights of hundreds of people , he was able to quantify regression to the mean , and estimate the size of the effect for height , galton estimated this coefficient to be about 2/3 : the height of an individual will measure around a midpoint that is two thirds of the parents ' deviation from the population average though his mathematical analysis was correct , galton 's biological explanation for the regression phenomenon he observed is now known to be incorrect speaking generally , the further his genealogy goes back , the more numerous and varied will his ancestry become , until they cease to differ from any equally numerous sample taken at haphazard from the race at large but the loci which carry these mutations are not necessarily shared between two tall individuals , and if these individuals mate , their offspring will be on average homozygous for '' tall '' mutations on fewer loci than either of their parents in addition , height is not entirely genetically determined , but also subject to environmental influences during development , which make offspring of exceptional parents even more likely to be closer to the average than their parents this population genetic phenomenon of regression to the mean is best thought of as a combination of a binomially distributed process of inheritance plus normally distributed environmental influences in contrast , the term '' regression to the mean '' is now often used to describe the phenomenon by which an initial sampling bias may disappear as new , repeated , or larger samples display sample means that are closer to the true underlying population mean regression toward the mean is a significant consideration in the design of experiments even if the interventions are worthless , the test group would be expected to show an improvement on their next physical exam , because of regression toward the mean the best way to combat this effect is to divide the group randomly into a treatment group that receives the treatment , and a control group that does not the concept of regression toward the mean can be misused very easily although extreme individual measurements regress toward the mean , the second sample of measurements will be no closer to the mean than the first the calculation and interpretation of '' improvement scores '' on standardized educational tests in massachusetts probably provides another example of the regression fallacy this is the definition of regression toward the mean that closely follows sir francis galton 's original usage regression toward the mean and the study of change , psychological bulletin a non-mathematical explanation of regression toward the mean a simulation of regression toward the mean

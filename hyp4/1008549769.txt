consider a simple example : a class of students takes a 100-item true/false test on a subject then , each student 's score would be a realization of one of a set of independent and identically distributed random variables , with an expected mean of 50 if one selects only the top scoring 10 % of the students and gives them a second test on which they again choose randomly on all items , the mean score would again be expected to be close to 50 thus the mean of these students would '' regress '' all the way back to the mean of all students who took the original test no matter what a student scores on the original test , the best prediction of their score on the second test is 50 if there were no luck ( good or bad ) or random guessing involved in the answers supplied by the students â€“ then all students would be expected to score the same on the second test as they scored on the original test , and there would be no regression toward the mean most realistic situations fall between these two extremes : for example , one might consider exam scores as a combination of skill and luck the following is an example of this second kind of regression toward the mean it has frequently been observed that the worst performers on the first day will tend to improve their scores on the second day , and the best performers on the first day will tend to do worse on the second day for the first test , some will be lucky , and score more than their ability , and some will be unlucky and score less than their ability some of the lucky students on the first test will be lucky again on the second test , but more of them will have ( for them ) average or below average scores therefore , a student who was lucky and over-performed their ability on the first test is more likely to have a worse score on the second test than a better score similarly , students who unluckily score less than their ability on the first test will tend to see their scores increase on the second test if a business organisation has a highly profitable quarter , despite the underlying reasons for its performance being unchanged , it is likely to do less well the next quarter baseball players who hit well in their rookie season are likely to do worse their second ; the '' sophomore slump '' the concept of regression comes from genetics and was popularized by sir francis galton during the late 19th century with the publication of regression towards mediocrity in hereditary stature rather , the characteristics in the offspring regress towards a mediocre point ( a point which has since been identified as the mean ) if its parents are each two inches taller than the averages for men and women , then , on average , the offspring will be shorter than its parents by some factor ( which , today , we would call one minus the regression analysis ) times two inches for height , galton estimated this coefficient to be about 2/3 : the height of an individual will measure around a midpoint that is two thirds of the parents ' deviation from the population average since then , the term '' regression '' has taken on a variety of meanings , and it may be used by modern statisticians to describe phenomena of sampling bias which have little to do with galton 's original observations in the field of genetics exceptionally tall individuals must be homozygous for increased height mutations at a large proportion of these loci in contrast , the term '' regression to the mean '' is now often used to describe the phenomenon by which an initial sampling bias may disappear as new , repeated , or larger samples display sample means that are closer to the true underlying population mean even if the interventions are worthless , the test group would be expected to show an improvement on their next physical exam , because of regression toward the mean alternatively , a group of disadvantaged children could be tested to identify the ones with most college potential even if the program is effective , their average scores may well be less when the test is repeated a year later the baseball player with the highest batting average by the all-star break is more likely to have a lower average than a higher average over the second half of the season so for extreme individuals , we expect the second score to be closer to the mean than the first score , but for all individuals , we expect the distribution of distances from the mean to be the same on both sets of measurements regression toward the mean simply says that , following an extreme random event , the next random event is likely to be less extreme this is the definition of regression toward the mean that closely follows sir francis galton 's original usage regression toward the mean and the study of change , psychological bulletin a non-mathematical explanation of regression toward the mean

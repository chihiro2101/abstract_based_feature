then , each student 's score would be a realization of one of a set of independent and identically distributed random variables , with an expected mean of 50 if one selects only the top scoring 10 % of the students and gives them a second test on which they again choose randomly on all items , the mean score would again be expected to be close to 50 thus the mean of these students would '' regress '' all the way back to the mean of all students who took the original test no matter what a student scores on the original test , the best prediction of their score on the second test is 50 if there were no luck ( good or bad ) or random guessing involved in the answers supplied by the students â€“ then all students would be expected to score the same on the second test as they scored on the original test , and there would be no regression toward the mean in this case , the subset of students scoring above average would be composed of those who were skilled and had not especially bad luck , together with those who were unskilled , but were extremely lucky the following is an example of this second kind of regression toward the mean it has frequently been observed that the worst performers on the first day will tend to improve their scores on the second day , and the best performers on the first day will tend to do worse on the second day some of the lucky students on the first test will be lucky again on the second test , but more of them will have ( for them ) average or below average scores therefore , a student who was lucky and over-performed their ability on the first test is more likely to have a worse score on the second test than a better score similarly , students who unluckily score less than their ability on the first test will tend to see their scores increase on the second test ) , their win signals that it is more likely they will win again next year baseball players who hit well in their rookie season are likely to do worse their second ; the '' sophomore slump '' the concept of regression comes from genetics and was popularized by sir francis galton during the late 19th century with the publication of regression towards mediocrity in hereditary stature galton wrote that , '' the average regression of the offspring is a constant fraction of their respective midparent deviations '' this means that the difference between a child and its parents for some characteristic is proportional to its parents ' deviation from typical people in the population galton coined the term '' regression '' to describe an observable fact in the inheritance of multi-factorial quantitative genetic traits : namely that the offspring of parents who lie at the tails of the distribution will tend to lie closer to the centre , the mean , of the distribution since then , the term '' regression '' has taken on a variety of meanings , and it may be used by modern statisticians to describe phenomena of sampling bias which have little to do with galton 's original observations in the field of genetics though his mathematical analysis was correct , galton 's biological explanation for the regression phenomenon he observed is now known to be incorrect speaking generally , the further his genealogy goes back , the more numerous and varied will his ancestry become , until they cease to differ from any equally numerous sample taken at haphazard from the race at large this population genetic phenomenon of regression to the mean is best thought of as a combination of a binomially distributed process of inheritance plus normally distributed environmental influences in contrast , the term '' regression to the mean '' is now often used to describe the phenomenon by which an initial sampling bias may disappear as new , repeated , or larger samples display sample means that are closer to the true underlying population mean statistics could be used to measure the success of an intervention on the 50 who were rated at the greatest risk even if the interventions are worthless , the test group would be expected to show an improvement on their next physical exam , because of regression toward the mean even if the program is effective , their average scores may well be less when the test is repeated a year later and if we compare the best student on the first day to the best student on the second day , regardless of whether it is the same individual or not , there is a tendency to regress toward the mean going in either direction regression to the mean in sports performance may also explain the apparent '' sports illustrated cover jinx '' and the '' madden curse '' john hollinger has an alternative name for the phenomenon of regression to the mean : the '' fluke rule '' , while bill james calls it the '' plexiglas principle '' this is the definition of regression toward the mean that closely follows sir francis galton 's original usage regression toward the mean and the study of change , psychological bulletin a non-mathematical explanation of regression toward the mean

then , each student 's score would be a realization of one of a set of independent and identically distributed random variables , with an expected mean of 50 if one selects only the top scoring 10 % of the students and gives them a second test on which they again choose randomly on all items , the mean score would again be expected to be close to 50 thus the mean of these students would '' regress '' all the way back to the mean of all students who took the original test if there were no luck ( good or bad ) or random guessing involved in the answers supplied by the students â€“ then all students would be expected to score the same on the second test as they scored on the original test , and there would be no regression toward the mean most realistic situations fall between these two extremes : for example , one might consider exam scores as a combination of skill and luck in this case , the subset of students scoring above average would be composed of those who were skilled and had not especially bad luck , together with those who were unskilled , but were extremely lucky the following is an example of this second kind of regression toward the mean it has frequently been observed that the worst performers on the first day will tend to improve their scores on the second day , and the best performers on the first day will tend to do worse on the second day some of the lucky students on the first test will be lucky again on the second test , but more of them will have ( for them ) average or below average scores therefore , a student who was lucky and over-performed their ability on the first test is more likely to have a worse score on the second test than a better score similarly , students who unluckily score less than their ability on the first test will tend to see their scores increase on the second test if one medical trial suggests that a particular drug or treatment is outperforming all other treatments for a condition , then in a second trial it is more likely that the outperforming drug or treatment will perform closer to the mean the next quarter the concept of regression comes from genetics and was popularized by sir francis galton during the late 19th century with the publication of regression towards mediocrity in hereditary stature rather , the characteristics in the offspring regress towards a mediocre point ( a point which has since been identified as the mean ) galton wrote that , '' the average regression of the offspring is a constant fraction of their respective midparent deviations '' galton coined the term '' regression '' to describe an observable fact in the inheritance of multi-factorial quantitative genetic traits : namely that the offspring of parents who lie at the tails of the distribution will tend to lie closer to the centre , the mean , of the distribution he quantified this trend , and in doing so invented linear regression analysis , thus laying the groundwork for much of modern statistical modelling since then , the term '' regression '' has taken on a variety of meanings , and it may be used by modern statisticians to describe phenomena of sampling bias which have little to do with galton 's original observations in the field of genetics though his mathematical analysis was correct , galton 's biological explanation for the regression phenomenon he observed is now known to be incorrect there is no generation-skipping in genetic material : any genetic material from earlier ancestors must have passed through the parents ( though it may not have been expressed in them ) in addition , height is not entirely genetically determined , but also subject to environmental influences during development , which make offspring of exceptional parents even more likely to be closer to the average than their parents even if the program is effective , their average scores may well be less when the test is repeated a year later the concept of regression toward the mean can be misused very easily then the students who scored under 70 the first time would have no incentive to do well , and might score worse on average the second time statistical regression toward the mean is not a causal phenomenon related to the point above , regression toward the mean works equally well in both directions the calculation and interpretation of '' improvement scores '' on standardized educational tests in massachusetts probably provides another example of the regression fallacy regression toward the mean simply says that , following an extreme random event , the next random event is likely to be less extreme this is the definition of regression toward the mean that closely follows sir francis galton 's original usage regression toward the mean and the study of change , psychological bulletin a non-mathematical explanation of regression toward the mean

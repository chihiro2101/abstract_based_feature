frame suppose the edges of a complete graph on 6 vertices are coloured red and blue ) if any of the edges , ( r , s ) , ( r , t ) , ( s , t ) , are also blue then we have an entirely blue triangle since this argument works for any colouring , any k 6 contains a monochromatic k 3 , and therefore r ( 3 , 3 ) ≤ 6 it goes as follows : count the number of ordered triples of vertices , x , y , z , such that the edge , ( xy ) , is red and the edge , ( yz ) , is blue therefore , there are at most 6 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 6 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 36 such triples conversely , it is possible to 2-colour a k 5 without creating any monochromatic k 3 , showing that r ( 3 , 3 ) & nbsp ; > & nbsp ; 5 thus r ( 3 , 3 ) & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 6 there are ( up to symmetries ) only two non-trivial multicolour ramsey numbers for which the exact value is known , namely r ( 3 , 3 , 3 ) & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 17 and r ( 3 , 3 , 4 ) & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 30 suppose that we have an edge colouring of a complete graph using 3 colours , red , green and blue thus , the induced edge colouring on the red neighbourhood of v has edges coloured with only two colours , namely green and blue to see that r ( 3 , 3 , 3 ) 17 , it suffices to draw an edge colouring on the complete graph on 16 vertices with 3 colours that avoids monochromatic triangles pick a vertex from the graph , and partition the remaining vertices into two sets and , such that for every vertex , is in if is blue , and is in if is red an m-hypergraph is a graph whose '' edges '' are sets of m vertices – in a normal graph an edge is a set of 2 vertices

frame suppose the edges of a complete graph on 6 vertices are coloured red and blue it goes as follows : count the number of ordered triples of vertices , x , y , z , such that the edge , ( xy ) , is red and the edge , ( yz ) , is blue therefore , there are at most 6 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 6 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 36 such triples conversely , it is possible to 2-colour a k 5 without creating any monochromatic k 3 , showing that r ( 3 , 3 ) & nbsp ; > & nbsp ; 5 the task of proving that r ( 3 , 3 ) & nbsp ; ≤ & nbsp ; 6 was one of the problems of william lowell putnam mathematical competition in 1953 , as well as in the hungarian math olympiad in 1947 right right a multicolour ramsey number is a ramsey number using 3 or more colours there are ( up to symmetries ) only two non-trivial multicolour ramsey numbers for which the exact value is known , namely r ( 3 , 3 , 3 ) & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 17 and r ( 3 , 3 , 4 ) & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 30 consider the set of vertices that have a red edge to the vertex v since r ( 3 , 3 ) 6 , the red neighbourhood of v can contain at most 5 vertices since every vertex , except for v itself , is in one of the red , green or blue neighbourhoods of v , the entire complete graph can have at most 1 + 5 + 5 + 5 16 vertices to see that r ( 3 , 3 , 3 ) 17 , it suffices to draw an edge colouring on the complete graph on 16 vertices with 3 colours that avoids monochromatic triangles consider a complete graph on vertices whose edges are coloured with two colours the base case for the proof is m & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 2 , which is exactly the theorem above

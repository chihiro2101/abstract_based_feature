frame suppose the edges of a complete graph on 6 vertices are coloured red and blue without loss of generality we can assume at least 3 of these edges , connecting the vertex , v , to vertices , r , s and t , are blue ) if any of the edges , ( r , s ) , ( r , t ) , ( s , t ) , are also blue then we have an entirely blue triangle the popular version of this is called the theorem on friends and strangers it goes as follows : count the number of ordered triples of vertices , x , y , z , such that the edge , ( xy ) , is red and the edge , ( yz ) , is blue right right a multicolour ramsey number is a ramsey number using 3 or more colours suppose that we have an edge colouring of a complete graph using 3 colours , red , green and blue consider the set of vertices that have a red edge to the vertex v since every vertex , except for v itself , is in one of the red , green or blue neighbourhoods of v , the entire complete graph can have at most 1 + 5 + 5 + 5 16 vertices to see that r ( 3 , 3 , 3 ) 17 , it suffices to draw an edge colouring on the complete graph on 16 vertices with 3 colours that avoids monochromatic triangles consider a complete graph on vertices whose edges are coloured with two colours an m-hypergraph is a graph whose '' edges '' are sets of m vertices â€“ in a normal graph an edge is a set of 2 vertices ( the directed analogue of the two possible arc colours is the two directions of the arcs , the analogue of '' monochromatic '' is '' all arc-arrows point the same way '' ; i.e

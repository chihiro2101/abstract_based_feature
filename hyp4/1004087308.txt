frame suppose the edges of a complete graph on 6 vertices are coloured red and blue there are 5 edges incident to v and so ( by the pigeonhole principle ) at least 3 of them must be the same colour ) if any of the edges , ( r , s ) , ( r , t ) , ( s , t ) , are also blue then we have an entirely blue triangle if not , then those three edges are all red and we have an entirely red triangle the popular version of this is called the theorem on friends and strangers therefore , there are at most 6 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 6 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 36 such triples there are ( up to symmetries ) only two non-trivial multicolour ramsey numbers for which the exact value is known , namely r ( 3 , 3 , 3 ) & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 17 and r ( 3 , 3 , 4 ) & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 30 suppose that we have an edge colouring of a complete graph using 3 colours , red , green and blue consider the set of vertices that have a red edge to the vertex v since every vertex , except for v itself , is in one of the red , green or blue neighbourhoods of v , the entire complete graph can have at most 1 + 5 + 5 + 5 16 vertices to see that r ( 3 , 3 , 3 ) 17 , it suffices to draw an edge colouring on the complete graph on 16 vertices with 3 colours that avoids monochromatic triangles an m-hypergraph is a graph whose '' edges '' are sets of m vertices – in a normal graph an edge is a set of 2 vertices the base case for the proof is m & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 2 , which is exactly the theorem above

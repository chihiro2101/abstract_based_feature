frame suppose the edges of a complete graph on 6 vertices are coloured red and blue without loss of generality we can assume at least 3 of these edges , connecting the vertex , v , to vertices , r , s and t , are blue ) if any of the edges , ( r , s ) , ( r , t ) , ( s , t ) , are also blue then we have an entirely blue triangle it goes as follows : count the number of ordered triples of vertices , x , y , z , such that the edge , ( xy ) , is red and the edge , ( yz ) , is blue therefore , there are at most 6 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 6 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 36 such triples conversely , it is possible to 2-colour a k 5 without creating any monochromatic k 3 , showing that r ( 3 , 3 ) & nbsp ; > & nbsp ; 5 there are ( up to symmetries ) only two non-trivial multicolour ramsey numbers for which the exact value is known , namely r ( 3 , 3 , 3 ) & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 17 and r ( 3 , 3 , 4 ) & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 30 suppose that we have an edge colouring of a complete graph using 3 colours , red , green and blue thus , the induced edge colouring on the red neighbourhood of v has edges coloured with only two colours , namely green and blue to see that r ( 3 , 3 , 3 ) 17 , it suffices to draw an edge colouring on the complete graph on 16 vertices with 3 colours that avoids monochromatic triangles it turns out that there are exactly two such colourings on k 16 , the so-called untwisted and twisted colourings an m-hypergraph is a graph whose '' edges '' are sets of m vertices – in a normal graph an edge is a set of 2 vertices the base case for the proof is m & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 2 , which is exactly the theorem above

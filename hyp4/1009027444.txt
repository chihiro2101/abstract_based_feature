nagel began to publish philosophy at the age of twenty-two ; his career now spans over fifty years of publication nagel thinks that each person , owing to his or her capacity to reason , instinctively seeks a unified world view however , if this aspiration leads one to believe that there is only one way to understand our intellectual commitments , whether about the external world , knowledge , or what our practical and moral reasons ought to be , this leads one into error like the british philosopher bernard williams , nagel believes that the rise of modern science has permanently changed how people think of the world and our place in it a modern scientific understanding is one way of thinking about the world and our place in it that is more objective than the common sense view it replaces understanding this bleached out view of the world draws on our capacities as purely rational thinkers and fails to account for the specific nature of our perceptual sensibility despite what may seem like skepticism about the objective claims of science , nagel does not dispute that science describes the world that exists independently of us his contention , rather , is that a given way of understanding a subject matter should not be regarded as better simply for being more objective he argues that scientific understanding 's attempt at an objective viewpoint -- a '' view from nowhere '' -- necessarily leaves out something essential when applied to the mind , which is inherently from a subjective point of view in '' what is it like to be a bat ? '' and elsewhere , he writes that science can not describe what it is like to be a thinker who conceives of the world from a particular subjective perspective it would , of its nature , leave out what it is to be a thinker , and that , nagel believes , would be a falsely objectifying view being a thinker is to have a subjective perspective on the world ; if one abstracts away from this perspective one leaves out what he sought to explain nagel thinks that philosophers – over-impressed by the paradigm of the kind of objective understanding represented by modern science – tend to produce philosophy of mind that are falsely objectifying in precisely this kind of way as a philosophical rationalism , nagel believes that a proper understanding of the place of mental properties in nature will involve a revolution in our understanding of both the physical and the mental , and that this is a reasonable prospect that people can anticipate in the near future a plausible science of the mind will give an account of the stuff that underpins mental and physical properties in such a way that people will simply be able to see that it necessitates both of these aspects now , it seems to people that the mental and the physical are irreducibly distinct but that is not a metaphysical insight , or an acknowledgment of an irreducible explanatory gap , but simply where people are at their present stage of understanding nagel accuses wittgenstein and american philosopher of mind and language donald davidson of philosophical idealism in both cases they ask people to take up an interpretative perspective to making sense of other speakers in the context of a shared , objective world nagel is probably most widely known within the field of philosophy of mind as an advocate of the idea that consciousness and subjective experience can not , at least with the contemporary understanding of physicalism , be satisfactorily explained using the current concepts of physics this position was primarily discussed by nagel in one of his most famous articles : '' what is it like to be a bat ? '' ( 1974 ) '' nagel , '' what is it like to be a bat ? '' ( 1974 ) , p his critics have objected strongly to what they see as a misguided attempt to argue from a fact about how one represents the world ( trivially , one can only do so from his own point of view ) to a false claim about the world , that it somehow has first personal perspectives built into it on that understanding , nagel is a conventional dualist about the physical and the mental but kripke argues that one can easily imagine a situation where , for example , one 's c-fibres are stimulated but one is not in pain and so refute any such psychophysical identity from the armchair he writes that mind is a basic aspect of nature , and that any philosophy of nature that can not account for it is fundamentally misguided nagel has argued that id should not be rejected as non-scientific , for instance writing in 2008 that '' id is very different from creation science , '' and that the debate about id '' is clearly a scientific disagreement , not a disagreement between science and something else but it is the reason that does the justificatory work of justifying both the action and the desire the most striking claim of the book is that there is a very close parallel between prudential reasoning in one 's own interests and moral reasons to act to further the interests of another person when one reasons prudentially , for example about the future reasons that one will have , one allows the reason in the future to justify one 's current action without reference to the strength of one 's current desires the denial of this view of prudence , nagel argues , means that one does not really believe that one is one and the same person through time comparable to the views of the nineteenth century moral philosopher henry sidgwick , nagel believes that one needs to conceive of one 's good as an impersonal good and one 's reasons as objective reasons in this case the false view is that one 's reasons are irreducibly his , in a way that does not allow them to be reasons for anyone : nagel argues this commits such a person to the view that he or she can not make the same judgments about her own reasons third-personally that she can make first-personally nagel calls this '' dissociation '' and considers it a practical analogue of solipsism ( the philosophical idea that only one 's own mind is sure to exist ) nagel 's later work on ethics ceases to place as much weight on the distinction between a person 's personal or '' subjective '' reasons and his or her '' objective '' reasons in later discussions , nagel treats his former view as an incomplete attempt to convey the fact that there are distinct classes of reasons and values , and speaks instead of '' agent-relative '' and '' agent-neutral '' reasons the different classes of reasons and values ( i.e this is similar to '' world agent '' consequentialist views in which one takes up the standpoint of a collective subject whose reasons are those of everyone in addition , in his later work , nagel finds a rationale for so-called deontic constraints in a way scheffler could not the extent to which one can lead a good life as an individual while respecting the demands of others leads inevitably to political philosophy in the locke lectures published as the book equality and partiality , nagel exposes john rawls 's theory of justice to detailed scrutiny the situation is roughly this : there are elements which , it added to one 's experience , make life better ; there are other elements which if added to one 's experience , make life worse he has also been awarded the balzan prize in moral philosophy ( 2008 ) , the rolf schock prize in logic and philosophy of the royal swedish academy of sciences ( 2008 ) and the distinguished achievement award of the mellon foundation ( 2006 ) american philosophy list of american philosophers david chalmers frank jackson galen strawson hard problem of consciousness knowledge argument

nagel thinks that each person , owing to his or her capacity to reason , instinctively seeks a unified world view however , if this aspiration leads one to believe that there is only one way to understand our intellectual commitments , whether about the external world , knowledge , or what our practical and moral reasons ought to be , this leads one into error like the british philosopher bernard williams , nagel believes that the rise of modern science has permanently changed how people think of the world and our place in it despite what may seem like skepticism about the objective claims of science , nagel does not dispute that science describes the world that exists independently of us in '' what is it like to be a bat ? '' and elsewhere , he writes that science can not describe what it is like to be a thinker who conceives of the world from a particular subjective perspective one learns and uses mental concepts by being directly acquainted with one 's own mind , whereas any attempt to think more objectively about mentality would abstract away from this fact being a thinker is to have a subjective perspective on the world ; if one abstracts away from this perspective one leaves out what he sought to explain nagel thinks that philosophers – over-impressed by the paradigm of the kind of objective understanding represented by modern science – tend to produce philosophy of mind that are falsely objectifying in precisely this kind of way they are right to be impressed – modern science really is objective – but are wrong to take modern science to be the only paradigm of objectivity a plausible science of the mind will give an account of the stuff that underpins mental and physical properties in such a way that people will simply be able to see that it necessitates both of these aspects now , it seems to people that the mental and the physical are irreducibly distinct but that is not a metaphysical insight , or an acknowledgment of an irreducible explanatory gap , but simply where people are at their present stage of understanding nagel 's rationalism and tendency to present our human nature as a composite , structured around our capacity to reason , explains why he thinks that therapeutic or deflationary accounts of philosophy are simply complacent and that radical skepticism is , strictly speaking , irrefutable the therapeutic or deflationary philosopher , influenced by the later philosophy of ludwig wittgenstein , reconciles people to the dependence of our worldview on our '' form of life '' nagel accuses wittgenstein and american philosopher of mind and language donald davidson of philosophical idealism nagel is probably most widely known within the field of philosophy of mind as an advocate of the idea that consciousness and subjective experience can not , at least with the contemporary understanding of physicalism , be satisfactorily explained using the current concepts of physics this position was primarily discussed by nagel in one of his most famous articles : '' what is it like to be a bat ? '' ( 1974 ) he states that '' an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism—something it is like for the organism this is , however , a misunderstanding : nagel 's point is that there is a constraint on what it is to possess the concept of a mental state , namely , that one be directly acquainted with it part of the puzzlement here is because of the limitations of imagination : influenced by his princeton colleague , saul kripke , nagel believes that any type identity statement that identifies a physical state type with a mental state type would be , if true , logical truth ) this argument that there will always be an explanatory gap between an identification of a state in mental and physical terms is compounded , nagel argues , by the fact that imagination operates in two distinct ways when asked to imagine sensorily , one imagines c-fibres being stimulated ; if asked to imagine sympathetically , one puts oneself in a conscious state resembling pain in his 2012 book mind and cosmos , nagel argues against a materialism view of the emergence of life and consciousness , writing that the standard neo-darwinism view flies in the face of common sense nagel has argued that id should not be rejected as non-scientific , for instance writing in 2008 that '' id is very different from creation science , '' and that the debate about id '' is clearly a scientific disagreement , not a disagreement between science and something else nagel has been highly influential in the related fields of moral and political philosophy supervised by john rawls , nagel has been a long-standing proponent of a kantian and rationalist approach to moral philosophy nagel contrasts this view with a rival view which believes that a moral agent can only accept that he or she has a reason to act if the desire to carry out the action has an independent justification the denial of this view of prudence , nagel argues , means that one does not really believe that one is one and the same person through time one is dissolving oneself into distinct person-stages this is the basis of his analogy between prudential actions and moral actions : in cases of altruistic action for another person 's good that person 's reasons quite literally become reasons for one if they are timeless and intrinsic reasons comparable to the views of the nineteenth century moral philosopher henry sidgwick , nagel believes that one needs to conceive of one 's good as an impersonal good and one 's reasons as objective reasons in this case the false view is that one 's reasons are irreducibly his , in a way that does not allow them to be reasons for anyone : nagel argues this commits such a person to the view that he or she can not make the same judgments about her own reasons third-personally that she can make first-personally nagel 's later work on ethics ceases to place as much weight on the distinction between a person 's personal or '' subjective '' reasons and his or her '' objective '' reasons earlier , in the possibility of altruism , he took the stance that if one 's reasons really are about intrinsic and timeless values then , qua subjective reason , one can only take them to be the guise of the reasons that there really are – the objective ones in later discussions , nagel treats his former view as an incomplete attempt to convey the fact that there are distinct classes of reasons and values , and speaks instead of '' agent-relative '' and '' agent-neutral '' reasons in the case of agent-relative reasons ( the successor to subjective reasons ) specifying the content of the reason makes essential reference back to the agent for whom it is a reason those reasons and values that withstand detached critical scrutiny are objective , but more subjective reasons and values can nevertheless be objectively tolerated however , the most striking part of the earlier argument and of sidgwick 's view is preserved : agent-neutral reasons are literally reasons for anyone , so all objectifiable reasons become individually possessed no matter whose they are but nagel remains an individualist who believes in the separateness of persons so his task is to explain why this objective viewpoint does not swallow up the individual standpoint of each of us the result is a hybrid ethical theory of the kind defended by nagel 's princeton phd student samuel scheffler in the rejection of consequentialism once again , nagel places such weight on the objective point of view and its requirements that he finds rawls 's view of liberal equality not demanding enough he has also been awarded the balzan prize in moral philosophy ( 2008 ) , the rolf schock prize in logic and philosophy of the royal swedish academy of sciences ( 2008 ) and the distinguished achievement award of the mellon foundation ( 2006 ) 2008 , '' public education and intelligent design '' , philosophy and public affairs 2009 , '' the i in me '' , a review article of selves : an essay in revisionary metaphysics by galen strawson , oxford , 448 pp , , lrb.co.uk american philosophy list of american philosophers david chalmers frank jackson galen strawson hard problem of consciousness knowledge argument

nagel began to publish philosophy at the age of twenty-two ; his career now spans over fifty years of publication nagel thinks that each person , owing to his or her capacity to reason , instinctively seeks a unified world view like the british philosopher bernard williams , nagel believes that the rise of modern science has permanently changed how people think of the world and our place in it our modern scientific understanding involves the mathematicized understanding of the world represented by modern physics despite what may seem like skepticism about the objective claims of science , nagel does not dispute that science describes the world that exists independently of us his contention , rather , is that a given way of understanding a subject matter should not be regarded as better simply for being more objective nagel argues that some phenomena are not best grasped from a more objective perspective one learns and uses mental concepts by being directly acquainted with one 's own mind , whereas any attempt to think more objectively about mentality would abstract away from this fact it would , of its nature , leave out what it is to be a thinker , and that , nagel believes , would be a falsely objectifying view being a thinker is to have a subjective perspective on the world ; if one abstracts away from this perspective one leaves out what he sought to explain nagel thinks that philosophers – over-impressed by the paradigm of the kind of objective understanding represented by modern science – tend to produce philosophy of mind that are falsely objectifying in precisely this kind of way the kind of understanding that science represents does not transfer to everything that people would like to understand as a philosophical rationalism , nagel believes that a proper understanding of the place of mental properties in nature will involve a revolution in our understanding of both the physical and the mental , and that this is a reasonable prospect that people can anticipate in the near future a plausible science of the mind will give an account of the stuff that underpins mental and physical properties in such a way that people will simply be able to see that it necessitates both of these aspects nagel 's rationalism and tendency to present our human nature as a composite , structured around our capacity to reason , explains why he thinks that therapeutic or deflationary accounts of philosophy are simply complacent and that radical skepticism is , strictly speaking , irrefutable the therapeutic or deflationary philosopher , influenced by the later philosophy of ludwig wittgenstein , reconciles people to the dependence of our worldview on our '' form of life '' nagel accuses wittgenstein and american philosopher of mind and language donald davidson of philosophical idealism in both cases they ask people to take up an interpretative perspective to making sense of other speakers in the context of a shared , objective world nagel claims this is no better than more orthodox forms of idealism in which reality is claimed to be made up of mental items or claimed to be constitutively dependent on a form supplied by the mind nagel is probably most widely known within the field of philosophy of mind as an advocate of the idea that consciousness and subjective experience can not , at least with the contemporary understanding of physicalism , be satisfactorily explained using the current concepts of physics this position was primarily discussed by nagel in one of his most famous articles : '' what is it like to be a bat ? '' ( 1974 ) the article 's title question , though often attributed to nagel , was originally asked by timothy sprigge on that understanding , nagel is a conventional dualist about the physical and the mental this is , however , a misunderstanding : nagel 's point is that there is a constraint on what it is to possess the concept of a mental state , namely , that one be directly acquainted with it part of the puzzlement here is because of the limitations of imagination : influenced by his princeton colleague , saul kripke , nagel believes that any type identity statement that identifies a physical state type with a mental state type would be , if true , logical truth but kripke argues that one can easily imagine a situation where , for example , one 's c-fibres are stimulated but one is not in pain and so refute any such psychophysical identity from the armchair ) this argument that there will always be an explanatory gap between an identification of a state in mental and physical terms is compounded , nagel argues , by the fact that imagination operates in two distinct ways when asked to imagine sensorily , one imagines c-fibres being stimulated ; if asked to imagine sympathetically , one puts oneself in a conscious state resembling pain these two ways of imagining the two terms of the identity statement are so different that there will always seem to be an explanatory gap , whether or not this is the case ) nagel is not a physicalist because he does not believe that an internal understanding of mental concepts shows them to have the kind of hidden essence that underpins a scientific identity in , say , chemistry in his 2012 book mind and cosmos , nagel argues against a materialism view of the emergence of life and consciousness , writing that the standard neo-darwinism view flies in the face of common sense nagel has argued that id should not be rejected as non-scientific , for instance writing in 2008 that '' id is very different from creation science , '' and that the debate about id '' is clearly a scientific disagreement , not a disagreement between science and something else . nagel 's rawlsian approach according to motivated desire theory , when a person is motivated to moral action it is indeed true that such actions are motivated – like all intentional actions – by a belief and a desire but it is important to get the justificatory relations right : when a person accepts a moral judgment he or she is necessarily motivated to act nagel contrasts this view with a rival view which believes that a moral agent can only accept that he or she has a reason to act if the desire to carry out the action has an independent justification an account based on presupposing sympathy would be of this kind if a hurricane were to destroy someone 's car next year at that point he will want his insurance company to pay him to replace it : that future reason gives him a reason , now , to take out insurance in this case the false view is that one 's reasons are irreducibly his , in a way that does not allow them to be reasons for anyone : nagel argues this commits such a person to the view that he or she can not make the same judgments about her own reasons third-personally that she can make first-personally nagel calls this '' dissociation '' and considers it a practical analogue of solipsism ( the philosophical idea that only one 's own mind is sure to exist ) the structure of nagel 's later ethical view is that all reasons must be brought into relation to this objective view of oneself '' he also said in his book the last word , '' i want atheism to be true and am made uneasy by the fact that some of the most intelligent and well-informed people i know are religious believers he has also been awarded the balzan prize in moral philosophy ( 2008 ) , the rolf schock prize in logic and philosophy of the royal swedish academy of sciences ( 2008 ) and the distinguished achievement award of the mellon foundation ( 2006 )

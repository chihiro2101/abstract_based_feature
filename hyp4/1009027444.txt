nagel began to publish philosophy at the age of twenty-two ; his career now spans over fifty years of publication nagel thinks that each person , owing to his or her capacity to reason , instinctively seeks a unified world view however , if this aspiration leads one to believe that there is only one way to understand our intellectual commitments , whether about the external world , knowledge , or what our practical and moral reasons ought to be , this leads one into error like the british philosopher bernard williams , nagel believes that the rise of modern science has permanently changed how people think of the world and our place in it a modern scientific understanding is one way of thinking about the world and our place in it that is more objective than the common sense view it replaces our modern scientific understanding involves the mathematicized understanding of the world represented by modern physics understanding this bleached out view of the world draws on our capacities as purely rational thinkers and fails to account for the specific nature of our perceptual sensibility despite what may seem like skepticism about the objective claims of science , nagel does not dispute that science describes the world that exists independently of us his contention , rather , is that a given way of understanding a subject matter should not be regarded as better simply for being more objective he argues that scientific understanding 's attempt at an objective viewpoint -- a '' view from nowhere '' -- necessarily leaves out something essential when applied to the mind , which is inherently from a subjective point of view as such , objective science is fundamentally unable to help people fully understand themselves in '' what is it like to be a bat ? '' and elsewhere , he writes that science can not describe what it is like to be a thinker who conceives of the world from a particular subjective perspective nagel argues that some phenomena are not best grasped from a more objective perspective the kind of understanding that science represents does not transfer to everything that people would like to understand as a philosophical rationalism , nagel believes that a proper understanding of the place of mental properties in nature will involve a revolution in our understanding of both the physical and the mental , and that this is a reasonable prospect that people can anticipate in the near future nagel 's rationalism and tendency to present our human nature as a composite , structured around our capacity to reason , explains why he thinks that therapeutic or deflationary accounts of philosophy are simply complacent and that radical skepticism is , strictly speaking , irrefutable the therapeutic or deflationary philosopher , influenced by the later philosophy of ludwig wittgenstein , reconciles people to the dependence of our worldview on our '' form of life '' nagel accuses wittgenstein and american philosopher of mind and language donald davidson of philosophical idealism oxford : oxford university press , chapter vi in both cases they ask people to take up an interpretative perspective to making sense of other speakers in the context of a shared , objective world this position was primarily discussed by nagel in one of his most famous articles : '' what is it like to be a bat ? '' ( 1974 ) in '' what is it like to be a bat ? '' , nagel argues that consciousness has essential to it a subjective character , a what it is like aspect on that understanding , nagel is a conventional dualist about the physical and the mental part of the puzzlement here is because of the limitations of imagination : influenced by his princeton colleague , saul kripke , nagel believes that any type identity statement that identifies a physical state type with a mental state type would be , if true , logical truth but kripke argues that one can easily imagine a situation where , for example , one 's c-fibres are stimulated but one is not in pain and so refute any such psychophysical identity from the armchair ) this argument that there will always be an explanatory gap between an identification of a state in mental and physical terms is compounded , nagel argues , by the fact that imagination operates in two distinct ways in his 2012 book mind and cosmos , nagel argues against a materialism view of the emergence of life and consciousness , writing that the standard neo-darwinism view flies in the face of common sense he argues that the principles that account for the emergence of life may be teleological , rather than materialist or mechanistic despite nagel 's being an atheist and not a proponent of intelligent design ( id ) , his book was '' praised by creationists '' , according to the new york times nagel has been highly influential in the related fields of moral and political philosophy supervised by john rawls , nagel has been a long-standing proponent of a kantian and rationalist approach to moral philosophy but it is important to get the justificatory relations right : when a person accepts a moral judgment he or she is necessarily motivated to act nagel contrasts this view with a rival view which believes that a moral agent can only accept that he or she has a reason to act if the desire to carry out the action has an independent justification the most striking claim of the book is that there is a very close parallel between prudential reasoning in one 's own interests and moral reasons to act to further the interests of another person when one reasons prudentially , for example about the future reasons that one will have , one allows the reason in the future to justify one 's current action without reference to the strength of one 's current desires if a hurricane were to destroy someone 's car next year at that point he will want his insurance company to pay him to replace it : that future reason gives him a reason , now , to take out insurance this is the basis of his analogy between prudential actions and moral actions : in cases of altruistic action for another person 's good that person 's reasons quite literally become reasons for one if they are timeless and intrinsic reasons comparable to the views of the nineteenth century moral philosopher henry sidgwick , nagel believes that one needs to conceive of one 's good as an impersonal good and one 's reasons as objective reasons nagel calls this '' dissociation '' and considers it a practical analogue of solipsism ( the philosophical idea that only one 's own mind is sure to exist ) in the case of agent-relative reasons ( the successor to subjective reasons ) specifying the content of the reason makes essential reference back to the agent for whom it is a reason '' by contrast , in the case of agent-neutral reasons ( the successor to objective reasons ) specifying the content of the reason does not make any essential reference back to the person for whom it is a reason the structure of nagel 's later ethical view is that all reasons must be brought into relation to this objective view of oneself nagel has said that '' there are elements which , if added to one 's experience , make life better ; there are other elements which if added to one 's experience , make life worse

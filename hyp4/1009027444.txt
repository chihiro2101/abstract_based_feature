nagel thinks that each person , owing to his or her capacity to reason , instinctively seeks a unified world view however , if this aspiration leads one to believe that there is only one way to understand our intellectual commitments , whether about the external world , knowledge , or what our practical and moral reasons ought to be , this leads one into error like the british philosopher bernard williams , nagel believes that the rise of modern science has permanently changed how people think of the world and our place in it a modern scientific understanding is one way of thinking about the world and our place in it that is more objective than the common sense view it replaces despite what may seem like skepticism about the objective claims of science , nagel does not dispute that science describes the world that exists independently of us his contention , rather , is that a given way of understanding a subject matter should not be regarded as better simply for being more objective he argues that scientific understanding 's attempt at an objective viewpoint -- a '' view from nowhere '' -- necessarily leaves out something essential when applied to the mind , which is inherently from a subjective point of view in '' what is it like to be a bat ? '' and elsewhere , he writes that science can not describe what it is like to be a thinker who conceives of the world from a particular subjective perspective one learns and uses mental concepts by being directly acquainted with one 's own mind , whereas any attempt to think more objectively about mentality would abstract away from this fact being a thinker is to have a subjective perspective on the world ; if one abstracts away from this perspective one leaves out what he sought to explain nagel thinks that philosophers – over-impressed by the paradigm of the kind of objective understanding represented by modern science – tend to produce philosophy of mind that are falsely objectifying in precisely this kind of way they are right to be impressed – modern science really is objective – but are wrong to take modern science to be the only paradigm of objectivity as a philosophical rationalism , nagel believes that a proper understanding of the place of mental properties in nature will involve a revolution in our understanding of both the physical and the mental , and that this is a reasonable prospect that people can anticipate in the near future now , it seems to people that the mental and the physical are irreducibly distinct but that is not a metaphysical insight , or an acknowledgment of an irreducible explanatory gap , but simply where people are at their present stage of understanding nagel 's rationalism and tendency to present our human nature as a composite , structured around our capacity to reason , explains why he thinks that therapeutic or deflationary accounts of philosophy are simply complacent and that radical skepticism is , strictly speaking , irrefutable the therapeutic or deflationary philosopher , influenced by the later philosophy of ludwig wittgenstein , reconciles people to the dependence of our worldview on our '' form of life '' nagel accuses wittgenstein and american philosopher of mind and language donald davidson of philosophical idealism the result 'cuts the world down to size ' and makes what there is dependent on what there can be interpreted to be nagel is probably most widely known within the field of philosophy of mind as an advocate of the idea that consciousness and subjective experience can not , at least with the contemporary understanding of physicalism , be satisfactorily explained using the current concepts of physics he states that '' an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism—something it is like for the organism his critics have objected strongly to what they see as a misguided attempt to argue from a fact about how one represents the world ( trivially , one can only do so from his own point of view ) to a false claim about the world , that it somehow has first personal perspectives built into it on that understanding , nagel is a conventional dualist about the physical and the mental part of the puzzlement here is because of the limitations of imagination : influenced by his princeton colleague , saul kripke , nagel believes that any type identity statement that identifies a physical state type with a mental state type would be , if true , logical truth but kripke argues that one can easily imagine a situation where , for example , one 's c-fibres are stimulated but one is not in pain and so refute any such psychophysical identity from the armchair ) this argument that there will always be an explanatory gap between an identification of a state in mental and physical terms is compounded , nagel argues , by the fact that imagination operates in two distinct ways these two ways of imagining the two terms of the identity statement are so different that there will always seem to be an explanatory gap , whether or not this is the case ( some philosophers of mind have taken these arguments as helpful for physicalism on the grounds that it exposes a limitation that makes the existence of an explanatory gap seem compelling , while others have argued that this makes the case for physicalism even more impossible as it can not be defended even in principle in his 2012 book mind and cosmos , nagel argues against a materialism view of the emergence of life and consciousness , writing that the standard neo-darwinism view flies in the face of common sense supervised by john rawls , nagel has been a long-standing proponent of a kantian and rationalist approach to moral philosophy that book seeks by reflection on the nature of practical reasoning to uncover the formal principles that underlie reason in practice and the related general beliefs about the self that are necessary for those principles to be truly applicable to us nagel defends motivated desire theory about the motivation of moral action according to motivated desire theory , when a person is motivated to moral action it is indeed true that such actions are motivated – like all intentional actions – by a belief and a desire when one reasons prudentially , for example about the future reasons that one will have , one allows the reason in the future to justify one 's current action without reference to the strength of one 's current desires if a hurricane were to destroy someone 's car next year at that point he will want his insurance company to pay him to replace it : that future reason gives him a reason , now , to take out insurance comparable to the views of the nineteenth century moral philosopher henry sidgwick , nagel believes that one needs to conceive of one 's good as an impersonal good and one 's reasons as objective reasons in this case the false view is that one 's reasons are irreducibly his , in a way that does not allow them to be reasons for anyone : nagel argues this commits such a person to the view that he or she can not make the same judgments about her own reasons third-personally that she can make first-personally subjective and objective reasons '' by contrast , in the case of agent-neutral reasons ( the successor to objective reasons ) specifying the content of the reason does not make any essential reference back to the person for whom it is a reason , agent-relative and agent-neutral ) emphasized in nagel 's later work are situated within a sidgwickian model in which one 's moral commitments are thought of objectively , such that one 's personal reasons and values are simply incomplete parts of an impersonal whole those reasons and values that withstand detached critical scrutiny are objective , but more subjective reasons and values can nevertheless be objectively tolerated thinking reflectively about ethics from this standpoint , one must take every other agent 's standpoint on value as seriously as one 's own , since one 's own perspective is just a subjective take on an inter-subjective whole ; one 's personal set of reasons is thus swamped by the objective reasons of all others but nagel remains an individualist who believes in the separateness of persons so his task is to explain why this objective viewpoint does not swallow up the individual standpoint of each of us nagel has said that '' there are elements which , if added to one 's experience , make life better ; there are other elements which if added to one 's experience , make life worse

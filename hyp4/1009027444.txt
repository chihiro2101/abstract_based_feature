nagel thinks that each person , owing to his or her capacity to reason , instinctively seeks a unified world view however , if this aspiration leads one to believe that there is only one way to understand our intellectual commitments , whether about the external world , knowledge , or what our practical and moral reasons ought to be , this leads one into error like the british philosopher bernard williams , nagel believes that the rise of modern science has permanently changed how people think of the world and our place in it a modern scientific understanding is one way of thinking about the world and our place in it that is more objective than the common sense view it replaces understanding this bleached out view of the world draws on our capacities as purely rational thinkers and fails to account for the specific nature of our perceptual sensibility he argues that scientific understanding 's attempt at an objective viewpoint -- a '' view from nowhere '' -- necessarily leaves out something essential when applied to the mind , which is inherently from a subjective point of view as such , objective science is fundamentally unable to help people fully understand themselves in '' what is it like to be a bat ? '' and elsewhere , he writes that science can not describe what it is like to be a thinker who conceives of the world from a particular subjective perspective nagel argues that some phenomena are not best grasped from a more objective perspective one learns and uses mental concepts by being directly acquainted with one 's own mind , whereas any attempt to think more objectively about mentality would abstract away from this fact being a thinker is to have a subjective perspective on the world ; if one abstracts away from this perspective one leaves out what he sought to explain nagel thinks that philosophers – over-impressed by the paradigm of the kind of objective understanding represented by modern science – tend to produce philosophy of mind that are falsely objectifying in precisely this kind of way the kind of understanding that science represents does not transfer to everything that people would like to understand as a philosophical rationalism , nagel believes that a proper understanding of the place of mental properties in nature will involve a revolution in our understanding of both the physical and the mental , and that this is a reasonable prospect that people can anticipate in the near future a plausible science of the mind will give an account of the stuff that underpins mental and physical properties in such a way that people will simply be able to see that it necessitates both of these aspects nagel 's rationalism and tendency to present our human nature as a composite , structured around our capacity to reason , explains why he thinks that therapeutic or deflationary accounts of philosophy are simply complacent and that radical skepticism is , strictly speaking , irrefutable nagel is probably most widely known within the field of philosophy of mind as an advocate of the idea that consciousness and subjective experience can not , at least with the contemporary understanding of physicalism , be satisfactorily explained using the current concepts of physics this position was primarily discussed by nagel in one of his most famous articles : '' what is it like to be a bat ? '' ( 1974 ) the article 's title question , though often attributed to nagel , was originally asked by timothy sprigge rosenthal ) , and philosophy of mind : classical and contemporary readings ( edited by david j in '' what is it like to be a bat ? '' , nagel argues that consciousness has essential to it a subjective character , a what it is like aspect his critics have objected strongly to what they see as a misguided attempt to argue from a fact about how one represents the world ( trivially , one can only do so from his own point of view ) to a false claim about the world , that it somehow has first personal perspectives built into it this is , however , a misunderstanding : nagel 's point is that there is a constraint on what it is to possess the concept of a mental state , namely , that one be directly acquainted with it these two ways of imagining the two terms of the identity statement are so different that there will always seem to be an explanatory gap , whether or not this is the case ) nagel is not a physicalist because he does not believe that an internal understanding of mental concepts shows them to have the kind of hidden essence that underpins a scientific identity in , say , chemistry nagel has argued that id should not be rejected as non-scientific , for instance writing in 2008 that '' id is very different from creation science , '' and that the debate about id '' is clearly a scientific disagreement , not a disagreement between science and something else '' nagel does not accept meyer 's conclusions but he endorsed meyer 's approach , and argued in mind and cosmos that meyer and other id proponents , david berlinski and michael behe , '' do not deserve the scorn with which they are commonly met supervised by john rawls , nagel has been a long-standing proponent of a kantian and rationalist approach to moral philosophy nagel defends motivated desire theory about the motivation of moral action according to motivated desire theory , when a person is motivated to moral action it is indeed true that such actions are motivated – like all intentional actions – by a belief and a desire nagel contrasts this view with a rival view which believes that a moral agent can only accept that he or she has a reason to act if the desire to carry out the action has an independent justification the most striking claim of the book is that there is a very close parallel between prudential reasoning in one 's own interests and moral reasons to act to further the interests of another person when one reasons prudentially , for example about the future reasons that one will have , one allows the reason in the future to justify one 's current action without reference to the strength of one 's current desires this is the basis of his analogy between prudential actions and moral actions : in cases of altruistic action for another person 's good that person 's reasons quite literally become reasons for one if they are timeless and intrinsic reasons comparable to the views of the nineteenth century moral philosopher henry sidgwick , nagel believes that one needs to conceive of one 's good as an impersonal good and one 's reasons as objective reasons in this case the false view is that one 's reasons are irreducibly his , in a way that does not allow them to be reasons for anyone : nagel argues this commits such a person to the view that he or she can not make the same judgments about her own reasons third-personally that she can make first-personally earlier , in the possibility of altruism , he took the stance that if one 's reasons really are about intrinsic and timeless values then , qua subjective reason , one can only take them to be the guise of the reasons that there really are – the objective ones in later discussions , nagel treats his former view as an incomplete attempt to convey the fact that there are distinct classes of reasons and values , and speaks instead of '' agent-relative '' and '' agent-neutral '' reasons an example of this might be : '' anyone has a reason to promote the good of parenthood , agent-relative and agent-neutral ) emphasized in nagel 's later work are situated within a sidgwickian model in which one 's moral commitments are thought of objectively , such that one 's personal reasons and values are simply incomplete parts of an impersonal whole the structure of nagel 's later ethical view is that all reasons must be brought into relation to this objective view of oneself those reasons and values that withstand detached critical scrutiny are objective , but more subjective reasons and values can nevertheless be objectively tolerated american philosophy list of american philosophers david chalmers frank jackson galen strawson hard problem of consciousness knowledge argument

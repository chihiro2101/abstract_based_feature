at the same time , lawrence 's recent invention , the cyclotron , promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics , and chadwick felt that the cavendish laboratory would fall behind unless it also acquired one he therefore chafed under rutherford , who clung to the belief that good nuclear physics could still be done without large , expensive equipment , and turned down the request for a cyclotron chadwick was himself a critic of big science in general , and lawrence in particular , whose approach he considered careless and focused on technology at the expense of science when lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of limitless energy at the solvay conference in 1933 , chadwick responded that the results were more likely attributable to contamination of the equipment while lawrence rechecked his results at berkeley only to find that chadwick was correct , rutherford and oliphant conducted an investigation at the cavendish that found that deuterium fuses to form helium-3 , thereby causing the effect that the lawrence had observed in march 1935 , chadwick received an offer of the lyon jones chair of physics at the university of liverpool , in his wife 's home town , to succeed lionel wilberforce the laboratory was so antiquated that it still ran on direct current electricity , but chadwick seized the opportunity , assuming the chair on 1 october 1935 chadwick set about acquiring a cyclotron for liverpool the total cost of £5,184 was more than chadwick had received from the university and the royal society , so chadwick paid the rest from his ( £8,243 ) nobel prize money in germany , otto hahn and fritz strassmann bombarded uranium with neutrons , and noted that barium , a lighter element , was among the products produced french scientists , pierre joliot , hans von halban and lew kowarski , soon verified that more than one neutron was indeed emitted per fission in a paper co-authored with the american physicist john wheeler , bohr theorised that fission was more likely to occur in the uranium-235 isotope , which made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium chadwick did not believe that there was any likelihood of another war with germany in 1939 , and took his family for a holiday on a remote lake in northern sweden when he reached liverpool , chadwick found joseph rotblat , a polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron , was now destitute , as he was cut off from funds from poland chadwick promptly hired rotblat as a lecturer , despite his poor grasp of english in october 1939 , chadwick received a letter from sir edward appleton , the secretary of the department of scientific and industrial research , asking for his opinion on the feasibility of an atomic bomb chadwick decided to investigate the properties of uranium oxide further with rotblat pegram and harold urey visited britain to see how the project , now known as tube alloys , was going , chadwick was able to tell them : '' i wish i could tell you that the bomb is not going to work , but i am 90 per cent sure that it will at the same time that the british became convinced that a joint project was necessary , the progress of the american manhattan project was such that british cooperation seemed less essential , although the americans were still eager to utilise chadwick 's talents he became the only man apart from groves and his second in command to have access to all the american research and production facilities for the uranium bomb chadwick accepted that the americans did not need british help , but that it could still be useful in bringing the project to an early and successful conclusion the chadwick laboratory at the university of liverpool is named after him , as is its sir james chadwick chair of experimental physics , which was named after him in 1991 as part of celebrations of the centenary of his birth the james chadwick building , which houses part of the school of chemical engineering and analytical sciences , university of manchester is named in his honour

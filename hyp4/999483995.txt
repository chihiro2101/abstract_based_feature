at the same time , lawrence 's recent invention , the cyclotron , promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics , and chadwick felt that the cavendish laboratory would fall behind unless it also acquired one he therefore chafed under rutherford , who clung to the belief that good nuclear physics could still be done without large , expensive equipment , and turned down the request for a cyclotron chadwick was himself a critic of big science in general , and lawrence in particular , whose approach he considered careless and focused on technology at the expense of science when lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of limitless energy at the solvay conference in 1933 , chadwick responded that the results were more likely attributable to contamination of the equipment this was another major discovery , but the oliphant-rutherford particle accelerator was an expensive state-of-the-art piece of equipment in march 1935 , chadwick received an offer of the lyon jones chair of physics at the university of liverpool , in his wife 's home town , to succeed lionel wilberforce the laboratory was so antiquated that it still ran on direct current electricity , but chadwick seized the opportunity , assuming the chair on 1 october 1935 the university 's prestige was soon bolstered by chadwick 's nobel prize , which was announced in november 1935 he started by spending £700 to refurbish the antiquated laboratories at liverpool , so some components could be made in-house to build his cyclotron , chadwick brought in two young experts , bernard kinsey and harold walke , who had worked with lawrence at the university of california the total cost of £5,184 was more than chadwick had received from the university and the royal society , so chadwick paid the rest from his ( £8,243 ) nobel prize money chadwick anticipated that neutrons and radioactive isotopes produced with the 37-inch cyclotron could be used to study biochemical processes , and might become a weapon in the fight against cancer they calculated that this would result in the release of about 200 mev , implying an energy release orders of magnitude greater than chemical reactions , and frisch confirmed their theory experimentally french scientists , pierre joliot , hans von halban and lew kowarski , soon verified that more than one neutron was indeed emitted per fission determined not to spend another war in an internment camp , chadwick made his way to stockholm as fast as he could , but when he arrived there with his family , he found that all air traffic between stockholm and london had been suspended he did not dismiss the possibility , but carefully went over the many theoretical and practical difficulties involved while other teams investigated uranium enrichment techniques , chadwick 's team at liverpool concentrated on determining the nuclear cross section of uranium-235 by april 1941 , it had been experimentally confirmed that the critical mass of uranium-235 might be or less '' so worried that he could not sleep , chadwick resorted to sleeping pills , which he continued to take for most of his remaining years leaving rotblat in charge in liverpool , chadwick began a tour of the manhattan project facilities in november 1943 , except for the hanford site where plutonium was produced , which he was not allowed to see inside its pit was a polonium-beryllium modulated neutron initiator , a development of the technique that chadwick had used to discover the neutron over a decade before he was also appointed as the british scientific advisor to the united nations atomic energy commission the chadwick laboratory at the university of liverpool is named after him , as is its sir james chadwick chair of experimental physics , which was named after him in 1991 as part of celebrations of the centenary of his birth

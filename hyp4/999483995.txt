at the same time , lawrence 's recent invention , the cyclotron , promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics , and chadwick felt that the cavendish laboratory would fall behind unless it also acquired one he therefore chafed under rutherford , who clung to the belief that good nuclear physics could still be done without large , expensive equipment , and turned down the request for a cyclotron when lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of limitless energy at the solvay conference in 1933 , chadwick responded that the results were more likely attributable to contamination of the equipment this was another major discovery , but the oliphant-rutherford particle accelerator was an expensive state-of-the-art piece of equipment in march 1935 , chadwick received an offer of the lyon jones chair of physics at the university of liverpool , in his wife 's home town , to succeed lionel wilberforce he was able to persuade the university to provide £2,000 and obtained a grant for another £2,000 from the royal society to build his cyclotron , chadwick brought in two young experts , bernard kinsey and harold walke , who had worked with lawrence at the university of california the total cost of £5,184 was more than chadwick had received from the university and the royal society , so chadwick paid the rest from his ( £8,243 ) nobel prize money chadwick was automatically a committee member of both faculties , and in 1938 he was appointed to a commission headed by lord derby to investigate the arrangements for cancer treatment in liverpool chadwick anticipated that neutrons and radioactive isotopes produced with the 37-inch cyclotron could be used to study biochemical processes , and might become a weapon in the fight against cancer in january 1939 , meitner and her nephew otto frisch astounded the physics community with a paper that explained this result they theorised that uranium atoms bombarded with neutrons can break into two roughly equal fragments , a process they called fission it was soon noted by hahn that if neutrons were released during fission , then a chain reaction was possible french scientists , pierre joliot , hans von halban and lew kowarski , soon verified that more than one neutron was indeed emitted per fission determined not to spend another war in an internment camp , chadwick made his way to stockholm as fast as he could , but when he arrived there with his family , he found that all air traffic between stockholm and london had been suspended in october 1939 , chadwick received a letter from sir edward appleton , the secretary of the department of scientific and industrial research , asking for his opinion on the feasibility of an atomic bomb in march 1940 , otto frisch and rudolf peierls at the university of birmingham re-examined the theoretical issues involved in a paper that became known as the frisch–peierls memorandum sir hermann bondi suggested that it was fortunate that chadwick , not rutherford , was the doyen of uk physics at the time , as the latter 's prestige might otherwise have overpowered chadwick 's interest in '' looking forward '' to the bomb 's prospects the quebec agreement established a new combined policy committee to direct the joint project the americans disliked akers , so chadwick was appointed technical advisor to the combined policy committee , and the head of the british mission '' this was the only plant to which chadwick had been denied access in wartime , and now he asked groves if he could accompany portal inside its pit was a polonium-beryllium modulated neutron initiator , a development of the technique that chadwick had used to discover the neutron over a decade before the chadwick laboratory at the university of liverpool is named after him , as is its sir james chadwick chair of experimental physics , which was named after him in 1991 as part of celebrations of the centenary of his birth

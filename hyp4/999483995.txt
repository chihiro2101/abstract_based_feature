at the same time , lawrence 's recent invention , the cyclotron , promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics , and chadwick felt that the cavendish laboratory would fall behind unless it also acquired one he therefore chafed under rutherford , who clung to the belief that good nuclear physics could still be done without large , expensive equipment , and turned down the request for a cyclotron chadwick was himself a critic of big science in general , and lawrence in particular , whose approach he considered careless and focused on technology at the expense of science when lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of limitless energy at the solvay conference in 1933 , chadwick responded that the results were more likely attributable to contamination of the equipment while lawrence rechecked his results at berkeley only to find that chadwick was correct , rutherford and oliphant conducted an investigation at the cavendish that found that deuterium fuses to form helium-3 , thereby causing the effect that the lawrence had observed in march 1935 , chadwick received an offer of the lyon jones chair of physics at the university of liverpool , in his wife 's home town , to succeed lionel wilberforce the university 's prestige was soon bolstered by chadwick 's nobel prize , which was announced in november 1935 the total cost of £5,184 was more than chadwick had received from the university and the royal society , so chadwick paid the rest from his ( £8,243 ) nobel prize money chadwick was automatically a committee member of both faculties , and in 1938 he was appointed to a commission headed by lord derby to investigate the arrangements for cancer treatment in liverpool french scientists , pierre joliot , hans von halban and lew kowarski , soon verified that more than one neutron was indeed emitted per fission in a paper co-authored with the american physicist john wheeler , bohr theorised that fission was more likely to occur in the uranium-235 isotope , which made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium determined not to spend another war in an internment camp , chadwick made his way to stockholm as fast as he could , but when he arrived there with his family , he found that all air traffic between stockholm and london had been suspended when he reached liverpool , chadwick found joseph rotblat , a polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron , was now destitute , as he was cut off from funds from poland in october 1939 , chadwick received a letter from sir edward appleton , the secretary of the department of scientific and industrial research , asking for his opinion on the feasibility of an atomic bomb chadwick decided to investigate the properties of uranium oxide further with rotblat pegram and harold urey visited britain to see how the project , now known as tube alloys , was going , chadwick was able to tell them : '' i wish i could tell you that the bomb is not going to work , but i am 90 per cent sure that it will '' in a recent book about the bomb project , graham farmelo wrote that '' chadwick did more than any other scientist to give churchill the bomb '' so worried that he could not sleep , chadwick resorted to sleeping pills , which he continued to take for most of his remaining years chadwick was reluctant to move tube alloys there , believing that the united kingdom was a better location for the isotope separation plant chadwick , oliphant , peierls and simon were summoned to the united states by the director of tube alloys , sir wallace akers , to work with the manhattan project leaving rotblat in charge in liverpool , chadwick began a tour of the manhattan project facilities in november 1943 , except for the hanford site where plutonium was produced , which he was not allowed to see he was also appointed as the british scientific advisor to the united nations atomic energy commission the chadwick laboratory at the university of liverpool is named after him , as is its sir james chadwick chair of experimental physics , which was named after him in 1991 as part of celebrations of the centenary of his birth

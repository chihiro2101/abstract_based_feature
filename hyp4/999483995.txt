at the same time , lawrence 's recent invention , the cyclotron , promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics , and chadwick felt that the cavendish laboratory would fall behind unless it also acquired one he therefore chafed under rutherford , who clung to the belief that good nuclear physics could still be done without large , expensive equipment , and turned down the request for a cyclotron when lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of limitless energy at the solvay conference in 1933 , chadwick responded that the results were more likely attributable to contamination of the equipment the university 's prestige was soon bolstered by chadwick 's nobel prize , which was announced in november 1935 to build his cyclotron , chadwick brought in two young experts , bernard kinsey and harold walke , who had worked with lawrence at the university of california the total cost of £5,184 was more than chadwick had received from the university and the royal society , so chadwick paid the rest from his ( £8,243 ) nobel prize money chadwick was automatically a committee member of both faculties , and in 1938 he was appointed to a commission headed by lord derby to investigate the arrangements for cancer treatment in liverpool chadwick anticipated that neutrons and radioactive isotopes produced with the 37-inch cyclotron could be used to study biochemical processes , and might become a weapon in the fight against cancer in germany , otto hahn and fritz strassmann bombarded uranium with neutrons , and noted that barium , a lighter element , was among the products produced when he reached liverpool , chadwick found joseph rotblat , a polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron , was now destitute , as he was cut off from funds from poland in october 1939 , chadwick received a letter from sir edward appleton , the secretary of the department of scientific and industrial research , asking for his opinion on the feasibility of an atomic bomb in march 1940 , otto frisch and rudolf peierls at the university of birmingham re-examined the theoretical issues involved in a paper that became known as the frisch–peierls memorandum instead of looking at unenriched uranium oxide , they considered what would happen to a sphere of pure uranium-235 , and found that not only could a chain reaction occur , but that it might require as little as of uranium-235 , and unleash the energy of tons of dynamite a special subcommittee of the committee for the scientific survey of air warfare ( cssaw ) , known as the maud committee , was created to investigate the matter further it was chaired by sir george thomson and its original membership included chadwick , along with mark oliphant , john cockcroft and philip moon '' in a recent book about the bomb project , graham farmelo wrote that '' chadwick did more than any other scientist to give churchill the bomb chadwick was reluctant to move tube alloys there , believing that the united kingdom was a better location for the isotope separation plant at the same time that the british became convinced that a joint project was necessary , the progress of the american manhattan project was such that british cooperation seemed less essential , although the americans were still eager to utilise chadwick 's talents leaving rotblat in charge in liverpool , chadwick began a tour of the manhattan project facilities in november 1943 , except for the hanford site where plutonium was produced , which he was not allowed to see he became the only man apart from groves and his second in command to have access to all the american research and production facilities for the uranium bomb chadwick accepted that the americans did not need british help , but that it could still be useful in bringing the project to an early and successful conclusion the chadwick laboratory at the university of liverpool is named after him , as is its sir james chadwick chair of experimental physics , which was named after him in 1991 as part of celebrations of the centenary of his birth the james chadwick building , which houses part of the school of chemical engineering and analytical sciences , university of manchester is named in his honour

at the same time , lawrence 's recent invention , the cyclotron , promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics , and chadwick felt that the cavendish laboratory would fall behind unless it also acquired one he therefore chafed under rutherford , who clung to the belief that good nuclear physics could still be done without large , expensive equipment , and turned down the request for a cyclotron chadwick was himself a critic of big science in general , and lawrence in particular , whose approach he considered careless and focused on technology at the expense of science when lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of limitless energy at the solvay conference in 1933 , chadwick responded that the results were more likely attributable to contamination of the equipment this was another major discovery , but the oliphant-rutherford particle accelerator was an expensive state-of-the-art piece of equipment in march 1935 , chadwick received an offer of the lyon jones chair of physics at the university of liverpool , in his wife 's home town , to succeed lionel wilberforce the university 's prestige was soon bolstered by chadwick 's nobel prize , which was announced in november 1935 he started by spending £700 to refurbish the antiquated laboratories at liverpool , so some components could be made in-house the total cost of £5,184 was more than chadwick had received from the university and the royal society , so chadwick paid the rest from his ( £8,243 ) nobel prize money chadwick anticipated that neutrons and radioactive isotopes produced with the 37-inch cyclotron could be used to study biochemical processes , and might become a weapon in the fight against cancer they theorised that uranium atoms bombarded with neutrons can break into two roughly equal fragments , a process they called fission it was soon noted by hahn that if neutrons were released during fission , then a chain reaction was possible chadwick did not believe that there was any likelihood of another war with germany in 1939 , and took his family for a holiday on a remote lake in northern sweden determined not to spend another war in an internment camp , chadwick made his way to stockholm as fast as he could , but when he arrived there with his family , he found that all air traffic between stockholm and london had been suspended when he reached liverpool , chadwick found joseph rotblat , a polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron , was now destitute , as he was cut off from funds from poland instead of looking at unenriched uranium oxide , they considered what would happen to a sphere of pure uranium-235 , and found that not only could a chain reaction occur , but that it might require as little as of uranium-235 , and unleash the energy of tons of dynamite a special subcommittee of the committee for the scientific survey of air warfare ( cssaw ) , known as the maud committee , was created to investigate the matter further while other teams investigated uranium enrichment techniques , chadwick 's team at liverpool concentrated on determining the nuclear cross section of uranium-235 pegram and harold urey visited britain to see how the project , now known as tube alloys , was going , chadwick was able to tell them : '' i wish i could tell you that the bomb is not going to work , but i am 90 per cent sure that it will sir hermann bondi suggested that it was fortunate that chadwick , not rutherford , was the doyen of uk physics at the time , as the latter 's prestige might otherwise have overpowered chadwick 's interest in '' looking forward '' to the bomb 's prospects '' for his efforts , chadwick received a knighthood in the 1945 new year honours inside its pit was a polonium-beryllium modulated neutron initiator , a development of the technique that chadwick had used to discover the neutron over a decade before the chadwick laboratory at the university of liverpool is named after him , as is its sir james chadwick chair of experimental physics , which was named after him in 1991 as part of celebrations of the centenary of his birth

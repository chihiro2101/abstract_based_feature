by 1973 , blackmore had steered deep purple through a significant personnel change , with ian gillan and roger glover being replaced by david coverdale and glenn hughes however , the new members were keen to add musical styles and blackmore found his request to record the fat mattress-penned '' black sheep of the family '' with '' sixteenth century greensleeves '' turned down by the band he decided to record the song with dio instead , using dio 's band elf as musicians he enjoyed the results , and a full album , billed as ritchie blackmore 's rainbow , was recorded between february and march 1975 at musicland studios in munich , germany rainbow 's music was partly inspired by classical music since blackmore started playing cello to help him construct interesting chord progressions , and dio wrote lyrics about medieval themes '' although dio never played a musical instrument on any rainbow album , he is credited with writing and arranging the music with blackmore , in addition to writing all the lyrics blackmore and dio also found a common ground in their sense of humour ritchie blackmore is the one who gave me my opportunity to show what i was worth blackmore was unhappy about carrying the elf line-up along for live performances , and so he fired everybody except dio shortly after the album was recorded , due to driscoll 's style of drumming and the funky bass playing of gruber blackmore would continue to dictate personnel for the remainder of the band 's lifetime , with drummer and former bandmate ricky munro remarking '' he was very difficult to get on with because you never knew when he would turn around and say 'you 're sacked ' '' blackmore recruited bassist jimmy bain , american keyboard player tony carey and drummer cozy powell , who had previously worked with jeff beck and had some solo success powell also greatly appealed to blackmore in their mutual fondness for practical jokes this line-up also commenced the first world tour for the band , with the first date in montreal on 10 november 1975 the centrepiece of the band 's live performance was a computer-controlled rainbow including 3,000 lightbulbs , which stretched 40 feet across the stage the band added deep purple 's '' mistreated '' to their setlist , and song lengths were stretched to include improvisation in august 1976 , following a gig at newcastle city hall , blackmore decided to fire carey , believing his playing style to be too complicated for the band after the release and extensive world tour in 1977â€“78 , blackmore decided that he wanted to take the band in a new commercial direction away from the '' sword and sorcery '' theme in a 1979 interview with sounds , sounds , 15 december 1979 blackmore said : '' if they were good enough , they 'd still be in the band he was bitching about the fact that it was ritchie blackmore 's rainbow and i 'm going , look , i 've tried after three years to make it just rainbow , not my rainbow the first album from the new line-up , down to earth , featured the band 's first major singles chart successes , '' all night long '' and the russ ballard-penned '' since you been gone '' in 1980 , the band headlined the inaugural monsters of rock festival at castle donington in england however , this was powell 's last rainbow gig : he had already given his notice to quit , disliking blackmore 's increasingly pop rock direction for the next album , bonnet and powell were replaced by americans joe lynn turner and bobby rondinelli , respectively in 1988 , after joining the band impelliteri , graham bonnet covered '' since you been gone '' on the group 's debut album , stand in line '' however , blackmore said that they had no plans for a new album or world tour , and that the reunion was '' just a few dates for fun however , the final track , '' waiting for a sign '' , is a studio track recorded with the current band lineup , and marked rainbow 's first song in 23 years

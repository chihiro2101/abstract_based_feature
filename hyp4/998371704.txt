stradivari made his instruments using an inner form , unlike the french copyists , such as vuillaume , who employed an outer form there has been conjecture that the wood used may have been treated with several types of minerals , both before and after construction of a violin scientists at national taiwan university have detected trace amounts of aluminum , copper , and calcium in wood from stradivari violins as well , the violin makers applied varnishes to their instruments simone fernando sacconi suggested that vernice bianca , an egg tempera varnish composed of gum arabic , honey , and egg white , may have been used more recently , french chemist jean-philippe echard and his co-workers have studied varnishes on stradivarius violins a lower layer of varnish is found within the topmost wood cells while an upper rests upon the wood these results suggest that differences in density differentials in the material may have played a significant role in the sound production of classical violins a stradivarius made in the 1680s , or during stradivari 's '' long pattern '' period from 1690 to 1700 , could be worth hundreds of thousands to several million u.s stolen instruments are often recovered , however , even after being missing for many years the lipinski stradivarius was stolen in an armed robbery on 27 january 2014 and subsequently recovered the ames stradivarius was stolen in 1981 and recovered in 2015 to the present ( as of 2014 ) have never found any difference in sound between stradivari 's violins and high-quality violins in comparable style of other makers and periods , nor has acoustic analysis in a test in 2009 , the british violinist matthew trusler played his 1711 stradivarius , said to be worth two million u.s according to this analysis , treatment improves the sound radiation ratio to the level of cold-climate wood considered to have superior resonance further evidence for this '' little ice age theory '' comes from a simple examination of the dense growth rings in the wood used in stradivari 's instruments croatian wood was traded by venetian merchants of the era , and is still used today by local luthiers and craftsfolk for musical instruments joseph nagyvary reveals that he has always held the belief that there are a wide range of chemicals that will improve the violin 's sound these recordings , known as the '' stradivarius sound bank '' , will be part of a permanent collection at the museo del violino that will allow future generations to hear stradivarius instruments chladni patterns for visualizing violin plate resonance patterns stradivari violin forms a detailed study of stradivari 's molds and drawings kept in the cremona museum

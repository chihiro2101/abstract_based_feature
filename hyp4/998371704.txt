stradivari made his instruments using an inner form , unlike the french copyists , such as vuillaume , who employed an outer form it is clear from the number of forms throughout his career that he experimented with some of the dimensions of his instruments there has been conjecture that the wood used may have been treated with several types of minerals , both before and after construction of a violin scientists at national taiwan university have detected trace amounts of aluminum , copper , and calcium in wood from stradivari violins more recently , french chemist jean-philippe echard and his co-workers have studied varnishes on stradivarius violins a lower layer of varnish is found within the topmost wood cells while an upper rests upon the wood these results suggest that differences in density differentials in the material may have played a significant role in the sound production of classical violins a stradivarius made in the 1680s , or during stradivari 's '' long pattern '' period from 1690 to 1700 , could be worth hundreds of thousands to several million u.s depending on condition , instruments made during stradivari 's '' golden period '' from 1700 to about 1725 can be worth millions of dollars stradivarius instruments are at risk of theft stolen instruments are often recovered , however , even after being missing for many years in a test in 2009 , the british violinist matthew trusler played his 1711 stradivarius , said to be worth two million u.s analysis of the treated wood revealed a reduction in density , accompanied by relatively little change in the speed of sound while many world-class soloists play violins by antonio stradivari , there are notable exceptions he states that the listener can not tell that his instrument is modern , and he regards it as excellent for bach and better than a stradivarius for '' the big romantic and 20th-century concertos further evidence for this '' little ice age theory '' comes from a simple examination of the dense growth rings in the wood used in stradivari 's instruments the presence of a stradivarius label does not confirm that the instrument is a genuine work of stradivari these recordings , known as the '' stradivarius sound bank '' , will be part of a permanent collection at the museo del violino that will allow future generations to hear stradivarius instruments how stradivari and guarneri got their music discusses the chemical techniques used to figure out what makes these instruments ' unique sound '' the violins of stradivarius '' by the hill family on the amati website

he became a monk at st albans , where he appears to have passed the whole of his monastic life , excepting a period from 1394 to 1396 during which he was prior of wymondham abbey , norfolk , england , another benedictine house at st albans he was in charge of the scriptorium , or writing room , and he died about 1422 walsingham is stated by bale and pits to have been a native of norfolk from an early period he was connected with the abbey of st albans abbey at st albans , hertfordshire , and was doubtless at school there an inconclusive passage in his historia anglicana has been taken as evidence that he was educated at oxford albans , however , maintained particularly close relations with oxford , sending its novices to be trained at st according to the register it was under thomas de la mare , who was abbot from 1350 to 1396 , that he held these offices his historia anglicana , indeed , is carried down to 1422 , though it remains a matter of controversy whether the latter portion is from his pen pits speaks of walsingham 's office of ‘ scriptorarius ’ at st this king , according to bale and pits , was henry vi , for both of them assert that walsingham flourished a.d bale makes his case worse by adding that walsingham was the author of a work styled acta henrici sexti if the ‘ chronica majora ’ was written , as must be supposed , at the latest not long after 1380 , walsingham must have been of exceptional age for that period in 1440 the acta regis henrici sexti is therefore probably apocryphal , and bale and pits have post-dated walsingham albans , walsingham compiled the gesta abbatum , a history of the abbots of st as in his other works , walsingham took the early part of the history from the writings of previous chroniclers , particularly of matthew paris , the great st riley comes to the conclusion that only of the portion extending from 1377 to 1392 is walsingham the author it begins in 1342 and ends at 1417 , and contains a note referring to the polychronicon , the name by which the historia anglicana is sometimes known albans , the abbey being besieged , many of its court rolls and other muniments burnt , and charters of manumission extorted john 's college , oxford , as attributed to thomas walsingham a modern edition of walsingham 's chronica maiora in : david preest , the chronica maiora of thomas walsingham 1376-1422 , with introduction and notes by james g

definitions of the term '' machine vision '' vary , but all include the technology and methods used to extract information from an image on an automated basis , as opposed to image processing , where the output is another image the information can be used for such applications as automatic inspection and robot and process guidance in industry , for security monitoring and vehicle guidance this field encompasses a large number of technologies , software and hardware products , integrated systems , actions , methods and expertise machine vision is practically the only term used for these functions in industrial automation applications ; the term is less universal for these functions in other environments such as security and vehicle guidance machine vision as a systems engineering discipline can be considered distinct from computer vision , a form of basic computer science ; machine vision attempts to integrate existing technologies in new ways and apply them to solve real world problems in a way that meets the requirements of industrial automation and similar application areas this broader definition also encompasses products and applications most often associated with image processing the primary uses for machine vision are automatic inspection and industrial robot/process guidance the primary uses for machine vision are imaging-based automatic inspection and sorting and robot guidance the overall process includes planning the details of the requirements and project , and then creating a solution the first step in the automatic inspection sequence of operation is digital imaging , typically using cameras , lenses , and lighting that has been designed to provide the differentiation required by subsequent processing the components of an automatic inspection system usually include lighting , a camera or other imager , a processor , software , and output devices july 2019 issue pages 60-64 when separated , the connection may be made to specialized intermediate hardware , a custom processing appliance , or a frame grabber within a computer using either an analog or standardized digital interface ( camera link , coaxpress ) finding the optimal hardware for deep learining inference in machine vision by mike fussell vision systems design magazine september 2019 issue pages 8-9 multiple stages of processing are generally used in a sequence that ends up as a desired result west , perry a roadmap for building a machine vision system pages 1-35 this also includes user interfaces , interfaces for the integration of multi-component systems and automated data interchange the overall process includes planning the details of the requirements and project , and then creating a solution

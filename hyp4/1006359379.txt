definitions of the term '' machine vision '' vary , but all include the technology and methods used to extract information from an image on an automated basis , as opposed to image processing , where the output is another image the information extracted can be a simple good-part/bad-part signal , or more a complex set of data such as the identity , position and orientation of each object in an image the information can be used for such applications as automatic inspection and robot and process guidance in industry , for security monitoring and vehicle guidance this field encompasses a large number of technologies , software and hardware products , integrated systems , actions , methods and expertise machine vision is practically the only term used for these functions in industrial automation applications ; the term is less universal for these functions in other environments such as security and vehicle guidance machine vision as a systems engineering discipline can be considered distinct from computer vision , a form of basic computer science ; machine vision attempts to integrate existing technologies in new ways and apply them to solve real world problems in a way that meets the requirements of industrial automation and similar application areas this broader definition also encompasses products and applications most often associated with image processing the primary uses for machine vision are automatic inspection and industrial robot/process guidance the primary uses for machine vision are imaging-based automatic inspection and sorting and robot guidance the first step in the automatic inspection sequence of operation is digital imaging , typically using cameras , lenses , and lighting that has been designed to provide the differentiation required by subsequent processing mv software packages and programs developed in them then employ various digital image processing techniques to extract the required information , and often make decisions ( such as pass/fail ) based on the extracted information the components of an automatic inspection system usually include lighting , a camera or other imager , a processor , software , and output devices while conventional ( 2d visible light ) imaging is most commonly used in mv , alternatives include multispectral image , hyperspectral imaging , imaging various infrared bands , line scan imaging , 3d imaging of surfaces and x-ray imaging the most commonly used method for 3d imaging is scanning based triangulation which utilizes motion of the product or image during the imaging process west , perry a roadmap for building a machine vision system pages 1-35 this also includes user interfaces , interfaces for the integration of multi-component systems and automated data interchange

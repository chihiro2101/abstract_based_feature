definitions of the term '' machine vision '' vary , but all include the technology and methods used to extract information from an image on an automated basis , as opposed to image processing , where the output is another image the information extracted can be a simple good-part/bad-part signal , or more a complex set of data such as the identity , position and orientation of each object in an image the information can be used for such applications as automatic inspection and robot and process guidance in industry , for security monitoring and vehicle guidance machine vision is practically the only term used for these functions in industrial automation applications ; the term is less universal for these functions in other environments such as security and vehicle guidance the term is also used in a broader sense by trade shows and trade groups such as the automated imaging association and the european machine vision association this broader definition also encompasses products and applications most often associated with image processing the primary uses for machine vision are automatic inspection and industrial robot/process guidance see glossary of machine vision the primary uses for machine vision are imaging-based automatic inspection and sorting and robot guidance mv software packages and programs developed in them then employ various digital image processing techniques to extract the required information , and often make decisions ( such as pass/fail ) based on the extracted information west , perry high speed , real-time machine vision cyberoptics , pages 1-38 though the vast majority of machine vision applications are solved using two-dimensional imaging , machine vision applications utilizing 3d imaging are a growing niche within the industry in machine vision this is accomplished with a scanning motion , either by moving the workpiece , or by moving the camera & laser imaging system one method is grid array based systems using pseudorandom structured light system as employed by the microsoft kinect system circa 2012 finding the optimal hardware for deep learining inference in machine vision by mike fussell vision systems design magazine september 2019 issue pages 8-9 multiple stages of processing are generally used in a sequence that ends up as a desired result west , perry a roadmap for building a machine vision system pages 1-35 this also includes user interfaces , interfaces for the integration of multi-component systems and automated data interchange

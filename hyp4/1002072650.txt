in languages written with alphabetic or syllabary scripts , one might expect that there would be a close match of the script or spelling with the phonetics in cases where spelling takes account of grammar features , these too may become inconsistent people who use non-standard spelling often suffer from adverse opinions , as a person 's mastery of standard spelling is often equated to his or her level of formal education or intelligence guessing the spelling of a word is more difficult after pronunciation changes significantly , thus yielding a non-phonetic etymological spelling system such as irish or french these spelling systems are still 'phonemic ' ( rather than 'phonetic ' ) since pronunciation can be systematically derived from spelling , although the converse ( i.e for example , in english spelling , most past participles are spelled with -ed , even though its pronunciation can vary ( compare raised and lifted ) one of the difficulties in introducing a spelling reform is how to reflect different pronunciations , often linked to regions or classes if the reform seeks to be totally phonemic in a model dialect , speakers of other dialects will find conflicts with their own usage on the other hand , many words were refashioned to reflect their latin or greek etymology therefore , most spelling reform proposals include multi-letter graphemes , as does current english spelling ( for example the first two phonemes of '' sheep '' are represented by the digraphs , , and , , respectively a number of proposals have been made to reform english spelling dutch has undergone a series of major spelling reforms beginning in 1804 - with varying levels of official backing and popular acceptance across dutch language areas the dutch language union , founded in 1980 by the netherlands and belgium , is now the source of official reforms in 1995 it issued the '' green booklet '' reform , and in 2005 the spelling changed again in 1990 , a substantial reform ordered by the french prime minister changed the spelling of about 2000 words as well as some grammar rules after much delay , the new recommended orthography received official support in france , belgium , and quebec in 2004 , but it has not yet been widely adopted there are 6000 words , including words which were not part of the 1990 reform , for example , charrette or charette , based on chariot german spelling was officially unified in 1901 and certain older spelling patterns were updated : for instance some occurrences of '' th '' were changed to '' t '' in 1944 a spelling reform was due to be introduced , but it ultimately came to nothing because of world war ii even though german spelling was already more consistent than english or french spelling , the german language countries signed an agreement on spelling reforms in 1996 ; these were planned to be gradually introduced beginning in 1998 and fully in force by 2005 indonesian underwent spelling reforms in 1947 and 1972 , after which its spelling was more consistent with the form of the language spoken in malaysia ( i.e because portuguese in portugal differs from brazilian portuguese , the reform has led to new differences in spellings which were formerly the same the most recent major reform of russian spelling was carried out shortly after the russian revolution the reform efforts were coordinated in order to correlate the two writing systems , culminating in the vienna literary agreement which has remained in service since the slovene language , not part of the serbo-croatian dialect continuum , was also covered by the same reform movement czech : the spelling of the czech language was reformed and regularised as early as the 15th century through the publication of the manuscript orthographia bohemica in a 1948 reform , the danish language abandoned the capitalization of common nouns ( originally a german-inspired rule ) to align with the other scandinavian languages

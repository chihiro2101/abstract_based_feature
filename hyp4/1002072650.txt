in languages written with alphabetic or syllabary scripts , one might expect that there would be a close match of the script or spelling with the phonetics however , even if they match at one time and place for some speakers , over time they often do not match well for the majority : one sound may be represented by various combinations of letters and one letter or group of letters pronounced differently people who use non-standard spelling often suffer from adverse opinions , as a person 's mastery of standard spelling is often equated to his or her level of formal education or intelligence guessing the spelling of a word is more difficult after pronunciation changes significantly , thus yielding a non-phonetic etymological spelling system such as irish or french these spelling systems are still 'phonemic ' ( rather than 'phonetic ' ) since pronunciation can be systematically derived from spelling , although the converse ( i.e spelling from pronunciation ) may not be possible english is an extreme example of a defective orthography in which spelling can not be systematically derived from pronunciation , but it also has the more unusual problem that pronunciation can not be systematically derived from spelling the idea of phonemic spelling has also been criticized as it would hide morphological similarities between words with differing pronunciations , thus obscuring their meanings in a system of phonetic spelling , these morphemes become less distinct , due to the various pronunciations of allomorphs for example , in english spelling , most past participles are spelled with -ed , even though its pronunciation can vary ( compare raised and lifted ) one of the difficulties in introducing a spelling reform is how to reflect different pronunciations , often linked to regions or classes if the reform seeks to be totally phonemic in a model dialect , speakers of other dialects will find conflicts with their own usage therefore , most spelling reform proposals include multi-letter graphemes , as does current english spelling ( for example the first two phonemes of '' sheep '' are represented by the digraphs , , and , , respectively ) diacritic marks and use of new letter shapes like ʒʒ have also formed part of spelling reform proposals a number of proposals have been made to reform english spelling after much delay , the new recommended orthography received official support in france , belgium , and quebec in 2004 , but it has not yet been widely adopted there are 6000 words , including words which were not part of the 1990 reform , for example , charrette or charette , based on chariot german spelling was officially unified in 1901 and certain older spelling patterns were updated : for instance some occurrences of '' th '' were changed to '' t '' in 1944 a spelling reform was due to be introduced , but it ultimately came to nothing because of world war ii even though german spelling was already more consistent than english or french spelling , the german language countries signed an agreement on spelling reforms in 1996 ; these were planned to be gradually introduced beginning in 1998 and fully in force by 2005 therefore german media outlets which had formerly opposed the changes began to use the new spelling indonesian underwent spelling reforms in 1947 and 1972 , after which its spelling was more consistent with the form of the language spoken in malaysia ( i.e the 2005 reform reintroduced traditional spellings which had been abolished by earlier spelling reforms the medieval spelling of portuguese was mostly phonemic , but , from the renaissance on , many authors who admired classical culture began to use an etymological orthography in the early 20th century , however , spelling reforms in portugal and brazil reverted the orthography to phonemic principles despite many attempts , there was no universally agreed-upon spelling standard employing the latin alphabet , and the cyrillic version was considered outdated hebrew : the hebrew language has two systems of spelling – with and without vowel marks , called niqqud

in languages written with alphabetic or syllabary scripts , one might expect that there would be a close match of the script or spelling with the phonetics people who use non-standard spelling often suffer from adverse opinions , as a person 's mastery of standard spelling is often equated to his or her level of formal education or intelligence guessing the spelling of a word is more difficult after pronunciation changes significantly , thus yielding a non-phonetic etymological spelling system such as irish or french these spelling systems are still 'phonemic ' ( rather than 'phonetic ' ) since pronunciation can be systematically derived from spelling , although the converse ( i.e spelling from pronunciation ) may not be possible english is an extreme example of a defective orthography in which spelling can not be systematically derived from pronunciation , but it also has the more unusual problem that pronunciation can not be systematically derived from spelling redundancy of letters is often an issue in spelling reform , which prompts the '' economic argument '' —significant cost savings in the production materials over time—as promulgated by george bernard shaw in a system of phonetic spelling , these morphemes become less distinct , due to the various pronunciations of allomorphs one of the difficulties in introducing a spelling reform is how to reflect different pronunciations , often linked to regions or classes many technical terms are more common in writing than in speech , so their pronunciation is almost irrelevant and it should not influence their spelling on the other hand , many words were refashioned to reflect their latin or greek etymology ) diacritic marks and use of new letter shapes like ʒʒ have also formed part of spelling reform proposals a number of proposals have been made to reform english spelling some of his suggestions resulted in the american and british english spelling differences in the 1950s , the language reform committee of the people 's republic of china devised the pinyin orthography and promulgated it as the official romanization system of mainland china dutch has undergone a series of major spelling reforms beginning in 1804 - with varying levels of official backing and popular acceptance across dutch language areas in 1995 it issued the '' green booklet '' reform , and in 2005 the spelling changed again there are 6000 words , including words which were not part of the 1990 reform , for example , charrette or charette , based on chariot as of 16 march 2009 , several major belgian publishing groups have begun to apply the new spellings in their online publications even though german spelling was already more consistent than english or french spelling , the german language countries signed an agreement on spelling reforms in 1996 ; these were planned to be gradually introduced beginning in 1998 and fully in force by 2005 the so-called rechtschreibreform was subject to dispute , and polls consistently showed a majority against the new spelling the classical , medieval , and early modern polytonic orthography inherited archaisms from ancient greek , which have been eliminated or simplified in the modern monotonic orthography indonesian underwent spelling reforms in 1947 and 1972 , after which its spelling was more consistent with the form of the language spoken in malaysia ( i.e in the early 20th century , however , spelling reforms in portugal and brazil reverted the orthography to phonemic principles the slovene language , not part of the serbo-croatian dialect continuum , was also covered by the same reform movement the academy of the hebrew language publishes rules for both vocalized and unvocalized spelling venetian : the venetian language has never had an official orthography , because it was considered a dialect until recent times , and also now many do n't consider it as a '' distinct '' language

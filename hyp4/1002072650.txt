in languages written with alphabetic or syllabary scripts , one might expect that there would be a close match of the script or spelling with the phonetics in cases where spelling takes account of grammar features , these too may become inconsistent people who use non-standard spelling often suffer from adverse opinions , as a person 's mastery of standard spelling is often equated to his or her level of formal education or intelligence guessing the spelling of a word is more difficult after pronunciation changes significantly , thus yielding a non-phonetic etymological spelling system such as irish or french these spelling systems are still 'phonemic ' ( rather than 'phonetic ' ) since pronunciation can be systematically derived from spelling , although the converse ( i.e english is an extreme example of a defective orthography in which spelling can not be systematically derived from pronunciation , but it also has the more unusual problem that pronunciation can not be systematically derived from spelling redundancy of letters is often an issue in spelling reform , which prompts the '' economic argument '' —significant cost savings in the production materials over time—as promulgated by george bernard shaw for example , in english spelling , most past participles are spelled with -ed , even though its pronunciation can vary ( compare raised and lifted ) one of the difficulties in introducing a spelling reform is how to reflect different pronunciations , often linked to regions or classes if spellings are changed to more closely match pronunciation , then their etymology will be more opaque , and they will diverge from spellings of similar words in other languages , and also from the pronunciation of other dialects , making the text more opaque for speakers of those languages and dialects english spelling contains many irregularities for various reasons therefore , most spelling reform proposals include multi-letter graphemes , as does current english spelling ( for example the first two phonemes of '' sheep '' are represented by the digraphs , , and , , respectively a number of proposals have been made to reform english spelling some of his suggestions resulted in the american and british english spelling differences in the 1950s , the language reform committee of the people 's republic of china devised the pinyin orthography and promulgated it as the official romanization system of mainland china dutch has undergone a series of major spelling reforms beginning in 1804 - with varying levels of official backing and popular acceptance across dutch language areas there are 6000 words , including words which were not part of the 1990 reform , for example , charrette or charette , based on chariot german spelling was officially unified in 1901 and certain older spelling patterns were updated : for instance some occurrences of '' th '' were changed to '' t '' in 1944 a spelling reform was due to be introduced , but it ultimately came to nothing because of world war ii in summer 2004 , various newspapers and magazines returned to the old spelling , and in march 2006 , the most controversial changes of rechtschreibreform were reverted indonesian underwent spelling reforms in 1947 and 1972 , after which its spelling was more consistent with the form of the language spoken in malaysia ( i.e the 2005 reform reintroduced traditional spellings which had been abolished by earlier spelling reforms because portuguese in portugal differs from brazilian portuguese , the reform has led to new differences in spellings which were formerly the same bulgarian underwent a spelling reform in 1945 , following the russian model a series of reforms have been undertaken to set the standards , in order to bring the writing system to parity with spoken language armenian : see spelling reform of the armenian language 1922–1924 venetian : the venetian language has never had an official orthography , because it was considered a dialect until recent times , and also now many do n't consider it as a '' distinct '' language

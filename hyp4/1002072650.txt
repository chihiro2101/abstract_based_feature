in languages written with alphabetic or syllabary scripts , one might expect that there would be a close match of the script or spelling with the phonetics in cases where spelling takes account of grammar features , these too may become inconsistent people who use non-standard spelling often suffer from adverse opinions , as a person 's mastery of standard spelling is often equated to his or her level of formal education or intelligence guessing the spelling of a word is more difficult after pronunciation changes significantly , thus yielding a non-phonetic etymological spelling system such as irish or french these spelling systems are still 'phonemic ' ( rather than 'phonetic ' ) since pronunciation can be systematically derived from spelling , although the converse ( i.e spelling from pronunciation ) may not be possible english is an extreme example of a defective orthography in which spelling can not be systematically derived from pronunciation , but it also has the more unusual problem that pronunciation can not be systematically derived from spelling redundancy of letters is often an issue in spelling reform , which prompts the '' economic argument '' —significant cost savings in the production materials over time—as promulgated by george bernard shaw for example , in english spelling , most past participles are spelled with -ed , even though its pronunciation can vary ( compare raised and lifted ) one of the difficulties in introducing a spelling reform is how to reflect different pronunciations , often linked to regions or classes if the reform seeks to be totally phonemic in a model dialect , speakers of other dialects will find conflicts with their own usage if spellings are changed to more closely match pronunciation , then their etymology will be more opaque , and they will diverge from spellings of similar words in other languages , and also from the pronunciation of other dialects , making the text more opaque for speakers of those languages and dialects many technical terms are more common in writing than in speech , so their pronunciation is almost irrelevant and it should not influence their spelling therefore , most spelling reform proposals include multi-letter graphemes , as does current english spelling ( for example the first two phonemes of '' sheep '' are represented by the digraphs , , and , , respectively ) diacritic marks and use of new letter shapes like ʒʒ have also formed part of spelling reform proposals in the 1950s , the language reform committee of the people 's republic of china devised the pinyin orthography and promulgated it as the official romanization system of mainland china dutch has undergone a series of major spelling reforms beginning in 1804 - with varying levels of official backing and popular acceptance across dutch language areas in 1990 , a substantial reform ordered by the french prime minister changed the spelling of about 2000 words as well as some grammar rules there are 6000 words , including words which were not part of the 1990 reform , for example , charrette or charette , based on chariot even though german spelling was already more consistent than english or french spelling , the german language countries signed an agreement on spelling reforms in 1996 ; these were planned to be gradually introduced beginning in 1998 and fully in force by 2005 indonesian underwent spelling reforms in 1947 and 1972 , after which its spelling was more consistent with the form of the language spoken in malaysia ( i.e some of the old spellings , which were more closely derived from the english language , still survive in proper names in the early 20th century , however , spelling reforms in portugal and brazil reverted the orthography to phonemic principles in a 1948 reform , the danish language abandoned the capitalization of common nouns ( originally a german-inspired rule ) to align with the other scandinavian languages hebrew : the hebrew language has two systems of spelling – with and without vowel marks , called niqqud the academy of the hebrew language publishes rules for both vocalized and unvocalized spelling venetian : the venetian language has never had an official orthography , because it was considered a dialect until recent times , and also now many do n't consider it as a '' distinct '' language

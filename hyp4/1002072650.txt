in languages written with alphabetic or syllabary scripts , one might expect that there would be a close match of the script or spelling with the phonetics in cases where spelling takes account of grammar features , these too may become inconsistent people who use non-standard spelling often suffer from adverse opinions , as a person 's mastery of standard spelling is often equated to his or her level of formal education or intelligence guessing the spelling of a word is more difficult after pronunciation changes significantly , thus yielding a non-phonetic etymological spelling system such as irish or french these spelling systems are still 'phonemic ' ( rather than 'phonetic ' ) since pronunciation can be systematically derived from spelling , although the converse ( i.e english is an extreme example of a defective orthography in which spelling can not be systematically derived from pronunciation , but it also has the more unusual problem that pronunciation can not be systematically derived from spelling redundancy of letters is often an issue in spelling reform , which prompts the '' economic argument '' —significant cost savings in the production materials over time—as promulgated by george bernard shaw in a system of phonetic spelling , these morphemes become less distinct , due to the various pronunciations of allomorphs for example , in english spelling , most past participles are spelled with -ed , even though its pronunciation can vary ( compare raised and lifted ) one of the difficulties in introducing a spelling reform is how to reflect different pronunciations , often linked to regions or classes if spellings are changed to more closely match pronunciation , then their etymology will be more opaque , and they will diverge from spellings of similar words in other languages , and also from the pronunciation of other dialects , making the text more opaque for speakers of those languages and dialects many technical terms are more common in writing than in speech , so their pronunciation is almost irrelevant and it should not influence their spelling english spelling contains many irregularities for various reasons therefore , most spelling reform proposals include multi-letter graphemes , as does current english spelling ( for example the first two phonemes of '' sheep '' are represented by the digraphs , , and , , respectively the most radical approach suggest discarding the latin alphabet altogether in favor of some other writing system like the deseret alphabet in the 1950s , the language reform committee of the people 's republic of china devised the pinyin orthography and promulgated it as the official romanization system of mainland china dutch has undergone a series of major spelling reforms beginning in 1804 - with varying levels of official backing and popular acceptance across dutch language areas in 1995 it issued the '' green booklet '' reform , and in 2005 the spelling changed again in 1990 , a substantial reform ordered by the french prime minister changed the spelling of about 2000 words as well as some grammar rules as of 16 march 2009 , several major belgian publishing groups have begun to apply the new spellings in their online publications even though german spelling was already more consistent than english or french spelling , the german language countries signed an agreement on spelling reforms in 1996 ; these were planned to be gradually introduced beginning in 1998 and fully in force by 2005 some of the old spellings , which were more closely derived from the english language , still survive in proper names the most recent major reform of russian spelling was carried out shortly after the russian revolution the slovene language , not part of the serbo-croatian dialect continuum , was also covered by the same reform movement armenian : see spelling reform of the armenian language 1922–1924 hebrew : the hebrew language has two systems of spelling – with and without vowel marks , called niqqud venetian : the venetian language has never had an official orthography , because it was considered a dialect until recent times , and also now many do n't consider it as a '' distinct '' language

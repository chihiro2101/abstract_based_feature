the region of bactria , which encompassed the oxus river in modern afghanistan and tajikistan , was conquered by alexander the great between 329 and 327 bc and he settled a number of his veterans in the region in the wars which followed alexander 's death in 323 bc , the region was largely left to its own devices , but it was incorporated in the seleucid empire by seleucus i between 308 and 305 bc , along with the rest of the territories that alexander had conquered in iran and central asia seleucus entrusted the region to his son and co-regent , antiochus i , around 295 bc between 295 and 281 bc , antiochus i established firm seleucid control over the region after antiochus i succeeded his father as ruler of the seleucid empire in 281 bc , he entrusted the east to his own son , antiochus ii who remained in this position until he in turn succeeded to the throne in 261 bc he probably became seleucid satrap ( governor ) of bactria during antiochus ii 's period in charge of the east , thus about a generation after the original establishment of seleucid control over the region at some point , diodotus seceded from the seleucid empire , establishing his realm as an independent kingdom , known in modern scholarship as the graeco-bactrian kingdom the literary evidence is as follows : justin says that the rebellion occurred 'around the same time ' as the parni conquest of parthia from the seleucid realm , but his dating of this event is confused—he places it in 256 bc , but during the reign of seleucus ii ( 246-225 bc ) different scholars have argued for a 'high chronology ' which places diodotus ' independence around 255 bc in the reign of antiochus ii , or a 'low chronology ' which dates the secession around 245 bc at the beginning of the reign of seleucus ii the choice of zeus may have been intended as a reference to diodotus himself whose name meant 'gift of zeus ' in greek the wreath was a greek symbol of victory—frank holt suggests that it commemorated a victory over the parthians and that this victory was also the source of diodotus ' epithet soter ( savour ) a few tetradrachm coins depicting diodotus i in a more 'idealising ' guise were issued late in diodotus ii 's reign ( 'series b ' ) tarn proposed that diodotus i had married a daughter of antiochus ii and his wife laodice i around 246 bc , as his second wife

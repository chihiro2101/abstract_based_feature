in the wars which followed alexander 's death in 323 bc , the region was largely left to its own devices , but it was incorporated in the seleucid empire by seleucus i between 308 and 305 bc , along with the rest of the territories that alexander had conquered in iran and central asia seleucus entrusted the region to his son and co-regent , antiochus i , around 295 bc between 295 and 281 bc , antiochus i established firm seleucid control over the region after antiochus i succeeded his father as ruler of the seleucid empire in 281 bc , he entrusted the east to his own son , antiochus ii who remained in this position until he in turn succeeded to the throne in 261 bc he probably became seleucid satrap ( governor ) of bactria during antiochus ii 's period in charge of the east , thus about a generation after the original establishment of seleucid control over the region at some point , diodotus seceded from the seleucid empire , establishing his realm as an independent kingdom , known in modern scholarship as the graeco-bactrian kingdom the literary evidence is as follows : justin says that the rebellion occurred 'around the same time ' as the parni conquest of parthia from the seleucid realm , but his dating of this event is confusedâ€”he places it in 256 bc , but during the reign of seleucus ii ( 246-225 bc ) ammianus marcellinus 23.6.2-3 arrian 's lost parthian history seems to have claimed that the seleucid satrap who was overthrown by the parthians was appointed to that position by antiochus ii different scholars have argued for a 'high chronology ' which places diodotus ' independence around 255 bc in the reign of antiochus ii , or a 'low chronology ' which dates the secession around 245 bc at the beginning of the reign of seleucus ii holt proposes that the younger portrait depicts diodotus ii , perhaps junior co-regent with diodotus i these coins imitate the original design of the tetradrachms issued by diodotus i , but with a legend on the obverse identifying the king as ( 'of diodotus soter ' ) there is a similar break to the silver and gold coins , after which the bronzes are issued with the legend ( 'of diodotus ' , 'series h ' ) 250 bc , who subsequently married euthydemus i and was involved in his murder of diodotus ii and usurpation of the throne

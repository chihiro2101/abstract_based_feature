the region of bactria , which encompassed the oxus river in modern afghanistan and tajikistan , was conquered by alexander the great between 329 and 327 bc and he settled a number of his veterans in the region in the wars which followed alexander 's death in 323 bc , the region was largely left to its own devices , but it was incorporated in the seleucid empire by seleucus i between 308 and 305 bc , along with the rest of the territories that alexander had conquered in iran and central asia between 295 and 281 bc , antiochus i established firm seleucid control over the region the region was divided into a number of satrapy ( provinces ) , of which bactria was one antiochus founded or refounded a number of cities on the greek model in the region and he opened a number of mints to produce coinage on the attic weight standard after antiochus i succeeded his father as ruler of the seleucid empire in 281 bc , he entrusted the east to his own son , antiochus ii who remained in this position until he in turn succeeded to the throne in 261 bc he probably became seleucid satrap ( governor ) of bactria during antiochus ii 's period in charge of the east , thus about a generation after the original establishment of seleucid control over the region the literary evidence is as follows : justin says that the rebellion occurred 'around the same time ' as the parni conquest of parthia from the seleucid realm , but his dating of this event is confusedâ€”he places it in 256 bc , but during the reign of seleucus ii ( 246-225 bc ) in his opinion , the process probably began in the 250s bc and was completed in the reign of seleucus ii the choice of zeus may have been intended as a reference to diodotus himself whose name meant 'gift of zeus ' in greek a few tetradrachm coins depicting diodotus i in a more 'idealising ' guise were issued late in diodotus ii 's reign ( 'series b ' ) the only attested relative of diodotus i is his son and successor , diodotus ii , whose mother is unknown 250 bc , who subsequently married euthydemus i and was involved in his murder of diodotus ii and usurpation of the throne

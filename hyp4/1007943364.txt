the region of bactria , which encompassed the oxus river in modern afghanistan and tajikistan , was conquered by alexander the great between 329 and 327 bc and he settled a number of his veterans in the region in the wars which followed alexander 's death in 323 bc , the region was largely left to its own devices , but it was incorporated in the seleucid empire by seleucus i between 308 and 305 bc , along with the rest of the territories that alexander had conquered in iran and central asia seleucus entrusted the region to his son and co-regent , antiochus i , around 295 bc between 295 and 281 bc , antiochus i established firm seleucid control over the region antiochus founded or refounded a number of cities on the greek model in the region and he opened a number of mints to produce coinage on the attic weight standard after antiochus i succeeded his father as ruler of the seleucid empire in 281 bc , he entrusted the east to his own son , antiochus ii who remained in this position until he in turn succeeded to the throne in 261 bc he probably became seleucid satrap ( governor ) of bactria during antiochus ii 's period in charge of the east , thus about a generation after the original establishment of seleucid control over the region frank holt argues that the secession should be seen as a gradual process in which diodotus and other eastern seleucid satraps aggregated ever more autonomy , rather than a single event as satrap , diodotus continued to issue these coins , in the name of antiochus ii probably while he was still satrap , diodotus introduced a new coinage , which consisted of a large number of silver tetradrachms and , later , a small number of gold staters a few tetradrachm coins depicting diodotus i in a more 'idealising ' guise were issued late in diodotus ii 's reign ( 'series b ' ) these coins imitate the original design of the tetradrachms issued by diodotus i , but with a legend on the obverse identifying the king as ( 'of diodotus soter ' ) there is a similar break to the silver and gold coins , after which the bronzes are issued with the legend ( 'of diodotus ' , 'series h ' )

ballard grew up in pacific beach , san diego , california to a mother of german heritage and a father of british heritage in 1965 , ballard graduated from the university of california , santa barbara , earning undergraduate degrees in chemistry and geology his first graduate degree ( ms , 1966 ) was in geophysics from the university of hawaii 's institute of geophysics where he trained porpoises and whales the navy assigned him as a liaison between the office of naval research and the woods hole oceanographic institution in woods hole , massachusetts after leaving active duty and entering into the naval reserve in 1970 , ballard continued working at woods hole persuading organizations and people , mostly scientists , to fund and use alvin for undersea research ballard joined the united states army in 1965 through the army 's reserve officers ' training corps when called to active duty in 1967 , he asked to fulfill his obligation in the united states navy ballard 's first dive in a submersible was in the ben franklin ( px-15 ) in 1969 off the coast of florida during a woods hole oceanographic institution expedition it used an air gun that sent sound waves underwater to determine the underlying structure of the ocean floor and the submersible alvin , which was used to find and recover a sample from the bedrock ballard was geologist diver in alvin during project famous , which explored the median rift valley of the mid-atlantic ridge in 1974 on the galapagos spreading center east of the islands a 1977 exploration by alvin found deep-sea hydrothermal vents and surrounding biology communities based on chemosynthesis ballard and geophysicist jean francheteau went down in alvin the day after the black smokers were first observed they were able to take an accurate temperature reading of the active vent ( the previous dive 's thermometer had melted ) , and recorded 350 & nbsp ; °c ( 662 & nbsp ; °f ) while ballard had been interested in the sea since an early age , his work at woods hole and his scuba diving experiences off massachusetts spurred his interest in shipwrecks and their exploration in summer 1985 , ballard was aboard the french research ship le suroît , which was using the side scan sonar sar to search for the titanic wreck when the french ship was recalled , he transferred onto a ship from woods hole , the rv knorr back in 1982 , he approached the navy about his new deep sea underwater robot craft , the argo , and his search for the titanic the navy agreed it would finance his titanic search only if he first searched for and investigated the two sunken submarines , and found out the state of their nuclear reactors after being submerged for such a long time , and whether their radioactivity was impacting the environment after the two missions were completed , time and funding permitting , he was free to use resources to hunt for the titanic when they searched for the two submarines , ballard and his team discovered that they had imploded from the immense pressure at depth following the large trail of debris led them directly to both and made it significantly easier for them to locate them than if they were to search for the hulls directly using that lesson , they had argo sweep back and forth across the ocean floor looking for the titanic 's debris trail finally , a boiler was sighted , and soon after that , the hull was found ballard 's team made a general search of the titanic 's exterior , noting its condition on july 12 , 1986 , ballard and his team returned on board atlantis ii to make the first detailed study of the wreck although the first dive ( taking over two hours ) encountered technical problems , subsequent ones were far more successful , and produced a detailed photographic record of the wreck 's condition ballard undertook an even more daunting task when he and his team searched off the coast of france for the german battleship bismarck in 1989 , using an ocean-crawling robot ballard later published a book about the quest , the discovery of the bismarck ( 1990 ) in 2003 , ballard started the center for ocean exploration and archaeological oceanography , a research program at the university of rhode island 's graduate school of oceanography the anoxic environment , which is hostile to many biological organisms that destroy wood in the oxygenated waters , provides an excellent testing site for deep water archaeological survey in 2000 , the team conducted an expedition that focused on the exploration of the sea bed about 15–30 & nbsp ; km west of sinop , and an additional deep-water survey east and north of the peninsula the wreck found provided the team with vast information about both the technological changes and trade that occurred in the black sea during a period of political , social and economic transition through their study of the ship 's construction techniques sea-trading on the black sea was most intense during the period of late antiquity , between the 2nd and 7th centuries ad the hypothesis that the anoxic waters of the black sea would allow extraordinary organic preservation is borne out by the discovery of sinop d , the 1,500-year-old shipwreck with excellent preservation of features above the sediment layer

ballard grew up in pacific beach , san diego , california to a mother of german heritage and a father of british heritage he has attributed his early interest in underwater exploration to reading the 1870 jules verne novel twenty thousand leagues under the sea , living by the ocean in san diego , and his fascination with the groundbreaking expeditions of the bathyscaphe trieste at north american , he worked on north american 's failed proposal to build the submersible alvin for the woods hole oceanographic institution in 1965 , ballard graduated from the university of california , santa barbara , earning undergraduate degrees in chemistry and geology while a student in santa barbara , california , he joined sigma alpha epsilon fraternity , and also completed the us army 's rotc program , giving him an army officer 's commission in army intelligence subsequently , he returned to andreas rechnitzer 's ocean systems group at north american aviation the navy assigned him as a liaison between the office of naval research and the woods hole oceanographic institution in woods hole , massachusetts after leaving active duty and entering into the naval reserve in 1970 , ballard continued working at woods hole persuading organizations and people , mostly scientists , to fund and use alvin for undersea research in marine geology and geophysics at the university of rhode island ballard joined the united states army in 1965 through the army 's reserve officers ' training corps when called to active duty in 1967 , he asked to fulfill his obligation in the united states navy it used an air gun that sent sound waves underwater to determine the underlying structure of the ocean floor and the submersible alvin , which was used to find and recover a sample from the bedrock during the summer of 1975 , ballard participated in a joint french-american expedition called phere searching for hydrothermal vents over the mid-atlantic ridge , but the expedition did not find any active vents while ballard had been interested in the sea since an early age , his work at woods hole and his scuba diving experiences off massachusetts spurred his interest in shipwrecks and their exploration his work in the navy had involved assisting in the development of small , unmanned submersibles that could be tethered to and controlled from a surface ship , and were outfitted with lighting , cameras , and manipulator arms in summer 1985 , ballard was aboard the french research ship le suro√Æt , which was using the side scan sonar sar to search for the titanic wreck navy for secret reconnaissance of the wreckage of two navy nuclear powered attack submarines , the uss scorpion and the uss thresher , which sank in the 1960s , and not for the titanic back in 1982 , he approached the navy about his new deep sea underwater robot craft , the argo , and his search for the titanic the navy agreed it would finance his titanic search only if he first searched for and investigated the two sunken submarines , and found out the state of their nuclear reactors after being submerged for such a long time , and whether their radioactivity was impacting the environment when they searched for the two submarines , ballard and his team discovered that they had imploded from the immense pressure at depth following the large trail of debris led them directly to both and made it significantly easier for them to locate them than if they were to search for the hulls directly they took shifts monitoring the video feed from argo as it searched the ocean floor two miles below in the early morning hours of september 1 , 1985 , observers noted anomalies on the otherwise smooth ocean floor most significantly , they confirmed that it had split in two , and that the stern was in far worse shape than the bow in 1988 , ballard published a book , discovery of the titanic : exploring the greatest of all lost ships , and he later recounted the specifics of the expedition for national geographic in a video ballard undertook an even more daunting task when he and his team searched off the coast of france for the german battleship bismarck in 1989 , using an ocean-crawling robot ballard later published a book about the quest , the discovery of the bismarck ( 1990 ) the wreck had been depth charged by the royal navy several years after the sinking , and had also been damaged by other explorers , making a forensic analysis difficult in 1992 , ballard and his team visited the sites of many wrecks of world war ii in the pacific to the east of sinop , the team discovered a remarkably well-preserved wreck at a 320 m depth , in the black sea 's deep anoxic waters the hypothesis that the anoxic waters of the black sea would allow extraordinary organic preservation is borne out by the discovery of sinop d , the 1,500-year-old shipwreck with excellent preservation of features above the sediment layer the caird medal of the national maritime museum in 2002 asteroid 11277 ballard , discovered by carolyn and eugene shoemaker at palomar observatory , was named in his honor in 2002 in 2004 , ballard was appointed professor of oceanography , and currently serves as director of the institute for archaeological oceanography , at the university of rhode island 's graduate school of oceanography he began the jason project in response to the thousands of letters he received from students following his discovery of the wreck of the titanic .

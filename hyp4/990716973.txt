he has attributed his early interest in underwater exploration to reading the 1870 jules verne novel twenty thousand leagues under the sea , living by the ocean in san diego , and his fascination with the groundbreaking expeditions of the bathyscaphe trieste ballard began working for andreas rechnitzer 's ocean systems group at north american aviation in 1962 when his father , chet , the chief engineer at north american aviation 's lgm-30 minuteman program , helped him get a part-time job at north american , he worked on north american 's failed proposal to build the submersible alvin for the woods hole oceanographic institution in 1965 , ballard graduated from the university of california , santa barbara , earning undergraduate degrees in chemistry and geology while a student in santa barbara , california , he joined sigma alpha epsilon fraternity , and also completed the us army 's rotc program , giving him an army officer 's commission in army intelligence his first graduate degree ( ms , 1966 ) was in geophysics from the university of hawaii 's institute of geophysics where he trained porpoises and whales in marine geology at the university of southern california in 1967 when he was called to active duty the navy assigned him as a liaison between the office of naval research and the woods hole oceanographic institution in woods hole , massachusetts after leaving active duty and entering into the naval reserve in 1970 , ballard continued working at woods hole persuading organizations and people , mostly scientists , to fund and use alvin for undersea research ballard joined the united states army in 1965 through the army 's reserve officers ' training corps he was designated as an intelligence officer and initially received a commission as a second lieutenant in the army reserve when called to active duty in 1967 , he asked to fulfill his obligation in the united states navy he retired from the navy as a commander in 1995 after reaching the statutory service limit ballard 's first dive in a submersible was in the ben franklin ( px-15 ) in 1969 off the coast of florida during a woods hole oceanographic institution expedition when alvin inspected one of the sites the deep-tow located , the scientists observed black '' smoke '' billowing out of the vents , something not observed at the galápagos rift while ballard had been interested in the sea since an early age , his work at woods hole and his scuba diving experiences off massachusetts spurred his interest in shipwrecks and their exploration his work in the navy had involved assisting in the development of small , unmanned submersibles that could be tethered to and controlled from a surface ship , and were outfitted with lighting , cameras , and manipulator arms in summer 1985 , ballard was aboard the french research ship le suroît , which was using the side scan sonar sar to search for the titanic wreck when the french ship was recalled , he transferred onto a ship from woods hole , the rv knorr back in 1982 , he approached the navy about his new deep sea underwater robot craft , the argo , and his search for the titanic the navy agreed it would finance his titanic search only if he first searched for and investigated the two sunken submarines , and found out the state of their nuclear reactors after being submerged for such a long time , and whether their radioactivity was impacting the environment they did not have much time to explore , as others were waiting to take knorr on other scientific pursuits , but his fame was now assured on july 12 , 1986 , ballard and his team returned on board atlantis ii to make the first detailed study of the wreck it was accompanied by jason junior , a small remotely operated vehicle that could fit through small openings to see into the ship 's interior in 1988 , ballard published a book , discovery of the titanic : exploring the greatest of all lost ships , and he later recounted the specifics of the expedition for national geographic in a video the vast majority of the relics retrieved by various groups , not including ballard , from rms titanic were owned by premier exhibitions which filed for bankruptcy in 2016 in late august 2018 , the groups vying for ownership of the 5,500 relics included one by museums in england and northern ireland with assistance from film maker james cameron and some financial support from national geographic ballard told the news media that he favored this bid since it would ensure that the memorabilia would be permanently displayed in belfast and in greenwich in the 1990s ballard founded the institute for exploration , which specializes in deep-sea archaeology and deep-sea geology in 2003 , ballard started the center for ocean exploration and archaeological oceanography , a research program at the university of rhode island 's graduate school of oceanography wreck a and wreck c probably date to the late roman period ( 2nd–4th century a.d to the east of sinop , the team discovered a remarkably well-preserved wreck at a 320 m depth , in the black sea 's deep anoxic waters the hypothesis that the anoxic waters of the black sea would allow extraordinary organic preservation is borne out by the discovery of sinop d , the 1,500-year-old shipwreck with excellent preservation of features above the sediment layer in 2004 , ballard was appointed professor of oceanography , and currently serves as director of the institute for archaeological oceanography , at the university of rhode island 's graduate school of oceanography

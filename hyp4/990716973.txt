ballard grew up in pacific beach , san diego , california to a mother of german heritage and a father of british heritage he has attributed his early interest in underwater exploration to reading the 1870 jules verne novel twenty thousand leagues under the sea , living by the ocean in san diego , and his fascination with the groundbreaking expeditions of the bathyscaphe trieste at north american , he worked on north american 's failed proposal to build the submersible alvin for the woods hole oceanographic institution in 1965 , ballard graduated from the university of california , santa barbara , earning undergraduate degrees in chemistry and geology his first graduate degree ( ms , 1966 ) was in geophysics from the university of hawaii 's institute of geophysics where he trained porpoises and whales subsequently , he returned to andreas rechnitzer 's ocean systems group at north american aviation the navy assigned him as a liaison between the office of naval research and the woods hole oceanographic institution in woods hole , massachusetts in marine geology and geophysics at the university of rhode island when called to active duty in 1967 , he asked to fulfill his obligation in the united states navy his request was approved , and he was transferred to the navy reserve on the reserve active duty list ballard 's first dive in a submersible was in the ben franklin ( px-15 ) in 1969 off the coast of florida during a woods hole oceanographic institution expedition during the summer of 1975 , ballard participated in a joint french-american expedition called phere searching for hydrothermal vents over the mid-atlantic ridge , but the expedition did not find any active vents on the galapagos spreading center east of the islands a 1977 exploration by alvin found deep-sea hydrothermal vents and surrounding biology communities based on chemosynthesis ballard and geophysicist jean francheteau went down in alvin the day after the black smokers were first observed while ballard had been interested in the sea since an early age , his work at woods hole and his scuba diving experiences off massachusetts spurred his interest in shipwrecks and their exploration as early as 1973 , he saw this as way of searching for the wreck of the titanic the navy agreed it would finance his titanic search only if he first searched for and investigated the two sunken submarines , and found out the state of their nuclear reactors after being submerged for such a long time , and whether their radioactivity was impacting the environment he was placed on temporary active duty in the navy , in charge of finding and investigating the wrecks after the two missions were completed , time and funding permitting , he was free to use resources to hunt for the titanic when they searched for the two submarines , ballard and his team discovered that they had imploded from the immense pressure at depth using that lesson , they had argo sweep back and forth across the ocean floor looking for the titanic 's debris trail although the first dive ( taking over two hours ) encountered technical problems , subsequent ones were far more successful , and produced a detailed photographic record of the wreck 's condition in 1988 , ballard published a book , discovery of the titanic : exploring the greatest of all lost ships , and he later recounted the specifics of the expedition for national geographic in a video ballard undertook an even more daunting task when he and his team searched off the coast of france for the german battleship bismarck in 1989 , using an ocean-crawling robot three weeks after the expedition however , personal tragedy struck him when his 21-year-old son , todd , who had aided him in the search , was killed in a car accident the actual cause of the sinking , however , was sabotage of the underwater valves by the onboard crew , according to ballard , who said , '' we found a hull that appears whole and relatively undamaged by the descent and impact '' film maker cameron , however , said that his crew 's examination of the wreckage indicated that the bismarck would have sunk eventually even if it had not been scuttled the wreck had been depth charged by the royal navy several years after the sinking , and had also been damaged by other explorers , making a forensic analysis difficult some experts have indicated that it was , in fact , boiler explosions that caused the ship to sink so quickly , in a mere 18 minutes on 19 may 1998 ballard found the wreck of yorktown , sunk at the battle of midway in 2002 , the national geographic society and ballard fielded a ship with remote vehicles to the solomon islands there was evidence for a strong flow of fresh water out of the black sea in the 8th millennium bc in 2004 , ballard was appointed professor of oceanography , and currently serves as director of the institute for archaeological oceanography , at the university of rhode island 's graduate school of oceanography he began the jason project in response to the thousands of letters he received from students following his discovery of the wreck of the titanic .

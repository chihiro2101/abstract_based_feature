in the case of normal distribution data , the three sigma rule means that roughly 1 in 22 observations will differ by twice the standard deviation or more from the mean , and 1 in 370 will deviate by three times the standard deviation in a sample of 1000 observations , the presence of up to five observations deviating from the mean by more than three times the standard deviation is within the range of what can be expected , being less than twice the expected number and hence within 1 standard deviation of the expected number – see poisson distribution – and not indicate an anomaly if the sample size is only 100 , however , just three such outliers are already reason for concern , being more than 11 times the expected number in general , if the nature of the population distribution is known a priori , it is possible to test if the number of outliers deviate significantly from what can be expected : for a given cutoff ( so samples fall beyond the cutoff with probability p ) of a given distribution , the number of outliers will follow a binomial distribution with parameter p , which can generally be well-approximated by the poisson distribution with λ pn a physical apparatus for taking measurements may have suffered a transient malfunction outliers arise due to changes in system behaviour , fraudulent behaviour , human error , instrument error or simply through natural deviations in populations additionally , the pathological appearance of outliers of a certain form appears in a variety of datasets , indicating that the causative mechanism for the data might differ at the extreme end ( king effect ) it is proposed to determine in a series of m observations the limit of error , beyond which all observations involving so great an error may be rejected , provided there are as many as n such observations for example , if q_1 and q_3 are the lower and upper quartiles respectively , then one could define an outlier to be any observation outside the range : : \big q_1 - k ( q_3 - q_1 ) , q_3 + k ( q_3 - q_1 ) \big for some nonnegative constant k the strength of this method lies in the fact that it takes into account a data set 's standard deviation , average and provides a statistically determined rejection zone ; thus providing an objective method to determine if a data point is an outlier deletion of outlier data is a controversial practice frowned upon by many scientists and science instructors ; while mathematical criteria provide an objective and quantitative method for data rejection , they do not make the practice more scientifically or methodologically sound , especially in small sets or where a normal distribution can not be assumed an outlier resulting from an instrument reading error may be excluded but it is desirable that the reading is at least verified in cases where the cause of the outliers is known , it may be possible to incorporate this effect into the model structure , for example by using a hierarchical bayes model , or a mixture model

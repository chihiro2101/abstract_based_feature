rabbits were first introduced to australia by the first fleet in 1788 in the first decades , they do not appear to have been numerous , judging from their absence from archaeological collections of early colonial food remains the common rabbit is becoming so numerous throughout the colony , that they are running about on some large estates by thousands colonial times and tasmanian advertiser 22 may 1827 this clearly shows a localised rabbit population explosion was underway in tasmania in the early 19th century the population explosion was ascribed to the disappearance of native predators , but the emergence of a hardier breed by natural selection has subsequently been attributed to their spread upon arriving in australia , which had no native rabbit population , austin asked his nephew william austin in england to send him 12 grey rabbits , five hares , 72 partridges , and some sparrows so he could continue his hobby in australia by creating a local population of the species at the time , he had stated , '' the introduction of a few rabbits could do little harm and might provide a touch of home , in addition to a spot of hunting '' william could not source enough grey rabbits to meet his uncle 's order , so he topped it up by buying domestic rabbits one theory as to why the barwon park rabbits adapted so well to australia is that the hybrid rabbits that resulted from the interbreeding of the two distinct types were much more suited to australian conditions in a classic example of unintended consequences , rabbits had become so prevalent within 10 years of their introduction in 1859 that two million could be shot or trapped annually without having any noticeable effect on the population although the rabbit is a notorious pest , it proved useful to many people during the depressions of the 1890s and 1930s and during wartime since their introduction from europe in the 19th century , the effect of rabbits on the ecology of australia has been devastating by 1887 , losses from rabbit damage compelled the new south wales government to offer a Â£25,000 reward for '' any method of success not previously known in the colony for the effectual extermination of rabbits '' a royal commission was held to investigate the situation in 1901 once the problem was understood , various control methods were tried to limit or reduce the population of rabbits in australia these methods had limited success until the introduction of biological control methods in the latter half of the 20th century although ferrets and other mustelid species are used as control measures , australia has significantly fewer wild mustelids to prey on the invasive rabbits while in their warrens or burrows compared to europe and the united states in 1907 , the rabbit-proof fence was built in western australia between cape keraudren and esperance to try to control the spread of the rabbit population from the east into western australian pastoral areas in 1950 , following research conducted by frank fenner , myxoma virus was deliberately released into the rabbit population , causing it to drop from an estimated 600 & nbsp ; million the virus that stunned australia 's rabbits to around 100 & nbsp ; million the virus escaped from a quarantine compound on wardang island , south australia , where the field tests were being carried out , and by late october 1995 , it was recorded in rabbits at yunta and gum creek , in north-eastern south australia the success of the virus was found to be higher in dry areas , because of a benign calicivirus found in the colder , wetter areas of australia , which was immunising rabbits against the more virulent form for this reason , biological warfare against rabbits in australia is a serious concern for conservation activities in other parts of the world

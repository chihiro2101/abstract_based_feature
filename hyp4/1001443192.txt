rabbits were first introduced to australia by the first fleet in 1788 in the first decades , they do not appear to have been numerous , judging from their absence from archaeological collections of early colonial food remains colonial times and tasmanian advertiser 22 may 1827 this clearly shows a localised rabbit population explosion was underway in tasmania in the early 19th century '' he also noted the scrubby , sandy rubble between sydney and botany bay would be ideal for farming rabbits '' sydney gazette 28 may 1831 in the 1840s , rabbit-keeping became even more common , with examples of the theft of rabbits from ordinary peoples ' houses appearing in court records and rabbits entering the diets of ordinary people dutton 's anlaby estate in the mid-north of south australia , released a number of rabbits for hunting sport their population remained fairly stable until around 1866 , presumed to have been kept in check by native carnivores and were protected by an act of parliament , but by 1867 was out of control william could not source enough grey rabbits to meet his uncle 's order , so he topped it up by buying domestic rabbits one theory as to why the barwon park rabbits adapted so well to australia is that the hybrid rabbits that resulted from the interbreeding of the two distinct types were much more suited to australian conditions the rabbits were extremely prolific creatures and spread rapidly across the southern parts of the country with widespread farming , areas that might otherwise have been scrub or woodlands were , instead , turned into vast areas with low vegetation , creating ideal habitats for rabbits today , rabbits are entrenched in the southern and central areas of the country , with scattered populations in the northern deserts although the rabbit is a notorious pest , it proved useful to many people during the depressions of the 1890s and 1930s and during wartime trapping rabbits helped farmers , stockmen , and stationhands by providing food and extra income , and in some cases helped pay off farming debts the extent of plant species ' loss is unknown at this time , though rabbits are known to often kill young trees in orchards , forests , and on properties by ringbarking them by 1887 , losses from rabbit damage compelled the new south wales government to offer a £25,000 reward for '' any method of success not previously known in the colony for the effectual extermination of rabbits '' these methods had limited success until the introduction of biological control methods in the latter half of the 20th century an offer by the new south wales government of a £25,000 reward for a biological control of rabbits attracted the attention of louis pasteur , who proposed using the chicken cholera bacillus ( now known as pasteurella multocida ) although that measure did not prove viable , the association with pasteur accelerated the introduction of microbiology into australia in 1906 and 1907 , jean danysz , of the pasteur institute of paris , conducted trials on broughton island , new south wales , of a strain of pasteurella bacteria he had developed , which proved to be specific to rabbits , but it proved to be a less-than-satisfactory control measure in southern europe , the scarcity of rabbits threatens the conservation of endangered predator species higher up the food chain , that depend on small game such as rabbits for this reason , biological warfare against rabbits in australia is a serious concern for conservation activities in other parts of the world

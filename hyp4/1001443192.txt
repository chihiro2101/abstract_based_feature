rabbits were first introduced to australia by the first fleet in 1788 the common rabbit is becoming so numerous throughout the colony , that they are running about on some large estates by thousands colonial times and tasmanian advertiser 22 may 1827 this clearly shows a localised rabbit population explosion was underway in tasmania in the early 19th century '' he also noted the scrubby , sandy rubble between sydney and botany bay would be ideal for farming rabbits the population explosion was ascribed to the disappearance of native predators , but the emergence of a hardier breed by natural selection has subsequently been attributed to their spread berrow 's worcester journal , saturday 31 mar 1866 , p.6 while living in england , austin had been an avid hunter , regularly dedicating his weekends to rabbit shooting william could not source enough grey rabbits to meet his uncle 's order , so he topped it up by buying domestic rabbits one theory as to why the barwon park rabbits adapted so well to australia is that the hybrid rabbits that resulted from the interbreeding of the two distinct types were much more suited to australian conditions australia had ideal conditions for a rabbit population explosion in a classic example of unintended consequences , rabbits had become so prevalent within 10 years of their introduction in 1859 that two million could be shot or trapped annually without having any noticeable effect on the population trapping rabbits helped farmers , stockmen , and stationhands by providing food and extra income , and in some cases helped pay off farming debts since their introduction from europe in the 19th century , the effect of rabbits on the ecology of australia has been devastating by 1887 , losses from rabbit damage compelled the new south wales government to offer a Â£25,000 reward for '' any method of success not previously known in the colony for the effectual extermination of rabbits '' once the problem was understood , various control methods were tried to limit or reduce the population of rabbits in australia these methods had limited success until the introduction of biological control methods in the latter half of the 20th century the sandy soil in many parts of australia makes ripping and ploughing a viable method of control , and both tractors and bulldozers are used for this operation poisoning is probably the most widely used of the conventional techniques , as it requires the least effort , and capable of destroying a local population , though reinfestation given the mobility of the animal is almost inevitable although ferrets and other mustelid species are used as control measures , australia has significantly fewer wild mustelids to prey on the invasive rabbits while in their warrens or burrows compared to europe and the united states in 1907 , the rabbit-proof fence was built in western australia between cape keraudren and esperance to try to control the spread of the rabbit population from the east into western australian pastoral areas in 1950 , following research conducted by frank fenner , myxoma virus was deliberately released into the rabbit population , causing it to drop from an estimated 600 & nbsp ; million the virus that stunned australia 's rabbits to around 100 & nbsp ; million the success of the virus was found to be higher in dry areas , because of a benign calicivirus found in the colder , wetter areas of australia , which was immunising rabbits against the more virulent form in southern europe , the scarcity of rabbits threatens the conservation of endangered predator species higher up the food chain , that depend on small game such as rabbits

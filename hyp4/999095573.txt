attack aircraft are identified by the prefix a- , as in '' a-6 intruder '' and '' a-10 thunderbolt ii '' however , until the end of world war ii the a- designation was shared between attack planes and light bombers johnson 2008 , p for usaaf aircraft ( as opposed to b- prefix for medium or heavy bombers ) the us navy used a separate designation system and at the time preferred to call similar aircraft scout bombers ( sb ) or torpedo bombers ( tb or bt ) for example , douglas sbd dauntless scout bomber was designated a-24 when used by the usaaf it was not until 1946 , when the us navy and us marine corps started using the '' attack '' ( a ) designation , when it renamed bt2d skyraider and btm mauler to , respectively , ad skyraider and am mauler as with many aircraft classifications , the definition of attack aircraft is somewhat vague and has tended to change over time military doctrine defines it as an aircraft which most likely performs an attack mission , more than any other kind of mission attack mission means , in turn , specifically tactical air-to-ground action—in other words , neither air-to-air action nor strategic bombing is considered an attack mission in united states navy vocabulary , the alternative designation for the same activity is a strike mission attack missions are principally divided into two categories : air interdiction and close air support in the last several decades , the rise of the ubiquitous multi-role fighter has created some confusion about the difference between attack and fighter aircraft designation system , an attack aircraft ( a ) is designed primarily for air-to-surface ( attack : aircraft designed to find , attack , and destroy land or sea targets ) designating and naming defense military aerospace vehicles 2005 missions ( also known as '' attack missions '' ) , while a fighter category f incorporates not only aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat , but additionally multipurpose aircraft designed also for ground-attack missions the nato reporting names for soviet/russian ground-attack aircraft at first started with '' b '' categorizing them as bombers , as in case of il-10 'beast ' the attack aircraft as a role was defined by its use during world war i , in support of ground forces on battlefields other roles , including those of light bombers , medium bombers , dive bombers , reconnaissance , fighters , fighter-bombers , could and did perform air strikes on battlefields attack aircraft came to diverge from bombers and fighters the survivability of attack aircraft was guaranteed by their speed/power , protection ( i.e armour panels ) and strength of construction ; germany was the first country to produce dedicated ground-attack aircraft ( designated cl-class and j-class ) most notable was the junkers j.i , which pioneered the idea of an armoured '' bathtub '' , that was both fuselage structure and protection for engine and crew the british experimented with the sopwith tf series ( termed '' trench fighters '' ) , although these did not see combat admittedly , the cost to the allies was high , with the royal flying corps sustaining a loss rate approaching 30 % among ground-attack aircraft nevertheless , during the 1920s , the us military , in particular , procured specialized '' attack '' aircraft and formed dedicated units , that were trained primarily for that role the us army engineering division became involved in designing ground attack aircraft the united states marine corps aviation applied close air support tactics in the banana wars the united states army air corps was notable for its creation of a separate '' a- '' designation for attack types , distinct from and alongside '' b- '' for bomber types and '' p- '' for pursuit ( later replaced by '' f- '' for fighter ) aircraft nevertheless , such aircraft , including the a-2 's replacement , the curtiss a-12 shrike , were unarmored and highly vulnerable to aa fire however , like most air arms of the period it did operate attack aircraft , named army cooperation in raf parlance , which included the hawker hector , westland lysander and others though equipped with generally unsuitable designs such as the henschel hs 123 and cannon-armed versions of the heinkel he 112 , their armament and pilots proved that aircraft were a very effective weapon , even without bombs this led to some support within the luftwaffe for the creation of an aircraft dedicated to this role , resulting in tenders for a new '' attack aircraft '' in japan , the imperial japanese navy had developed the aichi d3a dive bomber ( based on the heinkel he 70 ) and the mitsubishi b5m light attack bomber the bristol beaufighter , based on an obsolescent raf bomber , became a versatile twin-engine attack aircraft and served in almost every theatre of the war , in the maritime strike and ground attack roles as well as that of night fighter the ultimate development of the cannon-armed light attack aircraft was the small production run in 1944 of the henschel hs 129b-3 , armed with a modified pak 40 75 mm anti-tank gun the army , wishing to have its own resources to support its troops in combat and faced with a lack of air force enthusiasm for the ground-attack role , developed the dedicated attack helicopter a pattern for joint operations : world war ii close air support , north africa '' aircraft of the 1914–1918 war

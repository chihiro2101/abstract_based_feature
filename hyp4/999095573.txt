however , until the end of world war ii the a- designation was shared between attack planes and light bombers johnson 2008 , p for usaaf aircraft ( as opposed to b- prefix for medium or heavy bombers ) the us navy used a separate designation system and at the time preferred to call similar aircraft scout bombers ( sb ) or torpedo bombers ( tb or bt ) for example , douglas sbd dauntless scout bomber was designated a-24 when used by the usaaf as with many aircraft classifications , the definition of attack aircraft is somewhat vague and has tended to change over time military doctrine defines it as an aircraft which most likely performs an attack mission , more than any other kind of mission attack mission means , in turn , specifically tactical air-to-ground action—in other words , neither air-to-air action nor strategic bombing is considered an attack mission attack missions are principally divided into two categories : air interdiction and close air support in the last several decades , the rise of the ubiquitous multi-role fighter has created some confusion about the difference between attack and fighter aircraft designation system , an attack aircraft ( a ) is designed primarily for air-to-surface ( attack : aircraft designed to find , attack , and destroy land or sea targets ) designating and naming defense military aerospace vehicles 2005 missions ( also known as '' attack missions '' ) , while a fighter category f incorporates not only aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat , but additionally multipurpose aircraft designed also for ground-attack missions british designations have included fb for fighter-bomber and more recently '' g '' for '' ground-attack '' as in harrier gr1 ( meaning '' ground-attack/reconnaissance , mark 1 '' ) the attack aircraft as a role was defined by its use during world war i , in support of ground forces on battlefields battlefield support is generally divided into close air support and battlefield air interdiction , the first requiring strict and the latter only general cooperation with friendly surface forces such missions required flying where light anti-aircraft fire was expected and operating at low altitudes to precisely identify targets other roles , including those of light bombers , medium bombers , dive bombers , reconnaissance , fighters , fighter-bombers , could and did perform air strikes on battlefields while bombers could be used on a battlefield , their slower speeds made them extremely vulnerable to ground fire , as did the lighter construction of fighters the survivability of attack aircraft was guaranteed by their speed/power , protection ( i.e within the range of types serving attack roles , dive bombers were increasingly being seen as more effective than aircraft designed for strafing with machine guns or cannons nevertheless , during the 1920s , the us military , in particular , procured specialized '' attack '' aircraft and formed dedicated units , that were trained primarily for that role while they did not pioneer dive bombing tactics , marine aviators were the first to include it in their doctrine during the united states occupation of haiti and nicaragua moreover , the experiences of german condor legion during the spanish civil war , against an enemy with few fighter aircraft , changed ideas about ground attack this led to some support within the luftwaffe for the creation of an aircraft dedicated to this role , resulting in tenders for a new '' attack aircraft '' in japan , the imperial japanese navy had developed the aichi d3a dive bomber ( based on the heinkel he 70 ) and the mitsubishi b5m light attack bomber during the winter war , the soviet air forces used the polikarpov r-5sss , and polikarpov r-zsh , as attack aircraft as world war ii approached , the concept of an attack aircraft was not well defined , and various air services used many different names for widely differing types , all performing similar roles ( sometimes in tandem with non-attack roles of bombers , fighters , reconnaissance and other roles ; army co-operation the british concept of a light aircraft mixing all the roles that required extensive communication with land forces : reconnaissance , liaison , artillery spotting , aerial supply , and , last but not least , occasional strikes on the battlefield the concept was similar to front-line aircraft used in the world war i , which was called the cl class in the german empire ; light bomber during the inter-war period , the british considered that in a future war it would be france that would be the enemy ; dive bomber in some air services , dive bombers did not equip ground-attack units , but were treated as a separate class the royal air force and united states army air forces relegated obsolescent fighters to this role , while cutting-edge fighters would serve as interceptors and establish air superiority at around the same time , a massive invasion by axis forces had forced the soviet air forces to quickly expand their army support capacity , such as the ilyushin il-2 sturmovik the bristol beaufighter , based on an obsolescent raf bomber , became a versatile twin-engine attack aircraft and served in almost every theatre of the war , in the maritime strike and ground attack roles as well as that of night fighter although close air support and interdiction remain crucial to the modern battlefield , attack aircraft are less glamorous than fighters , while air force pilots and military planners have a certain well-cultivated contempt for '' mud-movers '' a primary distinction of post-world war ii aviation between the u.s air interdiction air-to-ground weaponry counter-insurgency aircraft gunship interdictor list of attack aircraft pace-finletter mou 1952 embraer emb 314 super tucano '' aircraft of the 1914–1918 war

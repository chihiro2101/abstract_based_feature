attack aircraft are identified by the prefix a- , as in '' a-6 intruder '' and '' a-10 thunderbolt ii '' however , until the end of world war ii the a- designation was shared between attack planes and light bombers johnson 2008 , p it was not until 1946 , when the us navy and us marine corps started using the '' attack '' ( a ) designation , when it renamed bt2d skyraider and btm mauler to , respectively , ad skyraider and am mauler as with many aircraft classifications , the definition of attack aircraft is somewhat vague and has tended to change over time military doctrine defines it as an aircraft which most likely performs an attack mission , more than any other kind of mission attack mission means , in turn , specifically tactical air-to-ground actionâ€”in other words , neither air-to-air action nor strategic bombing is considered an attack mission attack missions are principally divided into two categories : air interdiction and close air support in the last several decades , the rise of the ubiquitous multi-role fighter has created some confusion about the difference between attack and fighter aircraft designation system , an attack aircraft ( a ) is designed primarily for air-to-surface ( attack : aircraft designed to find , attack , and destroy land or sea targets ) designating and naming defense military aerospace vehicles 2005 the attack aircraft as a role was defined by its use during world war i , in support of ground forces on battlefields battlefield support is generally divided into close air support and battlefield air interdiction , the first requiring strict and the latter only general cooperation with friendly surface forces though such aircraft also attacked targets in rear areas attack aircraft came to diverge from bombers and fighters while bombers could be used on a battlefield , their slower speeds made them extremely vulnerable to ground fire , as did the lighter construction of fighters they were put into use in autumn 1917 , thetford 1954 , p within the range of types serving attack roles , dive bombers were increasingly being seen as more effective than aircraft designed for strafing with machine guns or cannons the us army engineering division became involved in designing ground attack aircraft the united states marine corps aviation applied close air support tactics in the banana wars the united states army air corps was notable for its creation of a separate '' a- '' designation for attack types , distinct from and alongside '' b- '' for bomber types and '' p- '' for pursuit ( later replaced by '' f- '' for fighter ) aircraft the british royal air force focused primarily on strategic bombing , rather than ground attack moreover , the experiences of german condor legion during the spanish civil war , against an enemy with few fighter aircraft , changed ideas about ground attack this led to some support within the luftwaffe for the creation of an aircraft dedicated to this role , resulting in tenders for a new '' attack aircraft '' this led to the introduction ( in 1942 ) of a unique single-seat , twin-engine attack aircraft , the slow-moving but heavily armored and formidably armed henschel hs 129 panzerknacker ( '' safecracker '' / '' tank cracker '' ) in japan , the imperial japanese navy had developed the aichi d3a dive bomber ( based on the heinkel he 70 ) and the mitsubishi b5m light attack bomber during the winter war , the soviet air forces used the polikarpov r-5sss , and polikarpov r-zsh , as attack aircraft perhaps the most notable attack type to emerge during the late 1930s was the soviet ilyushin il-2 sturmovik , which became the most-produced military aircraft type in history as world war ii approached , the concept of an attack aircraft was not well defined , and various air services used many different names for widely differing types , all performing similar roles ( sometimes in tandem with non-attack roles of bombers , fighters , reconnaissance and other roles the concept was similar to front-line aircraft used in the world war i , which was called the cl class in the german empire eventually the raf 's experience showed types such as westland lysander to be unacceptably vulnerable and it was replaced by faster fighter types for photoreconnaissance , and light aircraft for artillery spotting the last british specification issued for a light bomber was b.20/40 described as a '' close army support bomber '' capable of dive bombing and photoreconnaissance in nazi germany , the luftwaffe distinguished between the stuka ( sturzkampf- , '' dive bombing '' ) units , equipped with junkers ju 87 from schlacht ( '' battle '' ) units , using strafing/low-level bombing types such as the henschel hs 123 ) the royal air force and united states army air forces relegated obsolescent fighters to this role , while cutting-edge fighters would serve as interceptors and establish air superiority the junkers ju 87s of the german luftwaffe became virtually synonymous with close air support during the early months of world war ii at around the same time , a massive invasion by axis forces had forced the soviet air forces to quickly expand their army support capacity , such as the ilyushin il-2 sturmovik a proliferation of low intensity conflicts in the post-world war ii era has also expanded need for these types of aircraft to conduct counter-insurgency and light ground attack operations in the late 1960s the united states air force requested a dedicated close air support ( cas ) plane that became the fairchild republic a-10 thunderbolt ii a pattern for joint operations : world war ii close air support , north africa

attack aircraft are identified by the prefix a- , as in '' a-6 intruder '' and '' a-10 thunderbolt ii '' however , until the end of world war ii the a- designation was shared between attack planes and light bombers johnson 2008 , p for usaaf aircraft ( as opposed to b- prefix for medium or heavy bombers ) the us navy used a separate designation system and at the time preferred to call similar aircraft scout bombers ( sb ) or torpedo bombers ( tb or bt ) as with many aircraft classifications , the definition of attack aircraft is somewhat vague and has tended to change over time military doctrine defines it as an aircraft which most likely performs an attack mission , more than any other kind of mission attack missions are principally divided into two categories : air interdiction and close air support in the last several decades , the rise of the ubiquitous multi-role fighter has created some confusion about the difference between attack and fighter aircraft designation system , an attack aircraft ( a ) is designed primarily for air-to-surface ( attack : aircraft designed to find , attack , and destroy land or sea targets ) designating and naming defense military aerospace vehicles 2005 missions ( also known as '' attack missions '' ) , while a fighter category f incorporates not only aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat , but additionally multipurpose aircraft designed also for ground-attack missions the nato reporting names for soviet/russian ground-attack aircraft at first started with '' b '' categorizing them as bombers , as in case of il-10 'beast ' the attack aircraft as a role was defined by its use during world war i , in support of ground forces on battlefields though such aircraft also attacked targets in rear areas all these types could significantly damage ground targets from a low level flight , either by bombing , machine guns , or both attack aircraft came to diverge from bombers and fighters while bombers could be used on a battlefield , their slower speeds made them extremely vulnerable to ground fire , as did the lighter construction of fighters the survivability of attack aircraft was guaranteed by their speed/power , protection ( i.e most notable was the junkers j.i , which pioneered the idea of an armoured '' bathtub '' , that was both fuselage structure and protection for engine and crew the british experimented with the sopwith tf series ( termed '' trench fighters '' ) , although these did not see combat admittedly , the cost to the allies was high , with the royal flying corps sustaining a loss rate approaching 30 % among ground-attack aircraft within the range of types serving attack roles , dive bombers were increasingly being seen as more effective than aircraft designed for strafing with machine guns or cannons the us army engineering division became involved in designing ground attack aircraft the united states army air corps was notable for its creation of a separate '' a- '' designation for attack types , distinct from and alongside '' b- '' for bomber types and '' p- '' for pursuit ( later replaced by '' f- '' for fighter ) aircraft moreover , the experiences of german condor legion during the spanish civil war , against an enemy with few fighter aircraft , changed ideas about ground attack though equipped with generally unsuitable designs such as the henschel hs 123 and cannon-armed versions of the heinkel he 112 , their armament and pilots proved that aircraft were a very effective weapon , even without bombs this led to some support within the luftwaffe for the creation of an aircraft dedicated to this role , resulting in tenders for a new '' attack aircraft '' this led to the introduction ( in 1942 ) of a unique single-seat , twin-engine attack aircraft , the slow-moving but heavily armored and formidably armed henschel hs 129 panzerknacker ( '' safecracker '' / '' tank cracker '' ) both , like their us counterparts , were lightly armored types , and were critically reliant on surprise attacks and the absence of significant fighter or aa opposition perhaps the most notable attack type to emerge during the late 1930s was the soviet ilyushin il-2 sturmovik , which became the most-produced military aircraft type in history as world war ii approached , the concept of an attack aircraft was not well defined , and various air services used many different names for widely differing types , all performing similar roles ( sometimes in tandem with non-attack roles of bombers , fighters , reconnaissance and other roles ; dive bomber in some air services , dive bombers did not equip ground-attack units , but were treated as a separate class ; fighter-bomber although not a synonymous class with ground-attack aircraft , fighter-bombers were usually used for the role , and proved to excel at it , even when they were only lightly armored the royal air force and united states army air forces relegated obsolescent fighters to this role , while cutting-edge fighters would serve as interceptors and establish air superiority the united states navy , in distinction to the usaaf , preferred the older term '' scout-bomber '' , under a '' sb- '' designation , such as the curtiss sb2c helldiver many post-world war ii era air forces have been reluctant to adopt fixed-wing jet aircraft developed specifically for ground attack air force is currently researching a replacement for the a-10 and started the oa-x program to procure a light attack aircraft '' aircraft of the 1914â€“1918 war

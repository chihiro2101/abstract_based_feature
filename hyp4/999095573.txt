united states definition and designations attack aircraft are identified by the prefix a- , as in '' a-6 intruder '' and '' a-10 thunderbolt ii '' however , until the end of world war ii the a- designation was shared between attack planes and light bombers johnson 2008 , p the us navy used a separate designation system and at the time preferred to call similar aircraft scout bombers ( sb ) or torpedo bombers ( tb or bt ) it was not until 1946 , when the us navy and us marine corps started using the '' attack '' ( a ) designation , when it renamed bt2d skyraider and btm mauler to , respectively , ad skyraider and am mauler as with many aircraft classifications , the definition of attack aircraft is somewhat vague and has tended to change over time military doctrine defines it as an aircraft which most likely performs an attack mission , more than any other kind of mission in united states navy vocabulary , the alternative designation for the same activity is a strike mission attack missions are principally divided into two categories : air interdiction and close air support designation system , an attack aircraft ( a ) is designed primarily for air-to-surface ( attack : aircraft designed to find , attack , and destroy land or sea targets ) designating and naming defense military aerospace vehicles 2005 missions ( also known as '' attack missions '' ) , while a fighter category f incorporates not only aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat , but additionally multipurpose aircraft designed also for ground-attack missions british designations have included fb for fighter-bomber and more recently '' g '' for '' ground-attack '' as in harrier gr1 ( meaning '' ground-attack/reconnaissance , mark 1 '' ) the attack aircraft as a role was defined by its use during world war i , in support of ground forces on battlefields though such aircraft also attacked targets in rear areas attack aircraft came to diverge from bombers and fighters within the range of types serving attack roles , dive bombers were increasingly being seen as more effective than aircraft designed for strafing with machine guns or cannons nevertheless , during the 1920s , the us military , in particular , procured specialized '' attack '' aircraft and formed dedicated units , that were trained primarily for that role while they did not pioneer dive bombing tactics , marine aviators were the first to include it in their doctrine during the united states occupation of haiti and nicaragua the united states army air corps was notable for its creation of a separate '' a- '' designation for attack types , distinct from and alongside '' b- '' for bomber types and '' p- '' for pursuit ( later replaced by '' f- '' for fighter ) aircraft nevertheless , such aircraft , including the a-2 's replacement , the curtiss a-12 shrike , were unarmored and highly vulnerable to aa fire during the 1930s , nazi germany had begun to field a class of schlacht ( '' battle '' ) aircraft , such as the henschel hs 123 though equipped with generally unsuitable designs such as the henschel hs 123 and cannon-armed versions of the heinkel he 112 , their armament and pilots proved that aircraft were a very effective weapon , even without bombs this led to some support within the luftwaffe for the creation of an aircraft dedicated to this role , resulting in tenders for a new '' attack aircraft '' this led to the introduction ( in 1942 ) of a unique single-seat , twin-engine attack aircraft , the slow-moving but heavily armored and formidably armed henschel hs 129 panzerknacker ( '' safecracker '' / '' tank cracker '' ) in japan , the imperial japanese navy had developed the aichi d3a dive bomber ( based on the heinkel he 70 ) and the mitsubishi b5m light attack bomber both , like their us counterparts , were lightly armored types , and were critically reliant on surprise attacks and the absence of significant fighter or aa opposition ; army co-operation the british concept of a light aircraft mixing all the roles that required extensive communication with land forces : reconnaissance , liaison , artillery spotting , aerial supply , and , last but not least , occasional strikes on the battlefield the concept was similar to front-line aircraft used in the world war i , which was called the cl class in the german empire eventually the raf 's experience showed types such as westland lysander to be unacceptably vulnerable and it was replaced by faster fighter types for photoreconnaissance , and light aircraft for artillery spotting the last british specification issued for a light bomber was b.20/40 described as a '' close army support bomber '' capable of dive bombing and photoreconnaissance however , the specification was dropped before an aircraft went into production ; fighter-bomber although not a synonymous class with ground-attack aircraft , fighter-bombers were usually used for the role , and proved to excel at it , even when they were only lightly armored the junkers ju 87s of the german luftwaffe became virtually synonymous with close air support during the early months of world war ii a proliferation of low intensity conflicts in the post-world war ii era has also expanded need for these types of aircraft to conduct counter-insurgency and light ground attack operations the army is shifting its doctrine to favour ground-attack aircraft over attack helicopters for deep strike attack missions because ground-attack helicopters have proved to be highly vulnerable to small-arms fire ; the u.s air force is currently researching a replacement for the a-10 and started the oa-x program to procure a light attack aircraft '' aircraft of the 1914â€“1918 war

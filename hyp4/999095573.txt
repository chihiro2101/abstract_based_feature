attack aircraft are identified by the prefix a- , as in '' a-6 intruder '' and '' a-10 thunderbolt ii '' however , until the end of world war ii the a- designation was shared between attack planes and light bombers johnson 2008 , p the us navy used a separate designation system and at the time preferred to call similar aircraft scout bombers ( sb ) or torpedo bombers ( tb or bt ) as with many aircraft classifications , the definition of attack aircraft is somewhat vague and has tended to change over time military doctrine defines it as an aircraft which most likely performs an attack mission , more than any other kind of mission attack mission means , in turn , specifically tactical air-to-ground action—in other words , neither air-to-air action nor strategic bombing is considered an attack mission attack missions are principally divided into two categories : air interdiction and close air support in the last several decades , the rise of the ubiquitous multi-role fighter has created some confusion about the difference between attack and fighter aircraft missions ( also known as '' attack missions '' ) , while a fighter category f incorporates not only aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat , but additionally multipurpose aircraft designed also for ground-attack missions the nato reporting names for soviet/russian ground-attack aircraft at first started with '' b '' categorizing them as bombers , as in case of il-10 'beast ' the attack aircraft as a role was defined by its use during world war i , in support of ground forces on battlefields other roles , including those of light bombers , medium bombers , dive bombers , reconnaissance , fighters , fighter-bombers , could and did perform air strikes on battlefields all these types could significantly damage ground targets from a low level flight , either by bombing , machine guns , or both attack aircraft came to diverge from bombers and fighters armour panels ) and strength of construction ; germany was the first country to produce dedicated ground-attack aircraft ( designated cl-class and j-class ) the last battles of 1918 on the western front demonstrated that ground-attacking aircraft were a valuable component of all-arms tactics within the range of types serving attack roles , dive bombers were increasingly being seen as more effective than aircraft designed for strafing with machine guns or cannons nevertheless , during the 1920s , the us military , in particular , procured specialized '' attack '' aircraft and formed dedicated units , that were trained primarily for that role the 1920 boeing ga-1 was an armoured twin-engine triplane for ground strafing with eight machine guns and about a ton of armour plate , and the 1922 aeromarine pg-1 was a combined pursuit ( fighter ) and ground attack design with a 37mm gun the united states army air corps was notable for its creation of a separate '' a- '' designation for attack types , distinct from and alongside '' b- '' for bomber types and '' p- '' for pursuit ( later replaced by '' f- '' for fighter ) aircraft however , like most air arms of the period it did operate attack aircraft , named army cooperation in raf parlance , which included the hawker hector , westland lysander and others though equipped with generally unsuitable designs such as the henschel hs 123 and cannon-armed versions of the heinkel he 112 , their armament and pilots proved that aircraft were a very effective weapon , even without bombs in japan , the imperial japanese navy had developed the aichi d3a dive bomber ( based on the heinkel he 70 ) and the mitsubishi b5m light attack bomber eventually the raf 's experience showed types such as westland lysander to be unacceptably vulnerable and it was replaced by faster fighter types for photoreconnaissance , and light aircraft for artillery spotting ; light bomber during the inter-war period , the british considered that in a future war it would be france that would be the enemy in nazi germany , the luftwaffe distinguished between the stuka ( sturzkampf- , '' dive bombing '' ) units , equipped with junkers ju 87 from schlacht ( '' battle '' ) units , using strafing/low-level bombing types such as the henschel hs 123 ) ; fighter-bomber although not a synonymous class with ground-attack aircraft , fighter-bombers were usually used for the role , and proved to excel at it , even when they were only lightly armored the royal air force and united states army air forces relegated obsolescent fighters to this role , while cutting-edge fighters would serve as interceptors and establish air superiority the united states navy , in distinction to the usaaf , preferred the older term '' scout-bomber '' , under a '' sb- '' designation , such as the curtiss sb2c helldiver the junkers ju 87s of the german luftwaffe became virtually synonymous with close air support during the early months of world war ii the ultimate development of the cannon-armed light attack aircraft was the small production run in 1944 of the henschel hs 129b-3 , armed with a modified pak 40 75 mm anti-tank gun this weapon , the bordkanone bk 7,5 , was the most powerful forward-firing weapon fitted to a production military aircraft during world war ii the only other aircraft to be factory-equipped with similar guns were the 1,420 maritime strike variants of the north american b-25 mitchellg/h , which mounted either a m4 cannon , or light-weight t13e1 or m5 versions of the same gun ( except for versions of the piaggio p.108 armed with a 102mm anti-ship cannon , the bk 7,5 was unsurpassed as an aircraft-fitted gun until 1971 , when the four-engine lockheed ac-130e spectre ;

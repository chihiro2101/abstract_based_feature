millikan in 1891 226x226px starting in 1908 , while a professor at the university of chicago , millikan , with the significant input of fletcher , and after improving his setup , published his seminal study in 1913 in return , millikan used his influence in support of fletcher 's career at bell labs millikan and fletcher 's experiment involved measuring the force on oil droplets in a glass chamber sandwiched between two electrodes , one above and one below at the time of millikan and fletcher 's oil drop experiments , the existence of subatomic particles was not universally accepted aside from the measurement , the beauty of the oil drop experiment is that it is a simple , elegant hands-on demonstration that charge is quantized thomas edison , who had previously thought of charge as a continuous variable , became convinced after working with millikan and fletcher 's apparatus right right millikan 's and fletcher 's apparatus incorporated a parallel pair of horizontal metal plates ordinary oil would evaporate under the heat of the light source causing the mass of the oil drop to change over the course of the experiment thumb initially the oil drops are allowed to fall between the plates with the electric field turned off this enabled millikan to claim that he had calculated e to better than one half of one percent ; in fact , if millikan had included all of the data he had thrown out , the standard error of the mean would have been within 2 %

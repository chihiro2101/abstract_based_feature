millikan in 1891 226x226px starting in 1908 , while a professor at the university of chicago , millikan , with the significant input of fletcher , and after improving his setup , published his seminal study in 1913 millikan and fletcher 's experiment involved measuring the force on oil droplets in a glass chamber sandwiched between two electrodes , one above and one below with the electrical field calculated , they could measure the droplet 's charge , the charge on a single electron being at the time of millikan and fletcher 's oil drop experiments , the existence of subatomic particles was not universally accepted in 1923 , millikan won the nobel prize in physics , in part because of this experiment aside from the measurement , the beauty of the oil drop experiment is that it is a simple , elegant hands-on demonstration that charge is quantized thomas edison , who had previously thought of charge as a continuous variable , became convinced after working with millikan and fletcher 's apparatus right right millikan 's and fletcher 's apparatus incorporated a parallel pair of horizontal metal plates ordinary oil would evaporate under the heat of the light source causing the mass of the oil drop to change over the course of the experiment thumb initially the oil drops are allowed to fall between the plates with the electric field turned off

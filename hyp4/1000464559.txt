millikan in 1891 226x226px starting in 1908 , while a professor at the university of chicago , millikan , with the significant input of fletcher , and after improving his setup , published his seminal study in 1913 this remains controversial since papers found after fletcher 's death describe events in which millikan coerced fletcher into relinquishing authorship as a condition for receiving his phd millikan and fletcher 's experiment involved measuring the force on oil droplets in a glass chamber sandwiched between two electrodes , one above and one below with the electrical field calculated , they could measure the droplet 's charge , the charge on a single electron being at the time of millikan and fletcher 's oil drop experiments , the existence of subatomic particles was not universally accepted aside from the measurement , the beauty of the oil drop experiment is that it is a simple , elegant hands-on demonstration that charge is quantized thomas edison , who had previously thought of charge as a continuous variable , became convinced after working with millikan and fletcher 's apparatus thumb initially the oil drops are allowed to fall between the plates with the electric field turned off ( this is because the upwards electric force f e is greater for them than the downwards gravitational force f g , in the same way bits of paper can be picked by a charged rubber rod ) this enabled millikan to claim that he had calculated e to better than one half of one percent ; in fact , if millikan had included all of the data he had thrown out , the standard error of the mean would have been within 2 %

the post-processualists ' approach to archaeology is diametrically opposed to that of the processualists the processualists , as positivism , believed that the scientific method should and could apply to archaeological investigation , therefore allowing archaeologists to present objective statements about past societies based upon the evidence post-processual archaeology , however , questioned this stance , and instead emphasized that archaeology was subjective rather than objective , and that what truth could be ascertained from the archaeological record was often relative to the viewpoint of the archaeologist responsible for unearthing and presenting the data as the archaeologist matthew johnson noted , '' postprocessualists suggest that we can never confront theory and data ; instead , we see data through a cloud of theory due to the fact that they believe archaeology to be inherently subjective , post-processualists argue that '' all archaeologists in a similar criticism , miller and chris tilley believed that by putting forward the concept that human societies were irresistibly shaped by external influences and pressures , archaeologists were tacitly accepting social injustice ian hodder stated that archaeologists had no right to interpret the prehistories of other ethnic or cultural groups , and that instead they should simply provide individuals from these groups with the ability to construct their own views of the past while hodder 's viewpoint was not universally accepted among post-processualists , there was enough support for opposing racism , colonialism and professional elitism within the discipline that in 1986 the world archaeological congress was established whereas the processualists had been firm materialists , and the culture-historical archaeology had , by contrast , been idealists , the post-processualists argued that past societies should be interpreted through both materialist and idealist ideas they reject the 'rational ' view of 'landscape-as-a-set-of-resources ' as that of our own society and one that is ideologically loaded in its own way , loaded towards ideas of commodity and exploitation found in our own society post-processualism places great emphasis on encouraging marginalised groups to interact with archaeology although it would not be actually termed '' post-processual archaeology '' until 1985 ( by one of its most prominent proponents , ian hodder ) , an archaeological alternative to processual archaeology had begun to develop during the 1970s the third influence identified by trigger was the new cultural anthropology movement within the cultural anthropological discipline , which had arisen after the collapse of boasian anthropology post-processual archaeology began in britain during the late 1970s , spearheaded by a number of british archaeologists who had become interested in aspects of french marxist anthropology post-processual archaeology developed largely independently among the archaeological community in the united states in their article '' processual archaeology and the radical critique '' ( 1987 ) , timothy k

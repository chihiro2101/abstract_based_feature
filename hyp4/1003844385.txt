the processualists , as positivism , believed that the scientific method should and could apply to archaeological investigation , therefore allowing archaeologists to present objective statements about past societies based upon the evidence post-processual archaeology , however , questioned this stance , and instead emphasized that archaeology was subjective rather than objective , and that what truth could be ascertained from the archaeological record was often relative to the viewpoint of the archaeologist responsible for unearthing and presenting the data as the archaeologist matthew johnson noted , '' postprocessualists suggest that we can never confront theory and data ; instead , we see data through a cloud of theory ian hodder stated that archaeologists had no right to interpret the prehistories of other ethnic or cultural groups , and that instead they should simply provide individuals from these groups with the ability to construct their own views of the past while hodder 's viewpoint was not universally accepted among post-processualists , there was enough support for opposing racism , colonialism and professional elitism within the discipline that in 1986 the world archaeological congress was established within the post-processual movement , ian hodder became '' the leading exponent of a structuralist approach '' in a 1984 article , he looked at the similarities between the houses and the tombs of neolithic europe , and used a structuralist approach as a basis for his ideas on their symbolism post-processualists have also adopted beliefs regarding human agency , arguing that in other theoretical approaches to archaeology such as cultural-historical and processual , '' the individual is lost '' , and humans are therefore portrayed as '' passive dupes who blindly follow social rules post-processualism places great emphasis on encouraging marginalised groups to interact with archaeology in the 1960s and 1970s , feminist archaeology emerged as adherents of the second wave feminism movement began to argue that women in the archaeological record had been ignored by archaeologists up until that time according to archaeologist sam lucy , '' the agendas of feminist archaeology and post-processualism highlighted the importance of social and political factors on supposedly 'objective ' investigation '' the first of these was '' the marxism-inspired social anthropology that had developed in france during the 1960s and already had influenced british social anthropology post-processual archaeology developed largely independently among the archaeological community in the united states many american archaeologists also began to take note of a gender bias in the archaeological interpretation and in the discipline as a whole , as women had been largely marginalised as the archaeologists colin renfrew and paul bahn noted , '' for its most severe critics , post-processualism , while making a number of valid criticisms , simply developed some of the ideas and theoretical problems introduced by processualism preucel examined the post-processual movement 's '' radical critique '' of processualism , and while accepting that it had some merit and highlighted some important points , they came to the conclusion that on the whole , the post-processual approach was flawed because it failed to produce an explicit methodology

the processualists , as positivism , believed that the scientific method should and could apply to archaeological investigation , therefore allowing archaeologists to present objective statements about past societies based upon the evidence post-processual archaeology , however , questioned this stance , and instead emphasized that archaeology was subjective rather than objective , and that what truth could be ascertained from the archaeological record was often relative to the viewpoint of the archaeologist responsible for unearthing and presenting the data due to the fact that they believe archaeology to be inherently subjective , post-processualists argue that '' all archaeologists in a similar criticism , miller and chris tilley believed that by putting forward the concept that human societies were irresistibly shaped by external influences and pressures , archaeologists were tacitly accepting social injustice ian hodder stated that archaeologists had no right to interpret the prehistories of other ethnic or cultural groups , and that instead they should simply provide individuals from these groups with the ability to construct their own views of the past while hodder 's viewpoint was not universally accepted among post-processualists , there was enough support for opposing racism , colonialism and professional elitism within the discipline that in 1986 the world archaeological congress was established a number of post-processualists , such as michael shanks , christopher tilley and peter ucko , undermined '' archaeology 's claims to be an authoritative source of knowledge about the past '' , thereby '' encouraging people to question and resist all forms of authority… this position was hailed by its supporters as democratizing archaeology and purging it… of elitist pretensions '' whereas the processualists had been firm materialists , and the culture-historical archaeology had , by contrast , been idealists , the post-processualists argued that past societies should be interpreted through both materialist and idealist ideas this leads one to turn , for example , to optimal foraging theory and other economic models for an understanding of how people exploited the landscape 'rationally ' post-processualists instead argue that humans are free agents who in many cases act in their own interests rather than simply following societal rules , and by accepting these ideas , post-processualists argue that society is conflict-driven according to archaeologist sam lucy , '' the agendas of feminist archaeology and post-processualism highlighted the importance of social and political factors on supposedly 'objective ' investigation '' although it would not be actually termed '' post-processual archaeology '' until 1985 ( by one of its most prominent proponents , ian hodder ) , an archaeological alternative to processual archaeology had begun to develop during the 1970s post-processual archaeology developed largely independently among the archaeological community in the united states many american archaeologists had begun to recognise issues of bias within the scientific community , and within the processual movement itself which attempted to be scientific instead , it was mostly among historical archaeology ( those who study the archaeology of the historic , or literate period of the past ) , that such investigation into marginalised classes such as workers and slaves took place preucel examined the post-processual movement 's '' radical critique '' of processualism , and while accepting that it had some merit and highlighted some important points , they came to the conclusion that on the whole , the post-processual approach was flawed because it failed to produce an explicit methodology

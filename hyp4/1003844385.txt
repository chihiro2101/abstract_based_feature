the post-processualists ' approach to archaeology is diametrically opposed to that of the processualists the processualists , as positivism , believed that the scientific method should and could apply to archaeological investigation , therefore allowing archaeologists to present objective statements about past societies based upon the evidence post-processual archaeology , however , questioned this stance , and instead emphasized that archaeology was subjective rather than objective , and that what truth could be ascertained from the archaeological record was often relative to the viewpoint of the archaeologist responsible for unearthing and presenting the data as the archaeologist matthew johnson noted , '' postprocessualists suggest that we can never confront theory and data ; instead , we see data through a cloud of theory due to the fact that they believe archaeology to be inherently subjective , post-processualists argue that '' all archaeologists ian hodder stated that archaeologists had no right to interpret the prehistories of other ethnic or cultural groups , and that instead they should simply provide individuals from these groups with the ability to construct their own views of the past whereas the processualists had been firm materialists , and the culture-historical archaeology had , by contrast , been idealists , the post-processualists argued that past societies should be interpreted through both materialist and idealist ideas using an example to explain this belief in materialist-idealist unity , the archaeologist matthew johnson looked at the idea of landscape among past societies he argued that : : on the one hand , a materialist view of landscape tends to stress how it may be seen in terms of a set of resources , for example for hunter-gatherers or early farming groups postprocessualists like to stress that such an understanding of landscape was not formed in the abstract—that the way people moved around and used that landscape affected their understanding of it many , although not all post-processualists have adhered to the theory of structuralism in understanding historical societies a minority of post-processualists , such as julian thomas have however argued that human agency is not a useful aspect for looking at past societies , thereby accepting a cultural determinism position in the 1960s and 1970s , feminist archaeology emerged as adherents of the second wave feminism movement began to argue that women in the archaeological record had been ignored by archaeologists up until that time although it would not be actually termed '' post-processual archaeology '' until 1985 ( by one of its most prominent proponents , ian hodder ) , an archaeological alternative to processual archaeology had begun to develop during the 1970s bruce trigger considered this book to be '' a postprocessual showcase and counterpart to new perspectives in archaeology '' , the 1968 book written by american archaeologist lewis binford ( 1931–2011 ) that helped to launch the processual movement instead , it was mostly among historical archaeology ( those who study the archaeology of the historic , or literate period of the past ) , that such investigation into marginalised classes such as workers and slaves took place

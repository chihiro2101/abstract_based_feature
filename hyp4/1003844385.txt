the processualists , as positivism , believed that the scientific method should and could apply to archaeological investigation , therefore allowing archaeologists to present objective statements about past societies based upon the evidence post-processual archaeology , however , questioned this stance , and instead emphasized that archaeology was subjective rather than objective , and that what truth could be ascertained from the archaeological record was often relative to the viewpoint of the archaeologist responsible for unearthing and presenting the data as the archaeologist matthew johnson noted , '' postprocessualists suggest that we can never confront theory and data ; instead , we see data through a cloud of theory many post-processualists took this further and criticised the fact that archaeologists from wealthy , western countries were studying and writing the histories of poorer nations in the second and third worlds while hodder 's viewpoint was not universally accepted among post-processualists , there was enough support for opposing racism , colonialism and professional elitism within the discipline that in 1986 the world archaeological congress was established whereas the processualists had been firm materialists , and the culture-historical archaeology had , by contrast , been idealists , the post-processualists argued that past societies should be interpreted through both materialist and idealist ideas while recognizing that past societies would have interpreted the world around them in a partially materialistic way , the post-processualists argue that many historic societies have also placed a great emphasis on ideology ( which included religion ) in both interpreting their world and influencing their behaviour in the 1960s and 1970s , feminist archaeology emerged as adherents of the second wave feminism movement began to argue that women in the archaeological record had been ignored by archaeologists up until that time although it would not be actually termed '' post-processual archaeology '' until 1985 ( by one of its most prominent proponents , ian hodder ) , an archaeological alternative to processual archaeology had begun to develop during the 1970s the third influence identified by trigger was the new cultural anthropology movement within the cultural anthropological discipline , which had arisen after the collapse of boasian anthropology post-processual archaeology began in britain during the late 1970s , spearheaded by a number of british archaeologists who had become interested in aspects of french marxist anthropology in effect , he came to believe that even using the processual approach to understanding archaeological data , there were still many different ways that that data could be interpreted , and that therefore radically different conclusions could be put forward by different archaeologists , despite processualism 's claim that using the scientific method it could gain objective fact from the archaeological record post-processual archaeology developed largely independently among the archaeological community in the united states many american archaeologists also began to take note of a gender bias in the archaeological interpretation and in the discipline as a whole , as women had been largely marginalised the 1980s saw archaeological studies finally being published that dealt with this issue , namely through joan gero 's paper on '' gender bias in archaeology : a cross-cultural perspective '' ( 1983 ) and margaret conkey and janet spector 's paper on '' archaeology and the study of gender '' ( 1984 ) preucel examined the post-processual movement 's '' radical critique '' of processualism , and while accepting that it had some merit and highlighted some important points , they came to the conclusion that on the whole , the post-processual approach was flawed because it failed to produce an explicit methodology

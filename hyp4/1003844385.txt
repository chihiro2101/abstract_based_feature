the post-processualists ' approach to archaeology is diametrically opposed to that of the processualists the processualists , as positivism , believed that the scientific method should and could apply to archaeological investigation , therefore allowing archaeologists to present objective statements about past societies based upon the evidence post-processual archaeology , however , questioned this stance , and instead emphasized that archaeology was subjective rather than objective , and that what truth could be ascertained from the archaeological record was often relative to the viewpoint of the archaeologist responsible for unearthing and presenting the data as the archaeologist matthew johnson noted , '' postprocessualists suggest that we can never confront theory and data ; instead , we see data through a cloud of theory due to the fact that they believe archaeology to be inherently subjective , post-processualists argue that '' all archaeologists in a similar criticism , miller and chris tilley believed that by putting forward the concept that human societies were irresistibly shaped by external influences and pressures , archaeologists were tacitly accepting social injustice many post-processualists took this further and criticised the fact that archaeologists from wealthy , western countries were studying and writing the histories of poorer nations in the second and third worlds ian hodder stated that archaeologists had no right to interpret the prehistories of other ethnic or cultural groups , and that instead they should simply provide individuals from these groups with the ability to construct their own views of the past whereas the processualists had been firm materialists , and the culture-historical archaeology had , by contrast , been idealists , the post-processualists argued that past societies should be interpreted through both materialist and idealist ideas using an example to explain this belief in materialist-idealist unity , the archaeologist matthew johnson looked at the idea of landscape among past societies a minority of post-processualists , such as julian thomas have however argued that human agency is not a useful aspect for looking at past societies , thereby accepting a cultural determinism position although it would not be actually termed '' post-processual archaeology '' until 1985 ( by one of its most prominent proponents , ian hodder ) , an archaeological alternative to processual archaeology had begun to develop during the 1970s the third influence identified by trigger was the new cultural anthropology movement within the cultural anthropological discipline , which had arisen after the collapse of boasian anthropology in his introduction to the book , hodder noted that : : during the early period of exploration and development of ideas , premature conference presentations and individual seminars were given by various members of the cambridge group in other archaeological departments in england and abroad post-processual archaeology developed largely independently among the archaeological community in the united states preucel examined the post-processual movement 's '' radical critique '' of processualism , and while accepting that it had some merit and highlighted some important points , they came to the conclusion that on the whole , the post-processual approach was flawed because it failed to produce an explicit methodology

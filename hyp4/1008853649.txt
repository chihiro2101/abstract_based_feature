the term doctor derives from latin , meaning '' teacher '' or '' instructor '' the doctorate ( latin : doctoratus ) appeared in middle ages as a license to teach latin ( licentia docendi ) at a university the third council of the lateran of 1179 guaranteed access—at that time largely free of charge—to all able applicants this right remained a bone of contention between the church authorities and the universities , which were slowly distancing themselves from the church in 1213 the right was granted by the pope to the university of paris , where it became a universal license to teach ( licentia ubique docendi ) however , while the licentia continued to hold a higher prestige than the bachelor 's degree ( baccalaureus ) , the latter was ultimately reduced to an intermediate step to the master 's degree ( magister ) and doctorate , both of which now became the accepted teaching qualifications according to keith allan noble ( 1994 ) , the first doctoral degree was awarded in medieval paris around 1150 by the university of paris keith allan noble , changing doctoral degrees : an international perspective , society for research into higher education , 1994 , p alfred guillaume and syed farid al-attas agree that there is a resemblance between the ijazah and the licentia docendi the university as a european institution '' , in : a history of the university in europe , cambridge university press , 1992 , , pp the degrees awarded by european universities – the bachelor 's degree , the licentiate , the master 's degree , and the doctorate – have been adopted in the most diverse societies throughout the world the doctorate of philosophy developed in germany in the 17th century ( likely c in most of europe , all fields ( history , philosophy , social sciences , mathematics , and natural philosophy/natural sciences ) sooyoung chang , academic genealogy of mathematicians , world scientific , 2010 , p chris park explains that it was not until formal education and degree programs were standardized in the early 19th century that the doctorate of philosophy was reintroduced in germany as a research degree , park , c germany , however , differentiated then in more detail between doctorates in philosophy and doctorates in the natural sciences , abbreviated as dr the traditional term of study before new teachers were admitted to the guild of '' masters of arts '' was seven years , matching the apprenticeship term for other occupations after that time the german practice of requiring lecturers to have completed a research doctorate spread universities ' shift to research-oriented education ( based upon the scientific method , inquiry , and observation ) increased the doctorate 's importance professional doctorates developed in the united states from the 19th century onward at kings college ( now columbia university ) after the medical school 's founding in 1767 , although this was not a professional doctorate in the modern american sense as it was awarded for further study after the qualifying bachelor of medicine ( m.b ) rather than being a qualifying degree the modern research degree , in the shape of the german-style phd , was first awarded in the us in 1861 , at yale university this differed from the md in that the latter was a vocational '' professional degree '' that trained students to apply or practice knowledge , rather than generate it , similar to other students in vocational schools or institutes the phd spread to the uk from the us via canada , and was instituted at all british universities from 1917 , with the first ( titled a dphil ) being awarded at the university of oxford following the md , the next professional doctorate in the us , the juris doctor ( j.d when professional doctorates were established in the uk in the late 1980s and early 1990s , they did not follow the us model but were instead set up as research degrees at the same level as phds but with some taught components and a professional focus for the research work these doctorates are less common than the phd in some countries and are often awarded honoris causa the habilitation ( highest available degree ) demonstrates independent and thorough research , experience in teaching and lecturing , and , more recently , the ability to generate supportive funding since the middle ages , the number and types of doctorates awarded by universities has proliferated throughout the world while a doctorate usually entitles one to be addressed as '' doctor '' , use of the title varies widely , depending on the type and the associated occupation the best-known research degree title , in the english-speaking world , is doctor of philosophy ( abbreviated ph.d , phd or , at some british universities , dphil ) awarded in many countries throughout the world other research doctorates include the doctor of education ( ed.d ) , doctor of social science ( d.s.sc ) , doctor of business administration ( d.b.a , also awarded in japan and south korea ) , the uk engineering doctorate ( engd ) , the german engineering doctorate doktoringenieur ( dr.-ing ) the german natural science doctorate doctor rerum naturalium ( dr the uk doctor of medicine ( md or md ( res ) ) and doctor of dental surgery ( dds ) are research doctorates criteria for research doctorates vary , but typically require completion of a substantial body of original research , which may be presented as a single thesis or dissertation , or as a portfolio of shorter project reports ( thesis by publication ) the submitted dissertation is assessed by a committee of examiners , and is then typically defended by the candidate during an oral examination ( viva in the uk and india ) by the committee the time required to complete a research doctorate varies from three years , excluding undergraduate study , to six years or more the only requirement is submission of a dissertation , along with articles published in well-known journals it produced the majority of engineering doctoral degrees from national universities university-based doctoral programs called , are gradually replacing these degrees the science and technology resources of japan : a

and africa the only professional doctorate in japan is the juris doctor , known as hōmu hakushi ( 法務博士 ) the justice system reform council ( 2001 ) after successful completion of the first year of university , the student was awarded the propaedeutic diploma ( not a degree ) the candidate diploma was all but abolished by 1989 the successful completion of this thesis conveyed the doctorandus

master 's degrees , at harvard is taught in ph.d.-courses ( for instance advanced quantum mechanics or general relativity in a dutch course for the master 's degree in theoretical physics ) the promotor ( professor ) determines whether the thesis quality suffices and can be submitted to the committee of experts the actual defense lasts exactly the assigned time slot ( 45 minutes to 1 hour exactly depending on the university ) after which the defense is stopped by the bedel who closes the process in research doctorates the degree is always ph.d three dutch universities of technology ( eindhoven university of technology , delft university of technology , and university of twente ) also award a ( lower ranked ) professional doctorate in engineering ( pdeng ) although the title doctor is informally called ph.d those who obtained a degree in a foreign country can only use the dutch title drs if approved by the dienst uitvoering onderwijs though according to the opportunity principle , little effort monitors such frauds us research doctorates are awarded for successfully completing and defending independent research presented in the form of a dissertation , along with advanced study doctoral applicants were previously required to have a master 's degree , but many programs accept students immediately following undergraduate studies the 2008 version of the nsf list of research doctorates included in the survey of earned doctorates ( sed ) , contained 18 awards a doctoral degree can be revoked or rescinded by the university that awarded it

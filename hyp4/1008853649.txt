it did not become established as a graduate degree until 1930 the modern research degree , in the shape of the german-style phd , was first awarded in the us in 1861 , at yale university in the uk , research doctorates initially took the form of higher doctorates in science and letters , first introduced at durham university in 1882 the phd spread to the uk from the us via canada , and was instituted at all british universities from 1917 , with the first ( titled a dphil ) being awarded at the university of oxford these doctorates are less common than the phd in some countries and are often awarded honoris causa the habilitation is still used for academic recruitment purposes in many countries within the eu , and involves either a new long thesis ( a second book ) or a portfolio of research publications the habilitation ( highest available degree ) demonstrates independent and thorough research , experience in teaching and lecturing , and , more recently , the ability to generate supportive funding research doctorates are awarded in recognition of academic research that is publishable , at least in principle , in a peer review academic journal the best-known research degree title , in the english-speaking world , is doctor of philosophy ( abbreviated ph.d or dba ) , the uk doctor of management ( dman ) , various doctorates in engineering , such as the us doctor of engineering ( d.eng , also awarded in japan and south korea ) , the uk engineering doctorate ( engd ) , the german engineering doctorate doktoringenieur ( dr.-ing ) the german natural science doctorate doctor rerum naturalium ( dr ) and the economics and social science doctorate doctor rerum politicarum ( dr or thd ) , doctor of practical theology ( dpt ) and the doctor of sacred theology ( s.t.d ) are research doctorates in theology the submitted dissertation is assessed by a committee of examiners , and is then typically defended by the candidate during an oral examination ( viva in the uk and india ) by the committee candidates may also be required to complete graduate-level courses in their field , as well as study research methodology the time required to complete a research doctorate varies from three years , excluding undergraduate study , to six years or more until the 1990s , most natural science and engineering doctorates in japan were earned by industrial researchers in japanese companies these degrees were awarded by the employees ' former university , usually after years of research in industrial laboratories it produced the majority of engineering doctoral degrees from national universities university-based doctoral programs called , are gradually replacing these degrees by 1994 , more doctoral engineering degrees were earned for research within university laboratories ( 53 % ) than industrial research laboratories ( 47 % ) this curriculum is professionally oriented , yokohama national university law school the traditional academic system of the netherlands provided basic academic diploma : propaedeuse and three academic degrees : kandidaat ( the lowest degree ) , depending on gender doctorandus or doctoranda ( drs after successful completion of the first year of university , the student was awarded the propaedeutic diploma ( not a degree ) the successful completion of this thesis conveyed the doctorandus title , implying that the student 's initial studies were finished in addition to these 'general ' degrees , specific titles equivalent to the doctorandus degree were awarded for law : meester ( master ) ( mr the old candidate 's degree was revived to become the bachelor 's degree and the doctorandus ' ( mr and ir degree ) were replaced by master 's degrees students can only enroll in a doctorate system after completing a research university level master 's degree ;

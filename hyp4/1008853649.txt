the term doctor derives from latin , meaning '' teacher '' or '' instructor '' the doctorate ( latin : doctoratus ) appeared in middle ages as a license to teach latin ( licentia docendi ) at a university its roots can be traced to the early church in which the term doctor referred to the apostles , church fathers , and other christian authorities who taught and exegesis the right to grant a licentia docendi ( i.e the doctorate ) was originally reserved to the catholic church , which required the applicant to pass a test , to take an oath of allegiance and to pay a fee this right remained a bone of contention between the church authorities and the universities , which were slowly distancing themselves from the church in 1213 the right was granted by the pope to the university of paris , where it became a universal license to teach ( licentia ubique docendi ) according to keith allan noble ( 1994 ) , the first doctoral degree was awarded in medieval paris around 1150 by the university of paris keith allan noble , changing doctoral degrees : an international perspective , society for research into higher education , 1994 , p george makdisi theorizes that the ijazah issued in early islamic madrasahs was the origin of the doctorate later issued in medieval european universities the university as a european institution '' , in : a history of the university in europe , cambridge university press , 1992 , , pp the degrees awarded by european universities – the bachelor 's degree , the licentiate , the master 's degree , and the doctorate – have been adopted in the most diverse societies throughout the world stewart notes a difference in the granting authority ( individual professor for the ijzazah and a corporate entity in the case of the university doctorate ) the doctorate of philosophy developed in germany in the 17th century ( likely c the doctorate of philosophy adheres to this historic convention , even though the degrees are not always for the study of philosophy chris park explains that it was not until formal education and degree programs were standardized in the early 19th century that the doctorate of philosophy was reintroduced in germany as a research degree , park , c ( 2007 ) , redefining the doctorate , york , uk : the higher education academy , p , and also doctorates in the social/political sciences , abbreviated as dr university doctoral training was a form of apprenticeship to a guild originally the terms '' master '' and '' doctor '' were synonymous , but over time the doctorate came to be regarded as a higher qualification than the master 's degree the use and meaning of the doctorate has changed over time , and is subject to regional variations ) rather than being a qualifying degree the md became the standard first degree in medicine in the us during the 19th century , but as a three-year undergraduate degree ; it did not become established as a graduate degree until 1930 the md , as the standard qualifying degree in medicine , gave that profession the ability ( through the american medical association , established in 1847 for this purpose ) to set and raise standards for entry into professional practice the modern research degree , in the shape of the german-style phd , was first awarded in the us in 1861 , at yale university this differed from the md in that the latter was a vocational '' professional degree '' that trained students to apply or practice knowledge , rather than generate it , similar to other students in vocational schools or institutes in the uk , research doctorates initially took the form of higher doctorates in science and letters , first introduced at durham university in 1882 following the md , the next professional doctorate in the us , the juris doctor ( j.d however it took a long time to be accepted , not replacing the bachelor of laws ( llb ) until the 1960s , by which time the llb was generally taken as a graduate degree notably , the curriculum for the jd and llb were identical , with the degree being renamed as a doctorate , and it ( like the md ) was not equivalent to the phd , raising criticism that it was '' not a 'true doctorate when professional doctorates were established in the uk in the late 1980s and early 1990s , they did not follow the us model but were instead set up as research degrees at the same level as phds but with some taught components and a professional focus for the research work the habilitation follows the research doctorate , and in germany it can be a requirement for appointment as a privatdozent or professor the best-known research degree title , in the english-speaking world , is doctor of philosophy ( abbreviated ph.d , phd or , at some british universities , dphil ) awarded in many countries throughout the world other research doctorates include the doctor of education ( ed.d or edd ) , doctor of arts ( d.a ) , doctor of business administration ( d.b.a ) the german natural science doctorate doctor rerum naturalium ( dr or thd ) , doctor of practical theology ( dpt ) and the doctor of sacred theology ( s.t.d , students may be admitted with a bachelor 's degree , while elsewhere , e.g the time required to complete a research doctorate varies from three years , excluding undergraduate study , to six years or more it produced the majority of engineering doctoral degrees from national universities by 1994 , more doctoral engineering degrees were earned for research within university laboratories ( 53 % ) than industrial research laboratories ( 47 % ) the only professional doctorate in japan is the juris doctor , known as hōmu hakushi ( 法務博士 ) the justice system reform council ( 2001 ) this curriculum is professionally oriented , yokohama national university law school european network on law and society the traditional academic system of the netherlands provided basic academic diploma : propaedeuse and three academic degrees : kandidaat ( the lowest degree ) , depending on gender doctorandus or doctoranda ( drs ) ( with equivalent degrees in engineering – ir after successful completion of the first year of university , the student was awarded the

bologna protocol the dutch adopted the anglo-saxon system of academic degrees the old candidate 's degree was revived to become the bachelor 's degree and the doctorandus ' ( mr and ir degree ) were replaced by master 's degrees research can also be conducted without official research assistant status , for example through a business-sponsored research laboratory thesis has to be promoted by a full university professor who has the role of principal advisor a committee of experts in the field review the thesis the supervisors and promotor lose prestige among their colleagues should they allow a substandard thesis to be submitted the degree is awarded in a formal , public , defense session , in which the thesis is defended against critical questions of the '' opposition '' ( the review committee ) the actual defense lasts exactly the assigned time slot ( 45 minutes to 1 hour exactly depending on the university ) after which the defense is stopped by the bedel who closes the process upon approval from the university , the candidate receives a '' diploma de estudios avanzados '' ( part qualified doctor , equivalent to m.sc the phd was often distinguished from the earlier higher doctorates by distinctive academic dress the higher doctorates are stated to be '' a higher level of award '' , which is not covered by the qualifications frameworks many programs gauge the potential of a student applying to their program and grant a master 's degree upon completion of the necessary ph.d a doctoral degree can be revoked or rescinded by the university that awarded it

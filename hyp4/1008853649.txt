the term doctor derives from latin , meaning '' teacher '' or '' instructor '' the doctorate ( latin : doctoratus ) appeared in middle ages as a license to teach latin ( licentia docendi ) at a university its roots can be traced to the early church in which the term doctor referred to the apostles , church fathers , and other christian authorities who taught and exegesis the doctorate ) was originally reserved to the catholic church , which required the applicant to pass a test , to take an oath of allegiance and to pay a fee the third council of the lateran of 1179 guaranteed access—at that time largely free of charge—to all able applicants this right remained a bone of contention between the church authorities and the universities , which were slowly distancing themselves from the church in 1213 the right was granted by the pope to the university of paris , where it became a universal license to teach ( licentia ubique docendi ) however , while the licentia continued to hold a higher prestige than the bachelor 's degree ( baccalaureus ) , the latter was ultimately reduced to an intermediate step to the master 's degree ( magister ) and doctorate , both of which now became the accepted teaching qualifications according to keith allan noble ( 1994 ) , the first doctoral degree was awarded in medieval paris around 1150 by the university of paris keith allan noble , changing doctoral degrees : an international perspective , society for research into higher education , 1994 , p alfred guillaume and syed farid al-attas agree that there is a resemblance between the ijazah and the licentia docendi the university as a european institution '' , in : a history of the university in europe , cambridge university press , 1992 , , pp xix : '' no other european institution has spread over the entire world in the way in which the traditional form of the european university has done the degrees awarded by european universities – the bachelor 's degree , the licentiate , the master 's degree , and the doctorate – have been adopted in the most diverse societies throughout the world institutions of learning in islam and the west by george makdisi '' , journal of the american oriental society , vol the term '' philosophy '' does not refer solely to the field or academic discipline of philosophy , but is used in a broader sense in accordance with its original greek meaning , which is '' love of wisdom '' in most of europe , all fields ( history , philosophy , social sciences , mathematics , and natural philosophy/natural sciences ) sooyoung chang , academic genealogy of mathematicians , world scientific , 2010 , p were traditionally known as philosophy , and in germany and elsewhere in europe the basic faculty of liberal arts was known as the '' faculty of philosophy '' the doctorate of philosophy adheres to this historic convention , even though the degrees are not always for the study of philosophy chris park explains that it was not until formal education and degree programs were standardized in the early 19th century that the doctorate of philosophy was reintroduced in germany as a research degree , park , c originally the terms '' master '' and '' doctor '' were synonymous , but over time the doctorate came to be regarded as a higher qualification than the master 's degree university degrees , including doctorates , were originally restricted to men for instance , until the early 20th century few academic staff or professors in english-speaking universities held doctorates , except for very senior scholars and those in holy orders after that time the german practice of requiring lecturers to have completed a research doctorate spread today , a research doctorate ( phd ) or its equivalent ( as defined in the us by the nsf ) is generally a prerequisite for an academia career , although many recipients do not work in academia the md became the standard first degree in medicine in the us during the 19th century , but as a three-year undergraduate degree ; it did not become established as a graduate degree until 1930 the modern research degree , in the shape of the german-style phd , was first awarded in the us in 1861 , at yale university this differed from the md in that the latter was a vocational '' professional degree '' that trained students to apply or practice knowledge , rather than generate it , similar to other students in vocational schools or institutes the phd spread to the uk from the us via canada , and was instituted at all british universities from 1917 , with the first ( titled a dphil ) being awarded at the university of oxford however it took a long time to be accepted , not replacing the bachelor of laws ( llb ) until the 1960s , by which time the llb was generally taken as a graduate degree when professional doctorates were established in the uk in the late 1980s and early 1990s , they did not follow the us model but were instead set up as research degrees at the same level as phds but with some taught components and a professional focus for the research work these doctorates are less common than the phd in some countries and are often awarded honoris causa the habilitation ( highest available degree ) demonstrates independent and thorough research , experience in teaching and lecturing , and , more recently , the ability to generate supportive funding the habilitation follows the research doctorate , and in germany it can be a requirement for appointment as a privatdozent or professor since the middle ages , the number and types of doctorates awarded by universities has proliferated throughout the world the best-known research degree title , in the english-speaking world , is doctor of philosophy ( abbreviated ph.d , phd or , at some british universities , dphil ) awarded in many countries throughout the world other research doctorates include the doctor of education ( ed.d ) , doctor of professional studies/professional doctorate ( profdoc or dprof ) , doctor of public health ( dr.p.h , also awarded in japan and south korea ) , the uk engineering doctorate ( engd ) , the german engineering doctorate doktoringenieur ( dr.-ing the uk doctor of medicine ( md or md ( res ) ) and doctor of dental surgery ( dds ) are research doctorates criteria for research doctorates vary , but typically require completion of a substantial body of original research , which may be presented as a single thesis or dissertation , or as a portfolio of shorter project reports ( thesis by publication ) , students may be admitted with a bachelor 's degree , while elsewhere , e.g the time required to complete a research doctorate varies from three years , excluding undergraduate study , to six years or more these degrees were awarded by the employees ' former university , usually after years of research in industrial laboratories it produced the majority of engineering doctoral degrees from national universities the science and technology resources of japan : a comparison with the united states nsf.gov ( 2004-11-10 ) since 1978 , japan society for the promotion of science ( jsps ) has provided tutorial and financial support for promising researchers in asia and africa the only professional doctorate in japan is the juris doctor , known as hōmu hakushi ( 法務博士 ) the justice system reform council ( 2001 ) the traditional academic system of the netherlands provided basic academic diploma : propaedeuse and three academic degrees : kandidaat ( the lowest degree ) , depending on gender doctorandus or doctoranda ( drs it used to be attained after completion of the majority of courses of the academic study ( usually after completion of course requirements of the third year in the program ) , after which the student was allowed to begin work on their doctorandus thesis the successful completion of this thesis conveyed the doctorandus title , implying that the student 's initial studies were finished in addition to these 'general ' degrees , specific titles equivalent to the doctorandus degree were awarded for law : meester ( master ) ( mr the old candidate 's degree was revived to become the bachelor 's degree and the doctorandus ' ( mr and ir degree ) were replaced by master 's degrees students can only enroll in a doctorate system after completing a research university level master 's degree ; although dispensation can be granted on a case-by-case basis after scrutiny of the individual 's portfolio in research doctorates the degree is always ph.d the kandidat of sciences degree is usually recognised as an equivalent of the doctor of philosophy ( ph.d the degrees of kandidat and doktor of sciences are only awarded by the special governmental agency ( higher attestation commission ) ; only the university or scientific institute where the thesis was defended can recommend the award of this degree to candidates in the russian empire the academic degree '' doctor of the sciences '' ( doktor nauk ) marked the highest academic degree that can be achieved by an examination the first higher doctorate was the doctor of science at durham university , introduced in 1882 the duration of integrated doctorates is a minimum of four years , with three years spent on the research component multiple professional degrees use the term '' doctor '' in their title , such as juris doctor and doctor of medicine , but these degrees do not always contain an independent research component or always require a dissertation and should not be confused with ph.d./d.phil./ed.d./d.ed a doctor of pharmacy is awarded as the professional degree in pharmacy replacing a bachelor 's degree

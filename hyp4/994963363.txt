one of the most significant barriers to the procedure is the inability of nerve tissue to heal properly ; scarred nerve tissue does not transmit signals well , which is why a spinal cord injury is so devastating alternatively , a brainâ€“computer interface can be used connecting the subject to their own body because immune cells of the cns contribute to the maintenance of neurogenesis and spatial learning abilities in adulthood , the brain has been hypothesized to be an immune privilege ( unrejectable ) organ krieger , chief of endocrinology at mount sinai medical center in new york city , achieved success with a partial brain transplant in mice due to the human body 's need for motor functions , only a partial brain transplant is possible once the brain transplant has been completed , the white person 's consciousness takes control over the black host body ; meanwhile , the consciousness of the black person remains in the sunken place lestat demands that the procedure be used on him to allow him to be human once again , but soon finds that he has made an error and is forced to recapture james in his vampiric form so he can take his body back while the ultimate goal of transplanting is transfer of the brain to a new body optimized for it by genetics , proteomics , and/or other medical procedures , in uploading the brain itself moves nowhere and may even be physically destroyed or discarded ; the goal is rather to duplicate the information patterns contained within the brain

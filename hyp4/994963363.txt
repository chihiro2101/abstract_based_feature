one of the most significant barriers to the procedure is the inability of nerve tissue to heal properly ; scarred nerve tissue does not transmit signals well , which is why a spinal cord injury is so devastating also , for the procedure to be practical , the age of the donated body must be sufficient : an adult brain can not fit into a skull that has not reached its full growth , which occurs at age 9â€“12 years the whole-body transplant is just one of several means of putting a consciousness into a new body that have been explored in science fiction in the film get out ( 2017 ) , written and directed by jordan peele , a young , white woman , rose armitage ( allison williams ) , lures her young , black boyfriend , chris washington ( daniel kaluuya ) , to her family 's estate to be auctioned-off for a brain transplant procedure that enables older , white residents of the armitage community to obtain a pseudo-immortality in a black person 's body the armitage family is the founder of the cult the order of the coagula , in which missy armitage ( catherine keener ) , a psychiatrist , uses hypnosis to subdue the consciousness of black persons to the sunken place , and dean armitage ( bradley whitford ) , a neurosurgeon , transplants the brain of the white person into the black person 's body once the brain transplant has been completed , the white person 's consciousness takes control over the black host body ; meanwhile , the consciousness of the black person remains in the sunken place robert heinlein 's 1970 science fiction novel , i will fear no evil , features a main character named johann sebastian bach smith whose entire brain is transplanted into his deceased secretary 's skull while the ultimate goal of transplanting is transfer of the brain to a new body optimized for it by genetics , proteomics , and/or other medical procedures , in uploading the brain itself moves nowhere and may even be physically destroyed or discarded ; the goal is rather to duplicate the information patterns contained within the brain

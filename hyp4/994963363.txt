research at the wistar institute of the university of pennsylvania involving tissue-regenerating mice ( known as mrl mice ) may provide pointers for further research as to how to regenerate nerves without scarring because immune cells of the cns contribute to the maintenance of neurogenesis and spatial learning abilities in adulthood , the brain has been hypothesized to be an immune privilege ( unrejectable ) organ krieger , chief of endocrinology at mount sinai medical center in new york city , achieved success with a partial brain transplant in mice the whole-body transplant is just one of several means of putting a consciousness into a new body that have been explored in science fiction due to the human body 's need for motor functions , only a partial brain transplant is possible the sunken place is essential to suppressing the conscious minds of the hosts while the brain tissue is implanted into their skulls once the brain transplant has been completed , the white person 's consciousness takes control over the black host body ; meanwhile , the consciousness of the black person remains in the sunken place another similar literary theme , though different from either procedure described above , is the transplanting of a human brain into an artificial , usually robotic , body

it is neither as secure as the internal network , nor as insecure as the public internet in this case , the hosts most vulnerable to attack are those that provide services to users outside of the local area network , such as e-mail , web and domain name system ( dns ) servers because of the increased potential of these hosts suffering an attack , they are placed into this specific subnetwork in order to protect the rest of the network should any of them become compromised hosts in the dmz are permitted to have only limited connectivity to specific hosts in the internal network , as the content of dmz is not as secure as the internal network similarly , communication between hosts in the dmz and to the external network is also restricted to make the dmz more secure than the internet and suitable for housing these special purpose services this allows hosts in the dmz to communicate with both the internal and external network , while an intervening firewall controls the traffic between the dmz servers and the internal network clients , and another firewall would perform some level of control to protect the dmz from the external network in such architecture , the dmz usually has the application firewall and the ftp while the cmz hosts the web servers ) any service that is being provided to users on the external network can be placed in the dmz reduced internet access bandwidth requirements since some web content may be cached by the proxy server the external network is formed from the isp to the firewall on the first network interface , the internal network is formed from the second network interface , and the dmz is formed from the third network interface the second firewall ( also called '' back-end '' or '' internal '' firewall ) only allows traffic to the dmz from the internal network that is , the dmz host is able to connect to other hosts on the internal network , whereas hosts within a real dmz are prevented from connecting with the internal network by a firewall that separates them unless the firewall permits the connection

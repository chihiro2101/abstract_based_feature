in this case , the hosts most vulnerable to attack are those that provide services to users outside of the local area network , such as e-mail , web and domain name system ( dns ) servers because of the increased potential of these hosts suffering an attack , they are placed into this specific subnetwork in order to protect the rest of the network should any of them become compromised hosts in the dmz are permitted to have only limited connectivity to specific hosts in the internal network , as the content of dmz is not as secure as the internal network similarly , communication between hosts in the dmz and to the external network is also restricted to make the dmz more secure than the internet and suitable for housing these special purpose services this allows hosts in the dmz to communicate with both the internal and external network , while an intervening firewall controls the traffic between the dmz servers and the internal network clients , and another firewall would perform some level of control to protect the dmz from the external network a dmz configuration provides additional security from external attacks , but it typically has no bearing on internal attacks such as sniffing communication via a packet analyzer or spoofing such as e-mail spoofing ) any service that is being provided to users on the external network can be placed in the dmz e-mail messages and particularly the user database are confidential , so they are typically stored on servers that can not be accessed from the internet ( at least not in an insecure manner ) , but can be accessed from email servers that are exposed to the internet for security , compliance with legal standards such as hipaa , and monitoring reasons , in a business environment , some enterprises install a proxy server within the dmz the external network is formed from the isp to the firewall on the first network interface , the internal network is formed from the second network interface , and the dmz is formed from the third network interface by definition , this is not a true dmz ( demilitarized zone ) , since the router alone does not separate the host from the internal network this is also used for network protocols for which the router has no programming to handle ( 6in4 or gre tunnels are prototypical examples )

the dmz is seen as not belonging to either network bordering it in this case , the hosts most vulnerable to attack are those that provide services to users outside of the local area network , such as e-mail , web and domain name system ( dns ) servers hosts in the dmz are permitted to have only limited connectivity to specific hosts in the internal network , as the content of dmz is not as secure as the internal network similarly , communication between hosts in the dmz and to the external network is also restricted to make the dmz more secure than the internet and suitable for housing these special purpose services this allows hosts in the dmz to communicate with both the internal and external network , while an intervening firewall controls the traffic between the dmz servers and the internal network clients , and another firewall would perform some level of control to protect the dmz from the external network a dmz configuration provides additional security from external attacks , but it typically has no bearing on internal attacks such as sniffing communication via a packet analyzer or spoofing such as e-mail spoofing in such architecture , the dmz usually has the application firewall and the ftp while the cmz hosts the web servers e-mail messages and particularly the user database are confidential , so they are typically stored on servers that can not be accessed from the internet ( at least not in an insecure manner ) , but can be accessed from email servers that are exposed to the internet instead of providing a service to internal users wanting to access an external network , it provides indirect access for an external network ( usually the internet ) to internal resources the external network is formed from the isp to the firewall on the first network interface , the internal network is formed from the second network interface , and the dmz is formed from the third network interface the second firewall ( also called '' back-end '' or '' internal '' firewall ) only allows traffic to the dmz from the internal network that is , the dmz host is able to connect to other hosts on the internal network , whereas hosts within a real dmz are prevented from connecting with the internal network by a firewall that separates them unless the firewall permits the connection

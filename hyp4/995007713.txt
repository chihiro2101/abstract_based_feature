in this case , the hosts most vulnerable to attack are those that provide services to users outside of the local area network , such as e-mail , web and domain name system ( dns ) servers hosts in the dmz are permitted to have only limited connectivity to specific hosts in the internal network , as the content of dmz is not as secure as the internal network similarly , communication between hosts in the dmz and to the external network is also restricted to make the dmz more secure than the internet and suitable for housing these special purpose services this allows hosts in the dmz to communicate with both the internal and external network , while an intervening firewall controls the traffic between the dmz servers and the internal network clients , and another firewall would perform some level of control to protect the dmz from the external network it is also sometimes good practice to configure a separate classified militarized zone ( cmz ) , a highly monitored militarized zone comprising mostly web servers ( and similar servers that interface to the external world i.e in such architecture , the dmz usually has the application firewall and the ftp while the cmz hosts the web servers the most common of these services are : web servers mail servers ftp servers voip servers web servers that communicate with an internal database require access to a database server , which may not be publicly accessible and may contain sensitive information instead of providing a service to internal users wanting to access an external network , it provides indirect access for an external network ( usually the internet ) to internal resources since the proxy functions as a relay between the non-trusted network and the internal resource : it may also forward malicious traffic ( e.g a single firewall with at least 3 network interfaces can be used to create a network architecture containing a dmz the second firewall ( also called '' back-end '' or '' internal '' firewall ) only allows traffic to the dmz from the internal network that is , the dmz host is able to connect to other hosts on the internal network , whereas hosts within a real dmz are prevented from connecting with the internal network by a firewall that separates them unless the firewall permits the connection

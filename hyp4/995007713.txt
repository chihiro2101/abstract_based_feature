the dmz is seen as not belonging to either network bordering it in this case , the hosts most vulnerable to attack are those that provide services to users outside of the local area network , such as e-mail , web and domain name system ( dns ) servers hosts in the dmz are permitted to have only limited connectivity to specific hosts in the internal network , as the content of dmz is not as secure as the internal network similarly , communication between hosts in the dmz and to the external network is also restricted to make the dmz more secure than the internet and suitable for housing these special purpose services this allows hosts in the dmz to communicate with both the internal and external network , while an intervening firewall controls the traffic between the dmz servers and the internal network clients , and another firewall would perform some level of control to protect the dmz from the external network the internet ) that are not in the dmz but contain sensitive information about accessing servers within lan ( like database servers ) in such architecture , the dmz usually has the application firewall and the ftp while the cmz hosts the web servers ) any service that is being provided to users on the external network can be placed in the dmz instead of providing a service to internal users wanting to access an external network , it provides indirect access for an external network ( usually the internet ) to internal resources the external network is formed from the isp to the firewall on the first network interface , the internal network is formed from the second network interface , and the dmz is formed from the third network interface the firewall becomes a single point of failure for the network and must be able to handle all of the traffic going to the dmz as well as the internal network by definition , this is not a true dmz ( demilitarized zone ) , since the router alone does not separate the host from the internal network

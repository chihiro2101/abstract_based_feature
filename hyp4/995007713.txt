in this case , the hosts most vulnerable to attack are those that provide services to users outside of the local area network , such as e-mail , web and domain name system ( dns ) servers because of the increased potential of these hosts suffering an attack , they are placed into this specific subnetwork in order to protect the rest of the network should any of them become compromised hosts in the dmz are permitted to have only limited connectivity to specific hosts in the internal network , as the content of dmz is not as secure as the internal network similarly , communication between hosts in the dmz and to the external network is also restricted to make the dmz more secure than the internet and suitable for housing these special purpose services this allows hosts in the dmz to communicate with both the internal and external network , while an intervening firewall controls the traffic between the dmz servers and the internal network clients , and another firewall would perform some level of control to protect the dmz from the external network in such architecture , the dmz usually has the application firewall and the ftp while the cmz hosts the web servers e-mail messages and particularly the user database are confidential , so they are typically stored on servers that can not be accessed from the internet ( at least not in an insecure manner ) , but can be accessed from email servers that are exposed to the internet instead of providing a service to internal users wanting to access an external network , it provides indirect access for an external network ( usually the internet ) to internal resources a single firewall with at least 3 network interfaces can be used to create a network architecture containing a dmz by definition , this is not a true dmz ( demilitarized zone ) , since the router alone does not separate the host from the internal network a firewall may allow this if a host on the internal network first requests a connection to the host within the dmz bastion host screened subnet science dmz network architecture dmz for high performance computing

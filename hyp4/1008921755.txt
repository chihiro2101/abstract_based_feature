marshall mcluhan gave the term academic treatment in his book understanding media , written in 1964 according to cohen , author of a sociological study about youth culture and media titled folk devils and moral panics ( 1972 ) , a moral panic occurs when '' those who start the panic when they fear a threat to prevailing social or cultural values are known by researchers as 'moral entrepreneurs ' , while people who supposedly threaten social order have been described as 'folk devils ' many sociologists have pointed out the differences between definitions of a moral panic as described by american versus british sociologists kenneth thompson claimed that american sociologists tended to emphasize psychological factors , while the british portrayed '' moral panics '' as crisis of capitalism british criminologist jock young used the term in his participant observation study of drug consumption in porthmadog between 1967 and 1969 ; in policing the crisis : mugging , the state and law and order ( 1978 ) , stuart hall and his colleagues studied the public reaction to the phenomenon of robbery and the perception that it had recently been imported from american culture into the uk rising crime rate equation crime statistics , in hall 's view , are often manipulated for political and economic purposes ; moral panics could thereby be ignited to create public support for the need to '' . cohen 's stages of moral panic cohen used the term '' moral panic '' to characterize the reactions of the media , the public , and agents of social control to youth disturbances according to cohen , these groups were labelled as being outside the central core values of consensual society and as posing a threat to both the values of society and society itself , hence the term '' folk devils '' in a more recent edition of folk devils and moral panics , cohen suggested that the term '' panic '' in itself connotes irrationality and a lack of control cohen maintained that '' panic '' is a suitable term when used as an extended metaphor the concept of '' moral panic '' has also been linked to certain assumptions about the mass media cohen stated that the mass media is the primary source of the public 's knowledge about deviance and social problems he further argued that moral panic gives rise to the folk devil by labelling actions and people christian joppke , furthers the importance of media as he notes , shifts in public attention 'can trigger the decline of movements and fuel the rise of others' according to cohen , the media appear in any or all three roles in moral panic dramas : setting the agenda – selecting deviant or socially problematic events deemed as newsworthy , then using finer filters to select which events are candidates for moral panic transmitting the images – transmitting the claims by using the rhetoric of moral panics according to goode and ben-yehuda , moral panic consists of the following characteristics : concern – there must be the belief that the behavior of the group or activity deemed deviant is likely to have a negative effect on society hostility – hostility toward the group in question increases , and they become '' folk devils '' consensus – though concern does not have to be nationwide , there must be widespread acceptance that the group in question poses a very real threat to society it is important at this stage that the '' moral entrepreneurs '' are vocal and the '' folk devils '' appear weak and disorganized disproportionality – the action taken is disproportionate to the actual threat posed by the accused group writing about the blue whale challenge and the momo challenge as examples of moral panics , benjamin radford listed themes he commonly observed in modern versions of these phenomena : hidden dangers of modern technology this example reflects the fear of immigrants which emerged in the united states during the 1840s and 1850s the widespread concern regarding the perceived social threat is exhibited by the showing of the know-nothing party in the presidential election of 1856 , where they won 21.5 % of the total vote share there was particular fear over garrotting , a form of mugging in which the victim was strangled , especially after a member of parliament was attacked the panic was swelled by widespread newspaper reporting , but this is thought to have been an overreaction and much of the panic was manufactured by the press the panic resulted in a number of changes to legislation that made prison conditions more harsh and increased the corporal punishment available to the courts for garrotting offences the fear of disease ( or the fear of threats to public health ) and the spread of panic dates back many centuries and it continues to exist into the 21st century due to the existence and spread of diseases such as aids cohen 's idea of the '' folk devil '' and epidemics may be synonymous in their role in spreading mass panic and fear although the water was safe to drink in most parts of london , such a panic had arisen that very few people would dare drink the water over the years , there has been concern of various types of new music , often called '' the devil 's music '' , causing spiritual or otherwise moral corruption to younger generations it could thus be argued that this is really a series of smaller moral panics that fall under a larger umbrella while most notable in the united states , other countries such as romania have seen exposure to or promotion of the idea as well blues was one of the first music genres to receive this label , mainly due to a perception that it incited violence and other poor behavior sfgate in the early 20th century , the blues was considered disreputable , especially as white audiences began listening to the blues during the 1920s this was roughly the point where the notion of music explicitly associated with satanism as a theistic religion ( rather than generally with rebellious and unorthodox behavior ) first became widely spread , '' the toy that kills '' , 77 women 's home companion magazine 38 , november 1950 about automatic knives , or '' switchblades '' , sparked significant controversy fixation on the switchblade as the symbol of youth violence , sex , and delinquency resulted in demands from the public and congress to control the sale and possession of such knives state laws restricting or criminalizing switchblade possession and use were adopted by an increasing number of state legislatures , and many of the switchblade legality worldwide date back to this period although cohen acknowledged that mods and rockers engaged in street fighting in the mid-1960s , he argued that they were no different from the evening brawls that occurred between non-mod and non-rocker youths throughout the 1950s and early 1960s , both at seaside resorts and after football games folk devils and moral panics : the creation of the mods and rockers according to christopher ferguson , sensationalist media reports and the scientific community unintentionally worked together in '' promoting an unreasonable fear of violent video games '' another contributing factor in the moral panic over pedophiles and sex offenders was the day-care sex-abuse hysteria in the 1980s and early 1990s , including the mcmartin preschool trial in the 1980s and later , some groups , especially fundamentalist christian groups , accused the games of encouraging interest in sorcery and the veneration of demons a survey in september 2019 revealed that 61 % of americans are somewhat or very worried about a mass shooting happening in their community the united states began the war on terror , which included a war in afghanistan and a iraq war the term was used in 1830 , in a way that completely differs from its modern social science application , by a religious magazine preview making sense of moral panics : a framework for research ( palgrave studies in risk , crime and

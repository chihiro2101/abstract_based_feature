use as a social science term marshall mcluhan gave the term academic treatment in his book understanding media , written in 1964 according to cohen , author of a sociological study about youth culture and media titled folk devils and moral panics ( 1972 ) , a moral panic occurs when '' a condition , episode , person or group of persons emerges to become defined as a threat to society and interests '' those who start the panic when they fear a threat to prevailing social or cultural values are known by researchers as 'moral entrepreneurs ' , while people who supposedly threaten social order have been described as 'folk devils ' many sociologists have pointed out the differences between definitions of a moral panic as described by american versus british sociologists kenneth thompson claimed that american sociologists tended to emphasize psychological factors , while the british portrayed '' moral panics '' as crisis of capitalism british criminologist jock young used the term in his participant observation study of drug consumption in porthmadog between 1967 and 1969 crime statistics , in hall 's view , are often manipulated for political and economic purposes ; moral panics could thereby be ignited to create public support for the need to '' . cohen 's stages of moral panic cohen used the term '' moral panic '' to characterize the reactions of the media , the public , and agents of social control to youth disturbances this work , involving the mods and rockers , demonstrated how agents of social control amplified deviance according to cohen , these groups were labelled as being outside the central core values of consensual society and as posing a threat to both the values of society and society itself , hence the term '' folk devils '' the concept of '' moral panic '' has also been linked to certain assumptions about the mass media he further argued that moral panic gives rise to the folk devil by labelling actions and people transmitting the images – transmitting the claims by using the rhetoric of moral panics consensus – though concern does not have to be nationwide , there must be widespread acceptance that the group in question poses a very real threat to society volatility – moral panics are highly volatile and tend to disappear as quickly as they appeared because public interest wanes or news reports change to another narrative this example reflects the fear of immigrants which emerged in the united states during the 1840s and 1850s a short-lived national know nothing embodied the moral panic theory , focusing upon catholic immigrants and labelling them as members of an '' out-group '' this was due to their rejection of traditional americanism the panic was swelled by widespread newspaper reporting , but this is thought to have been an overreaction and much of the panic was manufactured by the press the panic resulted in a number of changes to legislation that made prison conditions more harsh and increased the corporal punishment available to the courts for garrotting offences cohen 's idea of the '' folk devil '' and epidemics may be synonymous in their role in spreading mass panic and fear during the year 1919 , the year 1920 , the late 1940s , and the 1950s , the united states had a moral panic over communism and feared being attacked by the soviet union over the years , there has been concern of various types of new music , often called '' the devil 's music '' , causing spiritual or otherwise moral corruption to younger generations while the types of music popularly labeled '' the devil 's music '' has changed with time , along with the intended meaning of the term , this basic factor of the moral panic has remained constant while most notable in the united states , other countries such as romania have seen exposure to or promotion of the idea as well ( laveyan satanism and other ideological variants would not be created until the mid-to-late 1960s , and '' devil 's music '' moral panics tend to either not recognize them as different or make no distinction however , in some crank communities , the aforementioned applications and meanings of the term '' the devil 's music '' are still widely in use fixation on the switchblade as the symbol of youth violence , sex , and delinquency resulted in demands from the public and congress to control the sale and possession of such knives minus switchblade knives and the distorted feeling of power they beget—power that is swaggering , reckless , and itching to express itself in violence—our delinquent adolescents would be shorn of one of their most potent means of incitement to crime '' the '' mods and rockers '' conflict was explored as an instance of moral panic by sociologist stanley cohen in his study folk devils and moral panics , cohen , stanley ( 2002 ) folk devils and moral panics : the creation of the mods and rockers folk devils and moral panics : the creation of the mods and rockers research shows that fear of increasing crime rates is often the cause of moral panics japanese jurist : ja : 浜井浩一 explains how the changes in crime recording in japan since the 1990s caused people to believe that the crime rate was rising and that crimes were getting increasingly severe , someone gave three children trick‐or‐treat apples with sewing needles in them there have been calls to regulate violence in video games for nearly as long as the video game industry has existed , with death race being a notable early example according to christopher ferguson , sensationalist media reports and the scientific community unintentionally worked together in '' promoting an unreasonable fear of violent video games '' supreme court ruled that legally restricting sales of video games to minors would be unconstitutional and deemed the research presented in favour of regulation , as '' unpersuasive '' some critics have pointed to moral panic as an explanation for the war on drugs while homosexuality was becoming more socially accepted after the sexual revolution , pro-contact pedophiles believed that the sexual revolution never helped pro-contact pedophiles despite receiving some support , pie received much backlash when they advocated for abolishing or lowering age of consent laws the murder of adam walsh took over nationwide news and led to a moral panic over child abduction after adam walsh was killed , new laws for missing children were created according to criminologist richard moran , '' the adam walsh case created a nation of petrified kids and paranoid parents this data led to society believing that sex offenders have a particularly high recidivism rate , which led to the creation of sex offender registry another contributing factor in the moral panic over pedophiles and sex offenders was the day-care sex-abuse hysteria in the 1980s and early 1990s , including the mcmartin preschool trial many critics of contemporary anti-prostitution activism argue that much of the current concern about human trafficking and its more general conflation with prostitution and other forms of sex work have hallmarks of moral panic '' their argument is that mass media has changed since the concept of moral panic emerged so '' that 'folk devils ' are less marginalized than they once were '' , and that 'folk devils ' are not only castigated by mass media but supported and defended by it as well making sense of moral panics : a framework for research ( palgrave studies in risk , crime and society , 2017 )

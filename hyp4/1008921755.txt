according to cohen , author of a sociological study about youth culture and media titled folk devils and moral panics ( 1972 ) , a moral panic occurs when '' a condition , episode , person or group of persons emerges to become defined as a threat to society and interests '' those who start the panic when they fear a threat to prevailing social or cultural values are known by researchers as 'moral entrepreneurs ' , while people who supposedly threaten social order have been described as 'folk devils ' many sociologists have pointed out the differences between definitions of a moral panic as described by american versus british sociologists kenneth thompson claimed that american sociologists tended to emphasize psychological factors , while the british portrayed '' moral panics '' as crisis of capitalism british criminologist jock young used the term in his participant observation study of drug consumption in porthmadog between 1967 and 1969 ; in policing the crisis : mugging , the state and law and order ( 1978 ) , stuart hall and his colleagues studied the public reaction to the phenomenon of robbery and the perception that it had recently been imported from american culture into the uk employing cohen 's definition of 'moral panic ' , hall et al crime statistics , in hall 's view , are often manipulated for political and economic purposes ; moral panics could thereby be ignited to create public support for the need to '' . cohen 's stages of moral panic cohen used the term '' moral panic '' to characterize the reactions of the media , the public , and agents of social control to youth disturbances according to cohen , these groups were labelled as being outside the central core values of consensual society and as posing a threat to both the values of society and society itself , hence the term '' folk devils '' cohen maintained that '' panic '' is a suitable term when used as an extended metaphor the concept of '' moral panic '' has also been linked to certain assumptions about the mass media he further argued that moral panic gives rise to the folk devil by labelling actions and people moral panics have several distinct features consensus – though concern does not have to be nationwide , there must be widespread acceptance that the group in question poses a very real threat to society disproportionality – the action taken is disproportionate to the actual threat posed by the accused group writing about the blue whale challenge and the momo challenge as examples of moral panics , benjamin radford listed themes he commonly observed in modern versions of these phenomena : hidden dangers of modern technology a short-lived national know nothing embodied the moral panic theory , focusing upon catholic immigrants and labelling them as members of an '' out-group '' it is important to note the quick decline in political success for the know nothing-party as a result of a decline in concern for the perceived social threat , an indicative feature of the movements situated in moral panic the fear of disease ( or the fear of threats to public health ) and the spread of panic dates back many centuries and it continues to exist into the 21st century due to the existence and spread of diseases such as aids cohen 's idea of the '' folk devil '' and epidemics may be synonymous in their role in spreading mass panic and fear the great stink of 1858 was blamed on miasma , along with reoccurring cholera epidemics during the victorian era although the water was safe to drink in most parts of london , such a panic had arisen that very few people would dare drink the water during the year 1919 , the year 1920 , the late 1940s , and the 1950s , the united states had a moral panic over communism and feared being attacked by the soviet union it could thus be argued that this is really a series of smaller moral panics that fall under a larger umbrella blues was one of the first music genres to receive this label , mainly due to a perception that it incited violence and other poor behavior at the time , traditionalists considered jazz to contribute to the breakdown of morality at this stage , the idea of a link between music and theistic satanism was not a major component in the accusations of blues , jazz , or other genres of music ( laveyan satanism and other ideological variants would not be created until the mid-to-late 1960s , and '' devil 's music '' moral panics tend to either not recognize them as different or make no distinction this was roughly the point where the notion of music explicitly associated with satanism as a theistic religion ( rather than generally with rebellious and unorthodox behavior ) first became widely spread some have speculated that the rock phase of the panic in the 1970s and 1980s contributed to the popularity of the satanic ritual abuse moral panic in the 1980s there are also applications of the term to musical genres that to others would seem unusual or irrational to be labeled '' the devil 's music '' , such as country and christian rock , but these ideas never caught on like the above examples and today tend to not be common outside the aforementioned crank communities minus switchblade knives and the distorted feeling of power they beget—power that is swaggering , reckless , and itching to express itself in violence—our delinquent adolescents would be shorn of one of their most potent means of incitement to crime '' the '' mods and rockers '' conflict was explored as an instance of moral panic by sociologist stanley cohen in his study folk devils and moral panics , cohen , stanley ( 2002 ) research shows that fear of increasing crime rates is often the cause of moral panics recent studies have shown that despite declining crime rates , this phenomenon , which often taps into a population 's '' herd mentality '' , continues to occur in various cultures , someone gave three children trick‐or‐treat apples with sewing needles in them '' rumors of randomly-distributed poison candy or fruit are nothing more than urban legends ; no child has ever been killed by eating a halloween candy from a stranger there have been calls to regulate violence in video games for nearly as long as the video game industry has existed , with death race being a notable early example according to christopher ferguson , sensationalist media reports and the scientific community unintentionally worked together in '' promoting an unreasonable fear of violent video games '' '' since the 1990s , there have been attempts to regulate violent video games in the united states through congressional bills as well as within the industry ferguson and others have explained the video game moral panic as part of a cycle that all new media go through for example , a 2009 australian study found that drug panel tests were unable to detect any drug in any of the 97 instances of patients admitted to the hospital believing their drinks might have been spiked . 1970s–present : sex offenders , child sexual abuse , and pedophilia one study reported high levels of anger , fear and social rejection towards pedophiles who have not committed a crime society 's attitude towards child sexual abuse is extremely negative , with some surveys ranking child sexual abuse as morally worse than murder the act specifically focused on pit bulls , which were associated with the lower social strata of british society , rather than the rottweilers and dobermann-pinschers generally owned by richer social groups cited in in '' rethinking 'moral panic ' for multi-mediated social worlds '' , angela mcrobbie and sarah thornton argued '' that it is now time that every stage in the process of constructing a moral panic , as well as the social relations which support it , should be revised the revisions are compatible with the way in which cohen theorizes panics in the third introduction to folk devils and moral panics making sense of moral panics : a framework for research ( palgrave studies in risk , crime and society , 2017 )

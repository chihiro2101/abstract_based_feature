marshall mcluhan gave the term academic treatment in his book understanding media , written in 1964 according to cohen , author of a sociological study about youth culture and media titled folk devils and moral panics ( 1972 ) , a moral panic occurs when '' a condition , episode , person or group of persons emerges to become defined as a threat to society and interests '' those who start the panic when they fear a threat to prevailing social or cultural values are known by researchers as 'moral entrepreneurs ' , while people who supposedly threaten social order have been described as 'folk devils ' many sociologists have pointed out the differences between definitions of a moral panic as described by american versus british sociologists kenneth thompson claimed that american sociologists tended to emphasize psychological factors , while the british portrayed '' moral panics '' as crisis of capitalism british criminologist jock young used the term in his participant observation study of drug consumption in porthmadog between 1967 and 1969 ; in policing the crisis : mugging , the state and law and order ( 1978 ) , stuart hall and his colleagues studied the public reaction to the phenomenon of robbery and the perception that it had recently been imported from american culture into the uk . cohen 's stages of moral panic cohen used the term '' moral panic '' to characterize the reactions of the media , the public , and agents of social control to youth disturbances this work , involving the mods and rockers , demonstrated how agents of social control amplified deviance according to cohen , these groups were labelled as being outside the central core values of consensual society and as posing a threat to both the values of society and society itself , hence the term '' folk devils '' in a more recent edition of folk devils and moral panics , cohen suggested that the term '' panic '' in itself connotes irrationality and a lack of control the concept of '' moral panic '' has also been linked to certain assumptions about the mass media cohen stated that the mass media is the primary source of the public 's knowledge about deviance and social problems he further argued that moral panic gives rise to the folk devil by labelling actions and people christian joppke , furthers the importance of media as he notes , shifts in public attention 'can trigger the decline of movements and fuel the rise of others' breaking the silence and making the claim consensus – though concern does not have to be nationwide , there must be widespread acceptance that the group in question poses a very real threat to society volatility – moral panics are highly volatile and tend to disappear as quickly as they appeared because public interest wanes or news reports change to another narrative the widespread concern regarding the perceived social threat is exhibited by the showing of the know-nothing party in the presidential election of 1856 , where they won 21.5 % of the total vote share in 1856 and again in 1862–1863 london garotting panics over a perceived rise in criminal behaviour citizens thought that the abolition of transportation to australia and the introduction of the ticket of leave scheme to release prisoners on licence had led to an increase in criminality the panic resulted in a number of changes to legislation that made prison conditions more harsh and increased the corporal punishment available to the courts for garrotting offences the fear of disease ( or the fear of threats to public health ) and the spread of panic dates back many centuries and it continues to exist into the 21st century due to the existence and spread of diseases such as aids cohen 's idea of the '' folk devil '' and epidemics may be synonymous in their role in spreading mass panic and fear the great stink of 1858 was blamed on miasma , along with reoccurring cholera epidemics during the victorian era although the water was safe to drink in most parts of london , such a panic had arisen that very few people would dare drink the water in the late 1940s and the 1950s , senator joseph mccarthy led a witch hunt against communists called mccarthyism , where people were accused of being communists while the types of music popularly labeled '' the devil 's music '' has changed with time , along with the intended meaning of the term , this basic factor of the moral panic has remained constant it could thus be argued that this is really a series of smaller moral panics that fall under a larger umbrella blues was one of the first music genres to receive this label , mainly due to a perception that it incited violence and other poor behavior sfgate in the early 20th century , the blues was considered disreputable , especially as white audiences began listening to the blues during the 1920s fass , the damned and the beautiful : american youth in the 1920s ( 1977 ) , p ( laveyan satanism and other ideological variants would not be created until the mid-to-late 1960s , and '' devil 's music '' moral panics tend to either not recognize them as different or make no distinction since the mid-to-late 1980s , the term has been closely associated with heavy metal music through falsifiable concepts like backmasking , as well as overt content of some major acts in the genre , and the pmrc 's activities however , in some crank communities , the aforementioned applications and meanings of the term '' the devil 's music '' are still widely in use fixation on the switchblade as the symbol of youth violence , sex , and delinquency resulted in demands from the public and congress to control the sale and possession of such knives , '' the switchblade menace '' , okca newsletter ( 1993 ) : rep minus switchblade knives and the distorted feeling of power they beget—power that is swaggering , reckless , and itching to express itself in violence—our delinquent adolescents would be shorn of one of their most potent means of incitement to crime '' the '' mods and rockers '' conflict was explored as an instance of moral panic by sociologist stanley cohen in his study folk devils and moral panics , cohen , stanley ( 2002 ) folk devils and moral panics : the creation of the mods and rockers '' us newspapers ' portrayals of home invasion crime '' recent studies have shown that despite declining crime rates , this phenomenon , which often taps into a population 's '' herd mentality '' , continues to occur in various cultures these two movements overlapped in 1975 , creating a new political agenda about child sexual abuse kids used to be able to go out and organize a stickball game , and now all playdates and the social lives of children are arranged and controlled by the parents this led to a moral panic where parents became hypervigilant with concerns of predatory child sex offenders seeking to abduct children in public spaces , such as playgrounds in the 1990s , blame shifted to '' uncivilized africans '' as the new '' folk devils '' , with a popular theory alleging that hiv originated from humans having sex with simians worrying about this was most common among women ( 58 % ) , adults ages 18–34 ( 54 % ) , democrats ( and democrat-leaning independents ) ( 64 % ) , and owners ( 58 % ) cited in in '' rethinking 'moral panic ' for multi-mediated social worlds '' , angela mcrobbie and sarah thornton argued '' that it is now time that every stage in the process of constructing a moral panic , as well as the social relations which support it , should be revised '' their argument is that mass media has changed since the concept of moral panic emerged so '' that 'folk devils ' are less marginalized than they once were '' , and that 'folk devils ' are not only castigated by mass media but supported and defended by it as well making sense of moral panics : a framework for research ( palgrave studies in risk , crime and society , 2017 )

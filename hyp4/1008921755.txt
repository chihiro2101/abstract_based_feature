marshall mcluhan gave the term academic treatment in his book understanding media , written in 1964 according to cohen , author of a sociological study about youth culture and media titled folk devils and moral panics ( 1972 ) , a moral panic occurs when '' a condition , episode , person or group of persons emerges to become defined as a threat to society and interests '' those who start the panic when they fear a threat to prevailing social or cultural values are known by researchers as 'moral entrepreneurs ' , while people who supposedly threaten social order have been described as 'folk devils ' many sociologists have pointed out the differences between definitions of a moral panic as described by american versus british sociologists british criminologist jock young used the term in his participant observation study of drug consumption in porthmadog between 1967 and 1969 ; in policing the crisis : mugging , the state and law and order ( 1978 ) , stuart hall and his colleagues studied the public reaction to the phenomenon of robbery and the perception that it had recently been imported from american culture into the uk employing cohen 's definition of 'moral panic ' , hall et al crime statistics , in hall 's view , are often manipulated for political and economic purposes ; moral panics could thereby be ignited to create public support for the need to '' cohen used the term '' moral panic '' to characterize the reactions of the media , the public , and agents of social control to youth disturbances according to cohen , these groups were labelled as being outside the central core values of consensual society and as posing a threat to both the values of society and society itself , hence the term '' folk devils '' in a more recent edition of folk devils and moral panics , cohen suggested that the term '' panic '' in itself connotes irrationality and a lack of control cohen maintained that '' panic '' is a suitable term when used as an extended metaphor the concept of '' moral panic '' has also been linked to certain assumptions about the mass media cohen stated that the mass media is the primary source of the public 's knowledge about deviance and social problems he further argued that moral panic gives rise to the folk devil by labelling actions and people christian joppke , furthers the importance of media as he notes , shifts in public attention 'can trigger the decline of movements and fuel the rise of others' according to cohen , the media appear in any or all three roles in moral panic dramas : setting the agenda – selecting deviant or socially problematic events deemed as newsworthy , then using finer filters to select which events are candidates for moral panic moral panics have several distinct features according to goode and ben-yehuda , moral panic consists of the following characteristics : concern – there must be the belief that the behavior of the group or activity deemed deviant is likely to have a negative effect on society hostility – hostility toward the group in question increases , and they become '' folk devils '' consensus – though concern does not have to be nationwide , there must be widespread acceptance that the group in question poses a very real threat to society it is important at this stage that the '' moral entrepreneurs '' are vocal and the '' folk devils '' appear weak and disorganized a short-lived national know nothing embodied the moral panic theory , focusing upon catholic immigrants and labelling them as members of an '' out-group '' citizens thought that the abolition of transportation to australia and the introduction of the ticket of leave scheme to release prisoners on licence had led to an increase in criminality the panic was swelled by widespread newspaper reporting , but this is thought to have been an overreaction and much of the panic was manufactured by the press the panic resulted in a number of changes to legislation that made prison conditions more harsh and increased the corporal punishment available to the courts for garrotting offences the fear of disease ( or the fear of threats to public health ) and the spread of panic dates back many centuries and it continues to exist into the 21st century due to the existence and spread of diseases such as aids during the year 1919 , the year 1920 , the late 1940s , and the 1950s , the united states had a moral panic over communism and feared being attacked by the soviet union over the years , there has been concern of various types of new music , often called '' the devil 's music '' , causing spiritual or otherwise moral corruption to younger generations ( laveyan satanism and other ideological variants would not be created until the mid-to-late 1960s , and '' devil 's music '' moral panics tend to either not recognize them as different or make no distinction some have speculated that the rock phase of the panic in the 1970s and 1980s contributed to the popularity of the satanic ritual abuse moral panic in the 1980s since the mid-to-late 1980s , the term has been closely associated with heavy metal music through falsifiable concepts like backmasking , as well as overt content of some major acts in the genre , and the pmrc 's activities however , in some crank communities , the aforementioned applications and meanings of the term '' the devil 's music '' are still widely in use it was further fuelled by highly popular films of the late 1950s , including rebel without a cause , crime in the streets , 12 angry men , the delinquents , high school confidential , and the 1957 broadway musical , west side story minus switchblade knives and the distorted feeling of power they beget—power that is swaggering , reckless , and itching to express itself in violence—our delinquent adolescents would be shorn of one of their most potent means of incitement to crime '' folk devils and moral panics : the creation of the mods and rockers there have been calls to regulate violence in video games for nearly as long as the video game industry has existed , with death race being a notable early example according to christopher ferguson , sensationalist media reports and the scientific community unintentionally worked together in '' promoting an unreasonable fear of violent video games '' '' since the 1990s , there have been attempts to regulate violent video games in the united states through congressional bills as well as within the industry ferguson and others have explained the video game moral panic as part of a cycle that all new media go through supreme court ruled that legally restricting sales of video games to minors would be unconstitutional and deemed the research presented in favour of regulation , as '' unpersuasive '' for example , a royal society of arts commission concluded that '' the misuse of drugs act 1971 some have written that one of the many rungs supporting the moral panic behind the war on drugs was a separate but related moral panic , which peaked in the late 1990s , involving media 's gross exaggeration of the date rape drug media coverage despite receiving some support , pie received much backlash when they advocated for abolishing or lowering age of consent laws as a result , people protested against pie the sexual part of child abuse became prominent in the united states due to the encounter of two political agendas : the fight against battered child syndrome by pediatricians during the 1960s and the feminist anti-rape movement , in particular the denunciation of domestic sexual violence '' although the concern over child sexual abuse was caused by feminists , the concern over child sexual abuse also attracted traditional groups and conservative groups for example , in britain , a prominent advertisement by the government suggested that the public was uninformed about hiv/aids due to a lack of publicly accessible and accurate information once it became clear that this was not the case , the moral panic created by the media changed to blaming the overall negligence of ethical standards by the younger generation ( both male and female ) , resulting in another moral panic '' their argument is that mass media has changed since the concept of moral panic emerged so '' that 'folk devils ' are less marginalized than they once were '' , and that 'folk devils ' are not only castigated by mass media but supported and defended by it as well the term was used in 1830 , in a way that completely differs from its modern social science application , by a

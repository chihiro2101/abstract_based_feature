use as a social science term marshall mcluhan gave the term academic treatment in his book understanding media , written in 1964 according to cohen , author of a sociological study about youth culture and media titled folk devils and moral panics ( 1972 ) , a moral panic occurs when '' a condition , episode , person or group of persons emerges to become defined as a threat to society and interests '' those who start the panic when they fear a threat to prevailing social or cultural values are known by researchers as 'moral entrepreneurs ' , while people who supposedly threaten social order have been described as 'folk devils ' many sociologists have pointed out the differences between definitions of a moral panic as described by american versus british sociologists kenneth thompson claimed that american sociologists tended to emphasize psychological factors , while the british portrayed '' moral panics '' as crisis of capitalism ; in policing the crisis : mugging , the state and law and order ( 1978 ) , stuart hall and his colleagues studied the public reaction to the phenomenon of robbery and the perception that it had recently been imported from american culture into the uk crime statistics , in hall 's view , are often manipulated for political and economic purposes ; moral panics could thereby be ignited to create public support for the need to '' . cohen 's stages of moral panic cohen used the term '' moral panic '' to characterize the reactions of the media , the public , and agents of social control to youth disturbances this work , involving the mods and rockers , demonstrated how agents of social control amplified deviance according to cohen , these groups were labelled as being outside the central core values of consensual society and as posing a threat to both the values of society and society itself , hence the term '' folk devils '' in a more recent edition of folk devils and moral panics , cohen suggested that the term '' panic '' in itself connotes irrationality and a lack of control the concept of '' moral panic '' has also been linked to certain assumptions about the mass media cohen stated that the mass media is the primary source of the public 's knowledge about deviance and social problems he further argued that moral panic gives rise to the folk devil by labelling actions and people according to goode and ben-yehuda , moral panic consists of the following characteristics : concern – there must be the belief that the behavior of the group or activity deemed deviant is likely to have a negative effect on society consensus – though concern does not have to be nationwide , there must be widespread acceptance that the group in question poses a very real threat to society it is important at this stage that the '' moral entrepreneurs '' are vocal and the '' folk devils '' appear weak and disorganized disproportionality – the action taken is disproportionate to the actual threat posed by the accused group volatility – moral panics are highly volatile and tend to disappear as quickly as they appeared because public interest wanes or news reports change to another narrative nativist criticism of immigrants from catholic nations centered upon the control of the pope over the church it is important to note the quick decline in political success for the know nothing-party as a result of a decline in concern for the perceived social threat , an indicative feature of the movements situated in moral panic in 1856 and again in 1862–1863 london garotting panics over a perceived rise in criminal behaviour citizens thought that the abolition of transportation to australia and the introduction of the ticket of leave scheme to release prisoners on licence had led to an increase in criminality there was particular fear over garrotting , a form of mugging in which the victim was strangled , especially after a member of parliament was attacked the panic was swelled by widespread newspaper reporting , but this is thought to have been an overreaction and much of the panic was manufactured by the press the fear of disease ( or the fear of threats to public health ) and the spread of panic dates back many centuries and it continues to exist into the 21st century due to the existence and spread of diseases such as aids cohen 's idea of the '' folk devil '' and epidemics may be synonymous in their role in spreading mass panic and fear the great stink of 1858 was blamed on miasma , along with reoccurring cholera epidemics during the victorian era during the year 1919 , the year 1920 , the late 1940s , and the 1950s , the united states had a moral panic over communism and feared being attacked by the soviet union while most notable in the united states , other countries such as romania have seen exposure to or promotion of the idea as well jazz was another early receiver of the label fass , the damned and the beautiful : american youth in the 1920s ( 1977 ) , p at this stage , the idea of a link between music and theistic satanism was not a major component in the accusations of blues , jazz , or other genres of music ( laveyan satanism and other ideological variants would not be created until the mid-to-late 1960s , and '' devil 's music '' moral panics tend to either not recognize them as different or make no distinction this was roughly the point where the notion of music explicitly associated with satanism as a theistic religion ( rather than generally with rebellious and unorthodox behavior ) first became widely spread some have speculated that the rock phase of the panic in the 1970s and 1980s contributed to the popularity of the satanic ritual abuse moral panic in the 1980s since the mid-to-late 1980s , the term has been closely associated with heavy metal music through falsifiable concepts like backmasking , as well as overt content of some major acts in the genre , and the pmrc 's activities in the united states , a 1950 article titled '' the toy that kills '' in the women 's home companion , pollack , jack h it was further fuelled by highly popular films of the late 1950s , including rebel without a cause , crime in the streets , 12 angry men , the delinquents , high school confidential , and the 1957 broadway musical , west side story fixation on the switchblade as the symbol of youth violence , sex , and delinquency resulted in demands from the public and congress to control the sale and possession of such knives , '' the switchblade menace '' , okca newsletter ( 1993 ) : rep state laws restricting or criminalizing switchblade possession and use were adopted by an increasing number of state legislatures , and many of the switchblade legality worldwide date back to this period the '' mods and rockers '' conflict was explored as an instance of moral panic by sociologist stanley cohen in his study folk devils and moral panics , cohen , stanley ( 2002 ) until the first half of the 1970s , sex was not yet part of the concept of domestic child abuse , which used to be limited to physical abuse and neglect the moral panic over sex offenders and pedophiles became very intense in the early 1980s no distinction obtains for the agenda between 'quality ' and 'tabloid ' newspapers , or between 'popular ' and 'serious ' television the united states began the war on terror , which included a war in afghanistan and a iraq war '' their argument is that mass media has changed since the concept of moral panic emerged so '' that 'folk devils ' are less marginalized than they once were '' , and that 'folk devils ' are not only castigated by mass media but supported and defended by it as well another british criminologist , steve hall , goes a step further to suggest that the term 'moral panic ' is a fundamental category

the response was so enthusiastic that dorsey sold 4,000 print copies of his song in between recording sessions with tampa red , and inspired by the compliments he received , he formed a choir at ebenezer baptist church at the request of the pastor , reverend james smith , who had an affinity for negro spirituals and indigenous singing styles dorsey and ebenezer 's music director theodore frye trained the new chorus to deliver his songs with a gospel blues sound : lively , joyous theatrical performances with embellished and elongated notes accentuated with rhythmic clapping and shouts this new style began to catch on in chicago , and dorsey 's musical partners theodore frye , magnolia lewis butts , and henry carruthers urged him to organize a convention where musicians could learn gospel blues in 1932 however , just as dorsey co-founded the gospel choral union of chicago – eventually renamed the national convention of gospel choirs and choruses ( ncgcc ) , his wife nettie died in childbirth , then 24 hours later , their son now at the center of gospel music activity in chicago , dorsey countered his bereavement by immersing himself in marketing his songs norton , kay , '' 'yes , gospel is real ' : half a century with chicago 's martin and morris company '' , journal of the society for american music , ( 2017 ) , volume 11 , number 4 , pp bernice johnson reagon , '' appreciation ;

elder dorsey , a graduate of atlanta bible college ( now morehouse college ) , traveled to nearby churches to preach religion and music were at the center of the dorseys ' lives , and young thomas was exposed to a variety of musical styles in his early childhood while often living hand-to-mouth , the dorseys were able to own an organ , which was rare for black families , and dorsey 's mother played during his father 's church services directionless , dorsey began attending shows at the nearby 81 theater , that featured blues musicians and live vaudeville acts he studied informally with musicians at the theater and local dance bands , always playing blues despite being meagerly compensated , he played rent party , house parties , juke joint , and brothels , but enjoyed the social life of a musician due to the spontaneous nature of the events dorsey worked , he became proficient at improvising , and along the way , learned to read musical notation seeking a greater challenge , dorsey relocated to chicago in 1919 , where he learned that his style of playing was unfashionable compared to the newer uptempo styles of jazz encountering more competition for jobs and with his concentration primarily on blues , dorsey turned to composing , copyrighting his first song in 1920 , titled '' if you do n't believe i 'm leaving , you can count the days i 'm gone '' dorsey seemed ambivalent about writing church music until 1921 when he was inspired by w dorsey found appeal in the freedom and potential that came with improvising within established hymns , allowing singers and musicians to infuse more emotion – particularly joy and elation – into their performances to move congregations sacred music could not sustain him financially , however , so he continued to work in blues two of his secular songs were recorded by monette moore and another by king oliver , ensuring dorsey a place as one of chicago 's top blues composers dorsey worked with rainey and her band for two years , wherein he composed and arranged her music in the blues style he was accustomed to , as well as vaudeville and jazz to please audiences ' tastes after the death of a close friend , dorsey was inspired to write his first religious song with a blues influence , '' if you see my savior , tell him that you saw me '' many churches sought prestige in their musical offerings , which were often ornate and sophisticated liturgical compositions by classical period ( music ) , such as handel 's messiah ( 1742 ) and mozart 's alleluia ( 1773 ) personal expressions such as clapping , stomping , and improvising with lyrics , rhythm , and melody were actively discouraged as being unrefined and degrading to the music and the singer dorsey tried to market his new sacred music by printing thousands of copies of his songs to sell directly to churches and publishers , even going door to door , but he was ultimately unsuccessful unsure if gospel music could sustain him , dorsey was nonetheless pleased to discover that he made an impression at the national baptist convention in 1930 when , unknown to him , willie mae ford smith sang '' if you see my savior '' during a morning meeting in between recording sessions with tampa red , and inspired by the compliments he received , he formed a choir at ebenezer baptist church at the request of the pastor , reverend james smith , who had an affinity for negro spirituals and indigenous singing styles dorsey and ebenezer 's music director theodore frye trained the new chorus to deliver his songs with a gospel blues sound : lively , joyous theatrical performances with embellished and elongated notes accentuated with rhythmic clapping and shouts when the pastor at pilgrim baptist , chicago 's second largest black church , saw the way it moved the congregation , he hired dorsey as music director , allowing him to dedicate all his time to gospel music his grief prompted him to write one of his most famous and enduring compositions , '' take my hand , precious lord '' an unintended consequence of his sales strategy helped spread gospel blues , as he worked with numerous musicians who assisted in selling his sheet

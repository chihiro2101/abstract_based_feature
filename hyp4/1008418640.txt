fritz haber was born in wrocław ( now wrocław , poland ) , prussia , into a well-off jews family the family name haber was a common one in the area , but fritz haber 's family has been traced back to a great-grandfather , pinkus selig haber , a wool dealer from kępno ( now kępno , poland ) an important prussian edict of 13 march 1812 determined that jews and their families , including pinkus haber , were '' to be treated as local citizens and citizens of prussia '' under such regulations , members of the haber family were able to establish themselves in respected positions in business , politics , and law fritz haber was the son of siegfried and paula haber , first cousins who married in spite of considerable opposition from their families paula experienced a difficult pregnancy and died three weeks after fritz 's birth , leaving siegfried devastated and fritz in the care of various aunts siegfried and his second wife had three daughters , else , helene and frieda although his relationship with his father was distant and often difficult , fritz developed close relationships with his step-mother and his half-sisters by the time fritz was born , the habers had to some extent assimilated into german society fritz haber identified strongly as german , less so as jewish although his father wished him to apprentice in the dye company , fritz obtained his father 's permission to study chemistry , at the friedrich wilhelm university in berlin ( today the humboldt university of berlin ) , with the director of the institute for chemistry , a haber was disappointed by his initial winter semester ( 1886–87 ) in berlin , and arranged to attend the heidelberg university for the summer semester of 1887 , where he studied under robert bunsen in addition to liebermann 's lectures on organic chemistry , haber also attended lectures by otto witt on the chemical technology of dyes in fall of 1892 , haber returned again to breslau to work in his father 's company , but the two men continued to clash and siegfried finally accepted that they could not work well together haber then sought an academic appointment , first working as an independent assistant to ludwig knorr at the university of jena between 1892 and 1894 bunte suggested that haber examine the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons haber was appointed a privatdozent in bunte 's institute , taking on teaching duties related to the area of dye technology , and continuing to work on the combustion of gases he had been interested in the area for some time , and had worked with another privatdozent , hans luggin , who gave theoretical lectures in electrochemistry and physical chemistry in the book 's foreword , haber expresses his gratitude to luggin , who died on 5 december 1899 haber collaborated with others in the area as well , including georg bredig , a student and later an assistant of wilhelm ostwald in leipzig bunte and engler supported an application for further authorization of haber 's teaching activities , and on 6 december 1898 , haber was invested with the title of extraordinarius and an associate professorship , by order of the grand duke friedrich von baden haber worked in a variety of areas while at karlsruhe , making significant contributions in several areas discussions with carl engler prompted haber to explain autoxidation in electrochemical terms , differentiating between dry and wet autoxidation he also studied the passivity of non-rare metals and the effects of electric current on corrosion of metals thermodynamics of technical gas-reactions : seven lectures ( 1908 ) , later regarded as '' a model of accuracy and critical insight '' in the field of chemical thermodynamics during his time at university of karlsruhe from 1894 to 1911 , haber and his assistant robert le rossignol invented the haber process , which is the catalytic formation of ammonia from hydrogen and atmospheric nitrogen under conditions of high temperature and pressure to further develop the process for large-scale ammonia production , haber turned to industry the haber–bosch process was a milestone in industrial chemistry the annual world production of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer is currently more than 100 million tons the food base of half of the current world population is based on the haber–bosch process haber was awarded the 1918 nobel prize in chemistry for this work ( he actually received the award in 1919 ) a large part of his work from 1911 to 1933 was done at the fritz haber institute of the mpg at berlin-dahlem haber played a major role in the development of the non-ballistic use of chemical weapons in world war i , in spite of the proscription of their use in shells by the hague convention of 1907 ( to which germany was a signatory ) in addition to leading the teams developing chlorine gas and other deadly gases for use in trench warfare , haber was on hand personally when it was first released by the german military at the second battle of ypres ( 22 april to 25 may 1915 ) in belgium future nobel laureates james franck , gustav hertz , and otto hahn served as gas troops in haber 's unit gas warfare in world war i was , in a sense , the war of the chemists , with haber pitted against french nobel laureate chemist victor grignard regarding war and peace , haber once said , '' during peace time a scientist belongs to the world , but during war time he belongs to his country the center 's library is also called fritz haber library , but it is not immediately clear if there is any connection to the 1936 homonymous library of the sieff ( now weizmann ) institute it explored his work on chemical warfare during world war i and the strain it put on his wife clara ( lesley sharp ) , concluding with her suicide and its cover-up by the authorities his and his wife 's life , including their relationship with the einsteins , and haber 's wife 's suicide , are featured prominently in

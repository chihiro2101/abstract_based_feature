the family name haber was a common one in the area , but fritz haber 's family has been traced back to a great-grandfather , pinkus selig haber , a wool dealer from kępno ( now kępno , poland ) fritz haber was the son of siegfried and paula haber , first cousins who married in spite of considerable opposition from their families paula experienced a difficult pregnancy and died three weeks after fritz 's birth , leaving siegfried devastated and fritz in the care of various aunts although his relationship with his father was distant and often difficult , fritz developed close relationships with his step-mother and his half-sisters by the time fritz was born , the habers had to some extent assimilated into german society fritz attended primary school at the johanneum school , a '' simultaneous school '' open equally to catholic , protestant , and jewish students although his father wished him to apprentice in the dye company , fritz obtained his father 's permission to study chemistry , at the friedrich wilhelm university in berlin ( today the humboldt university of berlin ) , with the director of the institute for chemistry , a liebermann assigned haber to work on reactions with piperonal for his thesis topic , published as ueber einige derivate des piperonals ( about a few piperonal derivatives ) in 1891 with his degree , fritz returned to breslau to work at his father 's chemical business through siegfried 's connections , fritz was assigned a series of practical apprenticeships in different chemical companies , to gain experience in fall of 1892 , haber returned again to breslau to work in his father 's company , but the two men continued to clash and siegfried finally accepted that they could not work well together during his time in jena , haber converted from judaism to lutheranism , possibly in an attempt to improve his chances of getting a better academic or military position knorr recommended haber to karl engler , a chemistry professor at the university of karlsruhe who was intensely interested in the chemical technology of dye and the dye industry , and the study of synthetic materials for textiles engler referred haber to a colleague in karlsruhe , hans bunte , who made haber an assistent in 1894 by making careful quantitative analyses , haber was able to establish that '' the thermal stability of the carbon-carbon bond is greater than that of the carbon-hydrogen bond in aromatic compounds and smaller in aliphatic compounds '' , a classic result in the study of pyrolysis of hydrocarbons this work became haber 's habilitation thesis haber was appointed a privatdozent in bunte 's institute , taking on teaching duties related to the area of dye technology , and continuing to work on the combustion of gases in 1897 haber made a similar trip to learn about developments in electrochemistry bunte and engler supported an application for further authorization of haber 's teaching activities , and on 6 december 1898 , haber was invested with the title of extraordinarius and an associate professorship , by order of the grand duke friedrich von baden haber worked in a variety of areas while at karlsruhe , making significant contributions in several areas in the area of dye and textiles , he and friedrich bran were able to theoretically explain steps in textile printing processes developed by adolf holz discussions with carl engler prompted haber to explain autoxidation in electrochemical terms , differentiating between dry and wet autoxidation haber 's work on irreversible and reversible forms of electrochemical reduction are considered classics in the field of electrochemistry in 1906 , max le blanc , chair of the physical chemistry department at karlsruhe , accepted a position at the university of leipzig during his time at university of karlsruhe from 1894 to 1911 , haber and his assistant robert le rossignol invented the haber process , which is the catalytic formation of ammonia from hydrogen and atmospheric nitrogen under conditions of high temperature and pressure the production of nitrogen-based products such as fertilizer and chemical feedstocks , previously dependent on acquisition of ammonia from limited natural deposits , now became possible using an easily available , abundant base & nbsp ; — atmospheric nitrogen chile had been a major ( and almost unique ) producer of natural deposits such as sodium nitrate ( caliche ) the annual world production of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer is currently more than 100 million tons the food base of half of the current world population is based on the haber–bosch process nitrogen bacteria teach us that nature , with her sophisticated forms of the chemistry of living matter , still understands and utilizes methods which we do not as yet know how to imitate a large part of his work from 1911 to 1933 was done at the fritz haber institute of the mpg at berlin-dahlem haber greeted world war i with enthusiasm , joining 92 other german intellectuals in signing the manifesto of the ninety-three in october 1914 he was promoted to the rank of captain and made head of the chemistry section in the ministry of war soon after the war began a special troop was formed for gas warfare ( pioneer regiments 35 and 36 ) under the command of otto peterson , with haber and friedrich kerschbaum as advisors clara was the daughter of a chemist who owned a sugar factory , and was the first woman to earn a phd ( in chemistry ) at the university of breslau there were multiple stresses in the marriage , and it has been suggested that she opposed haber 's work in chemical warfare in 1981 , the minerva foundation of the max planck society and the hebrew university of jerusalem ( huji ) established the fritz haber research center for molecular dynamics , based at the institute of chemistry of the hebrew university the institute most closely associated with his work , the former kaiser wilhelm institute for physical chemistry and electrochemistry at dahlem ( a suburb of berlin ) , was renamed fritz haber institute in 1953 and is part of the max planck society in january 2012 , radiolab aired a segment on haber , including the invention of the haber process , the second battle of ypres , his involvement with zyklon a , and the death of his wife , clara fritz stern : '' together and apart : fritz haber and albert einstein '' , in einstein 's german world princeton university press , 2001 stoltzenberg , dietrich : fritz haber : chemist , nobel laureate , german , jew : a biography ( chemical heritage foundation , 2005 ) ,

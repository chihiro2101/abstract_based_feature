fritz haber was born in wrocław ( now wrocław , poland ) , prussia , into a well-off jews family the family name haber was a common one in the area , but fritz haber 's family has been traced back to a great-grandfather , pinkus selig haber , a wool dealer from kępno ( now kępno , poland ) an important prussian edict of 13 march 1812 determined that jews and their families , including pinkus haber , were '' to be treated as local citizens and citizens of prussia '' under such regulations , members of the haber family were able to establish themselves in respected positions in business , politics , and law fritz haber was the son of siegfried and paula haber , first cousins who married in spite of considerable opposition from their families by the time fritz was born , the habers had to some extent assimilated into german society his family supported the jewish community and continued to observe many jewish traditions , but were not strongly associated with the synagogue fritz haber identified strongly as german , less so as jewish fritz haber successfully passed his examinations at the st in addition to liebermann 's lectures on organic chemistry , haber also attended lectures by otto witt on the chemical technology of dyes haber received his doctorate cum laude from friedrich wilhelm university in may 1891 , after presenting his work to a board of examiners from the university of berlin , since charlottenburg was not yet accredited to grant doctorates with his degree , fritz returned to breslau to work at his father 's chemical business through siegfried 's connections , fritz was assigned a series of practical apprenticeships in different chemical companies , to gain experience haber realized , based on these experiences , that he needed to learn more about technical processes , and persuaded his father to let him spend a semester at polytechnic college in zürich ( now the eth zürich ) , studying with georg lunge haber then sought an academic appointment , first working as an independent assistant to ludwig knorr at the university of jena between 1892 and 1894 knorr recommended haber to karl engler , a chemistry professor at the university of karlsruhe who was intensely interested in the chemical technology of dye and the dye industry , and the study of synthetic materials for textiles engler referred haber to a colleague in karlsruhe , hans bunte , who made haber an assistent in 1894 haber was appointed a privatdozent in bunte 's institute , taking on teaching duties related to the area of dye technology , and continuing to work on the combustion of gases in the book 's foreword , haber expresses his gratitude to luggin , who died on 5 december 1899 haber collaborated with others in the area as well , including georg bredig , a student and later an assistant of wilhelm ostwald in leipzig bunte and engler supported an application for further authorization of haber 's teaching activities , and on 6 december 1898 , haber was invested with the title of extraordinarius and an associate professorship , by order of the grand duke friedrich von baden this work led to a theoretical basis for the glass electrode and the measurement of electrolytic potentials haber 's work on irreversible and reversible forms of electrochemical reduction are considered classics in the field of electrochemistry thermodynamics of technical gas-reactions : seven lectures ( 1908 ) , later regarded as '' a model of accuracy and critical insight '' in the field of chemical thermodynamics during his time at university of karlsruhe from 1894 to 1911 , haber and his assistant robert le rossignol invented the haber process , which is the catalytic formation of ammonia from hydrogen and atmospheric nitrogen under conditions of high temperature and pressure to further develop the process for large-scale ammonia production , haber turned to industry teaming with carl bosch at basf , the process was successfully scaled-up to produce commercial quantities of ammonia the annual world production of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer is currently more than 100 million tons the food base of half of the current world population is based on the haber–bosch process haber was awarded the 1918 nobel prize in chemistry for this work ( he actually received the award in 1919 ) nitrogen bacteria teach us that nature , with her sophisticated forms of the chemistry of living matter , still understands and utilizes methods which we do not as yet know how to imitate chemical soldiers : british gas warfare in world war i gas warfare in world war i was , in a sense , the war of the chemists , with haber pitted against french nobel laureate chemist victor grignard regarding war and peace , haber once said , '' during peace time a scientist belongs to the world , but during war time he belongs to his country haber was a patriotic german who was proud of his service during world war i , for which he was decorated she converted from judaism to christianity in 1897 , several years before she and haber became engaged haber and his son hermann also urged that haber 's children by charlotte nathan , at boarding school in germany , should leave the country fritz haber bequeathed his extensive private library to the sieff institute , where it was dedicated as the fritz haber library on 29 january 1936 the institute most closely associated with his work , the former kaiser wilhelm institute for physical chemistry and electrochemistry at dahlem ( a suburb of berlin ) , was renamed fritz haber institute in 1953 and is part of the max planck society in january 2012 , radiolab aired a segment on haber , including the invention of the haber process , the second battle of ypres , his involvement with zyklon a , and the death of his wife , clara princeton university press , 2001 stoltzenberg , dietrich : fritz haber : chemist , nobel laureate , german , jew : a biography ( chemical heritage foundation , 2005 ) ,

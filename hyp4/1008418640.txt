fritz haber was born in wrocław ( now wrocław , poland ) , prussia , into a well-off jews family the family name haber was a common one in the area , but fritz haber 's family has been traced back to a great-grandfather , pinkus selig haber , a wool dealer from kępno ( now kępno , poland ) an important prussian edict of 13 march 1812 determined that jews and their families , including pinkus haber , were '' to be treated as local citizens and citizens of prussia '' fritz 's father siegfried was a well-known merchant in the town , who had founded his own business in dye pigments , paints and pharmaceuticals paula experienced a difficult pregnancy and died three weeks after fritz 's birth , leaving siegfried devastated and fritz in the care of various aunts haber was disappointed by his initial winter semester ( 1886–87 ) in berlin , and arranged to attend the heidelberg university for the summer semester of 1887 , where he studied under robert bunsen in the summer of 1889 haber left university to perform a legally required year of voluntary service in the sixth field artillery regiment in addition to liebermann 's lectures on organic chemistry , haber also attended lectures by otto witt on the chemical technology of dyes haber received his doctorate cum laude from friedrich wilhelm university in may 1891 , after presenting his work to a board of examiners from the university of berlin , since charlottenburg was not yet accredited to grant doctorates in fall of 1892 , haber returned again to breslau to work in his father 's company , but the two men continued to clash and siegfried finally accepted that they could not work well together haber then sought an academic appointment , first working as an independent assistant to ludwig knorr at the university of jena between 1892 and 1894 engler referred haber to a colleague in karlsruhe , hans bunte , who made haber an assistent in 1894 bunte suggested that haber examine the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons haber 's 1898 book grundriss der technischen elektrochemie auf theoretischer grundlage ( outline of technical electrochemistry based on theoretical foundations ) attracted considerable attention , particularly his work on the reduction of nitrobenzene discussions with carl engler prompted haber to explain autoxidation in electrochemical terms , differentiating between dry and wet autoxidation haber 's examinations of the thermodynamics of the reaction of solids confirmed that faraday 's laws hold for the electrolysis of crystalline salts after receiving recommendations from a search committee , the ministry of education in baden offered the full professorship for physical chemistry at karlsruhe to fritz haber , who accepted the offer during his time at university of karlsruhe from 1894 to 1911 , haber and his assistant robert le rossignol invented the haber process , which is the catalytic formation of ammonia from hydrogen and atmospheric nitrogen under conditions of high temperature and pressure this discovery was a direct consequence of le châtelier 's principle , announced in 1884 , which states that when a system is in equilibrium and one of the factors affecting it is changed , the system will respond by minimizing the effect of the change to further develop the process for large-scale ammonia production , haber turned to industry teaming with carl bosch at basf , the process was successfully scaled-up to produce commercial quantities of ammonia the annual world production of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer is currently more than 100 million tons the food base of half of the current world population is based on the haber–bosch process haber was awarded the 1918 nobel prize in chemistry for this work ( he actually received the award in 1919 ) nitrogen bacteria teach us that nature , with her sophisticated forms of the chemistry of living matter , still understands and utilizes methods which we do not as yet know how to imitate a large part of his work from 1911 to 1933 was done at the fritz haber institute of the mpg at berlin-dahlem haber greeted world war i with enthusiasm , joining 92 other german intellectuals in signing the manifesto of the ninety-three in october 1914 in addition to leading the teams developing chlorine gas and other deadly gases for use in trench warfare , haber was on hand personally when it was first released by the german military at the second battle of ypres ( 22 april to 25 may 1915 ) in belgium in 1914 and 1915 , before the second battle of ypres , haber 's unit investigated reports that the french had deployed turpenite , a supposed chemical weapon , against german soldiers chemical soldiers : british gas warfare in world war i gas warfare in world war i was , in a sense , the war of the chemists , with haber pitted against french nobel laureate chemist victor grignard regarding war and peace , haber once said , '' during peace time a scientist belongs to the world , but during war time he belongs to his country haber was a patriotic german who was proud of his service during world war i , for which he was decorated in his studies of the effects of poison gas , haber noted that exposure to a low concentration of a poisonous gas for a long time often had the same effect ( death ) as exposure to a high concentration for a short time he formulated a simple mathematical relationship between the gas concentration and the necessary exposure time die chemie im kriege : fünf vorträge ( 1920–1923 ) über giftgas , sprengstoff und kunstdünger im ersten weltkrieg during the 1920s , scientists working at his institute developed the cyanide gas formulation zyklon a , which was used as an insecticide , especially as a fumigant in grain stores haber received much criticism for his involvement in the development of chemical weapons in pre-world war ii germany , both from contemporaries , especially albert einstein and from modern-day scientists in january 2012 , radiolab aired a segment on haber , including the invention of the haber process , the second battle of ypres , his involvement with zyklon a , and the death of his wife , clara fritz

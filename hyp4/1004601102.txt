in the archaeological record , with the mungo lady , the remains of a partly cremated body found at lake mungo , australia canberra : australian national university press , pp in the middle east and europe , both burial and cremation are evident in the archaeological record in the neolithic era the babylonians , according to herodotus , embalmed their dead early persians practiced cremation , but this became prohibited during the zoroastrian period cremation appeared around the 12th century bce , constituting a new practice of burial , probably influenced by anatolia until the christian era , when inhumation again became the only burial practice , both combustion and inhumation had been practiced , depending on the era and location in europe , there are traces of cremation dating to the early bronze age ( c the custom became dominant throughout bronze age europe with the urnfield culture ( from c homer 's account of patroclus ' burial describes cremation with subsequent burial in a tumulus , similar to urnfield burials , and qualifying as the earliest description of cremation rites criticism of burial rites is a common form of aspersion by competing religions and cultures , including the association of cremation with fire sacrifice or human sacrifice hinduism and jainism are notable for not only allowing but prescribing cremation cremation in india is first attested in the cemetery h culture ( from c the rigveda contains a reference to the emerging practice , in rv 10.15.14 , where the forefathers '' both cremated ( agnidagdhá- ) and uncremated ( ánagnidagdha- ) '' are invoked cremation remained common but not universal , in both ancient greece and ancient rome the rise of christianity saw an end to cremation in europe , though it may have already been in decline this stance was influenced by its roots in judaism , the belief in the resurrection of the body , and the example of christ 's burial in early roman britain , cremation was usual but diminished by the 4th century it then reappeared in the 5th and 6th centuries during the migration era , when sacrificed animals were sometimes included with the human bodies on the pyre , and the deceased were dressed in costume and with ornaments for the burning cremation was sometimes used by catholic authorities as part of punishment for accused heretics , which included death by burning for example , the body of john wycliff was exhumed years after his death and burned to ashes , with the ashes thrown in a river , explicitly as a posthumous punishment for his denial of the roman catholic doctrine of transubstantiation the first to advocate for the use of cremation was the physician sir thomas browne in 1658 in 1869 , the idea was presented to the medical international congress of florence by professors coletti and castiglioni '' in the name of public health and civilization '' in 1873 , professor paolo gorini of lodi and professor ludovico brunetti of padua published reports of practical work they had conducted his furnace operated at a high temperature by using air preheater of fuel and air for combustion through this method , an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel , and this process made cremation an efficient and practical proposal charles 's nephew , carl friedrich von siemens perfected the use of this furnace for the incineration of organic material at his factory in dresden encyclopedia of cremation by lewis h his main reason for supporting cremation was that '' it was becoming a necessary sanitary precaution against the propagation of disease among a population daily growing larger in relation to the area it occupied '' however , after protests and an intervention by the home secretary , sir richard cross , their plans were put on hold price successfully argued in court that while the law did not state that cremation was legal , it also did not state that it was illegal in 1885 , the first official cremation in the united kingdom took place in woking by the end of the year , the cremation society of great britain had overseen two more cremations , a total of 3 out of 597,357 deaths in the uk that year in 1891 , woking crematorium added a chapel , pioneering the concept of a crematorium being a venue for funerals as well as cremation like many early proponents , he was motivated by a belief it would be beneficial for public health other countries that opened their first crematorium included sweden ( 1887 in stockholm ) , switzerland ( 1889 in zurich ) and france ( 1889 in père lachaise , paris ) some of the various protestant churches came to accept cremation , with the rationale being , '' god can resurrect a bowl of ashes just as conveniently as he can resurrect a bowl of dust '' in anglican and nordic protestant countries , cremation gained acceptance ( though did not yet become the norm ) first by the higher classes and cultural circles , and then by the rest of the population not to be left behind , crematories had an idea of making cremation beautiful australia also started to establish modern cremation movements and societies australians had their first purpose-built modern crematorium and chapel in the west terrace cemetery in the south australian capital of adelaide in 1901 this small building , resembling the buildings at woking , remained largely unchanged from its 19th-century style and was in full operation until the late 1950s the oldest operating crematorium in australia is at rookwood cemetery , in sydney in the netherlands , the foundation of the association for optional cremation dutch , vereniging voor facultatieve lijkverbranding in 1874 ushered in a long debate about the merits and demerits of cremation laws against cremation were challenged and invalidated in 1915 ( two years after the construction of the first crematorium in the netherlands ) , though cremation did not become legally recognised until 1955 the holocaust furnaces were supplied by a number of manufacturers , with the best known and most common being topf and sons as well as kori company of berlin , whose ovens were elongated to accommodate two bodies , slid inside from the back side once outside , the gasses then rose through a free standing chimney , most notable for the fact that it was not directly attached to the structure of the building itself , nor had a visible duct leading into it this is done on the condition that the ashes must be buried or interred , not scattered many countries where burial is traditional saw cremation rise to become a significant , if not the most common way of disposing of a dead body - designing a place for goodbye : the architecture of crematoria in the netherlands - jan 2012 starting in the 1960s , cremation has become more common than burial in several countries where the latter is traditional this has included the united kingdom ( 1968 ) , canada ( early 2000s ) , the united states ( 2016 ) and finland ( 2017 ) in many countries , the crematorium is a venue for funerals as well as cremation the time required for cremation varies from body to body , with the average being 90 minutes for an adult body a cremator is not designed to cremate more than one human body at a time the layer of fire bricks in contact with the combustion process protects the outer layer and must be replaced from time to time the body is required to be inside a coffin or a combustible container it also reduces health risks to the operators when cremation is finished , the remains are passed through a magnetic field to remove any metal , which will be interred elsewhere in the crematorium grounds or , increasingly , recycled delivery-only allows crematoria to schedule cremations to make best use of the cremators , perhaps by holding the body overnight in a refrigerator , allowing a lower fee to be charged the mean weight of an adult 's remains is ; the mean weight for adult males is about higher than that for adult females the reason given is that '' cremains '' is thought to have less connection with the deceased , whereas a loved one 's '' cremated remains '' has a more identifiable human connection the cost of pet cremation depends on location , where the cremation is done , and time of cremation the cremation rate in the united kingdom has been increasing steadily with the national average rate rising from 34.70 % in 1960 to 75.44 % in 2015

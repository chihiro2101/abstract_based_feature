by 1911 the abbey was expressing a preference for interring ashes only about one crematory per year was built in the late 19th century not to be left behind , crematories had an idea of making cremation beautiful australia also started to establish modern cremation movements and societies laws against cremation were challenged and invalidated in 1915 ( two years after the construction of the first crematorium in the netherlands ) , though cremation did not become legally recognised until 1955 the furnaces were also unique , in that they were of a '' stand alone '' type , meaning that there was no visible duct work for the exhaust gases the roman catholic church accepted the practice more slowly this is done on the condition that the ashes must be buried or interred , not scattered many countries where burial is traditional saw cremation rise to become a significant , if not the most common way of disposing of a dead body the cremation occurs in a cremator , which is located at a crematorium or crematory modern cremators automatically monitor their interior to tell when the cremation process is complete and have a spyhole so that an operator can see inside the time required for cremation varies from body to body , with the average being 90 minutes for an adult body the chamber where the body is placed is called a cremation chamber or retort and is lined with heat-resistant refractory bricks the outermost layer is usually simply an insulation material , e.g the layer of fire bricks in contact with the combustion process protects the outer layer and must be replaced from time to time the body is required to be inside a coffin or a combustible container it also reduces health risks to the operators this is sometimes done for religious reasons , such as in traditional hindu and jain funerals , and is also customary in japan most casket manufacturers provide lines of caskets that are specially built for cremation another option is a cardboard box that fits inside a wooden shell , which is designed to look like a traditional casket after the funeral service , the box is removed from the shell before cremation , permitting the shell to be re-used funeral homes may also offer rental caskets , which are traditional caskets used only during the services , after which the bodies are transferred to other containers for cremation it is recommended that jewellery be removed before the coffin is sealed , for this reason in germany , the process is mostly similar to that of the united kingdom a piece of fire clay with a number on it is used for identifying the remains of the dead body after burning handles ( if fitted ) are plastic and approved for use in a cremator coffins vary from natural cardboard and unfinished particle board ( covered with a velvet pall if there is a service ) to solid timber ; most are veneered particle board in some areas such as snowdon , wales , environmental authorities have warned that the frequent scattering of ashes can change the nature of the soil , and may affect the ecology however , for some even cremation is still relatively expensive , especially as a lot of fuel is required to perform it the cost of pet cremation depends on location , where the cremation is done , and time of cremation authorities had difficulties dealing with the large numbers of bodies , and as a result , thousands of bodies were cremated together out of fear that decaying bodies would cause disease according to the national funeral directors association the cremation rate in the united states in 2016 was 50.2 percent and this was expected to increase to 63.8 percent by 2025 and 78.8 percent in 2035

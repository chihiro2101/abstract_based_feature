gillespie , r ( 1998 ) alternative timescales : a critical review of willandra lakes dating in the archaeological record , with the mungo lady , the remains of a partly cremated body found at lake mungo , australia canberra : australian national university press , pp alternative death rituals emphasizing one method of disposal of a body—inhumation ( burial ) , cremation , or exposure—have gone through periods of preference throughout history in the middle east and europe , both burial and cremation are evident in the archaeological record in the neolithic era phoenicians practiced both cremation and burial cremation appeared around the 12th century bce , constituting a new practice of burial , probably influenced by anatolia until the christian era , when inhumation again became the only burial practice , both combustion and inhumation had been practiced , depending on the era and location in europe , there are traces of cremation dating to the early bronze age ( c the rigveda contains a reference to the emerging practice , in rv 10.15.14 , where the forefathers '' both cremated ( agnidagdhá- ) and uncremated ( ánagnidagdha- ) '' are invoked cremation remained common but not universal , in both ancient greece and ancient rome the rise of christianity saw an end to cremation in europe , though it may have already been in decline this stance was influenced by its roots in judaism , the belief in the resurrection of the body , and the example of christ 's burial in early roman britain , cremation was usual but diminished by the 4th century it then reappeared in the 5th and 6th centuries during the migration era , when sacrificed animals were sometimes included with the human bodies on the pyre , and the deceased were dressed in costume and with ornaments for the burning that custom was also very widespread among the germanic peoples of the northern continental lands from which the anglo-saxon migrants are supposed to have been derived , during the same period plunkett , suffolk in anglo-saxon times ( tempus publishing , stroud 2005 ) , 1–62 cremation was sometimes used by catholic authorities as part of punishment for accused heretics , which included death by burning the first to advocate for the use of cremation was the physician sir thomas browne in 1658 in europe , a movement to reintroduce cremation as a viable method for body disposal began in the 1870s at the time , many proponents believed in the miasma theory , and that cremation would reduce the '' bad air '' that caused diseases in italy , the movement was associated with anti-clericalism and freemasonry , whereas these were not major themes of the movement in britain in 1869 , the idea was presented to the medical international congress of florence by professors coletti and castiglioni '' in the name of public health and civilization '' in 1873 , professor paolo gorini of lodi and professor ludovico brunetti of padua published reports of practical work they had conducted the flow of the furnace is then reversed so that fuel and air pass through the chamber and are heated by the bricks through this method , an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel , and this process made cremation an efficient and practical proposal the efficient and cheap process brought about the quick and complete incineration of the body and was a fundamental technical breakthrough that finally made industrial cremation a practical possibility milan 's '' crematorium temple '' was built in the monumental cemetery his main reason for supporting cremation was that '' it was becoming a necessary sanitary precaution against the propagation of disease among a population daily growing larger in relation to the area it occupied '' he joined with other proponents to form the cremation society of great britain in 1874 in 1885 , the first official cremation in the united kingdom took place in woking in 1891 , woking crematorium added a chapel , pioneering the concept of a crematorium being a venue for funerals as well as cremation '' the new american way of death other countries that opened their first crematorium included sweden ( 1887 in stockholm ) , switzerland ( 1889 in zurich ) and france ( 1889 in père lachaise , paris ) the 1908 catholic encyclopedia was critical of the development , referring to them as a '' sinister movement '' and associating them with freemasonry , although it said that '' there is nothing directly opposed to any dogma of the church in the practice of cremation this small building , resembling the buildings at woking , remained largely unchanged from its 19th-century style and was in full operation until the late 1950s laws against cremation were challenged and invalidated in 1915 ( two years after the construction of the first crematorium in the netherlands ) , though cremation did not become legally recognised until 1955 the furnaces were also unique , in that they were of a '' stand alone '' type , meaning that there was no visible duct work for the exhaust gases in the 20th century , cremation gained varying degrees of acceptance in most christian denominations in 1963 , at the second vatican council pope paul vi lifted the ban on cremation , and in 1966 allowed catholic priests to officiate at cremation ceremonies this is done on the condition that the ashes must be buried or interred , not scattered many countries where burial is traditional saw cremation rise to become a significant , if not the most common way of disposing of a dead body in many countries , the crematorium is a venue for funerals as well as cremation modern cremators automatically monitor their interior to tell when the cremation process is complete and have a spyhole so that an operator can see inside crematoria may occasionally make exceptions for cases such as still-born twins , or a baby and mother who died during childbirth the chamber where the body is placed is called a cremation chamber or retort and is lined with heat-resistant refractory bricks inside is typically a layer of insulation brick , mostly calcium silicate in nature the layer of fire bricks in contact with the combustion process protects the outer layer and must be replaced from time to time the body is required to be inside a coffin or a combustible container this is sometimes done for religious reasons , such as in traditional hindu and jain funerals , and is also customary in japan in the united states federal law does not dictate any container requirements for cremation certain states , however , may require an opaque or non-transparent container of all cremations most casket manufacturers provide lines of caskets that are specially built for cremation after the funeral service , the box is removed from the shell before cremation , permitting the shell to be re-used rental caskets are sometimes designed with removable beds and liners , which are replaced after each use in the united kingdom , the body is not removed from the coffin and is not placed into a container as described above the body is cremated with the coffin which is why all british coffins that are to be used for cremation must be combustible sulfur and most carbon are driven off as oxidized gases during the process , although about 1 % -4 % of carbon remains as carbonate ( if they are missed at first , they must ultimately be removed before processing is complete , as items such as titanium joint replacements are far too durable to be ground the cost of pet cremation depends on location , where the cremation is done , and time of cremation this meant that the bodies of tourists from other asian nations , such as japan and south korea , were mass cremated , rather than being returned to their country of origin for funeral rites the cremation rate in the united kingdom has been increasing steadily with the national average rate rising from 34.70 % in 1960 to 75.44 % in 2015

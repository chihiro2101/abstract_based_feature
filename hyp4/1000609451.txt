fort carillon is situated on a point of land between lake champlain and lake george , at a natural point of conflict between french forces moving south from canada and the st lawrence river valley across the lake toward the hudson valley , and british forces moving up the hudson from albany the fort was sited with lake champlain to the east , with mount independence rising on the far side immediately to the south of the fort lay the mouth of the la chute river , which drains lake george the river was largely non-navigable , and there was a portage trail from the northern end of lake george to the location of a sawmill the french had built to assist in the fort 's construction to the north of the fort was a road going to fort st to the west was a low rise of land , beyond which lay mount hope , a rise that commanded part of the portage trail , but was too far from the fort to pose it any danger 26 the most serious geographic defect in the fort 's location was mount defiance ( known at the time of this battle as rattlesnake hill , and in the 1770s as sugar bush ) , which lay to the south of the fort , across the la chute river following a french and indian war french victories , 1756–1757 , coupled with military setbacks in europe , william pitt gained full control of the direction of british military efforts in the seven years ' war the third campaign , assigned to general james abercrombie , was to launch an attack against canada through the champlain valley 59 pitt probably would have preferred to have george howe , a skilled tactician and a dynamic leader , lead this expedition , but seniority and political considerations led him to appoint the relatively undistinguished abercrombie instead 60 , 65 the french , who had started construction on fort carillon in 1755 , lonergan , p 22 used it as a launching point for the successful siege of fort william henry in 1757 92 the lack of support from france was in large part due to an unwillingness of the french military to risk the movement of significant military forces across the atlantic ocean , which was dominated by britain 's royal navy vaudreuil , who had limited combat experience , wanted to divide the french forces , with about 5,000 each at carillon and louisbourg , and then send a picked force of about 3,500 men against the british in the mohawk river on the northwestern frontiers of the province of new york montcalm believed this to be folly , as the plan would enable the british to easily divert some of their forces to fend off the french attack the british amassed their army , under the command of general james abercrombie , near the remains of fort william henry , which lay at the southern end of lake george but had been destroyed following its capture by the french the previous year the army numbered fully 16,000 men , making it the largest single force ever deployed in north america at the time 93 on july 5 , 1758 , these troops embarked on boats , which unloaded them at the north end of lake george on july 6 colonel françois-charles de bourlamaque , in command of fort carillon prior to montcalm 's arrival , knew by june 23 that a major british offensive was about to begin 106–107 montcalm arrived at fort carillon on june 30 , and found there a significantly under-staffed garrison , with only 3,500 men , and food sufficient for only nine days given the large force facing him and the defects of the fort 's site , montcalm opted for a strategy of defending the likely approaches to the fort 88 lévis had not yet left montreal , so vaudreuil instead ordered him and 400 troops to carillon 163 these withdrawals isolated trépezet and his men from the main body , a situation made worse for trépezet when his indian guides , alarmed by the size of the british fleet , abandoned him 51 beginning on the evening of july 6 , the french began to lay out entrenchments on the rise northwest of the fort , about away , that commanded the land routes to the fort 164 near the area where bernetz brook enters the la chute , captain trépezet and his troop , who were attempting to return to the french lines , encountered phineas lyman 's connecticut regiment , sparking a skirmish in the woods as they approached the battle scene , general howe was hit and instantly killed by a musket ball a column of massachusetts provincials , also drawn to the battle , cut off the french patrol 's rear abercrombie ordered his engineer , lieutenant matthew clerk , and one of his aides , captain james abercrombie ( it is uncertain if the abercrombies were related or not ) to reconnoiter the french defenses william haviland , the 44th and 55th under lt redoubts with cannon protected the flanks of the entrenchments , although the one on the right had not been completed the low ground between the left flank and the la chute river was guarded by militia and marines , who had also constructed abatis to help protect their position portions of each battalion were also held in reserve , to assist in areas where they might be needed french forces were commanded by brigadier general louis-joseph de montcalm who personally commanded the centre group ( around 3,600 men total ) while abercrombie had expected the battle to begin at 1 pm , by 12:30 elements of the new york regiments on the left began engaging the french defenders 65 , 68 the result , rather than an orderly , coordinated advance on the french position , was a piecemeal entry of the regulars into the battle writing in his own defense , he later claimed that he was relying on clerk 's assessment that the works could be easily taken ; this was clearly refuted by the failure of the first charge fire from cannons on the fort 's southwest bastion 's sank two of the barges , spurring the remaining vessels to retreat 71–72 abercrombie ordered his reserves , the connecticut and new jersey provincials , into the battle around 2 , but by 2:30 it was clear their attack also failed abercrombie then tried to recall the troops , but a significant number , notably the 42nd and 46th regiments on the british left , persisted in the attack around 5 pm the 42nd made a desperate advance that actually succeeded in reaching the base of the french wall ; those that actually managed to scale the breastwork were bayoneted although he was active at lake george , he did little more than provide support for john bradstreet 's battle of fort frontenac , which was authorized in a war council on july 13 combined with the effective elimination of trépezet 's force on july 6 , there were about 550 casualties , about 13 percent of the french force , a percentage similar to the losses of the british ( who chartrand calculates as having lost 11.5 to 15 percent ) 58 fort ticonderoga was siege of fort ticonderoga ( 1777 ) in july 1777

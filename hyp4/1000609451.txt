fort carillon is situated on a point of land between lake champlain and lake george , at a natural point of conflict between french forces moving south from canada and the st lawrence river valley across the lake toward the hudson valley , and british forces moving up the hudson from albany the fort was sited with lake champlain to the east , with mount independence rising on the far side immediately to the south of the fort lay the mouth of the la chute river , which drains lake george the river was largely non-navigable , and there was a portage trail from the northern end of lake george to the location of a sawmill the french had built to assist in the fort 's construction the trail crossed the la chute twice ; once about from lake george , and again at the sawmill , which was about from the fort to the north of the fort was a road going to fort st to the west was a low rise of land , beyond which lay mount hope , a rise that commanded part of the portage trail , but was too far from the fort to pose it any danger 26 the most serious geographic defect in the fort 's location was mount defiance ( known at the time of this battle as rattlesnake hill , and in the 1770s as sugar bush ) , which lay to the south of the fort , across the la chute river 134 nicolas sarrebource de pontleroy , montcalm 's chief engineer , said of the fort 's site , '' were i to be entrusted with the siege of it , i should require only six mortars and two cannon prior to 1758 , the french and indian war had gone very poorly for the british , whose military met few of its objectives following a french and indian war french victories , 1756–1757 , coupled with military setbacks in europe , william pitt gained full control of the direction of british military efforts in the seven years ' war embarking on a strategy that emphasized defense in europe , where france was strong , and offense in north america , where france was weak , he resolved to attack new france ( the colonial holdings of france in north america ) in three strategic campaigns the third campaign , assigned to general james abercrombie , was to launch an attack against canada through the champlain valley 59 pitt probably would have preferred to have george howe , a skilled tactician and a dynamic leader , lead this expedition , but seniority and political considerations led him to appoint the relatively undistinguished abercrombie instead 60 , 65 the french , who had started construction on fort carillon in 1755 , lonergan , p 22 used it as a launching point for the successful siege of fort william henry in 1757 92 the lack of support from france was in large part due to an unwillingness of the french military to risk the movement of significant military forces across the atlantic ocean , which was dominated by britain 's royal navy vaudreuil , who had limited combat experience , wanted to divide the french forces , with about 5,000 each at carillon and louisbourg , and then send a picked force of about 3,500 men against the british in the mohawk river on the northwestern frontiers of the province of new york montcalm believed this to be folly , as the plan would enable the british to easily divert some of their forces to fend off the french attack 89–90 vaudreuil prevailed , and in june 1758 montcalm left quebec for carillon the british amassed their army , under the command of general james abercrombie , near the remains of fort william henry , which lay at the southern end of lake george but had been destroyed following its capture by the french the previous year colonel françois-charles de bourlamaque , in command of fort carillon prior to montcalm 's arrival , knew by june 23 that a major british offensive was about to begin bourlamaque increased scouting activities , and learned from captured british scouts the approximate size of the british force bourlamaque 's scouts reported that the british had 20,000 or more troops massing near the remains of fort william henry given the large force facing him and the defects of the fort 's site , montcalm opted for a strategy of defending the likely approaches to the fort 114 he immediately detached bourlamaque and three battalions to occupy and fortify the river crossing on the portage trail about two miles ( 3.2 & nbsp ; km ) from the northern end of lake george , about from the fort 162 he also sent word back to montreal of the situation , requesting that , if possible , the chevalier de lévis and his men , be sent as reinforcement ; these were troops that vaudreuil intended for duty at the western frontier forts 51 beginning on the evening of july 6 , the french began to lay out entrenchments on the rise northwest of the fort , about away , that commanded the land routes to the fort abercrombie first landed an advance force to check the area where the forces were to disembark , and found it recently deserted ; some supplies and equipment had been left behind by the french in their hasty departure as they approached the battle scene , general howe was hit and instantly killed by a musket ball william nester claims british casualties were light , only ten dead and six wounded , nester , p abercrombie ordered his engineer , lieutenant matthew clerk , and one of his aides , captain james abercrombie ( it is uncertain if the abercrombies were related or not ) to reconnoiter the french defenses after ascending rattlesnake hill ( as mount defiance was then known ) , they reported that the french position appeared to be incomplete , and could be '' easily forced , even without cannon '' 58 clerk 's report included recommendations to fortify both the summit and the base of rattlesnake hill 142 early on the morning of july 8 , clerk went out once again to the base of rattlesnake hill to observe the french defenses ; his report indicated that he still felt the french lines could be taken by assault 61–62 montcalm had organized the french forces into three brigades and a reserve the low ground between the left flank and the la chute river was guarded by militia and marines , who had also constructed abatis to help protect their position 64 the sounds of battle led haviland to believe that the french line might have been penetrated , so he ordered his men forward , even though not all of the regulars were in place , and abercrombie had not given an order to advance montcalm , wary of a second british attack , and concerned about the fatigue of his troops after a long day of battle , had barrels of beer and wine brought forward to the lines 206 as it happened , montreal ( the last point of resistance ) did not surrender until 1760 , with campaigns launched from fort oswego , quebec , and carillon , which was battle of ticonderoga ( 1759 ) by forces under the command of jeffery amherst , the victor at louisbourg news of the defeat circulated widely in their communities , which had a significant effect on the ability of british agents to recruit indians to their side for future operations many of these reports were from french deserters or captives , and abercrombie should have investigated them by sending out scouts or light infantry 58 fort ticonderoga was siege of fort ticonderoga ( 1777 ) in july 1777

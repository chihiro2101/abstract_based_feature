fort carillon is situated on a point of land between lake champlain and lake george , at a natural point of conflict between french forces moving south from canada and the st lawrence river valley across the lake toward the hudson valley , and british forces moving up the hudson from albany immediately to the south of the fort lay the mouth of the la chute river , which drains lake george the river was largely non-navigable , and there was a portage trail from the northern end of lake george to the location of a sawmill the french had built to assist in the fort 's construction to the north of the fort was a road going to fort st to the west was a low rise of land , beyond which lay mount hope , a rise that commanded part of the portage trail , but was too far from the fort to pose it any danger 26 the most serious geographic defect in the fort 's location was mount defiance ( known at the time of this battle as rattlesnake hill , and in the 1770s as sugar bush ) , which lay to the south of the fort , across the la chute river this hill , which was steep and densely forested , provided an excellent firing position for cannon aimed at the fort 134 nicolas sarrebource de pontleroy , montcalm 's chief engineer , said of the fort 's site , '' were i to be entrusted with the siege of it , i should require only six mortars and two cannon prior to 1758 , the french and indian war had gone very poorly for the british , whose military met few of its objectives following a french and indian war french victories , 1756–1757 , coupled with military setbacks in europe , william pitt gained full control of the direction of british military efforts in the seven years ' war 213–214,232 large-scale campaigns were planned to capture fort duquesne on the pennsylvania frontier and the fortress at louisbourg ( on île-royale , now known as cape breton island ) the third campaign , assigned to general james abercrombie , was to launch an attack against canada through the champlain valley 60 , 65 the french , who had started construction on fort carillon in 1755 , lonergan , p 92 the lack of support from france was in large part due to an unwillingness of the french military to risk the movement of significant military forces across the atlantic ocean , which was dominated by britain 's royal navy 68 this situation was further exacerbated by canada 's poor harvest in 1757 , which resulted in food shortages as the winter progressed montcalm believed this to be folly , as the plan would enable the british to easily divert some of their forces to fend off the french attack the british amassed their army , under the command of general james abercrombie , near the remains of fort william henry , which lay at the southern end of lake george but had been destroyed following its capture by the french the previous year colonel françois-charles de bourlamaque , in command of fort carillon prior to montcalm 's arrival , knew by june 23 that a major british offensive was about to begin bourlamaque 's scouts reported that the british had 20,000 or more troops massing near the remains of fort william henry given the large force facing him and the defects of the fort 's site , montcalm opted for a strategy of defending the likely approaches to the fort 114 he immediately detached bourlamaque and three battalions to occupy and fortify the river crossing on the portage trail about two miles ( 3.2 & nbsp ; km ) from the northern end of lake george , about from the fort montcalm himself took two battalions and occupied and fortified an advance camp at the sawmill , while remaining troops were put to work preparing additional defenses outside the fort 162 he also sent word back to montreal of the situation , requesting that , if possible , the chevalier de lévis and his men , be sent as reinforcement ; these were troops that vaudreuil intended for duty at the western frontier forts 88 lévis had not yet left montreal , so vaudreuil instead ordered him and 400 troops to carillon bourlamaque , who was satisfied with his defensive situation , resisted , not withdrawing until montcalm repeated the orders three times 123 montcalm , now aware of the scope of the movement , ordered all of the troops back to carillon , and had both bridges on the portage trail destroyed 163 these withdrawals isolated trépezet and his men from the main body , a situation made worse for trépezet when his indian guides , alarmed by the size of the british fleet , abandoned him 51 beginning on the evening of july 6 , the french began to lay out entrenchments on the rise northwest of the fort , about away , that commanded the land routes to the fort by the end of that day , they had also constructed a wooden breastwork above the trenches 164 near the area where bernetz brook enters the la chute , captain trépezet and his troop , who were attempting to return to the french lines , encountered phineas lyman 's connecticut regiment , sparking a skirmish in the woods as they approached the battle scene , general howe was hit and instantly killed by a musket ball a column of massachusetts provincials , also drawn to the battle , cut off the french patrol 's rear scouts and prisoners reported to abercrombie that montcalm had 6,000 men and was expecting the chevalier de lévis to arrive at any moment with 3,000 reinforcements after ascending rattlesnake hill ( as mount defiance was then known ) , they reported that the french position appeared to be incomplete , and could be '' easily forced , even without cannon '' 138 they were unaware that the french had disguised much of the works with shrubs and trees , and that they were in fact largely complete 103 abercrombie held a war council that evening 142 early on the morning of july 8 , clerk went out once again to the base of rattlesnake hill to observe the french defenses ; his report indicated that he still felt the french lines could be taken by assault while abercrombie had expected the battle to begin at 1 pm , by 12:30 elements of the new york regiments on the left began engaging the french defenders 65 , 68 the result , rather than an orderly , coordinated advance on the french position , was a piecemeal entry of the regulars into the battle as companies of the regulars came forward , they arranged themselves into lines as instructed , and then began to advance the same sources must also have reported the shortage of provisions at the fort , a sign that a siege would have ended quickly in 1777 , when general john burgoyne advanced down lake champlain at the beginning of the saratoga campaign , general george washington , who had never seen the fort , thought highly of its defensive value 58 fort ticonderoga was siege of fort ticonderoga ( 1777 ) in july 1777

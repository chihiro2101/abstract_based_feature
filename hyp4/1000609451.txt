fort carillon is situated on a point of land between lake champlain and lake george , at a natural point of conflict between french forces moving south from canada and the st lawrence river valley across the lake toward the hudson valley , and british forces moving up the hudson from albany the fort was sited with lake champlain to the east , with mount independence rising on the far side immediately to the south of the fort lay the mouth of the la chute river , which drains lake george the river was largely non-navigable , and there was a portage trail from the northern end of lake george to the location of a sawmill the french had built to assist in the fort 's construction the trail crossed the la chute twice ; once about from lake george , and again at the sawmill , which was about from the fort to the north of the fort was a road going to fort st to the west was a low rise of land , beyond which lay mount hope , a rise that commanded part of the portage trail , but was too far from the fort to pose it any danger 26 the most serious geographic defect in the fort 's location was mount defiance ( known at the time of this battle as rattlesnake hill , and in the 1770s as sugar bush ) , which lay to the south of the fort , across the la chute river this hill , which was steep and densely forested , provided an excellent firing position for cannon aimed at the fort 134 nicolas sarrebource de pontleroy , montcalm 's chief engineer , said of the fort 's site , '' were i to be entrusted with the siege of it , i should require only six mortars and two cannon prior to 1758 , the french and indian war had gone very poorly for the british , whose military met few of its objectives following a french and indian war french victories , 1756–1757 , coupled with military setbacks in europe , william pitt gained full control of the direction of british military efforts in the seven years ' war howe was appointed a brigadier general , and placed as abercrombie 's second in command 60 , 65 the french , who had started construction on fort carillon in 1755 , lonergan , p 68 this situation was further exacerbated by canada 's poor harvest in 1757 , which resulted in food shortages as the winter progressed vaudreuil , who had limited combat experience , wanted to divide the french forces , with about 5,000 each at carillon and louisbourg , and then send a picked force of about 3,500 men against the british in the mohawk river on the northwestern frontiers of the province of new york montcalm believed this to be folly , as the plan would enable the british to easily divert some of their forces to fend off the french attack 93 on july 5 , 1758 , these troops embarked on boats , which unloaded them at the north end of lake george on july 6 colonel françois-charles de bourlamaque , in command of fort carillon prior to montcalm 's arrival , knew by june 23 that a major british offensive was about to begin he had sent a messenger bearing a letter from vaudreuil to abercrombie ( part of a conventional exchange of pleasantries between opposing commanders ) on june 10 , expecting him to return ; the fact that the british held him was an indication that the messenger had probably learned too much just by being in the british camp bourlamaque 's scouts reported that the british had 20,000 or more troops massing near the remains of fort william henry given the large force facing him and the defects of the fort 's site , montcalm opted for a strategy of defending the likely approaches to the fort 114 he immediately detached bourlamaque and three battalions to occupy and fortify the river crossing on the portage trail about two miles ( 3.2 & nbsp ; km ) from the northern end of lake george , about from the fort montcalm himself took two battalions and occupied and fortified an advance camp at the sawmill , while remaining troops were put to work preparing additional defenses outside the fort 162 he also sent word back to montreal of the situation , requesting that , if possible , the chevalier de lévis and his men , be sent as reinforcement ; these were troops that vaudreuil intended for duty at the western frontier forts bourlamaque , who was satisfied with his defensive situation , resisted , not withdrawing until montcalm repeated the orders three times 123 montcalm , now aware of the scope of the movement , ordered all of the troops back to carillon , and had both bridges on the portage trail destroyed 163 these withdrawals isolated trépezet and his men from the main body , a situation made worse for trépezet when his indian guides , alarmed by the size of the british fleet , abandoned him 51 beginning on the evening of july 6 , the french began to lay out entrenchments on the rise northwest of the fort , about away , that commanded the land routes to the fort these hastily erected defenses , while proof against small arms fire , would have been ineffective if the british had used cannons against them the british army began an unopposed landing at the north end of lake george on the morning of july 6 general howe 's column was near the action , so he led it in that direction a column of massachusetts provincials , also drawn to the battle , cut off the french patrol 's rear 86 the british , frustrated by the difficult woods , demoralized by howe 's death , and exhausted from the overnight boat ride , camped in the woods , and returned to the landing point early the next morning abercrombie ordered his engineer , lieutenant matthew clerk , and one of his aides , captain james abercrombie ( it is uncertain if the abercrombies were related or not ) to reconnoiter the french defenses after ascending rattlesnake hill ( as mount defiance was then known ) , they reported that the french position appeared to be incomplete , and could be '' easily forced , even without cannon '' reserve forces were either in the fort itself , or on the grounds between the fort and the entrenchments on mount hope 159 was reported by his aide , james abercrombie , to be near the rear of the lines by the la chute river during much of the battle , nester , p 71–72 abercrombie ordered his reserves , the connecticut and new jersey provincials , into the battle around 2 , but by 2:30 it was clear their attack also failed 206 as it happened , montreal ( the last point of resistance ) did not surrender until 1760 , with campaigns launched from fort oswego , quebec , and carillon , which was battle of ticonderoga ( 1759 ) by forces under the command of jeffery amherst , the victor at louisbourg he apparently never inspected the landing area at the north end of lake george , which was a location from which he could contest the british landing many of these reports were from french deserters or captives , and abercrombie should have investigated them by sending out scouts or light infantry 58 fort ticonderoga was siege of fort ticonderoga ( 1777 ) in july 1777

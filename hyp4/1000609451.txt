fort carillon is situated on a point of land between lake champlain and lake george , at a natural point of conflict between french forces moving south from canada and the st lawrence river valley across the lake toward the hudson valley , and british forces moving up the hudson from albany the fort was sited with lake champlain to the east , with mount independence rising on the far side immediately to the south of the fort lay the mouth of the la chute river , which drains lake george the river was largely non-navigable , and there was a portage trail from the northern end of lake george to the location of a sawmill the french had built to assist in the fort 's construction the trail crossed the la chute twice ; once about from lake george , and again at the sawmill , which was about from the fort to the north of the fort was a road going to fort st to the west was a low rise of land , beyond which lay mount hope , a rise that commanded part of the portage trail , but was too far from the fort to pose it any danger 26 the most serious geographic defect in the fort 's location was mount defiance ( known at the time of this battle as rattlesnake hill , and in the 1770s as sugar bush ) , which lay to the south of the fort , across the la chute river this hill , which was steep and densely forested , provided an excellent firing position for cannon aimed at the fort 134 nicolas sarrebource de pontleroy , montcalm 's chief engineer , said of the fort 's site , '' were i to be entrusted with the siege of it , i should require only six mortars and two cannon prior to 1758 , the french and indian war had gone very poorly for the british , whose military met few of its objectives the third campaign , assigned to general james abercrombie , was to launch an attack against canada through the champlain valley howe was appointed a brigadier general , and placed as abercrombie 's second in command 60 , 65 the french , who had started construction on fort carillon in 1755 , lonergan , p 92 the lack of support from france was in large part due to an unwillingness of the french military to risk the movement of significant military forces across the atlantic ocean , which was dominated by britain 's royal navy they had fewer than 5,000 regular troops , an estimated six thousand militia men , and a limited number of indian allies , to bring against british forces reported to number 50,000 montcalm believed this to be folly , as the plan would enable the british to easily divert some of their forces to fend off the french attack colonel françois-charles de bourlamaque , in command of fort carillon prior to montcalm 's arrival , knew by june 23 that a major british offensive was about to begin bourlamaque increased scouting activities , and learned from captured british scouts the approximate size of the british force 106–107 montcalm arrived at fort carillon on june 30 , and found there a significantly under-staffed garrison , with only 3,500 men , and food sufficient for only nine days given the large force facing him and the defects of the fort 's site , montcalm opted for a strategy of defending the likely approaches to the fort on learning the size of the british fleet , which was reportedly '' large enough to cover the face of lake george '' , andersonmade , p 51 beginning on the evening of july 6 , the french began to lay out entrenchments on the rise northwest of the fort , about away , that commanded the land routes to the fort these hastily erected defenses , while proof against small arms fire , would have been ineffective if the british had used cannons against them as they approached the battle scene , general howe was hit and instantly killed by a musket ball a column of massachusetts provincials , also drawn to the battle , cut off the french patrol 's rear fifty men , including trepézet , escaped by swimming across the la chute trepézet died the next day of wounds suffered in the battle 86 the british , frustrated by the difficult woods , demoralized by howe 's death , and exhausted from the overnight boat ride , camped in the woods , and returned to the landing point early the next morning on july 7 abercrombie sent lieutenant colonel john bradstreet and a sizable force down the portage path on reaching the first crossing , where bourlamaque had camped , they rebuilt the bridge there , and proceeded on to the sawmill crossing after ascending rattlesnake hill ( as mount defiance was then known ) , they reported that the french position appeared to be incomplete , and could be '' easily forced , even without cannon '' john donaldson made the center , and the 42nd and 46th under the 42nd 's lt reserve forces were either in the fort itself , or on the grounds between the fort and the entrenchments on mount hope while abercrombie had expected the battle to begin at 1 pm , by 12:30 elements of the new york regiments on the left began engaging the french defenders 64 the sounds of battle led haviland to believe that the french line might have been penetrated , so he ordered his men forward , even though not all of the regulars were in place , and abercrombie had not given an order to advance 159 was reported by his aide , james abercrombie , to be near the rear of the lines by the la chute river during much of the battle , nester , p 156 and to have approached the front of the french lines at one point early in the battle fire from cannons on the fort 's southwest bastion 's sank two of the barges , spurring the remaining vessels to retreat french casualties are normally considered to be comparatively light : 104 killed and 273 wounded in the main battle the same sources must also have reported the shortage of provisions at the fort , a sign that a siege would have ended quickly even though the fort was effectively battle of ticonderoga ( 1759 ) , future defenders of the fort and their superior officers , who may not have been familiar with the site 's shortcomings , fell under the spell of this idea 58 fort ticonderoga was siege of fort ticonderoga ( 1777 ) in july 1777

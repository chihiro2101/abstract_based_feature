fort carillon is situated on a point of land between lake champlain and lake george , at a natural point of conflict between french forces moving south from canada and the st lawrence river valley across the lake toward the hudson valley , and british forces moving up the hudson from albany the fort was sited with lake champlain to the east , with mount independence rising on the far side immediately to the south of the fort lay the mouth of the la chute river , which drains lake george the river was largely non-navigable , and there was a portage trail from the northern end of lake george to the location of a sawmill the french had built to assist in the fort 's construction the trail crossed the la chute twice ; once about from lake george , and again at the sawmill , which was about from the fort to the west was a low rise of land , beyond which lay mount hope , a rise that commanded part of the portage trail , but was too far from the fort to pose it any danger 26 the most serious geographic defect in the fort 's location was mount defiance ( known at the time of this battle as rattlesnake hill , and in the 1770s as sugar bush ) , which lay to the south of the fort , across the la chute river 134 nicolas sarrebource de pontleroy , montcalm 's chief engineer , said of the fort 's site , '' were i to be entrusted with the siege of it , i should require only six mortars and two cannon embarking on a strategy that emphasized defense in europe , where france was strong , and offense in north america , where france was weak , he resolved to attack new france ( the colonial holdings of france in north america ) in three strategic campaigns the third campaign , assigned to general james abercrombie , was to launch an attack against canada through the champlain valley vaudreuil , who had limited combat experience , wanted to divide the french forces , with about 5,000 each at carillon and louisbourg , and then send a picked force of about 3,500 men against the british in the mohawk river on the northwestern frontiers of the province of new york montcalm believed this to be folly , as the plan would enable the british to easily divert some of their forces to fend off the french attack the british amassed their army , under the command of general james abercrombie , near the remains of fort william henry , which lay at the southern end of lake george but had been destroyed following its capture by the french the previous year the army numbered fully 16,000 men , making it the largest single force ever deployed in north america at the time 93 on july 5 , 1758 , these troops embarked on boats , which unloaded them at the north end of lake george on july 6 colonel françois-charles de bourlamaque , in command of fort carillon prior to montcalm 's arrival , knew by june 23 that a major british offensive was about to begin he had sent a messenger bearing a letter from vaudreuil to abercrombie ( part of a conventional exchange of pleasantries between opposing commanders ) on june 10 , expecting him to return ; the fact that the british held him was an indication that the messenger had probably learned too much just by being in the british camp bourlamaque increased scouting activities , and learned from captured british scouts the approximate size of the british force 106–107 montcalm arrived at fort carillon on june 30 , and found there a significantly under-staffed garrison , with only 3,500 men , and food sufficient for only nine days bourlamaque 's scouts reported that the british had 20,000 or more troops massing near the remains of fort william henry given the large force facing him and the defects of the fort 's site , montcalm opted for a strategy of defending the likely approaches to the fort 114 he immediately detached bourlamaque and three battalions to occupy and fortify the river crossing on the portage trail about two miles ( 3.2 & nbsp ; km ) from the northern end of lake george , about from the fort 108 when word reached bourlamaque on july 5 that the british fleet was coming , he sent captain trépezet and about 350 & nbsp ; men to observe the fleet , and , if possible , to prevent their landing the british army began an unopposed landing at the north end of lake george on the morning of july 6 abercrombie first landed an advance force to check the area where the forces were to disembark , and found it recently deserted ; some supplies and equipment had been left behind by the french in their hasty departure 164 near the area where bernetz brook enters the la chute , captain trépezet and his troop , who were attempting to return to the french lines , encountered phineas lyman 's connecticut regiment , sparking a skirmish in the woods as they approached the battle scene , general howe was hit and instantly killed by a musket ball in desperate fighting , about 150 of trepézet 's men were killed , and another 150 were captured scouts and prisoners reported to abercrombie that montcalm had 6,000 men and was expecting the chevalier de lévis to arrive at any moment with 3,000 reinforcements after ascending rattlesnake hill ( as mount defiance was then known ) , they reported that the french position appeared to be incomplete , and could be '' easily forced , even without cannon '' 243 abercrombie 's plan of attack omitted clerk 's recommendation to fortify the summit of rattlesnake hill ; in addition to the frontal assault , 4 six-pound guns and a howitzer were to be floated down the la chute river and mounted at the base of rattlesnake hill , with 20 bateaux of troops to support the effort they were followed by provincials from new york and massachusetts , and then three columns of regulars , who made their way through the provincial formations to begin the attack the 27th and 60th made up the right column , under the command of the 27th 's lt as companies of the regulars came forward , they arranged themselves into lines as instructed , and then began to advance 72 abercrombie , who was reported by early historians like francis parkman and thomas mante to be at the sawmill ( and thus well away from the action ) , parkman , p 71–72 abercrombie ordered his reserves , the connecticut and new jersey provincials , into the battle around 2 , but by 2:30 it was clear their attack also failed abercrombie then tried to recall the troops , but a significant number , notably the 42nd and 46th regiments on the british left , persisted in the attack 76–80 one british observer noted that '' our forces fell exceeding fast '' , while another wrote that they were '' cut down like grass '' 246 finally realizing the scope of the disaster , abercrombie ordered the troops to muster and march down to the landing on lake george lévis in one report claimed that the french recovered 800 british bodies , implying that abercrombie may have underreported the actual death toll the fact that fortifications were built along the portage road but then abandoned by the french is one indication of this failure of strategic thinking in 1777 , when general john burgoyne advanced down lake champlain at the beginning of the saratoga campaign , general george washington , who had never seen the fort , thought highly of its defensive value 65–74 the modern flag of quebec is based upon a banner reputedly carried by the victorious french forces at carillon

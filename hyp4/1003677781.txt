the term '' cut and paste '' comes from the traditional practice in manuscript-editings whereby people would cut paragraphs from a page with scissors and paste them onto another page the act of copying/transferring text from one part of a computer-based document ( '' buffer '' ) to a different location within the same or different computer-based document was a part of the earliest on-line computer editors this mechanism was often used to transfer frequently-used commands or text snippets from additional buffers into the document , as was the case with the qed text editor often this was done with a '' move '' command , but some text editors required that the text be first put into some temporary location for later retrieval/placement in 1983 , the apple lisa became the first text editing system to call that temporary location '' the clipboard '' earlier control schemes such as nls used a word order command structure , where the command name was provided first and the object to be copied or moved was second the inversion from verb—object to object—verb on which copy and paste are based , where the user selects the object to be operated before initiating the operation , was an innovation crucial for the success of the desktop metaphor as it allowed copy and move operations based on direct manipulation beginning in 1974 , he and colleagues at xerox parc implemented several text editors that used cut/copy-and-paste commands to move/copy text apple mapped the functionalities to key combinations consisting of the command key ( a special modifier key ) held down while typing the letters x ( for cut ) , c ( for copy ) , and v ( for paste ) , choosing a handful of keyboard shortcuts to control basic editing operations microsoft later also adopted the apple key combinations with the introduction of windows , using the control key as modifier key the user selects or '' highlights '' the text or file for moving by some method , typically by dragging over the text or file name with the pointing-device or holding down the shift key while using the arrow keys to move the text cursor on most systems only one clipboard location exists , hence another cut or copy operation overwrites the previously stored information a paste operation takes place which visibly inserts the clipboard text at the insertion point ( the paste operation does not typically destroy the clipboard text : it remains available in the clipboard and the user can insert additional copies at other points ) when a software environment provides cut and paste functionality , a nondestructive operation called copy usually accompanies them ; copy places a copy of the selected text in the clipboard without removing it from its original location the x window system maintains an additional clipboard containing the most recently selected text ; middle-clicking pastes the content of this '' selection '' clipboard into whatever the pointer is on at that time in a spreadsheet , moving ( cut and paste ) need not equate to copying ( copy and paste ) and then deleting the original : when moving , references to the moved cells may move accordingly each time a user performs a cut or copy operation , the system adds the affected text to the ring tracking and recording copy operations of users and using that data as implicit user feedback on the website content can be beneficial in a wide range of applications and uses , including in automatic summarization , and in text simplification .

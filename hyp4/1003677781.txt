the term '' cut and paste '' comes from the traditional practice in manuscript-editings whereby people would cut paragraphs from a page with scissors and paste them onto another page the act of copying/transferring text from one part of a computer-based document ( '' buffer '' ) to a different location within the same or different computer-based document was a part of the earliest on-line computer editors this mechanism was often used to transfer frequently-used commands or text snippets from additional buffers into the document , as was the case with the qed text editor often this was done with a '' move '' command , but some text editors required that the text be first put into some temporary location for later retrieval/placement in 1983 , the apple lisa became the first text editing system to call that temporary location '' the clipboard '' the inversion from verb—object to object—verb on which copy and paste are based , where the user selects the object to be operated before initiating the operation , was an innovation crucial for the success of the desktop metaphor as it allowed copy and move operations based on direct manipulation inspired by early line and character editors that broke a move or copy operation into two steps—between which the user could invoke a preparatory action such as navigation—larry tesler proposed the names '' cut '' and '' copy '' for the first step and '' paste '' for the second step beginning in 1974 , he and colleagues at xerox parc implemented several text editors that used cut/copy-and-paste commands to move/copy text similar patterns of key combinations , later borrowed by others , remain widely available in most gui text editors , word processors , and file system browsers it was dropped , one presumes , because the original apple and ibm guis were not high enough density to permit multiple windows , as were the parc machines , and so multiple simultaneous windows were rarely used the user selects or '' highlights '' the text or file for moving by some method , typically by dragging over the text or file name with the pointing-device or holding down the shift key while using the arrow keys to move the text cursor on most systems only one clipboard location exists , hence another cut or copy operation overwrites the previously stored information ( the paste operation does not typically destroy the clipboard text : it remains available in the clipboard and the user can insert additional copies at other points ) whereas cut-and-paste often takes place with a mouse-equivalent in windows-like gui environments , it may also occur entirely from the keyboard , especially in unix text editors , such as pico or vi when a software environment provides cut and paste functionality , a nondestructive operation called copy usually accompanies them ; copy places a copy of the selected text in the clipboard without removing it from its original location text can be placed in the find buffer by either using the find panel or by selecting text and hitting that is , if you enter a text in the find panel ( or with in one application and then switch to another application you can immediately start searching without having to enter the search text again each time a user performs a cut or copy operation , the system adds the affected text to the ring tracking and recording copy operations of users and using that data as implicit user feedback on the website content can be beneficial in a wide range of applications and uses , including in automatic summarization , and in text simplification .

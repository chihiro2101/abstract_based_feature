the term '' cut and paste '' comes from the traditional practice in manuscript-editings whereby people would cut paragraphs from a page with scissors and paste them onto another page the act of copying/transferring text from one part of a computer-based document ( '' buffer '' ) to a different location within the same or different computer-based document was a part of the earliest on-line computer editors often this was done with a '' move '' command , but some text editors required that the text be first put into some temporary location for later retrieval/placement earlier control schemes such as nls used a word order command structure , where the command name was provided first and the object to be copied or moved was second the inversion from verb—object to object—verb on which copy and paste are based , where the user selects the object to be operated before initiating the operation , was an innovation crucial for the success of the desktop metaphor as it allowed copy and move operations based on direct manipulation apple mapped the functionalities to key combinations consisting of the command key ( a special modifier key ) held down while typing the letters x ( for cut ) , c ( for copy ) , and v ( for paste ) , choosing a handful of keyboard shortcuts to control basic editing operations conceptually , the text has now moved to a location often called the clipboard on most systems only one clipboard location exists , hence another cut or copy operation overwrites the previously stored information many unix text-editors provide multiple clipboard entries , as do some macintosh programs such as clipboard master , and windows clipboard manager programs such as the one in microsoft office ( the paste operation does not typically destroy the clipboard text : it remains available in the clipboard and the user can insert additional copies at other points ) whereas cut-and-paste often takes place with a mouse-equivalent in windows-like gui environments , it may also occur entirely from the keyboard , especially in unix text editors , such as pico or vi when a software environment provides cut and paste functionality , a nondestructive operation called copy usually accompanies them ; copy places a copy of the selected text in the clipboard without removing it from its original location some application programs provide a means of viewing , or sometimes even editing , the data on the clipboard the popularity of this method stems from its simplicity and the ease with which users can move data between various applications visually – without resorting to disk storage together with copy and paste this can be used for quick and easy replacement of repeated text : select the text that you want to replace ( i.e in a spreadsheet , moving ( cut and paste ) need not equate to copying ( copy and paste ) and then deleting the original : when moving , references to the moved cells may move accordingly each time a user performs a cut or copy operation , the system adds the affected text to the ring web users copy on website different things for different reasons , including words and phrases to look up elsewhere , key sentences for use in citations and text summaries , and programming code fragments for use in software development tracking and recording copy operations of users and using that data as implicit user feedback on the website content can be beneficial in a wide range of applications and uses , including in automatic summarization , and in text simplification .

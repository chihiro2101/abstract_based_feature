the term '' cut and paste '' comes from the traditional practice in manuscript-editings whereby people would cut paragraphs from a page with scissors and paste them onto another page the act of copying/transferring text from one part of a computer-based document ( '' buffer '' ) to a different location within the same or different computer-based document was a part of the earliest on-line computer editors this mechanism was often used to transfer frequently-used commands or text snippets from additional buffers into the document , as was the case with the qed text editor often this was done with a '' move '' command , but some text editors required that the text be first put into some temporary location for later retrieval/placement in 1983 , the apple lisa became the first text editing system to call that temporary location '' the clipboard '' earlier control schemes such as nls used a word order command structure , where the command name was provided first and the object to be copied or moved was second the inversion from verb—object to object—verb on which copy and paste are based , where the user selects the object to be operated before initiating the operation , was an innovation crucial for the success of the desktop metaphor as it allowed copy and move operations based on direct manipulation inspired by early line and character editors that broke a move or copy operation into two steps—between which the user could invoke a preparatory action such as navigation—larry tesler proposed the names '' cut '' and '' copy '' for the first step and '' paste '' for the second step beginning in 1974 , he and colleagues at xerox parc implemented several text editors that used cut/copy-and-paste commands to move/copy text apple mapped the functionalities to key combinations consisting of the command key ( a special modifier key ) held down while typing the letters x ( for cut ) , c ( for copy ) , and v ( for paste ) , choosing a handful of keyboard shortcuts to control basic editing operations the original copy/cut/paste workflow , as implemented at parc , utilized a unique workflow : with two windows on the same screen , the user could use the mouse to pick a point at which to make an insertion in one window ( or a segment of text to replace ) the user selects or '' highlights '' the text or file for moving by some method , typically by dragging over the text or file name with the pointing-device or holding down the shift key while using the arrow keys to move the text cursor ( the paste operation does not typically destroy the clipboard text : it remains available in the clipboard and the user can insert additional copies at other points ) when a software environment provides cut and paste functionality , a nondestructive operation called copy usually accompanies them ; copy places a copy of the selected text in the clipboard without removing it from its original location together with copy and paste this can be used for quick and easy replacement of repeated text : select the text that you want to replace ( i.e by double clicking ) put the text in the find buffer with overwrite the selected text with your replacement text select the replacement text ( try to avoid lifting your hands from the keyboard ) copy the replacement text find the next or previous occurrence / paste the replacement text repeat the last two steps as often as needed or in short : select , replstr , , , , , , in a spreadsheet , moving ( cut and paste ) need not equate to copying ( copy and paste ) and then deleting the original : when moving , references to the moved cells may move accordingly each time a user performs a cut or copy operation , the system adds the affected text to the ring tracking and recording copy operations of users and using that data as implicit user feedback on the website content can be beneficial in a wide range of applications and uses , including in automatic summarization , and in text simplification .

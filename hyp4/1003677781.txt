the term '' cut and paste '' comes from the traditional practice in manuscript-editings whereby people would cut paragraphs from a page with scissors and paste them onto another page as soon as computer data entry moved from punch-cards to online files ( in the mid/late 1960s ) there were '' commands '' for accomplishing this operation this mechanism was often used to transfer frequently-used commands or text snippets from additional buffers into the document , as was the case with the qed text editor often this was done with a '' move '' command , but some text editors required that the text be first put into some temporary location for later retrieval/placement in 1983 , the apple lisa became the first text editing system to call that temporary location '' the clipboard '' inspired by early line and character editors that broke a move or copy operation into two steps—between which the user could invoke a preparatory action such as navigation—larry tesler proposed the names '' cut '' and '' copy '' for the first step and '' paste '' for the second step microsoft later also adopted the apple key combinations with the introduction of windows , using the control key as modifier key it was dropped , one presumes , because the original apple and ibm guis were not high enough density to permit multiple windows , as were the parc machines , and so multiple simultaneous windows were rarely used the user selects or '' highlights '' the text or file for moving by some method , typically by dragging over the text or file name with the pointing-device or holding down the shift key while using the arrow keys to move the text cursor a paste operation takes place which visibly inserts the clipboard text at the insertion point ( the paste operation does not typically destroy the clipboard text : it remains available in the clipboard and the user can insert additional copies at other points ) when a software environment provides cut and paste functionality , a nondestructive operation called copy usually accompanies them ; copy places a copy of the selected text in the clipboard without removing it from its original location the clipboard usually stays invisible , because the operations of cutting and pasting , while actually independent , usually take place in quick succession , and the user ( usually ) needs no assistance in understanding the operation or maintaining mental context some application programs provide a means of viewing , or sometimes even editing , the data on the clipboard it differs from cut and paste in that the original source text or data does not get deleted or removed together with copy and paste this can be used for quick and easy replacement of repeated text : select the text that you want to replace ( i.e in a spreadsheet , moving ( cut and paste ) need not equate to copying ( copy and paste ) and then deleting the original : when moving , references to the moved cells may move accordingly each time a user performs a cut or copy operation , the system adds the affected text to the ring tracking and recording copy operations of users and using that data as implicit user feedback on the website content can be beneficial in a wide range of applications and uses , including in automatic summarization , and in text simplification .

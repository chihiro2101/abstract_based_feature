the term '' cut and paste '' comes from the traditional practice in manuscript-editings whereby people would cut paragraphs from a page with scissors and paste them onto another page as soon as computer data entry moved from punch-cards to online files ( in the mid/late 1960s ) there were '' commands '' for accomplishing this operation this mechanism was often used to transfer frequently-used commands or text snippets from additional buffers into the document , as was the case with the qed text editor often this was done with a '' move '' command , but some text editors required that the text be first put into some temporary location for later retrieval/placement in 1983 , the apple lisa became the first text editing system to call that temporary location '' the clipboard '' earlier control schemes such as nls used a word order command structure , where the command name was provided first and the object to be copied or moved was second inspired by early line and character editors that broke a move or copy operation into two steps—between which the user could invoke a preparatory action such as navigation—larry tesler proposed the names '' cut '' and '' copy '' for the first step and '' paste '' for the second step apple computer widely popularized the computer-based cut/copy-and-paste paradigm through the lisa ( 1983 ) and macintosh ( 1984 ) operating systems and applications the user performs a '' cut '' operation via key combination for macintosh users ) , menu , or other means many unix text-editors provide multiple clipboard entries , as do some macintosh programs such as clipboard master , and windows clipboard manager programs such as the one in microsoft office a paste operation takes place which visibly inserts the clipboard text at the insertion point ( the paste operation does not typically destroy the clipboard text : it remains available in the clipboard and the user can insert additional copies at other points ) once one has copied data into the clipboard , one may paste the contents of the clipboard into a destination document the x window system maintains an additional clipboard containing the most recently selected text ; middle-clicking pastes the content of this '' selection '' clipboard into whatever the pointer is on at that time most terminal emulators and some other applications support the key combinations ctrl-insert to copy and shift-insert to paste in a spreadsheet , moving ( cut and paste ) need not equate to copying ( copy and paste ) and then deleting the original : when moving , references to the moved cells may move accordingly similarly , a kill ring provides a lifo stack used for cut-and-paste operations as a type of clipboard capable of storing multiple pieces of data concerns exist over the use of copy and paste functions in healthcare documentation and electronic health records tracking and recording copy operations of users and using that data as implicit user feedback on the website content can be beneficial in a wide range of applications and uses , including in automatic summarization , and in text simplification .

eric gardner , noticed he was seeing a motor cyclist with head injuries about every 2 weeks moss of bethnal green to make canvas and shellac helmets stiff enough to stand a heavy blow and smooth enough to glance off any projections it encountered he presented the design to the auto-cycle union where it was initially condemned , but later converted to the idea and made them compulsory for the 1914 isle of man tt races , although there was resistance from riders gardner took 94 of these helmets with him to the isle of man , and one rider who hit a gate with a glancing blow was saved by the helmet lawrence ( known as lawrence of arabia ) had a crash on a brough superior ss100 on a narrow road near his cottage near wareham one of the doctors attending him was hugh cairns , a neurosurgeon , who after lawrence 's death began a long study of what he saw as the unnecessary loss of life by motorcycle despatch riders through head injuries cairns ' research led to the increased use of crash helmets by both military and civilian motorcyclists a 2008 systematic study showed that helmets reduce the risk of head injury by around 69 % and the risk of death by around 42 % although it was once speculated that wearing a motorcycle helmet increased neck and spinal injuries in a crash , recent evidence has shown the opposite to be the case : helmets protect against cervical spine injury all of these types of helmets are secured by a chin strap , and their protective benefits are greatly reduced , if not eliminated , if the chin strap is not securely fastened so as to maintain a snug fit a full face helmet covers the entire head , with a rear that covers the base of the skull , and a protective section over the front of the chin such helmets have an open cutout in a band across the eyes and nose , and often include a clear or tinted transparent plastic face shield , known as a visor , that generally swivels up and down to allow access to the face 2f motocross sometimes omit the face shield , but extend the visor and chin portions to increase ventilation , since riding off-road is a very strenuous activity studies have shown that full face helmets offer the most protection to motorcycle riders because 35 % of all crashes showed major impact on the chin-bar area originally , off-road helmets did not include a chin bar , with riders using helmets very similar to modern open face street helmets , and using a face mask to fend off dirt and debris from the nose and mouth modern off-road helmets include a ( typically angular , rather than round ) chin bar to provide some facial impact protection in addition to protection from flying dirt and debris when fully assembled and closed , they resemble full face helmets by bearing a chin bar for absorbing face impacts its chin bar may be pivoted upwards ( or , in some cases , may be removed ) by a special lever to allow access to most of the face , as in an open face helmet the chin bar of those helmets offer real protection and they can be used in the '' open '' position while riding as of 2008 , there have not been wide scientific studies of modular helmets to assess how protective the pivoting or removable chin bars are ece 22.05 allows certification of modular helmets with or without chin bar tests , distinguished by -p ( protective lower face cover ) and -np ( non-protective ) suffixes to the certification number , and additional warning text for non-certified chin bars the open face , or '' three-quarters '' , helmet covers the ears , cheeks , and back of the head , but lacks the lower chin bar of the full face helmet an open face helmet provides the same rear protection as a full face helmet , but little protection to the face , even from non-crash events alternatively , many open face helmets include , or can be fitted with , a face shield , which is more effective in stopping flying insects from entering the helmet 2007 and popular with rockers and road racers of the 1960s in the british isles riders wearing a plain white helmet rather than a black one were associated with a 24 % lower risk of suffering a motorcycle accident injury or death thumb motorcycle helmets greatly reduce injuries and fatalities in motorcycle accidents , the effect of the 1992 california motorcycle helmet use law on motorcycle crash fatalities and injuries however , the dot standard does not test the chin bar of helmets with them , while the snell ( and ece ) standards do for full-face type only the sheet metal wall of a car door may bend inwards to a depth of during a helmeted-head impact , allowing more stopping distance for the rider 's head than the helmet itself

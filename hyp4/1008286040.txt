lawrence on a brough superior ss100 the origins of the crash helmet date back to the brooklands race track in early 1914 '' how the crash helmet originated '' , motor cycle magazine , june 22nd , 1922 where a medical officer , dr eric gardner , noticed he was seeing a motor cyclist with head injuries about every 2 weeks gardner took 94 of these helmets with him to the isle of man , and one rider who hit a gate with a glancing blow was saved by the helmet gardner received a letter later from the isle of man medical officer stating that after the t.t one of the doctors attending him was hugh cairns , a neurosurgeon , who after lawrence 's death began a long study of what he saw as the unnecessary loss of life by motorcycle despatch riders through head injuries a 2008 systematic study showed that helmets reduce the risk of head injury by around 69 % and the risk of death by around 42 % although it was once speculated that wearing a motorcycle helmet increased neck and spinal injuries in a crash , recent evidence has shown the opposite to be the case : helmets protect against cervical spine injury all of these types of helmets are secured by a chin strap , and their protective benefits are greatly reduced , if not eliminated , if the chin strap is not securely fastened so as to maintain a snug fit a full face helmet covers the entire head , with a rear that covers the base of the skull , and a protective section over the front of the chin such helmets have an open cutout in a band across the eyes and nose , and often include a clear or tinted transparent plastic face shield , known as a visor , that generally swivels up and down to allow access to the face many full face helmets include vents to increase the airflow to the rider 2f motocross sometimes omit the face shield , but extend the visor and chin portions to increase ventilation , since riding off-road is a very strenuous activity studies have shown that full face helmets offer the most protection to motorcycle riders because 35 % of all crashes showed major impact on the chin-bar area the visor allows the rider to dip his or her head and provide further protection from flying debris during off-road riding originally , off-road helmets did not include a chin bar , with riders using helmets very similar to modern open face street helmets , and using a face mask to fend off dirt and debris from the nose and mouth modern off-road helmets include a ( typically angular , rather than round ) chin bar to provide some facial impact protection in addition to protection from flying dirt and debris when properly combined with goggles , the result provides most of the same protective features of full face street helmets its chin bar may be pivoted upwards ( or , in some cases , may be removed ) by a special lever to allow access to most of the face , as in an open face helmet it is also popular with people who use eyeglasses as it allows them to fit a helmet without removing their glasses since the chin bar section also protrudes further from the forehead than a three-quarters visor , riding with the helmet in the open position may pose increased risk of neck injury in a crash some modular helmets are dual certified as full face and open face helmet the chin bar of those helmets offer real protection and they can be used in the '' open '' position while riding the open face , or '' three-quarters '' , helmet covers the ears , cheeks , and back of the head , but lacks the lower chin bar of the full face helmet many offer snap-on visors that may be used by the rider to reduce sunlight glare an open face helmet provides the same rear protection as a full face helmet , but little protection to the face , even from non-crash events states , is required by law ) for riders to wear wrap-around sunglasses or goggles to supplement eye protection with these helmets in some countries , most notably the united states and india , there is opposition to compulsory helmet use ( see helmet law defense league ) ; not all u.s many countries have set standards for the effectiveness of a motorcycle helmet , including the following the standard also describes how helmets must be labeled , including with such information as how to wear and clean the helmet , its size and mass , and warnings to replace the helmet after a violent impact

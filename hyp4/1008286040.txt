lawrence on a brough superior ss100 the origins of the crash helmet date back to the brooklands race track in early 1914 '' how the crash helmet originated '' , motor cycle magazine , june 22nd , 1922 where a medical officer , dr moss of bethnal green to make canvas and shellac helmets stiff enough to stand a heavy blow and smooth enough to glance off any projections it encountered gardner took 94 of these helmets with him to the isle of man , and one rider who hit a gate with a glancing blow was saved by the helmet although it was once speculated that wearing a motorcycle helmet increased neck and spinal injuries in a crash , recent evidence has shown the opposite to be the case : helmets protect against cervical spine injury many full face helmets include vents to increase the airflow to the rider 2f motocross sometimes omit the face shield , but extend the visor and chin portions to increase ventilation , since riding off-road is a very strenuous activity studies have shown that full face helmets offer the most protection to motorcycle riders because 35 % of all crashes showed major impact on the chin-bar area dietmar otte , hannover medical university , department of traffic accident research , germany wearing a helmet with less coverage eliminates that protection â€” the less coverage the helmet offers , the less protection for the rider thumb the motocross and off-road helmet has clearly elongated chin and visor portions , a chin bar , and partially open face to give the rider extra protection while wearing goggles and to allow the unhindered flow of air during the physical exertion typical of this type of riding originally , off-road helmets did not include a chin bar , with riders using helmets very similar to modern open face street helmets , and using a face mask to fend off dirt and debris from the nose and mouth modern off-road helmets include a ( typically angular , rather than round ) chin bar to provide some facial impact protection in addition to protection from flying dirt and debris thumb a hybrid between full face and open face helmets for street use is the modular or '' flip-up '' helmet , also sometimes termed '' convertible '' or '' flip-face '' when fully assembled and closed , they resemble full face helmets by bearing a chin bar for absorbing face impacts it is also popular with people who use eyeglasses as it allows them to fit a helmet without removing their glasses the curved shape of an open chin bar and face shield section can cause increased wind drag during riding , as air will not flow around an open modular helmet in the same way as a three-quarters helmet the chin bar of those helmets offer real protection and they can be used in the '' open '' position while riding ece 22.05 allows certification of modular helmets with or without chin bar tests , distinguished by -p ( protective lower face cover ) and -np ( non-protective ) suffixes to the certification number , and additional warning text for non-certified chin bars . open face or 3/4 helmet the open face , or '' three-quarters '' , helmet covers the ears , cheeks , and back of the head , but lacks the lower chin bar of the full face helmet an open face helmet provides the same rear protection as a full face helmet , but little protection to the face , even from non-crash events alternatively , many open face helmets include , or can be fitted with , a face shield , which is more effective in stopping flying insects from entering the helmet the half helmet , also referred to as a '' shorty '' in the united states and '' pudding basin '' or tt helmet in the uk classic motorcycling : a guide for the 21st century by rex bunn as with the open face , it is not uncommon to augment this helmet 's eye protection through other means such as goggles department of transportation ( dot ) standards , and are unsuitable for crash protection because they lack the energy-absorbing foam that protects the brain by allowing it to come to a gradual stop during an impact riders wearing a plain white helmet rather than a black one were associated with a 24 % lower risk of suffering a motorcycle accident injury or death motorcycle helmets are generally designed to distort in a crash ( thus expending the energy otherwise destined for the wearer 's skull ) , so they provide little protection at the site of their first impact , but continued protection over the remainder of the helmet however , the dot standard does not test the chin bar of helmets with them , while the snell ( and ece ) standards do for full-face type only the standard also describes how helmets must be labeled , including with such information as how to wear and clean the helmet , its size and mass , and warnings to replace the helmet after a violent impact while motorcyclists frequently ride at speeds higher than 20 & nbsp ; m/s ( 45 & nbsp ; mph ) , the perpendicular impact speed of the helmet is usually not the same as the road speed of the motorcycle , and the severity of the impact is determined not only by the speed of the head but also by the surface it hits and the angle of impact

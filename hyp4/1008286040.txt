lawrence on a brough superior ss100 the origins of the crash helmet date back to the brooklands race track in early 1914 '' how the crash helmet originated '' , motor cycle magazine , june 22nd , 1922 where a medical officer , dr gardner took 94 of these helmets with him to the isle of man , and one rider who hit a gate with a glancing blow was saved by the helmet he was not wearing a helmet , and suffered serious head injuries which left him in a coma ; he died after six days in the hospital a 2008 systematic study showed that helmets reduce the risk of head injury by around 69 % and the risk of death by around 42 % although it was once speculated that wearing a motorcycle helmet increased neck and spinal injuries in a crash , recent evidence has shown the opposite to be the case : helmets protect against cervical spine injury there are five basic types of helmets intended for motorcycling , and others not intended for motorcycling but which are used by some riders from most to least protective , as generally accepted by riders and manufacturers , the helmet types are : a full face helmet covers the entire head , with a rear that covers the base of the skull , and a protective section over the front of the chin many full face helmets include vents to increase the airflow to the rider some wearers dislike the increased heat , sense of isolation , lack of wind , and reduced hearing of such helmets studies have shown that full face helmets offer the most protection to motorcycle riders because 35 % of all crashes showed major impact on the chin-bar area the visor allows the rider to dip his or her head and provide further protection from flying debris during off-road riding originally , off-road helmets did not include a chin bar , with riders using helmets very similar to modern open face street helmets , and using a face mask to fend off dirt and debris from the nose and mouth when fully assembled and closed , they resemble full face helmets by bearing a chin bar for absorbing face impacts its chin bar may be pivoted upwards ( or , in some cases , may be removed ) by a special lever to allow access to most of the face , as in an open face helmet it is also popular with people who use eyeglasses as it allows them to fit a helmet without removing their glasses the curved shape of an open chin bar and face shield section can cause increased wind drag during riding , as air will not flow around an open modular helmet in the same way as a three-quarters helmet since the chin bar section also protrudes further from the forehead than a three-quarters visor , riding with the helmet in the open position may pose increased risk of neck injury in a crash some modular helmets are dual certified as full face and open face helmet as of 2008 , there have not been wide scientific studies of modular helmets to assess how protective the pivoting or removable chin bars are an open face helmet provides the same rear protection as a full face helmet , but little protection to the face , even from non-crash events alternatively , many open face helmets include , or can be fitted with , a face shield , which is more effective in stopping flying insects from entering the helmet as with the open face , it is not uncommon to augment this helmet 's eye protection through other means such as goggles because of their inferiority compared to other helmet styles , some motorcycle safety foundations prohibit the use of half helmets now there are other types of headwear often called '' beanies , '' '' brain buckets '' , or '' novelty helmets '' , a term which arose since they are uncertified and can not legally be called motorcycle helmets in some jurisdictions although black helmets are popular among motorcyclists , one study determined they offer the least visibility to motorists this study also notes '' riders wearing high visibility clothing and white helmets are likely to be more safety conscious than other riders the standard also describes how helmets must be labeled , including with such information as how to wear and clean the helmet , its size and mass , and warnings to replace the helmet after a violent impact most motorcycle helmet standards use impacts at speeds between 4 & ndash ; 7 & nbsp ; m/s ( 9 & ndash ; 16 & nbsp ; mph )

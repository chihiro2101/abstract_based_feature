lawrence on a brough superior ss100 the origins of the crash helmet date back to the brooklands race track in early 1914 '' how the crash helmet originated '' , motor cycle magazine , june 22nd , 1922 where a medical officer , dr lawrence ( known as lawrence of arabia ) had a crash on a brough superior ss100 on a narrow road near his cottage near wareham he was not wearing a helmet , and suffered serious head injuries which left him in a coma ; he died after six days in the hospital cairns ' research led to the increased use of crash helmets by both military and civilian motorcyclists a 2008 systematic study showed that helmets reduce the risk of head injury by around 69 % and the risk of death by around 42 % all of these types of helmets are secured by a chin strap , and their protective benefits are greatly reduced , if not eliminated , if the chin strap is not securely fastened so as to maintain a snug fit a full face helmet covers the entire head , with a rear that covers the base of the skull , and a protective section over the front of the chin dietmar otte , hannover medical university , department of traffic accident research , germany wearing a helmet with less coverage eliminates that protection â€” the less coverage the helmet offers , the less protection for the rider the visor allows the rider to dip his or her head and provide further protection from flying debris during off-road riding originally , off-road helmets did not include a chin bar , with riders using helmets very similar to modern open face street helmets , and using a face mask to fend off dirt and debris from the nose and mouth when fully assembled and closed , they resemble full face helmets by bearing a chin bar for absorbing face impacts the rider may thus eat , drink or have a conversation without unfastening the chinstrap and removing the helmet , making them popular among motor officers it is also popular with people who use eyeglasses as it allows them to fit a helmet without removing their glasses many modular helmets are designed to be worn only in the closed position for riding , as the movable chin bar is designed as a convenience feature , useful while not actively riding the curved shape of an open chin bar and face shield section can cause increased wind drag during riding , as air will not flow around an open modular helmet in the same way as a three-quarters helmet some modular helmets are dual certified as full face and open face helmet an example of such a helmet would be the bmw system 6 as of 2008 , there have not been wide scientific studies of modular helmets to assess how protective the pivoting or removable chin bars are observation and unofficial testing suggest that significantly greater protection exists beyond that for an open face helmet , and may be enough to pass full-face helmet standardized tests , but the extent of protection is not fully established by all standards bodies the open face , or '' three-quarters '' , helmet covers the ears , cheeks , and back of the head , but lacks the lower chin bar of the full face helmet an open face helmet provides the same rear protection as a full face helmet , but little protection to the face , even from non-crash events alternatively , many open face helmets include , or can be fitted with , a face shield , which is more effective in stopping flying insects from entering the helmet the bsa gold star by mick walker , 2004 it has essentially the same front design as an open face helmet but without a lowered rear in the shape of a bowl as with the open face , it is not uncommon to augment this helmet 's eye protection through other means such as goggles because of their inferiority compared to other helmet styles , some motorcycle safety foundations prohibit the use of half helmets now this study also notes '' riders wearing high visibility clothing and white helmets are likely to be more safety conscious than other riders the purpose of the foam liner is to crush during an impact , thereby increasing the distance and period of time over which the head stops and reducing its deceleration however , the dot standard does not test the chin bar of helmets with them , while the snell ( and ece ) standards do for full-face type only 22.05 contains '' uniform provisions concerning the approval of protective helmets and their visors for drivers and passengers of motor cycles and mopeds ''

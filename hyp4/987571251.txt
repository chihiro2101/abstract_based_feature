askham bog formed within the vale of york in a hollow which became flooded with melt-water from the last glacial melt about 15,000 years ago continuing further up are layers of fen peat and sphagnum peat , of which the latter also contains traces of scorpidium and eriophorum however , subsequent colonization by common reed , whose fossilized root fragments have been found immediately above the nekron mud layer , lead to a reduced extent of open water in turn , a layer of fen peat gradually accumulated above the mud in the bog centre to begin forming a raised bog the increased elevation of the central peat mound began to cut off the direct influx of base-rich waters into the bog from the surrounding land and existing bases in the raised peat were leached out through rainfall therefore , net loss of bases from the peat in the centre of the bog gradually led to increased soil acidity , with loss of the original rich fen community which previously covered the whole area consequently , the nutrient-poor , acid surface enabled sphagnum mosses to thrive on the raised bog and contribute greatly to the bulk of peat forming above the fen margins the continued net accumulation of peat in the centre relative to the margins led to a further increase in elevation of the central peat dome , so that supply of base-rich groundwater was prevented completely , therefore rendering the peat centre ombrotrophic the linyphiid spiders of askham bog a site on the edge of askham bog was earmarked by a developer for a plot of 500 homes askham bog is regarded as one of the most ecologically diverse sites in northern england ; usher mb askham bog is one of the few northern examples in england to show such an array of habitat transitions askham bog status – natural england ’ s sssi information ecological studies at askham bog nature reserve 1 other tree species growing alongside oak in the acid centre include hazel , frangula alnus and rowan acidification , nitrogen deposition and rapid vegetational change in a small valley mire in yorkshire notable species include ranunculus , stellaria , saw sedge , marsh fern , great water dock , meadow thistle , purple small reed , carex appropinquata and water violet askham bog is rich in invertebrates , and is nationally known for its diversity of water beetles such as haliplidae , noteridae , dytiscidae and gyrinidae the water vole was once common at askham bog , but has now been largely eradicated by the american mink documentary evidence for this exists in the written bylaws of the manor of drighouses and acomb court rolls restricting peat cutting by tenants the bog was acquired in 1946 by sir francis terry and joseph rowntree , who subsequently both awarded it to yorkshire naturalists ' trust ( now yorkshire wildlife trust ) in 1946 there is fossil evidence in the form of hemp achenes and pollen found preserved in distinct horizons between layers of fen peat and scorpidium-sphagnum peat that this plant was once cultivated at askham bog bradshaw rhw , coxon p a considerable proportion of this grant was invested in management of askham bog to ensure adequate water quality and level required for the bog wildlife

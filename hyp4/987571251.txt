askham bog formed within the vale of york in a hollow which became flooded with melt-water from the last glacial melt about 15,000 years ago the bog is sealed with a bottom-most layer largely comprising boulder clay , sand and gravel on top , there is a distinct layering of organic deposits , collectively reflecting a series of biological and geological periods continuing further up are layers of fen peat and sphagnum peat , of which the latter also contains traces of scorpidium and eriophorum the nekron mud layer reflects a permanent switch to a relatively warm post-glacial climate during which this layer formed it contains an abundance of plant remains which in turn reflect a period of rich floral growth at this time in turn , a layer of fen peat gradually accumulated above the mud in the bog centre to begin forming a raised bog therefore , net loss of bases from the peat in the centre of the bog gradually led to increased soil acidity , with loss of the original rich fen community which previously covered the whole area consequently , the nutrient-poor , acid surface enabled sphagnum mosses to thrive on the raised bog and contribute greatly to the bulk of peat forming above the fen margins the linyphiid spiders of askham bog a site on the edge of askham bog was earmarked by a developer for a plot of 500 homes askham bog is regarded as one of the most ecologically diverse sites in northern england ; usher mb askham bog is one of the few northern examples in england to show such an array of habitat transitions although the raised bog originally largely replaced the original fen , medieval peat cutting brought the vegetation back within the influence of base-rich ground water askham bog is extensively wooded , with birch being ubiquitous throughout the mire ecological studies at askham bog nature reserve 1 acidification , nitrogen deposition and rapid vegetational change in a small valley mire in yorkshire the flora of askham bog is not only diverse , but also distinctly resembles plant assemblies in southern england askham bog also holds the largest and most north-eastern colony in england of the rare gingerbread sedge carex elongata , david rw typical amphibians of askham bog include common frog , bufo bufo , and smooth newt the water vole was once common at askham bog , but has now been largely eradicated by the american mink the commitment to preserve and conserve askham bog was the original reason for the trust 's establishment a considerable proportion of this grant was invested in management of askham bog to ensure adequate water quality and level required for the bog wildlife

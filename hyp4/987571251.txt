askham bog formed within the vale of york in a hollow which became flooded with melt-water from the last glacial melt about 15,000 years ago two ridges of terminal moraine had formed on both sides of the hollow and contained the glacial melt-water between and behind them the bog is sealed with a bottom-most layer largely comprising boulder clay , sand and gravel continuing further up are layers of fen peat and sphagnum peat , of which the latter also contains traces of scorpidium and eriophorum it contains an abundance of plant remains which in turn reflect a period of rich floral growth at this time however , subsequent colonization by common reed , whose fossilized root fragments have been found immediately above the nekron mud layer , lead to a reduced extent of open water in turn , a layer of fen peat gradually accumulated above the mud in the bog centre to begin forming a raised bog therefore , net loss of bases from the peat in the centre of the bog gradually led to increased soil acidity , with loss of the original rich fen community which previously covered the whole area consequently , the nutrient-poor , acid surface enabled sphagnum mosses to thrive on the raised bog and contribute greatly to the bulk of peat forming above the fen margins the continued net accumulation of peat in the centre relative to the margins led to a further increase in elevation of the central peat dome , so that supply of base-rich groundwater was prevented completely , therefore rendering the peat centre ombrotrophic the appeal by the community and yorkshire wildlife trust enlisted the help of sir david attenborough , who said that '' it is our collective responsibility to save it askham bog is regarded as one of the most ecologically diverse sites in northern england ; usher mb although the raised bog originally largely replaced the original fen , medieval peat cutting brought the vegetation back within the influence of base-rich ground water askham bog status – natural england ’ s sssi information ecological studies at askham bog nature reserve 1 especially where much of the wood in the north central part has been clear-felled the flora of askham bog is not only diverse , but also distinctly resembles plant assemblies in southern england askham bog also holds the largest and most north-eastern colony in england of the rare gingerbread sedge carex elongata , david rw despite nearby potential sources of human disturbance , the bog provides a suitable shelter within a relatively bare surrounding agricultural landscape and has a rich fruit and seed supply in winter and a richness of invertebrates in summer some rare beetle species include dromius sigma , agabus undulatus ; alongside one record of pselaphus dresdensis which has been found in moss from pond sides at the bog and nowhere else in england typical amphibians of askham bog include common frog , bufo bufo , and smooth newt there is fossil evidence in the form of hemp achenes and pollen found preserved in distinct horizons between layers of fen peat and scorpidium-sphagnum peat that this plant was once cultivated at askham bog bradshaw rhw , coxon p a considerable proportion of this grant was invested in management of askham bog to ensure adequate water quality and level required for the bog wildlife

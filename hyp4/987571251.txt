askham bog formed within the vale of york in a hollow which became flooded with melt-water from the last glacial melt about 15,000 years ago the bog is sealed with a bottom-most layer largely comprising boulder clay , sand and gravel continuing further up are layers of fen peat and sphagnum peat , of which the latter also contains traces of scorpidium and eriophorum in turn , a layer of fen peat gradually accumulated above the mud in the bog centre to begin forming a raised bog the increased elevation of the central peat mound began to cut off the direct influx of base-rich waters into the bog from the surrounding land and existing bases in the raised peat were leached out through rainfall therefore , net loss of bases from the peat in the centre of the bog gradually led to increased soil acidity , with loss of the original rich fen community which previously covered the whole area consequently , the nutrient-poor , acid surface enabled sphagnum mosses to thrive on the raised bog and contribute greatly to the bulk of peat forming above the fen margins changes in the species-area relations of higher plants on nature reserves the ecological diversity is attributable to a wide diversity of habitats ranging from fen-meadow with base-rich ground on the periphery to more inward carr woodland and raised bog with acid soil ; interspersed with ditch and stands of open water the large habitat diversity may be partly explained by the many successional stages present which generally become more advanced towards the centre , in turn related to spatial differences in topography and soil ph askham bog is one of the few northern examples in england to show such an array of habitat transitions the extensive peat cutting in turn led to a return to fen conditions around some of the previously acid soils askham bog status – natural england ’ s sssi information askham bog is extensively wooded , with birch being ubiquitous throughout the mire other tree species growing alongside oak in the acid centre include hazel , frangula alnus and rowan birch has however recently declined in favour of oak , alder and ash , pogg p , squires p , fitter ah the other community is a species-poor acid one towards the centre , including species such as sphagnum palustre , molinia caerulea , rubus fruticosus and honeysuckle although the drop in ph and elevational increase on the peat domes is attributable to sphagnum growth , no sphagnum has been found in one vegetation assemblage characterized by honeysuckle and rubus fruticosus within the acid centre of the bog over 90 bird species have been recorded on the bog , attracting both winter and summer visitors in fact , intensive peat cutting had probably caused substantial topographical changes on the bog since its original geographic formation in turn , a lowering of the acid peat layer due to extraction would have allowed the centre to become flooded by base-rich groundwater , thereby re-transforming it into an open fen there is fossil evidence in the form of hemp achenes and pollen found preserved in distinct horizons between layers of fen peat and scorpidium-sphagnum peat that this plant was once cultivated at askham bog bradshaw rhw , coxon p a considerable proportion of this grant was invested in management of askham bog to ensure adequate water quality and level required for the bog wildlife

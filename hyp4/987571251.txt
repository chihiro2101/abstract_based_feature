askham bog formed within the vale of york in a hollow which became flooded with melt-water from the last glacial melt about 15,000 years ago the bog is sealed with a bottom-most layer largely comprising boulder clay , sand and gravel continuing further up are layers of fen peat and sphagnum peat , of which the latter also contains traces of scorpidium and eriophorum the nekron mud layer reflects a permanent switch to a relatively warm post-glacial climate during which this layer formed in turn , a layer of fen peat gradually accumulated above the mud in the bog centre to begin forming a raised bog the increased elevation of the central peat mound began to cut off the direct influx of base-rich waters into the bog from the surrounding land and existing bases in the raised peat were leached out through rainfall therefore , net loss of bases from the peat in the centre of the bog gradually led to increased soil acidity , with loss of the original rich fen community which previously covered the whole area consequently , the nutrient-poor , acid surface enabled sphagnum mosses to thrive on the raised bog and contribute greatly to the bulk of peat forming above the fen margins conversely , the marginal rich-fen community which receives influx of base-rich groundwater from the surrounding moraines makes ecological conditions here similar to those on the east anglican fens a site on the edge of askham bog was earmarked by a developer for a plot of 500 homes the appeal by the community and yorkshire wildlife trust enlisted the help of sir david attenborough , who said that '' it is our collective responsibility to save it askham bog is regarded as one of the most ecologically diverse sites in northern england ; usher mb the ecological diversity is attributable to a wide diversity of habitats ranging from fen-meadow with base-rich ground on the periphery to more inward carr woodland and raised bog with acid soil ; interspersed with ditch and stands of open water although the raised bog originally largely replaced the original fen , medieval peat cutting brought the vegetation back within the influence of base-rich ground water ecological studies at askham bog nature reserve 1 alder and grey sallow are locally dominant on the fenny margins and oak being so in the acid centre askham bog also holds the largest and most north-eastern colony in england of the rare gingerbread sedge carex elongata , david rw the other community is a species-poor acid one towards the centre , including species such as sphagnum palustre , molinia caerulea , rubus fruticosus and honeysuckle the earliest evidence of nearby peat cutting from the roman period has been found in a roman well in york in the form of lumps of sphagnum peat the spider fauna of askham bog , york , and the assessment of conservation value there is some documentary evidence for this at askham bog in the acomb court roll of 1594 , which restricted where hemp could be retted ( steeped ) owing to the malodour produced by retted fibres and the potential for the retting water to pollute rivers the commitment to preserve and conserve askham bog was the original reason for the trust 's establishment most of the species-rich fen areas are grazed by exmoor ponies to encourage early successional plants such as marsh orchid and meadow thistle , and to suppress vigorous grasses , reed and saplings

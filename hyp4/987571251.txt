askham bog formed within the vale of york in a hollow which became flooded with melt-water from the last glacial melt about 15,000 years ago two ridges of terminal moraine had formed on both sides of the hollow and contained the glacial melt-water between and behind them the bog is sealed with a bottom-most layer largely comprising boulder clay , sand and gravel continuing further up are layers of fen peat and sphagnum peat , of which the latter also contains traces of scorpidium and eriophorum the nekron mud layer reflects a permanent switch to a relatively warm post-glacial climate during which this layer formed in turn , a layer of fen peat gradually accumulated above the mud in the bog centre to begin forming a raised bog the increased elevation of the central peat mound began to cut off the direct influx of base-rich waters into the bog from the surrounding land and existing bases in the raised peat were leached out through rainfall therefore , net loss of bases from the peat in the centre of the bog gradually led to increased soil acidity , with loss of the original rich fen community which previously covered the whole area consequently , the nutrient-poor , acid surface enabled sphagnum mosses to thrive on the raised bog and contribute greatly to the bulk of peat forming above the fen margins conversely , the marginal rich-fen community which receives influx of base-rich groundwater from the surrounding moraines makes ecological conditions here similar to those on the east anglican fens the linyphiid spiders of askham bog the appeal by the community and yorkshire wildlife trust enlisted the help of sir david attenborough , who said that '' it is our collective responsibility to save it askham bog is regarded as one of the most ecologically diverse sites in northern england ; usher mb askham bog is one of the few northern examples in england to show such an array of habitat transitions askham bog status – natural england ’ s sssi information askham bog is extensively wooded , with birch being ubiquitous throughout the mire the flora of askham bog is not only diverse , but also distinctly resembles plant assemblies in southern england askham bog also holds the largest and most north-eastern colony in england of the rare gingerbread sedge carex elongata , david rw a very rare spider species cornicularia kochi ( o.p.-c ) in its hundreds has been recorded in piles of cut-down phragmites during winter the water vole was once common at askham bog , but has now been largely eradicated by the american mink from the early roman period until the mid-18th century , askham bog and its vicinity appeared to be intensely exploited for peat as fuel the earliest evidence of nearby peat cutting from the roman period has been found in a roman well in york in the form of lumps of sphagnum peat a considerable proportion of this grant was invested in management of askham bog to ensure adequate water quality and level required for the bog wildlife

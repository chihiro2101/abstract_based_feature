tia was intended to be a five-year research project by the defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) these components consisted of information analysis , collaboration , decision-support tools , language translation , data-searching , pattern recognition , and privacy-protection technologies tia research included or planned to include the participation of nine government entities : inscom , nsa , dia , cia , cifa , stratcom , socom , jfcom , and jwac universities enlisted to assist with research and development included berkeley , colorado state , carnegie mellon , columbia , cornell , dallas , georgiatech , maryland , mit , and southampton tia 's goal was to revolutionize the united states ' ability to detect , classify and identify foreign terrorists and decipher their plans , thereby enabling the u.s unlike the other program components , genoa predated tia and provided a basis for it it was designed to support both top-down and bottom-up approaches ; a policymaker could hypothesize an attack and use genoa to look for supporting evidence of it or compile pieces of intelligence into a diagram and suggest possible outcomes while genoa primarily focused on intelligence analysis , genoa ii aimed to provide means by which computers , software agents , policymakers , and field operatives could collaborate vast amounts of information were to be collected and analyzed , and the available database technology at the time was insufficient for storing and organizing such enormous quantities of data so they developed techniques for virtual data aggregation to support effective analysis across heterogeneous databases , as well as unstructured public data sources , such as the world wide web '' effective analysis across heterogenous databases '' means the ability to take things from databases which are designed to store different types of data—such as a database containing criminal records , a phone call database and a foreign intelligence database the web is considered an '' unstructured public data source '' because it is publicly accessible and contains many different types of data—blogs , emails , records of visits to websites , etc.—all of which need to be analyzed and stored efficiently scalable social network analysis ( ssna ) aimed to develop techniques based on social network analysis to model the key characteristics of terrorist groups and discriminate them from other societal groups it was to develop the ability to detect patterns comprising multiple types of links between data items or communications ( e.g communicator was to develop '' dialogue interaction '' technology to enable warfighters to talk to computers , such that information would be accessible on the battlefield or in command centers without a keyboard-based interface live exercises were conducted involving small unit logistics operations with the united states marines to test the technology in extreme environments the goals of humanid were to : develop algorithms to find and acquire subjects out to 150 meters ( 500 & nbsp ; ft ) in range fuse face and gait recognition into a 24/7 human identification system gait recognition was a key component of humanid , because it could be employed on low-resolution video feeds and therefore help identify subjects at a distance carnegie mellon university 's robotics institute ( part of the school of computer science ) worked on dynamic face recognition health and biological information tia collected included drug prescriptions , medical records , fingerprints , gait , face and iris data , and dna in january 2002 poindexter was appointed director of the newly created information awareness office division of darpa , which managed tia 's development 108-7 , division m , § 111 ( b ) passed in february , the defense department was given 90 days to compile a report laying out a schedule of tia 's development and the intended use of allotted funds or face a cutoff of support on september 30 , 2003 , congress officially cut off tia 's funding and the information awareness office ( with the senate voting unanimously against it ) because of its unpopular perception by the general public and the media still , in 2013 former director of national intelligence james clapper lied about a massive data collection on us citizens and others in the 2008 british television series the last enemy , tia is portrayed as a uk-based surveillance database that can be used to track and monitor anybody by putting all available government information in one place .

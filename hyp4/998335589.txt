tia was intended to be a five-year research project by the defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) these components consisted of information analysis , collaboration , decision-support tools , language translation , data-searching , pattern recognition , and privacy-protection technologies tia research included or planned to include the participation of nine government entities : inscom , nsa , dia , cia , cifa , stratcom , socom , jfcom , and jwac they were to be able to access tia 's programs through a series of dedicated nodes universities enlisted to assist with research and development included berkeley , colorado state , carnegie mellon , columbia , cornell , dallas , georgiatech , maryland , mit , and southampton tia 's goal was to revolutionize the united states ' ability to detect , classify and identify foreign terrorists and decipher their plans , thereby enabling the u.s to take timely action to preempt and disrupt terrorist activity unlike the other program components , genoa predated tia and provided a basis for it genoa 's primary function was intelligence analysis to assist human analysts genisys aimed to develop technologies that would enable '' ultra-large , all-source information repositories '' vast amounts of information were to be collected and analyzed , and the available database technology at the time was insufficient for storing and organizing such enormous quantities of data so they developed techniques for virtual data aggregation to support effective analysis across heterogeneous databases , as well as unstructured public data sources , such as the world wide web scalable social network analysis ( ssna ) aimed to develop techniques based on social network analysis to model the key characteristics of terrorist groups and discriminate them from other societal groups ) were invited to participate in the annual information retrieval , topic detection and tracking , automatic content extraction , and machine translation evaluations run by nist communicator was to develop '' dialogue interaction '' technology to enable warfighters to talk to computers , such that information would be accessible on the battlefield or in command centers without a keyboard-based interface live exercises were conducted involving small unit logistics operations with the united states marines to test the technology in extreme environments develop a low-power millimeter wave radar system for wide field of view detection and narrow field of view gait classification characterize gait performance from video for human identification at a distance the research focused primarily on the extraction of body biometric features from video and identifying subjects from those features the university of maryland 's institute for advanced computer studies ' research focused on recognizing people at a distance by gait and face the university of southampton 's department of electronics and computer science was developing an '' automatic gait recognition '' system and was in charge of compiling a database to test it the term '' total information awareness '' was first coined at the 1999 annual darpatech conference in a presentation by the deputy director of the office of information systems management , brian sharkey the report also conceded that a full prototype of tia would not be ready until the 2007 fiscal year at some point in early 2003 , the national security agency began installing access nodes on tia 's classified network critics allege that the program could be abused by government authorities as part of their practice of mass surveillance in the united states in the 2008 british television series the last enemy , tia is portrayed as a uk-based surveillance database that can be used to track and monitor anybody by putting all available government information in one place .

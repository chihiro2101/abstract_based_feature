tia was intended to be a five-year research project by the defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) these components consisted of information analysis , collaboration , decision-support tools , language translation , data-searching , pattern recognition , and privacy-protection technologies tia research included or planned to include the participation of nine government entities : inscom , nsa , dia , cia , cifa , stratcom , socom , jfcom , and jwac companies contracted to work on tia included the science applications international corporation , booz allen hamilton , lockheed martin corporation , schafer corporation , srs technologies , adroit systems , caci dynamic systems , asi systems international , and syntek technologies universities enlisted to assist with research and development included berkeley , colorado state , carnegie mellon , columbia , cornell , dallas , georgiatech , maryland , mit , and southampton tia 's goal was to revolutionize the united states ' ability to detect , classify and identify foreign terrorists and decipher their plans , thereby enabling the u.s it was designed to support both top-down and bottom-up approaches ; a policymaker could hypothesize an attack and use genoa to look for supporting evidence of it or compile pieces of intelligence into a diagram and suggest possible outcomes human analysts could then modify the diagram to test various cases while genoa primarily focused on intelligence analysis , genoa ii aimed to provide means by which computers , software agents , policymakers , and field operatives could collaborate genisys aimed to develop technologies that would enable '' ultra-large , all-source information repositories '' vast amounts of information were to be collected and analyzed , and the available database technology at the time was insufficient for storing and organizing such enormous quantities of data so they developed techniques for virtual data aggregation to support effective analysis across heterogeneous databases , as well as unstructured public data sources , such as the world wide web the web is considered an '' unstructured public data source '' because it is publicly accessible and contains many different types of data—blogs , emails , records of visits to websites , etc.—all of which need to be analyzed and stored efficiently evidence extraction and link discovery ( eeld ) developed technologies and tools for automated discovery , extraction and linking of sparse evidence contained in large amounts of classified and unclassified data sources ( such as phone call records from the nsa call database , internet histories , or bank records ) it was to develop the ability to detect patterns comprising multiple types of links between data items or communications ( e.g translingual information detection , extraction and summarization ( tides ) develops advanced language processing technology to enable english speakers to find and interpret critical information in multiple languages without requiring knowledge of those languages cornell university , columbia university , and the university of california , berkeley were given grants to work on tides communicator was to develop '' dialogue interaction '' technology to enable warfighters to talk to computers , such that information would be accessible on the battlefield or in command centers without a keyboard-based interface the goals of humanid were to : develop algorithms to find and acquire subjects out to 150 meters ( 500 & nbsp ; ft ) in range develop and demonstrate a human identification system that operates out to 150 meters ( 500 & nbsp ; ft ) using visible imagery the research focused primarily on the extraction of body biometric features from video and identifying subjects from those features the university of maryland 's institute for advanced computer studies ' research focused on recognizing people at a distance by gait and face there were also plans for tia to have an application that could '' anonymize '' data , so that information could be linked to an individual only by court order ( especially for medical records gathered by the bio-surveillance project ) also in may , total information awareness was renamed terrorism information awareness in an attempt to stem the flow of criticism on its information-gathering practices on average citizens on september 30 , 2003 , congress officially cut off tia 's funding and the information awareness office ( with the senate voting unanimously against it ) because of its unpopular perception by the general public and the media in an op-ed for the new york times , william safire called it '' the supersnoop 's dream : a total information awareness about every u.s

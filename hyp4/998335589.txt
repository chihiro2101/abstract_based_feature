tia was intended to be a five-year research project by the defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) these components consisted of information analysis , collaboration , decision-support tools , language translation , data-searching , pattern recognition , and privacy-protection technologies tia research included or planned to include the participation of nine government entities : inscom , nsa , dia , cia , cifa , stratcom , socom , jfcom , and jwac they were to be able to access tia 's programs through a series of dedicated nodes inscom was to house tia 's hardware in fort belvoir , virginia universities enlisted to assist with research and development included berkeley , colorado state , carnegie mellon , columbia , cornell , dallas , georgiatech , maryland , mit , and southampton tia 's goal was to revolutionize the united states ' ability to detect , classify and identify foreign terrorists and decipher their plans , thereby enabling the u.s unlike the other program components , genoa predated tia and provided a basis for it genoa 's primary function was intelligence analysis to assist human analysts while genoa primarily focused on intelligence analysis , genoa ii aimed to provide means by which computers , software agents , policymakers , and field operatives could collaborate genisys aimed to develop technologies that would enable '' ultra-large , all-source information repositories '' vast amounts of information were to be collected and analyzed , and the available database technology at the time was insufficient for storing and organizing such enormous quantities of data so they developed techniques for virtual data aggregation to support effective analysis across heterogeneous databases , as well as unstructured public data sources , such as the world wide web scalable social network analysis ( ssna ) aimed to develop techniques based on social network analysis to model the key characteristics of terrorist groups and discriminate them from other societal groups wargaming the asymmetric environment ( wae ) focused on developing automated technology that could identify predictive indicators of terrorist activity or impending attacks by examining individual and group behavior in broad environmental context and the motivation of specific terrorists translingual information detection , extraction and summarization ( tides ) develops advanced language processing technology to enable english speakers to find and interpret critical information in multiple languages without requiring knowledge of those languages ) were invited to participate in the annual information retrieval , topic detection and tracking , automatic content extraction , and machine translation evaluations run by nist live exercises were conducted involving small unit logistics operations with the united states marines to test the technology in extreme environments the university of maryland 's institute for advanced computer studies ' research focused on recognizing people at a distance by gait and face the data included a set of nine static pictures taken from different viewpoints , a video of each subject looking around a room , a video of the subject speaking , and one or more videos of the subject showing facial expressions health and biological information tia collected included drug prescriptions , medical records , fingerprints , gait , face and iris data , and dna there were also plans for tia to have an application that could '' anonymize '' data , so that information could be linked to an individual only by court order ( especially for medical records gathered by the bio-surveillance project ) on 24 january 2003 , the united states senate voted to limit tia by restricting its ability to gather information from emails and the commercial databases of health , financial and travel companies the total information awareness project lives on , mit technology review , 26 april 2006 , retrieved 16 june 2016 most of the original project goals and research findings were preserved , but the privacy protection mechanics were abandoned the information awareness prototype system was reclassified as '' basketball '' and work on it continued by saic , supervised by arda in an op-ed for the new york times , william safire called it '' the supersnoop 's dream : a total information awareness about every u.s

tia was intended to be a five-year research project by the defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) these components consisted of information analysis , collaboration , decision-support tools , language translation , data-searching , pattern recognition , and privacy-protection technologies tia research included or planned to include the participation of nine government entities : inscom , nsa , dia , cia , cifa , stratcom , socom , jfcom , and jwac companies contracted to work on tia included the science applications international corporation , booz allen hamilton , lockheed martin corporation , schafer corporation , srs technologies , adroit systems , caci dynamic systems , asi systems international , and syntek technologies tia 's goal was to revolutionize the united states ' ability to detect , classify and identify foreign terrorists and decipher their plans , thereby enabling the u.s unlike the other program components , genoa predated tia and provided a basis for it it was designed to support both top-down and bottom-up approaches ; a policymaker could hypothesize an attack and use genoa to look for supporting evidence of it or compile pieces of intelligence into a diagram and suggest possible outcomes genisys aimed to develop technologies that would enable '' ultra-large , all-source information repositories '' vast amounts of information were to be collected and analyzed , and the available database technology at the time was insufficient for storing and organizing such enormous quantities of data so they developed techniques for virtual data aggregation to support effective analysis across heterogeneous databases , as well as unstructured public data sources , such as the world wide web the web is considered an '' unstructured public data source '' because it is publicly accessible and contains many different types of data—blogs , emails , records of visits to websites , etc.—all of which need to be analyzed and stored efficiently scalable social network analysis ( ssna ) aimed to develop techniques based on social network analysis to model the key characteristics of terrorist groups and discriminate them from other societal groups it was to develop the ability to detect patterns comprising multiple types of links between data items or communications ( e.g translingual information detection , extraction and summarization ( tides ) develops advanced language processing technology to enable english speakers to find and interpret critical information in multiple languages without requiring knowledge of those languages the dialogue interaction software was to interpret dialogue 's context to improve performance , and to automatically adapt to new topics so conversation could be natural and efficient the human identification at a distance ( humanid ) project developed automated biometric identification technologies to detect , recognize and identify humans at great distances for '' force protection '' , crime prevention , and '' homeland security/defense '' purposes they planned to develop a system that recovered static body and stride parameters of subjects as they walked , while also looking into the ability of time-normalized joint angle trajectories in the walking plane as a way of recognizing gait carnegie mellon university 's robotics institute ( part of the school of computer science ) worked on dynamic face recognition health and biological information tia collected included drug prescriptions , medical records , fingerprints , gait , face and iris data , and dna a former national security adviser to president ronald reagan and a key player in the iran–contra affair , he was working with syntek technologies , a company often contracted out by the government for work on defense projects also in may , total information awareness was renamed terrorism information awareness in an attempt to stem the flow of criticism on its information-gathering practices on average citizens following a scandal in the department of defense involving a proposal to reward investors who predicted terrorist attacks , poindexter resigned from office on 29 august the total information awareness project lives on , mit technology review , 26 april 2006 , retrieved 16 june 2016 most of the original project goals and research findings were preserved , but the privacy protection mechanics were abandoned '' when asked about topsail in a senate intelligence committee hearing that february , both national intelligence director john negroponte and fbi director robert mueller said they did n't know the program 's status as late as september 2004 , basketball was fully funded by the government and being tested in a research center jointly run by arda and saic in the 2008 british television series the last enemy , tia is portrayed as a uk-based surveillance database that can be used to track and monitor anybody by putting all available government information in one place .

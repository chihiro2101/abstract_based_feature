tia was intended to be a five-year research project by the defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) the goal was to integrate components from previous and new government intelligence and surveillance programs , including genoa , genoa ii , genisys , ssna , eeld , wae , tides , communicator , humanid and bio-surveillance , with data mining knowledge gleaned from the private sector to create a resource for the intelligence , counterintelligence , and law enforcement communities these components consisted of information analysis , collaboration , decision-support tools , language translation , data-searching , pattern recognition , and privacy-protection technologies tia research included or planned to include the participation of nine government entities : inscom , nsa , dia , cia , cifa , stratcom , socom , jfcom , and jwac universities enlisted to assist with research and development included berkeley , colorado state , carnegie mellon , columbia , cornell , dallas , georgiatech , maryland , mit , and southampton tia 's goal was to revolutionize the united states ' ability to detect , classify and identify foreign terrorists and decipher their plans , thereby enabling the u.s unlike the other program components , genoa predated tia and provided a basis for it it was designed to support both top-down and bottom-up approaches ; a policymaker could hypothesize an attack and use genoa to look for supporting evidence of it or compile pieces of intelligence into a diagram and suggest possible outcomes vast amounts of information were to be collected and analyzed , and the available database technology at the time was insufficient for storing and organizing such enormous quantities of data so they developed techniques for virtual data aggregation to support effective analysis across heterogeneous databases , as well as unstructured public data sources , such as the world wide web '' effective analysis across heterogenous databases '' means the ability to take things from databases which are designed to store different types of dataâ€”such as a database containing criminal records , a phone call database and a foreign intelligence database another goal was to develop '' a large , distributed system architecture for managing the huge volume of raw data input , analysis results , and feedback , that will result in a simpler , more flexible data store that performs well and allows us to retain important data indefinitely scalable social network analysis ( ssna ) aimed to develop techniques based on social network analysis to model the key characteristics of terrorist groups and discriminate them from other societal groups evidence extraction and link discovery ( eeld ) developed technologies and tools for automated discovery , extraction and linking of sparse evidence contained in large amounts of classified and unclassified data sources ( such as phone call records from the nsa call database , internet histories , or bank records ) wargaming the asymmetric environment ( wae ) focused on developing automated technology that could identify predictive indicators of terrorist activity or impending attacks by examining individual and group behavior in broad environmental context and the motivation of specific terrorists translingual information detection , extraction and summarization ( tides ) develops advanced language processing technology to enable english speakers to find and interpret critical information in multiple languages without requiring knowledge of those languages research was also started on foreign-language computer interaction for use in coalition operations the human identification at a distance ( humanid ) project developed automated biometric identification technologies to detect , recognize and identify humans at great distances for '' force protection '' , crime prevention , and '' homeland security/defense '' purposes gait recognition was a key component of humanid , because it could be employed on low-resolution video feeds and therefore help identify subjects at a distance they planned to develop a system that recovered static body and stride parameters of subjects as they walked , while also looking into the ability of time-normalized joint angle trajectories in the walking plane as a way of recognizing gait to conduct its studies , the university created databases of synchronized multi-camera video sequences of body motion , human faces under a wide range of imaging conditions , au coded expression videos , and hyperspectal and polarimetric images of faces the bio-surveillance project was designed to predict and respond to bioterrorism by monitoring non-traditional data sources such as animal sentinels , behavioral indicators , and pre-diagnostic medical data late that year , the information awareness office awarded the science applications international corporation ( saic ) a 19 million contract to develop the '' information awareness prototype system '' , the core architecture to integrate all of tia 's information extraction , analysis , and dissemination tools the total information awareness project lives on , mit technology review , 26 april 2006 , retrieved 16 june 2016 most of the original project goals and research findings were preserved , but the privacy protection mechanics were abandoned in an op-ed for the new york times , william safire called it '' the supersnoop 's dream : a total information awareness about every u.s in the 2008 british television series the last enemy , tia is portrayed as a uk-based surveillance database that can be used to track and monitor anybody by putting all available government information in one place .

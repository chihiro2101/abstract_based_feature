the story of galahad and his quest for the holy grail is a relatively late addition to the arthurian legend he first appears in a 13th-century old french arthurian epic , the interconnected set of romances known as the vulgate cycle the original conception of galahad , whose adult exploits are first recounted in the fourth book of the vulgate cycle , may had come from the mystical cistercian order according to some interpreters , the philosophical inspiration of the celibate , otherworldly character of the monastic knight galahad came from this monastic order set up by st the circumstances surrounding galahad 's conception derive from the earlier parts of grail prose cycles it takes place when king arthur 's greatest knight , lancelot , mistakes elaine of corbenic for his secret mistress , queen guinevere on discovering the deception , lancelot draws his sword on elaine , but when he finds out that they have conceived a son together , he is immediately forgiving ; however , he does not marry elaine or even wish to be with her any more and returns to arthur 's court according to the 13th-century old french prose lancelot ( part of the vulgate cycle ) , '' galahad '' ( galaad ) was lancelot 's original name , but it was changed when he was a child merlin prophesies that galahad will surpass his father in valor and be successful in his search for the holy grail upon reaching adulthood , galahad is reunited with his father lancelot , who knights his son after being defeated by him '' ( the embedding of a sword in a stone is also an element of the legends of arthur 's original sword , excalibur ) galahad accomplishes this test with ease , and arthur swiftly proclaims him to be the greatest knight ever the tale of the sankgreal , briefly drawn out of french , which is a tale chronicled for one of the truest and one of the holiest that is in this world it is galahad who takes the initiative to begin the search for the grail ; the rest of the knights follow him further uniquely among the round table , galahad is capable of doing miracles such as banishing demons and healing the sick for the most part he travels alone during the grail quest , smiting ( and often sparing ) his enemies , rescuing fellow knights including percival and saving maidens in distress , until he is finally reunited with bors and percival so it is , while making his way back to arthur 's court , galahad is visited by joseph of arimathea , and thus experiences such glorious rapture that he makes his request to die galahad 's success in the high religious endeavour that was the search for the holy grail was predicted before his birth , not only by pelles but also by merlin , who once had told uther pendragon that there was one who would fill the place at the '' table of joseph '' , but that he was not yet born the holy grail : the galahad quest in the arthurian literature despite this , galahad is the knight who is chosen to find the holy grail galahad , in both the lancelot-grail cycle and in malory 's retelling , is exalted above all the other knights : he is the one worthy enough to have the holy grail revealed to him and to be taken into heaven in thomas malory 's le morte d'arthur , galahad 's incredible prowess and fortune in the quest for the holy grail are traced back to his piety while in a specific sense , this '' purity '' refers to chastity , galahad appears to have lived a generally sinless life and so as a result , he lives and thinks on a level entirely apart from the other knights around him in the next verse of this poem , tennyson continues to glorify galahad for remaining pure at heart , by putting these words into his mouth : i never felt the kiss of love , / nor maiden 's hand in mine '' tennyson 's poem follows galahad 's journey to find the holy grail but ends while he is still riding , still seeking , still dreaming ; as if to say that the quest for the holy grail is an ongoing task unlike many other portrayals of the legend of sir galahad , tennyson has sir galahad speak in the first person , gives the reader his thoughts and feelings as he rides on his quest , rather than just the details of his battles , as in malory unlike malory and tennyson 's pure hero , morris creates a galahad who is emotionally complex , conflicted , and palpably human the poem opens on midwinter 's night ; sir galahad has been sitting for six hours in a chapel , staring at the floor sir galahad , a christmas mystery of the three knights who are untainted by sin – sir perceval , sir bors , and sir galahad – galahad is the only one predestined to achieve this honour of attaining the holy grail edmund wilson 's story '' galahad '' , published in 1927 , presents a humorous story about the attempted seduction of a virginal high school student by a debutante in john erskine 's novel galahad : enough of his life to explain his reputation , galahad 's main tutor for his knightly training is queen guinevere just as in le morte d'arthur , galahad grows up in the court of his mother elaine and travels to king arthur 's court to be reunited with his father and to become a knight when galahad arrives at the court , guinevere is upset with lancelot because he does not want to be her lover any more and she takes an interest in the young knight , persuading him to go above and beyond regular knightly duties in most versions of the story of sir galahad , galahad 's death comes about after his greatest achievement , that of the holy grail the board game shadows over camelot features sir galahad as one of the characters that the players can select a comical approach to the legend of sir galahad , his quest for the holy grail , and his pure character is made to seem foolish '' thomas berger 's arthur rex : galahad and earthly power '' the holy grail : the galahad quest in the arthurian literature

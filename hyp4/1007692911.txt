the story of galahad and his quest for the holy grail is a relatively late addition to the arthurian legend galahad does not feature in any romance by chrétien de troyes , or in robert de boron 's grail stories , or in any of the continuations of chrétien 's story of the mysterious castle of the fisher king he first appears in a 13th-century old french arthurian epic , the interconnected set of romances known as the vulgate cycle the original conception of galahad , whose adult exploits are first recounted in the fourth book of the vulgate cycle , may had come from the mystical cistercian order significantly , in the narratives , galahad is associated with a white shield with a vermilion cross , the very same emblem given to the knights templar by pope eugene iii the circumstances surrounding galahad 's conception derive from the earlier parts of grail prose cycles it takes place when king arthur 's greatest knight , lancelot , mistakes elaine of corbenic for his secret mistress , queen guinevere in the french tale used by thomas malory , king pelles has already received magical foreknowledge that lancelot will give his daughter a child and that this little boy will grow to become the greatest knight in the world , the knight chosen by god to discover the holy grail on discovering the deception , lancelot draws his sword on elaine , but when he finds out that they have conceived a son together , he is immediately forgiving ; however , he does not marry elaine or even wish to be with her any more and returns to arthur 's court according to the 13th-century old french prose lancelot ( part of the vulgate cycle ) , '' galahad '' ( galaad ) was lancelot 's original name , but it was changed when he was a child merlin prophesies that galahad will surpass his father in valor and be successful in his search for the holy grail pelles , galahad 's maternal grandfather , is portrayed as a descendant of joseph of arimathea 's brother-in-law bron also known as galahad ( galaad ) , whose line had been entrusted with the grail by joseph '' ( the embedding of a sword in a stone is also an element of the legends of arthur 's original sword , excalibur ) galahad accomplishes this test with ease , and arthur swiftly proclaims him to be the greatest knight ever the tale of the sankgreal , briefly drawn out of french , which is a tale chronicled for one of the truest and one of the holiest that is in this world arthur is sorrowful that all the knights have embarked thus , for he discerns that many will never be seen again , dying in their quest this might be seen as a theological statement that concludes that earthly endeavours must take second place to the pursuit of the holy further uniquely among the round table , galahad is capable of doing miracles such as banishing demons and healing the sick for the most part he travels alone during the grail quest , smiting ( and often sparing ) his enemies , rescuing fellow knights including percival and saving maidens in distress , until he is finally reunited with bors and percival after many adventures , galahad and percival find themselves in the mystical castle of corbenic at the court of pelles and eliazar , his son galahad 's conception is later glossed by malory in le morte d'arthur : '' and so by enchantment elaine won the love of lancelot , and certainly she loved him again passing well the holy grail : the galahad quest in the arthurian literature galahad , in both the lancelot-grail cycle and in malory 's retelling , is exalted above all the other knights : he is the one worthy enough to have the holy grail revealed to him and to be taken into heaven this quality is reflected in alfred , lord tennyson 's poem '' sir galahad '' : my good blade carves the casques of men , / my tough lance thrusteth sure , / my strength is as the strength of ten , / because my heart is pure sir galahad , published 1834 in the next verse of this poem , tennyson continues to glorify galahad for remaining pure at heart , by putting these words into his mouth : i never felt the kiss of love , / nor maiden 's hand in mine galahad pursues a single-minded and lonely course , sacrificing much in his determination to aspire to a higher ideal : then move the trees , the copses nod , / wings flutter , voices hover clear / '' o just and faithful knight of god ! / ride on ! the prize is near unlike many other portrayals of the legend of sir galahad , tennyson has sir galahad speak in the first person , gives the reader his thoughts and feelings as he rides on his quest , rather than just the details of his battles , as in malory sir galahad 's thoughts and aspirations have been explored as well by william morris in his poems the chapel in lyoness , published in 1856 , and sir galahad , a christmas mystery , sir galahad , a christmas mystery camelot project published in 1858 morris ’ poems place this emotional conflict at centre stage , rather than concentrating upon galahad 's prowess for defeating external enemies , and the cold and the frost of a christmas period serve to reinforce his '' chilly isolation '' the poem opens on midwinter 's night ; sir galahad has been sitting for six hours in a chapel , staring at the floor sir galahad , a christmas mystery sir bors sees a vision of the holy grail whilst in a chapel with the baby and his mother camelot project this is similar to god declaring that king david had shed much blood and was not worthy of building the jerusalem temple , this honour falling only to his son king solomon merlin brings lancelot back with him , and after the sorrows that subsequently befall camelot , the lady of the lake reveals that merlin was meant to pick galahad , and that his mistake proves how human he truly is john larroquette played an elderly yet immortal galahad ( now known as jenkins ) in the tv series the librarians a comical approach to the legend of sir galahad , his quest for the holy grail , and his pure character is made to seem foolish the holy grail : the galahad quest in the arthurian literature this text gives a detailed discourse covering galahad 's life story from his birth to his death , with specific emphasis on his contribution to the quest for the holy grail

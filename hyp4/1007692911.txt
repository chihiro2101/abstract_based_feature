the story of galahad and his quest for the holy grail is a relatively late addition to the arthurian legend galahad does not feature in any romance by chrétien de troyes , or in robert de boron 's grail stories , or in any of the continuations of chrétien 's story of the mysterious castle of the fisher king he first appears in a 13th-century old french arthurian epic , the interconnected set of romances known as the vulgate cycle his name could have been derived from the welsh name gwalchaved , meaning '' falcon of summer '' the original conception of galahad , whose adult exploits are first recounted in the fourth book of the vulgate cycle , may had come from the mystical cistercian order according to some interpreters , the philosophical inspiration of the celibate , otherworldly character of the monastic knight galahad came from this monastic order set up by st the cistercian-bernardine concept of catholic warrior asceticism that so distinguishes the character of galahad also informs st the circumstances surrounding galahad 's conception derive from the earlier parts of grail prose cycles it takes place when king arthur 's greatest knight , lancelot , mistakes elaine of corbenic for his secret mistress , queen guinevere according to the 13th-century old french prose lancelot ( part of the vulgate cycle ) , '' galahad '' ( galaad ) was lancelot 's original name , but it was changed when he was a child at his birth , therefore , galahad is given his father 's own original name pelles , galahad 's maternal grandfather , is portrayed as a descendant of joseph of arimathea 's brother-in-law bron also known as galahad ( galaad ) , whose line had been entrusted with the grail by joseph upon reaching adulthood , galahad is reunited with his father lancelot , who knights his son after being defeated by him galahad is promptly invited to become a knight of the round table , and soon afterwards , arthur 's court witnesses an ethereal vision of the grail it is galahad who takes the initiative to begin the search for the grail ; the rest of the knights follow him galahad , in some ways , mirrors arthur , drawing a sword from a stone in the way that arthur did further uniquely among the round table , galahad is capable of doing miracles such as banishing demons and healing the sick these men bring galahad into a room where he is finally allowed to see the holy grail after seeing the grail , galahad , however , makes the request that he may die at the time of his choosing galahad 's success in the high religious endeavour that was the search for the holy grail was predicted before his birth , not only by pelles but also by merlin , who once had told uther pendragon that there was one who would fill the place at the '' table of joseph '' , but that he was not yet born galahad 's conception is later glossed by malory in le morte d'arthur : '' and so by enchantment elaine won the love of lancelot , and certainly she loved him again passing well '' galahad was conceived for the divine purpose of seeking the holy grail , waite , arthur despite this , galahad is the knight who is chosen to find the holy grail galahad , in both the lancelot-grail cycle and in malory 's retelling , is exalted above all the other knights : he is the one worthy enough to have the holy grail revealed to him and to be taken into heaven while in a specific sense , this '' purity '' refers to chastity , galahad appears to have lived a generally sinless life and so as a result , he lives and thinks on a level entirely apart from the other knights around him this quality is reflected in alfred , lord tennyson 's poem '' sir galahad '' : my good blade carves the casques of men , / my tough lance thrusteth sure , / my strength is as the strength of ten , / because my heart is pure sir galahad , published 1834 unlike many other portrayals of the legend of sir galahad , tennyson has sir galahad speak in the first person , gives the reader his thoughts and feelings as he rides on his quest , rather than just the details of his battles , as in malory sir galahad 's thoughts and aspirations have been explored as well by william morris in his poems the chapel in lyoness , published in 1856 , and sir galahad , a christmas mystery , sir galahad , a christmas mystery camelot project published in 1858 unlike malory and tennyson 's pure hero , morris creates a galahad who is emotionally complex , conflicted , and palpably human a poem by thomas de beverly published in 1925 , '' the birth of sir galahad '' , tells of the events leading up to the conception of sir galahad , his birth and a visit soon afterwards by sir bors , to see elaine and the baby galahad of the three knights who are untainted by sin – sir perceval , sir bors , and sir galahad – galahad is the only one predestined to achieve this honour of attaining the holy grail warner , biblical motives in twentieth century literature '' in barbara kid ( ed at first galahad seems content with just being an ordinary knight of the round table , going out on quests and saving maidens in distress cohen pokes fun at galahad 's '' calling '' by saying that his life would be wasted if he failed to remain pure and holy in order to be the bearer of the holy grail joan baez uses the legend metaphorically in her song '' sweet sir galahad '' , which is about the courtship of her sister a comical approach to the legend of sir galahad , his quest for the holy grail , and his pure character is made to seem foolish galahad and the grail the holy grail : the galahad quest in the arthurian literature

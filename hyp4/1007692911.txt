the story of galahad and his quest for the holy grail is a relatively late addition to the arthurian legend galahad does not feature in any romance by chrétien de troyes , or in robert de boron 's grail stories , or in any of the continuations of chrétien 's story of the mysterious castle of the fisher king he first appears in a 13th-century old french arthurian epic , the interconnected set of romances known as the vulgate cycle his name could have been derived from the welsh name gwalchaved , meaning '' falcon of summer '' the original conception of galahad , whose adult exploits are first recounted in the fourth book of the vulgate cycle , may had come from the mystical cistercian order according to some interpreters , the philosophical inspiration of the celibate , otherworldly character of the monastic knight galahad came from this monastic order set up by st bernard 's projection of ideal chivalry in his work on the knights templar , the liber ad milites templi de laude novae militiae it takes place when king arthur 's greatest knight , lancelot , mistakes elaine of corbenic for his secret mistress , queen guinevere according to the 13th-century old french prose lancelot ( part of the vulgate cycle ) , '' galahad '' ( galaad ) was lancelot 's original name , but it was changed when he was a child at his birth , therefore , galahad is given his father 's own original name pelles , galahad 's maternal grandfather , is portrayed as a descendant of joseph of arimathea 's brother-in-law bron also known as galahad ( galaad ) , whose line had been entrusted with the grail by joseph galahad is promptly invited to become a knight of the round table , and soon afterwards , arthur 's court witnesses an ethereal vision of the grail all of the knights of the round table set out to find the grail it is galahad who takes the initiative to begin the search for the grail ; the rest of the knights follow him this might be seen as a theological statement that concludes that earthly endeavours must take second place to the pursuit of the holy further uniquely among the round table , galahad is capable of doing miracles such as banishing demons and healing the sick for the most part he travels alone during the grail quest , smiting ( and often sparing ) his enemies , rescuing fellow knights including percival and saving maidens in distress , until he is finally reunited with bors and percival these three knights then come across percival 's sister , who leads them to the mystical ship of solomon which they use to cross the sea to an island where galahad finds king david 's sword after seeing the grail , galahad , however , makes the request that he may die at the time of his choosing galahad bids percival and bors farewell , after which angels appear to take him to heaven at first this knight was believed to be percival ; however it is later discovered to be galahad the holy grail : the galahad quest in the arthurian literature galahad , in both the lancelot-grail cycle and in malory 's retelling , is exalted above all the other knights : he is the one worthy enough to have the holy grail revealed to him and to be taken into heaven unlike many other portrayals of the legend of sir galahad , tennyson has sir galahad speak in the first person , gives the reader his thoughts and feelings as he rides on his quest , rather than just the details of his battles , as in malory a poem by thomas de beverly published in 1925 , '' the birth of sir galahad '' , tells of the events leading up to the conception of sir galahad , his birth and a visit soon afterwards by sir bors , to see elaine and the baby galahad sir bors sees a vision of the holy grail whilst in a chapel with the baby and his mother of the three knights who are untainted by sin – sir perceval , sir bors , and sir galahad – galahad is the only one predestined to achieve this honour of attaining the holy grail camelot project this is similar to god declaring that king david had shed much blood and was not worthy of building the jerusalem temple , this honour falling only to his son king solomon just as in le morte d'arthur , galahad grows up in the court of his mother elaine and travels to king arthur 's court to be reunited with his father and to become a knight when galahad arrives at the court , guinevere is upset with lancelot because he does not want to be her lover any more and she takes an interest in the young knight , persuading him to go above and beyond regular knightly duties at first galahad seems content with just being an ordinary knight of the round table , going out on quests and saving maidens in distress matt cohen satirises galahad 's virtuous character in his short story '' too bad galahad '' cohen describes galahad as the perfect knight who does no harm however , cohen , instead of glorifying galahad 's virtuous character , makes it into a weakness just like the grail , perfection is unattainable ; only glimpses of the grail and of perfection can be seen the villain pavel syerov calls andrei in derision '' sir galahad of the blackmail sword '' ; ayn rand , we the living , part two , ch in the 2015 video game the order : 1886 , the main character is an heir to the title of sir galahad , and is therefore referred to as such a comical approach to the legend of sir galahad , his quest for the holy grail , and his pure character is made to seem foolish the holy grail : the galahad quest in the arthurian literature

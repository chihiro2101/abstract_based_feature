born to a bookseller in naples , italy , giovan battista vico attended several schools , but ill health and dissatisfaction with the scholasticism of the jesuits led to his being educated at home by tutors evidence from his autobiographical work indicates that vico likely was an autodidact educated under paternal influence , during a three-year absence from school , consequence of an accidental fall when the boy was seven years old four years later , in 1699 , vico married teresa caterina destito , a childhood friend , and accepted a chair in rhetoric at the university of naples , which he held until ill-health retirement , in 1741 throughout his academic career , vico would aspire to , but never attain , the more respectable chair of jurisprudence ; however , in 1734 , he was appointed historiographer royal , by charles iii , king of naples , at a salary greater than he had earned as a university professor the rhetoric and humanism of vico vico 's version of rhetoric is product of his humanism and pedagogic concerns as royal professor of latin eloquence , vico prepared students for higher studies in the fields of law and of jurisprudence ; thus , his lessons were about the formal aspects of the canon of rhetoric , including the arrangement and the delivery of an argument vico 's objection to modern rhetoric is that it is disconnected from common sense ( sensus communis ) , defined as the '' worldly sense '' that is common to all men in lectures and throughout the body of his work , vico 's rhetoric begins from a central argument ( medius terminus ) , which is to be clarified by following the order of things as they arise in our experience in the tradition of classical roman rhetoric , vico sets out to educate the orator ( rhetorician ) as the transmitter of the oratio , a speech with ratio ( reason ) at the centre widely disseminated by the port royal logic of antoine arnauld and pierre nicole , descartes 's method was rooted in verification : the only path to truth , and thus knowledge , was through axioms derived from observation one of the clearest and earliest forms of this argument is available in the de italorum sapientia , where vico argues that vico 's position here and in later works is not that the cartesian method is irrelevant , but that its application can not be extended to the civic sphere vico is best known for his verum factum principle , first formulated in 1710 as part of his de antiquissima italorum sapientia , ex linguae latinae originibus eruenda ( 1710 ) ( '' on the most ancient wisdom of the italians , unearthed from the origins of the latin language '' ) '' this criterion for truth would later shape the history of civilization in vico 's opus , the scienza nuova ( the new science , 1725 ) , because he would argue that civil life—like mathematics—is wholly constructed in it , beckett sees a profound influence of vico 's philosophy and poetics—as well the cyclical form of the scienza nuova—on the avant-garde compositions of joyce , and especially the titular work in progress , viz despite having been relatively unknown in his 17th-century time , and read only in his native naples , the ideas of vico are predecessors to the ideas of the intellectuals of the enlightenment moreover , recognition of vico 's intellectual influence began in the 19th century , when the french romantic historians used his works as methodological models and guides in das kapital ( 1867 ) , karl marx 's mention of vico indicates their parallel perspectives about history , the role of historical actors , and an historical method of narrative marx and vico saw class conflict as the means by which men achieve the end of equal rights ; vico called that time the '' age of men '' marx concluded that such a state of affairs is the optimal end of social change in a society , but vico thought that such complete equality of rights would lead to socio-political chaos and the consequent collapse of society '' as a humanist and early philologist , vico represented '' a different , alternative model that has been extremely important to me in my work '' , which differed from mainstream western prejudice against the orient and the dominating '' standardization '' that came with modernity and culminated in national socialism that the interdependence of human history and culture facilitates the scholars ' task to '' take seriously vico 's great observation that men make their own history , that what they can know is what they have made , and extend it to geography new vico studies ( institute for vico studies at emory university ) recapitulation theory finnegans wake vico and humanism : essays on vico , heidegger , and rhetoric institute for vico studies entry in the internet encyclopedia of philosophy entry in the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy entry in the johns hopkins guide to literary theory verene , donald phillip

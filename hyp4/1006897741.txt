born to a bookseller in naples , italy , giovan battista vico attended several schools , but ill health and dissatisfaction with the scholasticism of the jesuits led to his being educated at home by tutors evidence from his autobiographical work indicates that vico likely was an autodidact educated under paternal influence , during a three-year absence from school , consequence of an accidental fall when the boy was seven years old four years later , in 1699 , vico married teresa caterina destito , a childhood friend , and accepted a chair in rhetoric at the university of naples , which he held until ill-health retirement , in 1741 the rhetoric and humanism of vico vico 's version of rhetoric is product of his humanism and pedagogic concerns as royal professor of latin eloquence , vico prepared students for higher studies in the fields of law and of jurisprudence ; thus , his lessons were about the formal aspects of the canon of rhetoric , including the arrangement and the delivery of an argument vico 's objection to modern rhetoric is that it is disconnected from common sense ( sensus communis ) , defined as the '' worldly sense '' that is common to all men in lectures and throughout the body of his work , vico 's rhetoric begins from a central argument ( medius terminus ) , which is to be clarified by following the order of things as they arise in our experience in the tradition of socrates and cicero , vico 's true orator will be midwife to the birth of '' the true '' ( as an idea ) from '' the certain '' , the ignorance in the mind of the student rediscovery of '' the most ancient wisdom '' of the senses , a wisdom that is humana stultitia ( '' human foolishness '' ) , vico 's emphases on the importance of civic life and of professional obligations are in the humanist tradition he would call for a maieutic ( jurisprudential ) oratory art against the grain of the modern privilege of the dogmatic form of reason , in what he called the '' geometrical method '' of rené descartes and the logicians at the port-royal-des-champs abbey vico 's humanism and professional concerns prompted an obvious response that he would develop throughout the course of his writings : the realms of verifiable truth and human concern share only a slight overlap , yet reasoning is required in equal measure in both spheres one of the clearest and earliest forms of this argument is available in the de italorum sapientia , where vico argues that vico 's position here and in later works is not that the cartesian method is irrelevant , but that its application can not be extended to the civic sphere vico would reproduce this argument consistently throughout his works , and would use it as a central tenet of the scienza nuova vico is best known for his verum factum principle , first formulated in 1710 as part of his de antiquissima italorum sapientia , ex linguae latinae originibus eruenda ( 1710 ) ( '' on the most ancient wisdom of the italians , unearthed from the origins of the latin language '' ) '' this criterion for truth would later shape the history of civilization in vico 's opus , the scienza nuova ( the new science , 1725 ) , because he would argue that civil life—like mathematics—is wholly constructed in it , beckett sees a profound influence of vico 's philosophy and poetics—as well the cyclical form of the scienza nuova—on the avant-garde compositions of joyce , and especially the titular work in progress , viz despite having been relatively unknown in his 17th-century time , and read only in his native naples , the ideas of vico are predecessors to the ideas of the intellectuals of the enlightenment in das kapital ( 1867 ) , karl marx 's mention of vico indicates their parallel perspectives about history , the role of historical actors , and an historical method of narrative in orientalism ( 1978 ) , edward said acknowledged his scholar 's debt to vico , whose '' ideas anticipate and later infiltrate the line of german thinkers i am about to cite that the interdependence of human history and culture facilitates the scholars ' task to '' take seriously vico 's great observation that men make their own history , that what they can know is what they have made , and extend it to geography the philosophy of giambattista vico giambattista vico and the quarrel between the ancients and the moderns lecture de la science nouvelle de giambattista vico , l'esprit de la cité , gallimard , 2015 institute for vico studies entry in the internet encyclopedia of philosophy entry in the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy entry in the johns hopkins guide to literary theory verene , donald phillip

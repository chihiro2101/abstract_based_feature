born to a bookseller in naples , italy , giovan battista vico attended several schools , but ill health and dissatisfaction with the scholasticism of the jesuits led to his being educated at home by tutors evidence from his autobiographical work indicates that vico likely was an autodidact educated under paternal influence , during a three-year absence from school , consequence of an accidental fall when the boy was seven years old four years later , in 1699 , vico married teresa caterina destito , a childhood friend , and accepted a chair in rhetoric at the university of naples , which he held until ill-health retirement , in 1741 the rhetoric and humanism of vico vico 's objection to modern rhetoric is that it is disconnected from common sense ( sensus communis ) , defined as the '' worldly sense '' that is common to all men in lectures and throughout the body of his work , vico 's rhetoric begins from a central argument ( medius terminus ) , which is to be clarified by following the order of things as they arise in our experience in the tradition of socrates and cicero , vico 's true orator will be midwife to the birth of '' the true '' ( as an idea ) from '' the certain '' , the ignorance in the mind of the student rediscovery of '' the most ancient wisdom '' of the senses , a wisdom that is humana stultitia ( '' human foolishness '' ) , vico 's emphases on the importance of civic life and of professional obligations are in the humanist tradition one of the clearest and earliest forms of this argument is available in the de italorum sapientia , where vico argues that vico 's position here and in later works is not that the cartesian method is irrelevant , but that its application can not be extended to the civic sphere vico would reproduce this argument consistently throughout his works , and would use it as a central tenet of the scienza nuova vico is best known for his verum factum principle , first formulated in 1710 as part of his de antiquissima italorum sapientia , ex linguae latinae originibus eruenda ( 1710 ) ( '' on the most ancient wisdom of the italians , unearthed from the origins of the latin language '' ) the new science ( 1725 , scienza nuova ) is his major work and has been highly influential in the philosophy of history , and for historicists such as isaiah berlin and hayden white samuel beckett 's first published work , in the selection of critical essays on james joyce entitled our exagmination round his factification for incamination of work in progress , is '' dante in it , beckett sees a profound influence of vico 's philosophy and poetics—as well the cyclical form of the scienza nuova—on the avant-garde compositions of joyce , and especially the titular work in progress , viz despite having been relatively unknown in his 17th-century time , and read only in his native naples , the ideas of vico are predecessors to the ideas of the intellectuals of the enlightenment moreover , recognition of vico 's intellectual influence began in the 19th century , when the french romantic historians used his works as methodological models and guides in das kapital ( 1867 ) , karl marx 's mention of vico indicates their parallel perspectives about history , the role of historical actors , and an historical method of narrative marx and vico saw class conflict as the means by which men achieve the end of equal rights ; vico called that time the '' age of men '' in that vein , vico proposed a social need for religion , for a supernatural divine providence to keep order in human society in orientalism ( 1978 ) , edward said acknowledged his scholar 's debt to vico , whose '' ideas anticipate and later infiltrate the line of german thinkers i am about to cite the new science of giambattista vico , ( 1744 ) vita di giambattista vico ( the autobiography of giambattista vico ) vico and humanism : essays on vico , heidegger , and rhetoric vico 's science of imagination institute for vico studies entry in the internet encyclopedia of philosophy entry in the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy entry in the johns hopkins guide to literary theory verene , donald phillip

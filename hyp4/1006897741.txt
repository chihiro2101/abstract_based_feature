born to a bookseller in naples , italy , giovan battista vico attended several schools , but ill health and dissatisfaction with the scholasticism of the jesuits led to his being educated at home by tutors evidence from his autobiographical work indicates that vico likely was an autodidact educated under paternal influence , during a three-year absence from school , consequence of an accidental fall when the boy was seven years old four years later , in 1699 , vico married teresa caterina destito , a childhood friend , and accepted a chair in rhetoric at the university of naples , which he held until ill-health retirement , in 1741 the rhetoric and humanism of vico yet he chose to emphasize the aristotelian connection of rhetoric with logic and dialectic , thereby placing ends ( rhetoric ) at their center vico 's objection to modern rhetoric is that it is disconnected from common sense ( sensus communis ) , defined as the '' worldly sense '' that is common to all men in lectures and throughout the body of his work , vico 's rhetoric begins from a central argument ( medius terminus ) , which is to be clarified by following the order of things as they arise in our experience in the tradition of classical roman rhetoric , vico sets out to educate the orator ( rhetorician ) as the transmitter of the oratio , a speech with ratio ( reason ) at the centre in the tradition of socrates and cicero , vico 's true orator will be midwife to the birth of '' the true '' ( as an idea ) from '' the certain '' , the ignorance in the mind of the student as he relates in his autobiography , vico returned to naples from vatolla to find '' the physics of descartes at the height of its renown among the established men of letters one of the clearest and earliest forms of this argument is available in the de italorum sapientia , where vico argues that vico 's position here and in later works is not that the cartesian method is irrelevant , but that its application can not be extended to the civic sphere '' this criterion for truth would later shape the history of civilization in vico 's opus , the scienza nuova ( the new science , 1725 ) , because he would argue that civil life—like mathematics—is wholly constructed the new science ( 1725 , scienza nuova ) is his major work and has been highly influential in the philosophy of history , and for historicists such as isaiah berlin and hayden white in it , beckett sees a profound influence of vico 's philosophy and poetics—as well the cyclical form of the scienza nuova—on the avant-garde compositions of joyce , and especially the titular work in progress , viz despite having been relatively unknown in his 17th-century time , and read only in his native naples , the ideas of vico are predecessors to the ideas of the intellectuals of the enlightenment in das kapital ( 1867 ) , karl marx 's mention of vico indicates their parallel perspectives about history , the role of historical actors , and an historical method of narrative marx and vico saw class conflict as the means by which men achieve the end of equal rights ; vico called that time the '' age of men '' marx concluded that such a state of affairs is the optimal end of social change in a society , but vico thought that such complete equality of rights would lead to socio-political chaos and the consequent collapse of society '' as a humanist and early philologist , vico represented '' a different , alternative model that has been extremely important to me in my work '' , which differed from mainstream western prejudice against the orient and the dominating '' standardization '' that came with modernity and culminated in national socialism that the interdependence of human history and culture facilitates the scholars ' task to '' take seriously vico 's great observation that men make their own history , that what they can know is what they have made , and extend it to geography the new science of giambattista vico , ( 1744 ) '' the philosophy of the imagination in vico and malebranche '' vita di giambattista vico ( the autobiography of giambattista vico ) vico and humanism : essays on vico , heidegger , and rhetoric institute for vico studies entry in the internet encyclopedia of philosophy entry in the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy entry in the johns hopkins guide to literary theory verene , donald phillip

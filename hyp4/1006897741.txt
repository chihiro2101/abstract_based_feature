born to a bookseller in naples , italy , giovan battista vico attended several schools , but ill health and dissatisfaction with the scholasticism of the jesuits led to his being educated at home by tutors evidence from his autobiographical work indicates that vico likely was an autodidact educated under paternal influence , during a three-year absence from school , consequence of an accidental fall when the boy was seven years old in 1686 , after surviving a bout of typhus , he accepted a job as a tutor , in vatolla , south of salerno , which became a nine-year professional engagement that lasted till 1695 four years later , in 1699 , vico married teresa caterina destito , a childhood friend , and accepted a chair in rhetoric at the university of naples , which he held until ill-health retirement , in 1741 the rhetoric and humanism of vico as royal professor of latin eloquence , vico prepared students for higher studies in the fields of law and of jurisprudence ; thus , his lessons were about the formal aspects of the canon of rhetoric , including the arrangement and the delivery of an argument vico 's objection to modern rhetoric is that it is disconnected from common sense ( sensus communis ) , defined as the '' worldly sense '' that is common to all men in lectures and throughout the body of his work , vico 's rhetoric begins from a central argument ( medius terminus ) , which is to be clarified by following the order of things as they arise in our experience in the tradition of classical roman rhetoric , vico sets out to educate the orator ( rhetorician ) as the transmitter of the oratio , a speech with ratio ( reason ) at the centre in the tradition of socrates and cicero , vico 's true orator will be midwife to the birth of '' the true '' ( as an idea ) from '' the certain '' , the ignorance in the mind of the student as he relates in his autobiography , vico returned to naples from vatolla to find '' the physics of descartes at the height of its renown among the established men of letters widely disseminated by the port royal logic of antoine arnauld and pierre nicole , descartes 's method was rooted in verification : the only path to truth , and thus knowledge , was through axioms derived from observation vico 's humanism and professional concerns prompted an obvious response that he would develop throughout the course of his writings : the realms of verifiable truth and human concern share only a slight overlap , yet reasoning is required in equal measure in both spheres one of the clearest and earliest forms of this argument is available in the de italorum sapientia , where vico argues that vico 's position here and in later works is not that the cartesian method is irrelevant , but that its application can not be extended to the civic sphere '' this criterion for truth would later shape the history of civilization in vico 's opus , the scienza nuova ( the new science , 1725 ) , because he would argue that civil life—like mathematics—is wholly constructed the new science ( 1725 , scienza nuova ) is his major work and has been highly influential in the philosophy of history , and for historicists such as isaiah berlin and hayden white in it , beckett sees a profound influence of vico 's philosophy and poetics—as well the cyclical form of the scienza nuova—on the avant-garde compositions of joyce , and especially the titular work in progress , viz despite having been relatively unknown in his 17th-century time , and read only in his native naples , the ideas of vico are predecessors to the ideas of the intellectuals of the enlightenment in das kapital ( 1867 ) , karl marx 's mention of vico indicates their parallel perspectives about history , the role of historical actors , and an historical method of narrative in orientalism ( 1978 ) , edward said acknowledged his scholar 's debt to vico , whose '' ideas anticipate and later infiltrate the line of german thinkers i am about to cite '' as a humanist and early philologist , vico represented '' a different , alternative model that has been extremely important to me in my work '' , which differed from mainstream western prejudice against the orient and the dominating '' standardization '' that came with modernity and culminated in national socialism the philosophy of giambattista vico vita di giambattista vico ( the autobiography of giambattista vico ) “ democracy and the vernacular imagination in vico ’ s plebian philology , ” history of humanities 3.2 ( 2018 ) : 247–277 institute for vico studies entry in the internet encyclopedia of philosophy entry in the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy entry in the johns hopkins guide to literary theory verene , donald phillip

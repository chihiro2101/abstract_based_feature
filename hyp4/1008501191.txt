russian america was settled by promyshlenniki , merchants and fur trappers who expanded through siberia they arrived in alaska in 1732 , and in 1799 the russian-american company ( rac ) received a charter to hunt for fur no colony was established , but the russian orthodox church sent missionaries to the natives and built churches in 1821 , tsar alexander i issued an edict declaring russia 's sovereignty over the north american pacific coast north of the 51st parallel north us secretary of state john quincy adams strongly protested the edict , which potentially threatened both the commerce and expansionary ambitions of the united states in the treaty , russia limited its claims to lands north of parallel 54°40′ north , and also agreed to open russian ports to u.s by the 1850s a population of once 300,000 sea otters was almost extinct , and russia needed money after being defeated by france and britain in the crimean war the russian government discussed the proposal in 1857 and 1858 , and offered to sell the territory to the united states , hoping that its presence in the region would offset the plans of britain grand duke konstantin , a younger brother of the tsar , began to press for the handover of russian america to the united states in 1857 supporters of konstantin 's proposal to immediately withdraw from north america included admiral yevfimy putyatin and the russian minister to the united states , eduard de stoeckl over the winter of 1859–1860 de stoeckl held meetings with american officials , though he had been instructed not to initiate discussions about the sale of the rac assets while president james buchanan kept these hearings informal , preparations were made for further negotiations government might pay for the russian colony and senator gwin replied that they '' might go as far as 5,000,000 '' , a figure gorchakov found far too low de stoeckl informed appleton and gwin of this , the latter saying that his congressional colleagues in oregon and california would support a larger figure with the oncoming american civil war , de stoeckl proposed a renewal of the rac 's charter . russia continued to see an opportunity to weaken british power by causing british columbia , including the royal navy base at esquimalt , to be surrounded or annexed by american territory president andrew johnson was busy with negotiations about reconstruction and seward had alienated a number of republicans , so both men believed that the purchase would help divert attention from the domestic issues the treaty passed the united states senate with 37 votes for versus 2 opposed there can be no doubt that the feelings of a majority of the citizens of the united states are in favor of it the notion that the purchase was unpopular among americans is , a scholar wrote 120 years later , '' one of the strongest historical myths in american history a majority of newspapers supported the purchase or were neutral a review of dozens of contemporary newspapers found general support for the purchase , especially in california ; most of 48 major newspapers supported the purchase after the transfer , a number of russian citizens remained in sitka , but nearly all of them very soon decided to return to russia , which was still possible at the expense of the russian-american company the business grew so large that the earnings of english laborers after the acquisition of alaska by the united states amounted by 1890 to 12,000,000 the purchase of alaska has been referenced as a '' bargain basement deal '' '' seward ’ s folly : who ’ s laughing now ?

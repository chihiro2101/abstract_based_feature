round spermatid injection ( rosi ) is a technique of assisted reproduction whereby a round spermatid is injected into oocyte cytoplasm in order to achieve fertilization this technique can be used to enable genetic fatherhood to some men who have no spermatozoa in the ejaculate ( azoospermia ) and in whom spermatozoa can not be obtained surgically from the testicles this condition is called non-obstructive or secretory azoospermia , as opposed to obstructive azoospermia , in which complete sperm production does occur in the testicles , and potentially fertilizing spermatozoa can be obtained by testicular sperm extraction ( tese ) and used for icsi in cases of nonobstructive ( secretory ) azoospermia , on the other hand , testicular sperm production is blocked at different stages of the process of sperm formation ( spermatogenesis ) in those men in whom spermatogenesis is blocked at the stage of round spermatids , in which meiosis has already been completed , these round cells can successfully fertilize oocytes after being injected into their cytoplasm hum reprod 1996 ; 11:780-783 before the development of the rosi technique , men with the arrest of spermatogenesis at the round spermatid stage could only have children with the use of donor spermatozoa even though many technical aspects of rosi are similar to those of icsi , there are also significant differences between both techniques moreover , the distinction between living round spermatids , to be used in rosi , and dead round spermatids , to be discarded , needs specific methods and skills , not required in the case of icsi where sperm cell viability can be easily evaluated on the basis of sperm motility in most cases if all requirements for round spermatid selection and injection are successfully met , the injected oocytes develop to early embryos and can be transferred to the mother 's uterus to produce pregnancy this procedure is most commonly used to overcome male infertility problems , although it may also be used where eggs can not easily be penetrated by sperm , and occasionally in addition to sperm donation it can be used in teratozoospermia , because once the egg is fertilized , abnormal sperm morphology does not appear to influence blastocyst development or blastocyst morphology zymot tm icsi chip is a device that selects the best spermatozoa for the icsi technique the advantages in relation with other techniques revolve around sperm quality , as the selected ones have better motility , morphology , little dna fragmentation and less quantity of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) the first child born from a gamete micromanipulation ( technique in which special tools and inverted microscopes are used that help embryologists to choose and pick an individual sperm for icsi ivf ) was a singapore-born child in april 1989 icsi ’ s success has effectively diverted attention from identifying what causes male infertility and focused research onto the female , to optimize the provision of eggs and a receptive endometrium , on which icsi ’ s success depends icsi is generally performed following a transvaginal oocyte retrieval procedure to extract one or several oocytes from a woman in icsi ivf , the male partner or a donor provides a sperm sample on the same day when the eggs are collected the extraction of sperm from epididymis is also known as percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration ( pesa ) and extraction of sperm from testicle is also known as testicular sperm aspiration ( tesa ) concern has been raised that in icsi this sperm selection process is bypassed and the sperm is selected by the embryologist without any specific testing '' use of hyaluronan in the selection of sperm for intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( icsi ) : significant improvement in clinical outcomes- multicenter , double-blinded and randomized controlled trial it is uncertain whether icsi improves live birth rates or reduces the risk of miscarriage compared with ultra‐high magnification ( imsi ) sperm selection

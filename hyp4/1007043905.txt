round spermatid injection ( rosi ) is a technique of assisted reproduction whereby a round spermatid is injected into oocyte cytoplasm in order to achieve fertilization this condition is called non-obstructive or secretory azoospermia , as opposed to obstructive azoospermia , in which complete sperm production does occur in the testicles , and potentially fertilizing spermatozoa can be obtained by testicular sperm extraction ( tese ) and used for icsi in cases of nonobstructive ( secretory ) azoospermia , on the other hand , testicular sperm production is blocked at different stages of the process of sperm formation ( spermatogenesis ) in those men in whom spermatogenesis is blocked at the stage of round spermatids , in which meiosis has already been completed , these round cells can successfully fertilize oocytes after being injected into their cytoplasm even though many technical aspects of rosi are similar to those of icsi , there are also significant differences between both techniques the microinjection procedure for rosi also differs slightly from that of icsi , since additional stimuli are needed to ensure proper oocyte activation after spermatid injection if all requirements for round spermatid selection and injection are successfully met , the injected oocytes develop to early embryos and can be transferred to the mother 's uterus to produce pregnancy ninety babies born after round spermatid injection into oocytes : survey of their development from fertilization up to 2 years old it can be used in teratozoospermia , because once the egg is fertilized , abnormal sperm morphology does not appear to influence blastocyst development or blastocyst morphology additionally , we resort to icsi in cases of azoospermia ( when there are no spermatozoa ejaculated but they can be found in testis ) , when we possess valious spermatozoa ( the name given to sperm samples taken to preservate fertility afer chemotherapy ) or after previous irruptions in ivf cycles before performing icsi , sperm in vitro selection and capacitation has to be done apart from the most common techniques of in vitro sperm capacitation ( swim-up , density gradients , filtration and simple wash ) , some new techniques are incredible useful and better than the previous ones one of these new techniques are microfluidic chips , like zymot tm icsi chip zymot tm icsi chip is a device that selects the best spermatozoa for the icsi technique the technique was developed by gianpiero palermo at the vrije universiteit brussel , in the center for reproductive medicine headed by paul devroey and andre van steirteghem icsi is generally performed following a transvaginal oocyte retrieval procedure to extract one or several oocytes from a woman in icsi ivf , the male partner or a donor provides a sperm sample on the same day when the eggs are collected in contrast , in natural fertilization sperm compete and when the first sperm penetrates the oolemma , the oolemma hardens to block the entry of any other sperm the embryologist places the prepared sperm on the microdot , selects and captures sperm that bind to the dot it is uncertain whether icsi improves live birth rates or reduces the risk of miscarriage compared with ultra‚Äêhigh magnification ( imsi ) sperm selection there is some suggestion that birth defects are increased with the use of ivf in general , and icsi specifically , though different studies show contradictory results

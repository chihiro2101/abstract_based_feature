round spermatid injection ( rosi ) round spermatid injection ( rosi ) is a technique of assisted reproduction whereby a round spermatid is injected into oocyte cytoplasm in order to achieve fertilization this technique can be used to enable genetic fatherhood to some men who have no spermatozoa in the ejaculate ( azoospermia ) and in whom spermatozoa can not be obtained surgically from the testicles this condition is called non-obstructive or secretory azoospermia , as opposed to obstructive azoospermia , in which complete sperm production does occur in the testicles , and potentially fertilizing spermatozoa can be obtained by testicular sperm extraction ( tese ) and used for icsi in cases of nonobstructive ( secretory ) azoospermia , on the other hand , testicular sperm production is blocked at different stages of the process of sperm formation ( spermatogenesis ) in those men in whom spermatogenesis is blocked at the stage of round spermatids , in which meiosis has already been completed , these round cells can successfully fertilize oocytes after being injected into their cytoplasm hum reprod 1996 ; 11:780-783 before the development of the rosi technique , men with the arrest of spermatogenesis at the round spermatid stage could only have children with the use of donor spermatozoa even though many technical aspects of rosi are similar to those of icsi , there are also significant differences between both techniques in the first place , as compared to spermatozoa , round spermatids do not possess easily perceptible morphological characteristics and are immotile moreover , the distinction between living round spermatids , to be used in rosi , and dead round spermatids , to be discarded , needs specific methods and skills , not required in the case of icsi where sperm cell viability can be easily evaluated on the basis of sperm motility in most cases the microinjection procedure for rosi also differs slightly from that of icsi , since additional stimuli are needed to ensure proper oocyte activation after spermatid injection if all requirements for round spermatid selection and injection are successfully met , the injected oocytes develop to early embryos and can be transferred to the mother 's uterus to produce pregnancy this procedure is most commonly used to overcome male infertility problems , although it may also be used where eggs can not easily be penetrated by sperm , and occasionally in addition to sperm donation additionally , we resort to icsi in cases of azoospermia ( when there are no spermatozoa ejaculated but they can be found in testis ) , when we possess valious spermatozoa ( the name given to sperm samples taken to preservate fertility afer chemotherapy ) or after previous irruptions in ivf cycles before performing icsi , sperm in vitro selection and capacitation has to be done apart from the most common techniques of in vitro sperm capacitation ( swim-up , density gradients , filtration and simple wash ) , some new techniques are incredible useful and better than the previous ones the advantages in relation with other techniques revolve around sperm quality , as the selected ones have better motility , morphology , little dna fragmentation and less quantity of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) in icsi ivf , the male partner or a donor provides a sperm sample on the same day when the eggs are collected the extraction of sperm from epididymis is also known as percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration ( pesa ) and extraction of sperm from testicle is also known as testicular sperm aspiration ( tesa ) '' use of hyaluronan in the selection of sperm for intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( icsi ) : significant improvement in clinical outcomes- multicenter , double-blinded and randomized controlled trial it is uncertain whether icsi improves live birth rates or reduces the risk of miscarriage compared with ultra‚Äêhigh magnification ( imsi ) sperm selection

the first systematic exposition of economic crises , in opposition to the existing theory of economic equilibrium , was the 1819 nouveaux principes d'économie politique by jean charles léonard de sismondi '' over production and under consumption '' , scarlett , history of economic theory and thought prior to that point classical economics had either denied the existence of business cycles , blamed them on external factors , notably war , or only studied the long term sismondi found vindication in the panic of 1825 , which was the first unarguably international economic crisis , occurring in peacetime this work did not generate interest among classical economists , though underconsumption theory developed as a heterodox branch in economics until being systematized in keynesian economics in the 1930s sismondi 's theory of periodic crises was developed into a theory of alternating cycles by charles dunoyer , and similar theories , showing signs of influence by sismondi , were developed by johann karl rodbertus periodic crises in capitalism formed the basis of the theory of karl marx , who further claimed that these crises were increasing in severity and , on the basis of which , he predicted a communist revolution in 1860 french economist clément juglar first identified economic cycles 7 to 11 years long , although he cautiously did not claim any rigid regularity there were also significant increases in productivity in the years leading up to the great depression see financial crisis 19th century for listing and details business cycles in oecd countries after world war ii were generally more restrained than the earlier business cycles in this period , the economic cycle – at least the problem of depressions – was twice declared dead notably , in 2003 , robert lucas , in his presidential address to the american economic association , declared that the '' central problem of depression-prevention has been solved , for all practical purposes '' fighting off depression , new york times , unfortunately , this was followed by the 2008–2012 global recession mitchell provided the now standard definition of business cycles in their book measuring business cycles : a mitchell , measuring business cycles , new york , national bureau of economic research , 1946 an expansion is the period from a trough to a peak and a recession as the period from a peak to a trough . upper turning points of business cycle , commodity prices and freight rates there is often a close timing relationship between the upper turning points of the business cycle , commodity prices , and freight rates , which is shown to be particularly tight in the grand peak years of 1873 , 1889 , 1900 and 1912 numerous metrics are proposed to identify the business cycle , such as unemployment , stock market returns , and household spending rate economists and investors alike speculate which series may lead the business cycle , providing advanced warning of changes and an advantage in information recent research employing frequency domain has confirmed the presence of kondratiev waves in the world gdp dynamics at an acceptable level of statistical significance a spectral analysis of world gdp dynamics : kondratieff waves , kuznets swings , juglar and kitchin cycles in global economic development , and the 2008–2009 economic crisis korotayev & tsirel also detected shorter business cycles , dating the kuznets to about 17 years and calling it the third sub-harmonic of the kondratiev , meaning that there are three kuznets cycles per kondratiev recurrence quantification analysis has been employed to detect the characteristic of business cycles and economic development last but not least , it has been demonstrated that recurrence quantification analysis can detect differences between macroeconomic variables and highlight hidden features of economic dynamics the explanation of fluctuations in aggregate economic activity is one of the primary concerns of macroeconomics and a variety of theories have been proposed to explain them within economics , it has been debated as to whether or not the fluctuations of a business cycle are attributable to external ( exogenous ) versus internal ( endogenous ) causes the view of the economic cycle as caused exogenously dates to say 's law , and much debate on endogeneity or exogeneity of causes of the economic cycle is framed in terms of refuting or supporting say 's law ; this is also referred to as the '' general glut '' ( supply in relation to demand ) debate there has been some resurgence of neoclassical approaches in the form of real business cycle ( rbc ) theory the 19th-century school of underconsumptionism also posited endogenous causes for the business cycle , notably the paradox of thrift , and today this previously heterodox school has entered the mainstream in the form of keynesian economics via the keynesian revolution mainstream economics views business cycles as essentially '' the random summation of random causes '' this caused economists to move away from viewing business cycles as a cycle that needed to be explained and instead viewing their apparently cyclical nature as a methodological artefact mainstream economists have built models of business cycles based the idea that they are caused by random shocks '' why are recessions so hard to predict ? random shocks and business cycles '' from cycles to shocks : progress in business cycle theory due to this inherent randomness , recessions can sometimes not occur for decades ; for example , australia did not experience any recession between 1991 and 2020 keynesian models do not necessarily imply periodic business cycles however , simple keynesian models involving the interaction of the keynesian multiplier and accelerator give rise to cyclical responses to initial shocks goodwin ( 1967 ) '' a growth cycle '' , in c.h feinstein , editor , socialism , capitalism and economic growth according to goodwin , when unemployment and business profits rise , the output rises in particular , the bursting of speculative bubbles is seen as the proximate cause of depressions , and this theory places finance and banks at the center of the business cycle a primary theory in this vein is the debt deflation theory of irving fisher , which he proposed to explain the great depression post-keynesian economist hyman minsky has proposed an explanation of cycles founded on fluctuations in credit , interest rates and financial frailty , called the financial instability hypothesis 4 ( december 2006 ) : 452–465 david gordon provided a marxist model of long period institutional growth cycles in an attempt to explain the kondratiev wave the difference between 10-year treasury bond rates and the federal funds rate ) is incorporated into the index of leading economic indicators published by the conference board henry george claimed land price fluctuations were the primary cause of most business cycles many social indicators , such as mental health , crimes , and suicides , worsen during economic recessions ( though general mortality tends to fall , and it is in expansions when it tends to increase ) as periods of economic stagnation are painful for the many who lose their jobs , there is often political pressure for governments to mitigate recessions

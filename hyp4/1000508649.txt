the first systematic exposition of economic crises , in opposition to the existing theory of economic equilibrium , was the 1819 nouveaux principes d'économie politique by jean charles léonard de sismondi '' over production and under consumption '' , scarlett , history of economic theory and thought prior to that point classical economics had either denied the existence of business cycles , blamed them on external factors , notably war , or only studied the long term sismondi found vindication in the panic of 1825 , which was the first unarguably international economic crisis , occurring in peacetime this work did not generate interest among classical economists , though underconsumption theory developed as a heterodox branch in economics until being systematized in keynesian economics in the 1930s sismondi 's theory of periodic crises was developed into a theory of alternating cycles by charles dunoyer , and similar theories , showing signs of influence by sismondi , were developed by johann karl rodbertus periodic crises in capitalism formed the basis of the theory of karl marx , who further claimed that these crises were increasing in severity and , on the basis of which , he predicted a communist revolution though only passing references in das kapital ( 1867 ) refer to crises , they were extensively discussed in marx 's posthumously published books , particularly in theories of surplus value in progress and poverty ( 1879 ) , henry george focused on land 's role in crises – particularly land speculation – and proposed a land value tax as a solution others , such as dmitry orlov , argue that simple compound interest mandates the cycling of monetary systems since 1960 , world gdp has increased by fifty-nine times , and these multiples have not even kept up with annual inflation over the same period the bible ( 760 bce ) and hammurabi 's code ( 1763 bce ) both explain economic remediations for cyclic sixty-year recurring great depressions , via fiftieth-year jubilee ( biblical ) debt and wealth resets there were great increases in productivity , industrial production and real per capita product throughout the period from 1870 to 1890 that included the long depression and two other recessions the effect of technological progress can be seen by the purchasing power of an average hour 's work , which has grown from 3 in 1900 to 22 in 1990 , measured in 2010 dollars ) a table of innovations and long cycles can be seen at : there were frequent crises in europe and america in the 19th and first half of the 20th century , specifically the period 1815–1939 see financial crisis 19th century for listing and details business cycles in oecd countries after world war ii were generally more restrained than the earlier business cycles this was particularly true during the golden age of capitalism ( 1945/50–1970s ) , and the period 1945–2008 did not experience a global downturn until the late-2000s recession the first declaration was in the late 1960s , when the phillips curve was seen as being able to steer the economy the second declaration was in the early 2000s , following the stability and growth in the 1980s and 1990s in what came to be known as the great moderation notably , in 2003 , robert lucas , in his presidential address to the american economic association , declared that the '' central problem of depression-prevention has been solved , for all practical purposes for several of these countries the period 1989–2010 has been an ongoing depression , with real income still lower than in 1989 mitchell provided the now standard definition of business cycles in their book measuring business cycles : a mitchell , measuring business cycles , new york , national bureau of economic research , 1946 new york , national bureau of economic research , 1951 in the united states , it is generally accepted that the national bureau of economic research ( nber ) is the final arbiter of the dates of the peaks and troughs of the business cycle the nber identifies a recession as '' a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy , lasting more than a few months , normally visible in real gdp , real income , employment , industrial production '' numerous metrics are proposed to identify the business cycle , such as unemployment , stock market returns , and household spending rate series used to infer the underlying business cycle fall into three categories : lagging , coincident , and leading economists and investors alike speculate which series may lead the business cycle , providing advanced warning of changes and an advantage in information a prominent coincident , or real-time , business cycle indicator is the aruoba-diebold-scotti index a spectral analysis of world gdp dynamics : kondratieff waves , kuznets swings , juglar and kitchin cycles in global economic development , and the 2008–2009 economic crisis korotayev & tsirel also detected shorter business cycles , dating the kuznets to about 17 years and calling it the third sub-harmonic of the kondratiev , meaning that there are three kuznets cycles per kondratiev recurrence quantification analysis has been employed to detect the characteristic of business cycles and economic development to this end , orlando et al , over an extensive dataset , shown that recurrence quantification analysis may help in anticipating transitions from laminar ( i.e the classical school ( now neo-classical ) argues for exogenous causes and the underconsumptionist ( now keynesian ) school argues for endogenous causes the 19th-century school of underconsumptionism also posited endogenous causes for the business cycle , notably the paradox of thrift , and today this previously heterodox school has entered the mainstream in the form of keynesian economics via the keynesian revolution this means that what appear to be cyclical phenomena can actually be explained as just random events that are fed into a simple linear model thus business cycles are essentially random shocks that average out over time '' from cycles to shocks : progress in business cycle theory due to this inherent randomness , recessions can sometimes not occur for decades ; for example , australia did not experience any recession between 1991 and 2020 '' australia ’ s first recession in decades signals tougher times to come according to keynesian economics , fluctuations in aggregate demand cause the economy to come to short run equilibrium at levels that are different from the full employment rate of output cambridge : cambridge university press accounts for cycles in output by the distribution of income between business profits and workers ' wages one alternative theory is that the primary cause of economic cycles is due to the credit cycle : the net expansion of credit ( increase in private credit , equivalently debt , as a percentage of gdp ) yields economic expansions , while the net contraction causes recessions , and if it persists , depressions post-keynesian economist hyman minsky has proposed an explanation of cycles founded on fluctuations in credit , interest rates and financial frailty , called the financial instability hypothesis recent research by georgiy revyakin proved initial vernon theory and showed economic cycles in developed countries overran economic cycles in developing countries over the same time frame , every occurrence of an inverted yield curve has been followed by recession as declared by the nber business cycle dating committee however , even according to keynesian theory , managing economic policy to smooth out the cycle is a difficult task in a society with a complex economy

the first systematic exposition of economic crises , in opposition to the existing theory of economic equilibrium , was the 1819 nouveaux principes d'économie politique by jean charles léonard de sismondi '' over production and under consumption '' , scarlett , history of economic theory and thought prior to that point classical economics had either denied the existence of business cycles , blamed them on external factors , notably war , or only studied the long term sismondi and his contemporary robert owen , who expressed similar but less systematic thoughts in 1817 report to the committee of the association for the relief of the manufacturing poor , both identified the cause of economic cycles as overproduction and underconsumption , caused in particular by wealth inequality this work did not generate interest among classical economists , though underconsumption theory developed as a heterodox branch in economics until being systematized in keynesian economics in the 1930s sismondi 's theory of periodic crises was developed into a theory of alternating cycles by charles dunoyer , and similar theories , showing signs of influence by sismondi , were developed by johann karl rodbertus periodic crises in capitalism formed the basis of the theory of karl marx , who further claimed that these crises were increasing in severity and , on the basis of which , he predicted a communist revolution though only passing references in das kapital ( 1867 ) refer to crises , they were extensively discussed in marx 's posthumously published books , particularly in theories of surplus value in progress and poverty ( 1879 ) , henry george focused on land 's role in crises – particularly land speculation – and proposed a land value tax as a solution in 1860 french economist clément juglar first identified economic cycles 7 to 11 years long , although he cautiously did not claim any rigid regularity over the period since the industrial revolution , technological progress has had a much larger effect on the economy than any fluctuations in credit or debt , the primary exception being the great depression , which caused a multi-year steep economic decline the effect of technological progress can be seen by the purchasing power of an average hour 's work , which has grown from 3 in 1900 to 22 in 1990 , measured in 2010 dollars there were frequent crises in europe and america in the 19th and first half of the 20th century , specifically the period 1815–1939 business cycles in oecd countries after world war ii were generally more restrained than the earlier business cycles the second declaration was in the early 2000s , following the stability and growth in the 1980s and 1990s in what came to be known as the great moderation notably , in 2003 , robert lucas , in his presidential address to the american economic association , declared that the '' central problem of depression-prevention has been solved , for all practical purposes '' fighting off depression , new york times , unfortunately , this was followed by the 2008–2012 global recession mitchell provided the now standard definition of business cycles in their book measuring business cycles : a mitchell , measuring business cycles , new york , national bureau of economic research , 1946 new york , national bureau of economic research , 1951 in the united states , it is generally accepted that the national bureau of economic research ( nber ) is the final arbiter of the dates of the peaks and troughs of the business cycle the nber identifies a recession as '' a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy , lasting more than a few months , normally visible in real gdp , real income , employment , industrial production '' . upper turning points of business cycle , commodity prices and freight rates numerous metrics are proposed to identify the business cycle , such as unemployment , stock market returns , and household spending rate series used to infer the underlying business cycle fall into three categories : lagging , coincident , and leading most are results of the cycle instead of the reason for the cycle , and thus lag recent research employing frequency domain has confirmed the presence of kondratiev waves in the world gdp dynamics at an acceptable level of statistical significance developed the so-called recurrence quantification correlation index to test correlations of rqa on a sample signal and then investigated the application to business time series last but not least , it has been demonstrated that recurrence quantification analysis can detect differences between macroeconomic variables and highlight hidden features of economic dynamics the business cycle follows changes in stock prices which are mostly caused by external factors such as socioeconomic conditions , inflation , exchange rates for example , milton friedman said that calling the business cycle a '' cycle '' is a misnomer , because of its non-cyclical nature friedman believed that for the most part , excluding very large supply shocks , business declines are more of a monetary phenomenon until the keynesian revolution in mainstream economics in the wake of the great depression , classical and neoclassical explanations ( exogenous causes ) were the mainstream explanation of economic cycles ; following the keynesian revolution , neoclassical macroeconomics was largely rejected in 1927 , eugen slutzky observed that summing random numbers , such as the last digits of the russian state lottery , could generate patterns akin to that we see in business cycles , an observation that has since been repeated many times thus business cycles are essentially random shocks that average out over time mainstream economists have built models of business cycles based the idea that they are caused by random shocks '' from cycles to shocks : progress in business cycle theory due to this inherent randomness , recessions can sometimes not occur for decades ; for example , australia did not experience any recession between 1991 and 2020 these fluctuations express themselves as the observed business cycles paul samuelson 's '' oscillator model '' is supposed to account for business cycles thanks to the multiplier and the accelerator one alternative theory is that the primary cause of economic cycles is due to the credit cycle : the net expansion of credit ( increase in private credit , equivalently debt , as a percentage of gdp ) yields economic expansions , while the net contraction causes recessions , and if it persists , depressions in particular , the bursting of speculative bubbles is seen as the proximate cause of depressions , and this theory places finance and banks at the center of the business cycle . product based theory of economic cycles this theory explains the nature and causes of economic cycles from the viewpoint of life-cycle of marketable goods recent research by georgiy revyakin proved initial vernon theory and showed economic cycles in developed countries overran economic cycles in developing countries ) , and kitchin cycles are characterized by change in the society preferences ( tastes ) for consumer goods , and time , which is necessary to start the production the replacement , regime b , adopts contractionary policies reducing inflation and growth , and the downwards swing of the cycle later theorists applying variants of the goodwin model have identified both short and long period profit-led growth and distribution cycles in the united states and elsewhere the difference between 10-year treasury bond rates and the federal funds rate ) is incorporated into the index of leading economic indicators published by the conference board as periods of economic stagnation are painful for the many who lose their jobs , there is often political pressure for governments to mitigate recessions however , even according to keynesian theory , managing economic policy to smooth out the cycle is a difficult task in a society with a complex economy

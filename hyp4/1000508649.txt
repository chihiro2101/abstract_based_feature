the first systematic exposition of economic crises , in opposition to the existing theory of economic equilibrium , was the 1819 nouveaux principes d'économie politique by jean charles léonard de sismondi '' over production and under consumption '' , scarlett , history of economic theory and thought prior to that point classical economics had either denied the existence of business cycles , blamed them on external factors , notably war , or only studied the long term sismondi found vindication in the panic of 1825 , which was the first unarguably international economic crisis , occurring in peacetime sismondi and his contemporary robert owen , who expressed similar but less systematic thoughts in 1817 report to the committee of the association for the relief of the manufacturing poor , both identified the cause of economic cycles as overproduction and underconsumption , caused in particular by wealth inequality this work did not generate interest among classical economists , though underconsumption theory developed as a heterodox branch in economics until being systematized in keynesian economics in the 1930s sismondi 's theory of periodic crises was developed into a theory of alternating cycles by charles dunoyer , and similar theories , showing signs of influence by sismondi , were developed by johann karl rodbertus periodic crises in capitalism formed the basis of the theory of karl marx , who further claimed that these crises were increasing in severity and , on the basis of which , he predicted a communist revolution though only passing references in das kapital ( 1867 ) refer to crises , they were extensively discussed in marx 's posthumously published books , particularly in theories of surplus value in progress and poverty ( 1879 ) , henry george focused on land 's role in crises – particularly land speculation – and proposed a land value tax as a solution in 1860 french economist clément juglar first identified economic cycles 7 to 11 years long , although he cautiously did not claim any rigid regularity social contract ( freedoms and absence of social problems ) collapses may be observed in nations where incomes are not kept in balance with cost-of-living over the timeline of the monetary system cycle there were great increases in productivity , industrial production and real per capita product throughout the period from 1870 to 1890 that included the long depression and two other recessions there were also significant increases in productivity in the years leading up to the great depression both the long and great depressions were characterized by overcapacity and market saturation over the period since the industrial revolution , technological progress has had a much larger effect on the economy than any fluctuations in credit or debt , the primary exception being the great depression , which caused a multi-year steep economic decline the effect of technological progress can be seen by the purchasing power of an average hour 's work , which has grown from 3 in 1900 to 22 in 1990 , measured in 2010 dollars there were frequent crises in europe and america in the 19th and first half of the 20th century , specifically the period 1815–1939 this period started from the end of the napoleonic wars in 1815 , which was immediately followed by the post-napoleonic depression in the united kingdom ( 1815–30 ) , and culminated in the great depression of 1929–39 , which led into world war ii business cycles in oecd countries after world war ii were generally more restrained than the earlier business cycles this was particularly true during the golden age of capitalism ( 1945/50–1970s ) , and the period 1945–2008 did not experience a global downturn until the late-2000s recession in this period , the economic cycle – at least the problem of depressions – was twice declared dead the second declaration was in the early 2000s , following the stability and growth in the 1980s and 1990s in what came to be known as the great moderation notably , in 2003 , robert lucas , in his presidential address to the american economic association , declared that the '' central problem of depression-prevention has been solved , for all practical purposes for several of these countries the period 1989–2010 has been an ongoing depression , with real income still lower than in 1989 mitchell provided the now standard definition of business cycles in their book measuring business cycles : a new york , national bureau of economic research , 1951 in the united states , it is generally accepted that the national bureau of economic research ( nber ) is the final arbiter of the dates of the peaks and troughs of the business cycle there is often a close timing relationship between the upper turning points of the business cycle , commodity prices , and freight rates , which is shown to be particularly tight in the grand peak years of 1873 , 1889 , 1900 and 1912 numerous metrics are proposed to identify the business cycle , such as unemployment , stock market returns , and household spending rate series used to infer the underlying business cycle fall into three categories : lagging , coincident , and leading economists and investors alike speculate which series may lead the business cycle , providing advanced warning of changes and an advantage in information recent research employing frequency domain has confirmed the presence of kondratiev waves in the world gdp dynamics at an acceptable level of statistical significance last but not least , it has been demonstrated that recurrence quantification analysis can detect differences between macroeconomic variables and highlight hidden features of economic dynamics the business cycle follows changes in stock prices which are mostly caused by external factors such as socioeconomic conditions , inflation , exchange rates in the first case shocks are stochastic , in the second case shocks are deterministically chaotic and embedded in the economic system there has been some resurgence of neoclassical approaches in the form of real business cycle ( rbc ) theory the 19th-century school of underconsumptionism also posited endogenous causes for the business cycle , notably the paradox of thrift , and today this previously heterodox school has entered the mainstream in the form of keynesian economics via the keynesian revolution in 1927 , eugen slutzky observed that summing random numbers , such as the last digits of the russian state lottery , could generate patterns akin to that we see in business cycles , an observation that has since been repeated many times this caused economists to move away from viewing business cycles as a cycle that needed to be explained and instead viewing their apparently cyclical nature as a methodological artefact '' why are recessions so hard to predict ? random shocks and business cycles however , simple keynesian models involving the interaction of the keynesian multiplier and accelerator give rise to cyclical responses to initial shocks feinstein , editor , socialism , capitalism and economic growth one alternative theory is that the primary cause of economic cycles is due to the credit cycle : the net expansion of credit ( increase in private credit , equivalently debt , as a percentage of gdp ) yields economic expansions , while the net contraction causes recessions , and if it persists , depressions a more recent complementary theory is the financial instability hypothesis of hyman minsky , and the credit theory of economic cycles is often associated with post-keynesian economics such as steve keen post-keynesian economist hyman minsky has proposed an explanation of cycles founded on fluctuations in credit , interest rates and financial frailty , called the financial instability hypothesis '' why are recessions so hard to predict ? random shocks and business cycles '' alternative approaches to the political business cycle , '' brookings papers on economic activity , p pp austrians claim that the boom-and-bust business cycle is caused by government intervention into the economy , and that the cycle would be comparatively rare and mild without central government interference estrella and others have postulated that the yield curve affects the business cycle via the balance sheet of banks ( or shadow banking system ) however , even according to keynesian theory , managing economic policy to smooth out the cycle is a difficult task in a society with a complex economy

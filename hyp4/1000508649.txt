the first systematic exposition of economic crises , in opposition to the existing theory of economic equilibrium , was the 1819 nouveaux principes d'économie politique by jean charles léonard de sismondi '' over production and under consumption '' , scarlett , history of economic theory and thought prior to that point classical economics had either denied the existence of business cycles , blamed them on external factors , notably war , or only studied the long term sismondi found vindication in the panic of 1825 , which was the first unarguably international economic crisis , occurring in peacetime this work did not generate interest among classical economists , though underconsumption theory developed as a heterodox branch in economics until being systematized in keynesian economics in the 1930s sismondi 's theory of periodic crises was developed into a theory of alternating cycles by charles dunoyer , and similar theories , showing signs of influence by sismondi , were developed by johann karl rodbertus periodic crises in capitalism formed the basis of the theory of karl marx , who further claimed that these crises were increasing in severity and , on the basis of which , he predicted a communist revolution in progress and poverty ( 1879 ) , henry george focused on land 's role in crises – particularly land speculation – and proposed a land value tax as a solution in 1860 french economist clément juglar first identified economic cycles 7 to 11 years long , although he cautiously did not claim any rigid regularity others , such as dmitry orlov , argue that simple compound interest mandates the cycling of monetary systems social contract ( freedoms and absence of social problems ) collapses may be observed in nations where incomes are not kept in balance with cost-of-living over the timeline of the monetary system cycle the bible ( 760 bce ) and hammurabi 's code ( 1763 bce ) both explain economic remediations for cyclic sixty-year recurring great depressions , via fiftieth-year jubilee ( biblical ) debt and wealth resets thirty major debt forgiveness events are recorded in history including the debt forgiveness given to most european nations in the 1930s to 1954 both the long and great depressions were characterized by overcapacity and market saturation over the period since the industrial revolution , technological progress has had a much larger effect on the economy than any fluctuations in credit or debt , the primary exception being the great depression , which caused a multi-year steep economic decline the effect of technological progress can be seen by the purchasing power of an average hour 's work , which has grown from 3 in 1900 to 22 in 1990 , measured in 2010 dollars there were frequent crises in europe and america in the 19th and first half of the 20th century , specifically the period 1815–1939 business cycles in oecd countries after world war ii were generally more restrained than the earlier business cycles in this period , the economic cycle – at least the problem of depressions – was twice declared dead the second declaration was in the early 2000s , following the stability and growth in the 1980s and 1990s in what came to be known as the great moderation mitchell provided the now standard definition of business cycles in their book measuring business cycles : a mitchell , what happens during business cycles : a progress report new york , national bureau of economic research , 1951 in the united states , it is generally accepted that the national bureau of economic research ( nber ) is the final arbiter of the dates of the peaks and troughs of the business cycle the nber identifies a recession as '' a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy , lasting more than a few months , normally visible in real gdp , real income , employment , industrial production '' there is often a close timing relationship between the upper turning points of the business cycle , commodity prices , and freight rates , which is shown to be particularly tight in the grand peak years of 1873 , 1889 , 1900 and 1912 numerous metrics are proposed to identify the business cycle , such as unemployment , stock market returns , and household spending rate most are results of the cycle instead of the reason for the cycle , and thus lag a prominent coincident , or real-time , business cycle indicator is the aruoba-diebold-scotti index a spectral analysis of world gdp dynamics : kondratieff waves , kuznets swings , juglar and kitchin cycles in global economic development , and the 2008–2009 economic crisis korotayev & tsirel also detected shorter business cycles , dating the kuznets to about 17 years and calling it the third sub-harmonic of the kondratiev , meaning that there are three kuznets cycles per kondratiev recurrence quantification analysis has been employed to detect the characteristic of business cycles and economic development developed the so-called recurrence quantification correlation index to test correlations of rqa on a sample signal and then investigated the application to business time series the said index has been proven to detect hidden changes in time series the business cycle follows changes in stock prices which are mostly caused by external factors such as socioeconomic conditions , inflation , exchange rates for example , milton friedman said that calling the business cycle a '' cycle '' is a misnomer , because of its non-cyclical nature friedman believed that for the most part , excluding very large supply shocks , business declines are more of a monetary phenomenon the explanation of fluctuations in aggregate economic activity is one of the primary concerns of macroeconomics and a variety of theories have been proposed to explain them the debate between keynesians and neo-classical advocates was reawakened following the recession of 2007 mainstream economics views business cycles as essentially '' the random summation of random causes '' thus business cycles are essentially random shocks that average out over time '' new york times , 09.02.20 while economists have found it difficult to forecast recessions or determine their likely severity , research indicates that longer expansions do not cause following recessions to be more severe these fluctuations express themselves as the observed business cycles however , simple keynesian models involving the interaction of the keynesian multiplier and accelerator give rise to cyclical responses to initial shocks in particular , the bursting of speculative bubbles is seen as the proximate cause of depressions , and this theory places finance and banks at the center of the business cycle in an expansion period , interest rates are low and companies easily borrow money from banks to invest the replacement , regime b , adopts contractionary policies reducing inflation and growth , and the downwards swing of the cycle later theorists applying variants of the goodwin model have identified both short and long period profit-led growth and distribution cycles in the united states and elsewhere the slope of the yield curve is one of the most powerful predictors of future economic growth , inflation , and recessions since the 1940s , following the keynesian revolution , most governments of developed nations have seen the mitigation of the business cycle as part of the responsibility of government , under the rubric of stabilization policy the 1973–75 recession provided striking support for their theories while proving a dilemma for keynesian policies , which appeared to necessitate both expansionary policies to mitigate recession and contractionary policies to reduce inflation

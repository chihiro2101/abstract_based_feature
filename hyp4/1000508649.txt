the first systematic exposition of economic crises , in opposition to the existing theory of economic equilibrium , was the 1819 nouveaux principes d'économie politique by jean charles léonard de sismondi '' over production and under consumption '' , scarlett , history of economic theory and thought prior to that point classical economics had either denied the existence of business cycles , blamed them on external factors , notably war , or only studied the long term sismondi found vindication in the panic of 1825 , which was the first unarguably international economic crisis , occurring in peacetime this work did not generate interest among classical economists , though underconsumption theory developed as a heterodox branch in economics until being systematized in keynesian economics in the 1930s periodic crises in capitalism formed the basis of the theory of karl marx , who further claimed that these crises were increasing in severity and , on the basis of which , he predicted a communist revolution though only passing references in das kapital ( 1867 ) refer to crises , they were extensively discussed in marx 's posthumously published books , particularly in theories of surplus value in progress and poverty ( 1879 ) , henry george focused on land 's role in crises – particularly land speculation – and proposed a land value tax as a solution in 1860 french economist clément juglar first identified economic cycles 7 to 11 years long , although he cautiously did not claim any rigid regularity others , such as dmitry orlov , argue that simple compound interest mandates the cycling of monetary systems there were great increases in productivity , industrial production and real per capita product throughout the period from 1870 to 1890 that included the long depression and two other recessions there were also significant increases in productivity in the years leading up to the great depression this period started from the end of the napoleonic wars in 1815 , which was immediately followed by the post-napoleonic depression in the united kingdom ( 1815–30 ) , and culminated in the great depression of 1929–39 , which led into world war ii business cycles in oecd countries after world war ii were generally more restrained than the earlier business cycles this was particularly true during the golden age of capitalism ( 1945/50–1970s ) , and the period 1945–2008 did not experience a global downturn until the late-2000s recession in this period , the economic cycle – at least the problem of depressions – was twice declared dead the second declaration was in the early 2000s , following the stability and growth in the 1980s and 1990s in what came to be known as the great moderation notably , in 2003 , robert lucas , in his presidential address to the american economic association , declared that the '' central problem of depression-prevention has been solved , for all practical purposes various regions have experienced prolonged depressions , most dramatically the economic crisis in former eastern bloc countries following the end of the soviet union in 1991 mitchell provided the now standard definition of business cycles in their book measuring business cycles : a mitchell , measuring business cycles , new york , national bureau of economic research , 1946 mitchell , what happens during business cycles : a progress report new york , national bureau of economic research , 1951 in the united states , it is generally accepted that the national bureau of economic research ( nber ) is the final arbiter of the dates of the peaks and troughs of the business cycle numerous metrics are proposed to identify the business cycle , such as unemployment , stock market returns , and household spending rate economists and investors alike speculate which series may lead the business cycle , providing advanced warning of changes and an advantage in information spectral analysis of business cycles a spectral analysis of world gdp dynamics : kondratieff waves , kuznets swings , juglar and kitchin cycles in global economic development , and the 2008–2009 economic crisis korotayev & tsirel also detected shorter business cycles , dating the kuznets to about 17 years and calling it the third sub-harmonic of the kondratiev , meaning that there are three kuznets cycles per kondratiev recurrence quantification analysis has been employed to detect the characteristic of business cycles and economic development last but not least , it has been demonstrated that recurrence quantification analysis can detect differences between macroeconomic variables and highlight hidden features of economic dynamics within economics , it has been debated as to whether or not the fluctuations of a business cycle are attributable to external ( exogenous ) versus internal ( endogenous ) causes this division is not absolute – some classicals ( including say ) argued for government policy to mitigate the damage of economic cycles , despite believing in external causes , while austrian school economists argue against government involvement as only worsening crises , despite believing in internal causes the debate between keynesians and neo-classical advocates was reawakened following the recession of 2007 thus business cycles are essentially random shocks that average out over time '' from cycles to shocks : progress in business cycle theory due to this inherent randomness , recessions can sometimes not occur for decades ; for example , australia did not experience any recession between 1991 and 2020 according to keynesian economics , fluctuations in aggregate demand cause the economy to come to short run equilibrium at levels that are different from the full employment rate of output paul samuelson 's '' oscillator model '' is supposed to account for business cycles thanks to the multiplier and the accelerator feinstein , editor , socialism , capitalism and economic growth cambridge : cambridge university press accounts for cycles in output by the distribution of income between business profits and workers ' wages in particular , the bursting of speculative bubbles is seen as the proximate cause of depressions , and this theory places finance and banks at the center of the business cycle post-keynesian economist hyman minsky has proposed an explanation of cycles founded on fluctuations in credit , interest rates and financial frailty , called the financial instability hypothesis while credit causes have not been a primary theory of the economic cycle within the mainstream , they have gained occasional mention , such as , cited approvingly by within mainstream economics , keynesian views have been challenged by real business cycle models in which fluctuations are due to random changes in the total productivity factor ( which are caused by changes in technology as well as the legal and regulatory environment ) '' why are recessions so hard to predict ? random shocks and business cycles recent research by georgiy revyakin proved initial vernon theory and showed economic cycles in developed countries overran economic cycles in developing countries economists of the heterodox austrian school argue that business cycles are caused by excessive issuance of credit by banks in fractional reserve banking systems the austrian explanation of the business cycle differs significantly from the mainstream understanding of business cycles and is generally rejected by mainstream economists as periods of economic stagnation are painful for the many who lose their jobs , there is often political pressure for governments to mitigate recessions however , even according to keynesian theory , managing economic policy to smooth out the cycle is a difficult task in a society with a complex economy

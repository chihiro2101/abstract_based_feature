'' cesare lombroso , a brief biography '' , brain and mind ( 1997 ) his father was aronne lombroso , a tradesman from verona , and his mother was zippora ( or zefira ) levi from chieri near turin cesare lombroso descended from a line of rabbis , which led him to study a wide range of topics in university three of his works had been translated into english by 1900 , including a partial translation of the female offender published in 1895 and read in august of that year by the late nineteenth century english novelist , george gissing lombroso later became professor of psychiatry ( 1896 ) and criminal anthropology ( 1906 ) at the same university besides the '' born criminal '' , lombroso also described '' criminaloids '' , or occasional criminals , criminals by passion , moral imbeciles , and criminal epileptics in criminal woman , as introduced in an english translation by nicole hahn rafter and mary gibson , lombroso used his theory of atavism to explain women 's criminal offending '' however , lombroso 's '' obdurate beliefs '' about women presented an '' intractable problem '' for this theory : '' because he was convinced that women are inferior to men lombroso was unable to argue , based on his theory of the born criminal , that women 's lesser involvement in crime reflected their comparatively lower levels of atavism '' lombroso 's research methods were clinical and descriptive , with precise details of skull dimension and other measurements although he gave some recognition in his later years to psychological and sociological factors in the etiology of crime , he remained convinced of , and identified with , criminal anthropometry lombroso 's theories were disapproved throughout europe , especially in schools of medicine : notably by alexandre lacassagne in france lombroso differentiated himself from his predecessor and rival , cesare beccaria , through depicting his positivist school in opposition to beccaria 's classist one ( which centered around the idea that criminal behavior is born out of free will rather than inherited physical traits ) lombroso 's theory has been cited as possibly '' the most influential doctrine '' in all areas studying human behavior , and indeed , its impact extended far and wide according to lombroso , criminal appearance was not just based on inherited physiognomy such as nose or skull shape , but also could be judged through superficial features like tattoos on the body in particular , lombroso began searching for a relationship between tattoos and an agglomeration of symptoms eut ( which are currently diagnosed as borderline personality disorder ) lombroso 's theories were likely accepted due to the pre-existing regional stigma against left-handedness , and greatly influenced the reception of left-handedness in the 20th century his hypothesis even manifested in a new way during the 1980s and 1990s with a series of research studies grouping left-handedness with psychiatric disorders and autoimmune diseases his work stereotyping degenerates can even be seen as an influence behind benito mussolini 's movement to clean the streets of italy within the penal system , lombroso 's work led to new forms of punishment , where occasionally punishment varied based on the defendant 's biological background lombroso and his followers argued for a criminal code , in which the criminal understood as unable to act with free will due to their biological predisposition to crime since his research tied criminal behavior together with the insane , lombroso is closely credited with the genesis of the criminal insane asylum and forensic psychiatry his work sponsored the creation of institutions where the criminally insane would be treated for mental illness , rather than placed in jails with their saner counterparts his influence on the asylum was at first regional , but eventually percolated to other countries who adopted some of lombroso 's measures for treating the criminally insane in addition to influencing criminal atavisim , lombroso wrote a book called genio e follia , in which he discussed the link between genius and insanity this disease also found its roots in the same poverty that caused cretinism , which lombroso studied at the start of his medical career in bram stoker 's dracula , count dracula is described as having a physical appearance lombroso would describe as criminal stevenson 's jekyll and hyde was influenced by lombroso 's theory , with the criminal , evil hyde being described as '' ape-like '' 1899 & nbsp ; crime : its causes and remedies 1909 & nbsp ; after death - what ? 1911 & nbsp ; criminal man , according to the classification of cesare lombroso 2004 & nbsp ; the criminal anthropological writings of cesare lombroso 2004 & nbsp ; criminal woman , the prostitute , and the normal woman the criminal , introduction by cesare lombroso , the macmillan company , 1900

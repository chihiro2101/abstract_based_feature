the min homeland of fujian was opened to chinese settlement by the defeat of the minyue state by the armies of emperor wu of han in 110 bc most subsequent migration from north to south china passed through the valleys of the xiang and gan rivers to the west , so that min varieties have experienced less northern influence than other southern groups as a result , whereas most varieties of chinese can be treated as derived from middle chinese , the language described by rime dictionary such as the qieyun ( 601 ad ) , min varieties contain traces of older distinctions linguists estimate that the oldest layers of min dialects diverged from the rest of chinese around the time of the han dynasty jerry norman identifies four main layers in the vocabulary of modern min varieties : a non-chinese substratum from the original languages of minyue , which norman and mei tsu-lin believe were austroasiatic the varieties used in neighbouring counties , and in the mountains of western fujian even in adjacent villages , are often mutually unintelligible the coastal varieties have the vast majority of speakers , and have spread from their homeland in fujian and eastern guangdong to the islands of taiwan and hainan , to other coastal areas of southern china and to southeast asia pan and colleagues divided them into three groups : eastern min ( min dong ) , centered around the city of fuzhou , the capital of fujian province , with fuzhou dialect as the prestige form southern min ( min nan ) originates from the south of fujian and the eastern corner of guangdong in popular usage , southern min usually refers to dialects of the hokkien type , which originated in southern fujian ( around quanzhou , zhangzhou and xiamen ) and spread to southeast asia , where they are known as hokkien , and taiwan , where they are known as taiwanese zhenan min of cangnan county in southern zhejiang is also of this type the language atlas of china ( 1987 ) distinguished two further groups , which had previously been included in southern min : leizhou min , spoken on the leizhou peninsula in southwestern guangdong pan and colleagues divided the inland varieties into two groups : northern min ( min bei ) is spoken in nanping prefecture in fujian , with jian'ou dialect taken as typical the min form preserves the original meaning '' cooking pot '' , but in other chinese varieties this word ( mc tengx > d«êng ) has become specialized to refer to ancient ceremonial tripods given that min combines the chinese of several different periods and contains some non-chinese substrate vocabulary , an author literate in mandarin ( or even classical chinese ) may have trouble finding the appropriate chinese characters for some min vocabulary the result is that adapting chinese characters to write min requires a substantial effort to choose characters for a significant portion of the vocabulary

the min homeland of fujian was opened to chinese settlement by the defeat of the minyue state by the armies of emperor wu of han in 110 bc most subsequent migration from north to south china passed through the valleys of the xiang and gan rivers to the west , so that min varieties have experienced less northern influence than other southern groups as a result , whereas most varieties of chinese can be treated as derived from middle chinese , the language described by rime dictionary such as the qieyun ( 601 ad ) , min varieties contain traces of older distinctions linguists estimate that the oldest layers of min dialects diverged from the rest of chinese around the time of the han dynasty jerry norman identifies four main layers in the vocabulary of modern min varieties : a non-chinese substratum from the original languages of minyue , which norman and mei tsu-lin believe were austroasiatic : min is usually described as one of seven or ten groups of varieties of chinese but has greater dialectal diversity than any of the other groups the coastal varieties have the vast majority of speakers , and have spread from their homeland in fujian and eastern guangdong to the islands of taiwan and hainan , to other coastal areas of southern china and to southeast asia li rulong and chen zhangtai examined 214 words , finding 62 % shared with quanzhou dialect ( southern min ) and 39 % shared with fuzhou dialect ( eastern min ) , and concluded that pu-xian was more closely related to southern min southern min ( min nan ) originates from the south of fujian and the eastern corner of guangdong in popular usage , southern min usually refers to dialects of the hokkien type , which originated in southern fujian ( around quanzhou , zhangzhou and xiamen ) and spread to southeast asia , where they are known as hokkien , and taiwan , where they are known as taiwanese the language atlas of china ( 1987 ) distinguished two further groups , which had previously been included in southern min : leizhou min , spoken on the leizhou peninsula in southwestern guangdong the language atlas of china ( 1987 ) included a further group : shao-jiang min , spoken in the northwestern fujian counties of shaowu and jiangle , were classified as hakka by pan and his associates however , jerry norman suggested that they were inland varieties of min that had been subject to heavy gan or hakka influence most min vocabulary corresponds directly to cognates in other chinese varieties , but there is also a significant number of distinctively min words that may be traced back to proto-min in min this form has displaced the common chinese term kǒu 口 the result is that adapting chinese characters to write min requires a substantial effort to choose characters for a significant portion of the vocabulary

the min homeland of fujian was opened to chinese settlement by the defeat of the minyue state by the armies of emperor wu of han in 110 bc most subsequent migration from north to south china passed through the valleys of the xiang and gan rivers to the west , so that min varieties have experienced less northern influence than other southern groups as a result , whereas most varieties of chinese can be treated as derived from middle chinese , the language described by rime dictionary such as the qieyun ( 601 ad ) , min varieties contain traces of older distinctions linguists estimate that the oldest layers of min dialects diverged from the rest of chinese around the time of the han dynasty in 909 , following the fall of the tang dynasty , his son wang shenzhi founded the min kingdom , one of the ten kingdoms in the five dynasties and ten kingdoms period jerry norman identifies four main layers in the vocabulary of modern min varieties : a non-chinese substratum from the original languages of minyue , which norman and mei tsu-lin believe were austroasiatic laurent sagart ( 2008 ) disagrees with norman and mei tsu-lin 's analysis of an austroasiatic substratum in min : min is usually described as one of seven or ten groups of varieties of chinese but has greater dialectal diversity than any of the other groups early classifications , such as those of li fang-kuei in 1937 and yuan jiahua in 1960 , divided min into northern and southern subgroups li rulong and chen zhangtai examined 214 words , finding 62 % shared with quanzhou dialect ( southern min ) and 39 % shared with fuzhou dialect ( eastern min ) , and concluded that pu-xian was more closely related to southern min southern min ( min nan ) originates from the south of fujian and the eastern corner of guangdong in popular usage , southern min usually refers to dialects of the hokkien type , which originated in southern fujian ( around quanzhou , zhangzhou and xiamen ) and spread to southeast asia , where they are known as hokkien , and taiwan , where they are known as taiwanese pan and colleagues divided the inland varieties into two groups : northern min ( min bei ) is spoken in nanping prefecture in fujian , with jian'ou dialect taken as typical central min ( min zhong ) , spoken in sanming prefecture the result is that adapting chinese characters to write min requires a substantial effort to choose characters for a significant portion of the vocabulary there are some uncommon publications in mixed writing , using mostly chinese characters but using the latin alphabet to represent words that can not easily be represented by chinese characters .

the min homeland of fujian was opened to chinese settlement by the defeat of the minyue state by the armies of emperor wu of han in 110 bc most subsequent migration from north to south china passed through the valleys of the xiang and gan rivers to the west , so that min varieties have experienced less northern influence than other southern groups linguists estimate that the oldest layers of min dialects diverged from the rest of chinese around the time of the han dynasty in 909 , following the fall of the tang dynasty , his son wang shenzhi founded the min kingdom , one of the ten kingdoms in the five dynasties and ten kingdoms period jerry norman identifies four main layers in the vocabulary of modern min varieties : a non-chinese substratum from the original languages of minyue , which norman and mei tsu-lin believe were austroasiatic : min is usually described as one of seven or ten groups of varieties of chinese but has greater dialectal diversity than any of the other groups early classifications , such as those of li fang-kuei in 1937 and yuan jiahua in 1960 , divided min into northern and southern subgroups the coastal varieties have the vast majority of speakers , and have spread from their homeland in fujian and eastern guangdong to the islands of taiwan and hainan , to other coastal areas of southern china and to southeast asia pan and colleagues divided them into three groups : eastern min ( min dong ) , centered around the city of fuzhou , the capital of fujian province , with fuzhou dialect as the prestige form li rulong and chen zhangtai examined 214 words , finding 62 % shared with quanzhou dialect ( southern min ) and 39 % shared with fuzhou dialect ( eastern min ) , and concluded that pu-xian was more closely related to southern min the language atlas of china ( 1987 ) distinguished two further groups , which had previously been included in southern min : leizhou min , spoken on the leizhou peninsula in southwestern guangdong pan and colleagues divided the inland varieties into two groups : northern min ( min bei ) is spoken in nanping prefecture in fujian , with jian'ou dialect taken as typical central min ( min zhong ) , spoken in sanming prefecture most min vocabulary corresponds directly to cognates in other chinese varieties , but there is also a significant number of distinctively min words that may be traced back to proto-min in min this form has displaced the common chinese term tián 田 given that min combines the chinese of several different periods and contains some non-chinese substrate vocabulary , an author literate in mandarin ( or even classical chinese ) may have trouble finding the appropriate chinese characters for some min vocabulary

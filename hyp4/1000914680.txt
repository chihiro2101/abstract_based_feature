the min homeland of fujian was opened to chinese settlement by the defeat of the minyue state by the armies of emperor wu of han in 110 bc most subsequent migration from north to south china passed through the valleys of the xiang and gan rivers to the west , so that min varieties have experienced less northern influence than other southern groups as a result , whereas most varieties of chinese can be treated as derived from middle chinese , the language described by rime dictionary such as the qieyun ( 601 ad ) , min varieties contain traces of older distinctions linguists estimate that the oldest layers of min dialects diverged from the rest of chinese around the time of the han dynasty however , significant waves of migration from the north china plain occurred : the uprising of the five barbarians during the jin dynasty , particularly the disaster of yongjia in 311 ad , caused a tide of immigration to the south jerry norman identifies four main layers in the vocabulary of modern min varieties : a non-chinese substratum from the original languages of minyue , which norman and mei tsu-lin believe were austroasiatic the earliest chinese layer , brought to fujian by settlers from zhejiang to the north during the han dynasty : min is usually described as one of seven or ten groups of varieties of chinese but has greater dialectal diversity than any of the other groups pan and colleagues divided them into three groups : eastern min ( min dong ) , centered around the city of fuzhou , the capital of fujian province , with fuzhou dialect as the prestige form li rulong and chen zhangtai examined 214 words , finding 62 % shared with quanzhou dialect ( southern min ) and 39 % shared with fuzhou dialect ( eastern min ) , and concluded that pu-xian was more closely related to southern min southern min ( min nan ) originates from the south of fujian and the eastern corner of guangdong the language atlas of china ( 1987 ) distinguished two further groups , which had previously been included in southern min : leizhou min , spoken on the leizhou peninsula in southwestern guangdong coastal varieties feature some uniquely min vocabulary , including pronouns and negatives , , , and , inland varieties contain traces of two further series , which norman termed '' softened stops '' due to their reflexes in some varieties most min vocabulary corresponds directly to cognates in other chinese varieties , but there is also a significant number of distinctively min words that may be traced back to proto-min given that min combines the chinese of several different periods and contains some non-chinese substrate vocabulary , an author literate in mandarin ( or even classical chinese ) may have trouble finding the appropriate chinese characters for some min vocabulary

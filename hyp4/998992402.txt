archimedes lived in the 3rd century bc and wrote his proofs as letters in doric greek addressed to contemporaries , including scholars at the great library of alexandria these letters were first compiled into a comprehensive text by isidorus of miletus , the architect of the hagia sophia patriarchal church , sometime around 530 ad in the then byzantine greek capital city of constantinople there , in 1229 , the archimedes codex was unbound , scraped and washed , along with at least six other partial parchment manuscripts , including one with works of hypereides the palimpsest remained near jerusalem through at least the 16th century at the isolated greek orthodox monastery of mar saba at some point before 1840 the palimpsest was brought back by the greek orthodox patriarchate of jerusalem to its library ( the metochion of the holy sepulcher ) in constantinople the biblical scholar constantin von tischendorf visited constantinople in the 1840s , and , intrigued by the greek mathematics visible on the palimpsest he found in a greek orthodox library , removed a leaf of it ( which is now in the cambridge university library ) in 1899 the greek scholar papadopoulos-kerameus produced a catalog of the library 's manuscripts and included a transcription of several lines of the partially visible underlying text upon seeing these lines johan heiberg , the world 's authority on archimedes , realized that the work was by archimedes when heiberg studied the palimpsest in constantinople in 1906 , he confirmed that the palimpsest included works by archimedes thought to have been lost heiberg was permitted by the greek orthodox church to take careful photographs of the palimpsest 's pages , and from these he produced transcriptions , published between 1910 and 1915 in a complete works of archimedes shortly thereafter archimedes ' greek text was translated into english by t the manuscript was still in the greek orthodox patriarchate of jerusalem 's library ( the metochion of the holy sepulchre ) in constantinople in 1920 sometime between 1923 and 1930 the palimpsest was acquired by marie louis sirieix , a '' businessman and traveler to the orient who lived in paris stored secretly for years by sirieix in his cellar , the palimpsest suffered damage from water and mold in addition , after disappearing from the greek orthodox patriarchate 's library , a forger added copies of medieval evangelical portraits in gold leaf onto four pages in the book in order to increase its sales value , further damaging the text unable to sell it privately , in 1998 she finally turned to christie 's to sell it in a public auction , risking an ownership dispute the ownership of the palimpsest was immediately contested in federal court in new york in the case of the greek orthodox patriarchate of jerusalem v the greek church contended that the palimpsest had been stolen from its library in constantinople in the 1920s during a period of extreme persecution sometime after 1938 , a forger placed four byzantine art religious images in the manuscript in an effort to increase its sales value '' in april 2007 , it was announced that a new text had been found in the palimpsest , which was a commentary on aristotle 's categories running to some 9 & nbsp ; 000 words , '' fragments of hyperides ’ against diondas from the archimedes palimpsest '' , '' inhaltsverzeichnis '' , zeitschrift für papyrologie und epigraphik , vol but there are two essential differences between archimedes ' method and 19th-century methods : archimedes did not know about differentiation , so he could not calculate any integrals other than those that came from center-of-mass considerations , by symmetry reviel netz of stanford university has argued that archimedes discussed the number of ways to solve the puzzle , that is , to put the pieces back into their box either archimedes used the suter board , the pieces of which were allowed to be turned over , or the statistics of the suter board are irrelevant .

there , in 1229 , the archimedes codex was unbound , scraped and washed , along with at least six other partial parchment manuscripts , including one with works of hypereides their leaves were folded in half , rebound and reused for a christian liturgical text of 177 later numbered leaves , of which 174 are extant ( each older folded leaf became two leaves of the liturgical book ) the palimpsest remained near jerusalem through at least the 16th century at the isolated greek orthodox monastery of mar saba at some point before 1840 the palimpsest was brought back by the greek orthodox patriarchate of jerusalem to its library ( the metochion of the holy sepulcher ) in constantinople the biblical scholar constantin von tischendorf visited constantinople in the 1840s , and , intrigued by the greek mathematics visible on the palimpsest he found in a greek orthodox library , removed a leaf of it ( which is now in the cambridge university library ) in 1899 the greek scholar papadopoulos-kerameus produced a catalog of the library 's manuscripts and included a transcription of several lines of the partially visible underlying text upon seeing these lines johan heiberg , the world 's authority on archimedes , realized that the work was by archimedes when heiberg studied the palimpsest in constantinople in 1906 , he confirmed that the palimpsest included works by archimedes thought to have been lost heiberg was permitted by the greek orthodox church to take careful photographs of the palimpsest 's pages , and from these he produced transcriptions , published between 1910 and 1915 in a complete works of archimedes shortly thereafter archimedes ' greek text was translated into english by t the manuscript was still in the greek orthodox patriarchate of jerusalem 's library ( the metochion of the holy sepulchre ) in constantinople in 1920 '' though sirieix claimed to have bought the manuscript from a monk , who would not in any case have had the authority to sell it , sirieix had no receipt or documentation for a sale of the valuable manuscript sirieix died in 1956 , and in 1970 his daughter began attempting quietly to sell the valuable manuscript unable to sell it privately , in 1998 she finally turned to christie 's to sell it in a public auction , risking an ownership dispute the greek church contended that the palimpsest had been stolen from its library in constantinople in the 1920s during a period of extreme persecution judge kimba wood decided in favor of christie 's auction house on laches grounds , and the palimpsest was bought for 2 million by an anonymous american buyer reviel netz of stanford university and nigel wilson have produced a diplomatic transcription of the text , filling in gaps in heiberg 's account with these images the archimedes palimpsest , vol '' in april 2007 , it was announced that a new text had been found in the palimpsest , which was a commentary on aristotle 's categories running to some 9 & nbsp ; 000 words he compared the area or volume of a figure of which he knew the total mass and center of mass with the area or volume of another figure he did not know anything about but the center of mass of one figure is known , and the total mass can be placed at this center and it still balances while he had a notion of linearity , to find the volume of a sphere he had to balance two figures at the same time ; he never figured out how to change variables or integrate by parts the codex board can be found as an extension of socrates ' argument in a seven-by-seven-square grid , suggesting an iterative construction of the side-diameter numbers that give rational approximations to the square root of two but it would certainly add to the mystery had archimedes used the suter board in preference to the codex board

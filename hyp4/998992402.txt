archimedes lived in the 3rd century bc and wrote his proofs as letters in doric greek addressed to contemporaries , including scholars at the great library of alexandria these letters were first compiled into a comprehensive text by isidorus of miletus , the architect of the hagia sophia patriarchal church , sometime around 530 ad in the then byzantine greek capital city of constantinople a copy of isidorus ' edition of archimedes was made around 950 ad by an anonymous scribe , again in the byzantine empire , in a period during which the study of archimedes flourished in constantinople in a school founded by the mathematician , engineer , and former greek orthodox archbishop of thessaloniki , leo the geometer , a cousin to the patriarch this medieval byzantine manuscript then traveled from constantinople to jerusalem , likely sometime after the fourth crusade in 1204 there , in 1229 , the archimedes codex was unbound , scraped and washed , along with at least six other partial parchment manuscripts , including one with works of hypereides the palimpsest remained near jerusalem through at least the 16th century at the isolated greek orthodox monastery of mar saba at some point before 1840 the palimpsest was brought back by the greek orthodox patriarchate of jerusalem to its library ( the metochion of the holy sepulcher ) in constantinople the biblical scholar constantin von tischendorf visited constantinople in the 1840s , and , intrigued by the greek mathematics visible on the palimpsest he found in a greek orthodox library , removed a leaf of it ( which is now in the cambridge university library ) in 1899 the greek scholar papadopoulos-kerameus produced a catalog of the library 's manuscripts and included a transcription of several lines of the partially visible underlying text when heiberg studied the palimpsest in constantinople in 1906 , he confirmed that the palimpsest included works by archimedes thought to have been lost heiberg was permitted by the greek orthodox church to take careful photographs of the palimpsest 's pages , and from these he produced transcriptions , published between 1910 and 1915 in a complete works of archimedes shortly thereafter archimedes ' greek text was translated into english by t the manuscript was still in the greek orthodox patriarchate of jerusalem 's library ( the metochion of the holy sepulchre ) in constantinople in 1920 shortly thereafter , during a turbulent period for the greek community in turkey that saw a turkish victory in the greco-turkish war ( 1919â€“22 ) along with the greek genocide and the forced population exchange between greece and turkey , the palimpsest disappeared from the greek church 's library in istanbul in addition , after disappearing from the greek orthodox patriarchate 's library , a forger added copies of medieval evangelical portraits in gold leaf onto four pages in the book in order to increase its sales value , further damaging the text the ownership of the palimpsest was immediately contested in federal court in new york in the case of the greek orthodox patriarchate of jerusalem v sometime after 1938 , a forger placed four byzantine art religious images in the manuscript in an effort to increase its sales value the transcriptions of the book were digitally encoded using the text encoding initiative guidelines , and metadata for the images and transcriptions included identification and cataloging information based on dublin core metadata elements on october 29 , 2008 , ( the tenth anniversary of the purchase of the palimpsest at auction ) all data , including images and transcriptions , were hosted on the digital palimpsest web page for free use under a creative commons license , the digital archimedes palimpsest released , dot porter , the stoa consortium , october 29 , 2008 in 2015 , in an experiment into the preservation of digital data , swiss scientists encoded text from the archimedes palimpsest into dna in his other works , archimedes often proves the equality of two areas or volumes with eudoxus ' method of exhaustion , an ancient greek counterpart of the modern method of limits he viewed plane figures as made out of infinitely many lines as in the later method of indivisibles , and balanced each line , or slice , of one figure against a corresponding slice of the second figure on a lever for the codex board ( again as with tangram ) there are three ways to pack the pieces : as two unit squares side by side ; as two unit squares one on top of the other ; and as a single square of side the square root of two either archimedes used the suter board , the pieces of which were allowed to be turned over , or the statistics of the suter board are irrelevant .

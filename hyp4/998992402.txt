archimedes lived in the 3rd century bc and wrote his proofs as letters in doric greek addressed to contemporaries , including scholars at the great library of alexandria these letters were first compiled into a comprehensive text by isidorus of miletus , the architect of the hagia sophia patriarchal church , sometime around 530 ad in the then byzantine greek capital city of constantinople a copy of isidorus ' edition of archimedes was made around 950 ad by an anonymous scribe , again in the byzantine empire , in a period during which the study of archimedes flourished in constantinople in a school founded by the mathematician , engineer , and former greek orthodox archbishop of thessaloniki , leo the geometer , a cousin to the patriarch this medieval byzantine manuscript then traveled from constantinople to jerusalem , likely sometime after the fourth crusade in 1204 there , in 1229 , the archimedes codex was unbound , scraped and washed , along with at least six other partial parchment manuscripts , including one with works of hypereides their leaves were folded in half , rebound and reused for a christian liturgical text of 177 later numbered leaves , of which 174 are extant ( each older folded leaf became two leaves of the liturgical book ) the palimpsest remained near jerusalem through at least the 16th century at the isolated greek orthodox monastery of mar saba at some point before 1840 the palimpsest was brought back by the greek orthodox patriarchate of jerusalem to its library ( the metochion of the holy sepulcher ) in constantinople the biblical scholar constantin von tischendorf visited constantinople in the 1840s , and , intrigued by the greek mathematics visible on the palimpsest he found in a greek orthodox library , removed a leaf of it ( which is now in the cambridge university library ) in 1899 the greek scholar papadopoulos-kerameus produced a catalog of the library 's manuscripts and included a transcription of several lines of the partially visible underlying text when heiberg studied the palimpsest in constantinople in 1906 , he confirmed that the palimpsest included works by archimedes thought to have been lost heiberg was permitted by the greek orthodox church to take careful photographs of the palimpsest 's pages , and from these he produced transcriptions , published between 1910 and 1915 in a complete works of archimedes the manuscript was still in the greek orthodox patriarchate of jerusalem 's library ( the metochion of the holy sepulchre ) in constantinople in 1920 shortly thereafter , during a turbulent period for the greek community in turkey that saw a turkish victory in the greco-turkish war ( 1919–22 ) along with the greek genocide and the forced population exchange between greece and turkey , the palimpsest disappeared from the greek church 's library in istanbul sometime between 1923 and 1930 the palimpsest was acquired by marie louis sirieix , a '' businessman and traveler to the orient who lived in paris '' though sirieix claimed to have bought the manuscript from a monk , who would not in any case have had the authority to sell it , sirieix had no receipt or documentation for a sale of the valuable manuscript the ownership of the palimpsest was immediately contested in federal court in new york in the case of the greek orthodox patriarchate of jerusalem v reviel netz of stanford university and nigel wilson have produced a diplomatic transcription of the text , filling in gaps in heiberg 's account with these images the resulting light beam has characteristics that make it ideal for revealing the intricate architecture and utility of many kinds of matter—in this case , the previously hidden work of one of the founding fathers of all science '' in april 2007 , it was announced that a new text had been found in the palimpsest , which was a commentary on aristotle 's categories running to some 9 & nbsp ; 000 words '' this referred to the previous discovery of a text by hypereides , an athenian politician from the fourth century bc , which has also been found within the palimpsest in 2015 , in an experiment into the preservation of digital data , swiss scientists encoded text from the archimedes palimpsest into dna this involved approximating the figure whose area he wanted to compute into sections of known area , which provide upper and lower bounds for the area of the figure either archimedes used the suter board , the pieces of which were allowed to be turned over , or the statistics of the suter board are irrelevant .

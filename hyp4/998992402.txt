archimedes lived in the 3rd century bc and wrote his proofs as letters in doric greek addressed to contemporaries , including scholars at the great library of alexandria these letters were first compiled into a comprehensive text by isidorus of miletus , the architect of the hagia sophia patriarchal church , sometime around 530 ad in the then byzantine greek capital city of constantinople a copy of isidorus ' edition of archimedes was made around 950 ad by an anonymous scribe , again in the byzantine empire , in a period during which the study of archimedes flourished in constantinople in a school founded by the mathematician , engineer , and former greek orthodox archbishop of thessaloniki , leo the geometer , a cousin to the patriarch this medieval byzantine manuscript then traveled from constantinople to jerusalem , likely sometime after the fourth crusade in 1204 there , in 1229 , the archimedes codex was unbound , scraped and washed , along with at least six other partial parchment manuscripts , including one with works of hypereides their leaves were folded in half , rebound and reused for a christian liturgical text of 177 later numbered leaves , of which 174 are extant ( each older folded leaf became two leaves of the liturgical book ) the palimpsest remained near jerusalem through at least the 16th century at the isolated greek orthodox monastery of mar saba at some point before 1840 the palimpsest was brought back by the greek orthodox patriarchate of jerusalem to its library ( the metochion of the holy sepulcher ) in constantinople the biblical scholar constantin von tischendorf visited constantinople in the 1840s , and , intrigued by the greek mathematics visible on the palimpsest he found in a greek orthodox library , removed a leaf of it ( which is now in the cambridge university library ) in 1899 the greek scholar papadopoulos-kerameus produced a catalog of the library 's manuscripts and included a transcription of several lines of the partially visible underlying text upon seeing these lines johan heiberg , the world 's authority on archimedes , realized that the work was by archimedes when heiberg studied the palimpsest in constantinople in 1906 , he confirmed that the palimpsest included works by archimedes thought to have been lost heiberg was permitted by the greek orthodox church to take careful photographs of the palimpsest 's pages , and from these he produced transcriptions , published between 1910 and 1915 in a complete works of archimedes shortly thereafter archimedes ' greek text was translated into english by t the manuscript was still in the greek orthodox patriarchate of jerusalem 's library ( the metochion of the holy sepulchre ) in constantinople in 1920 shortly thereafter , during a turbulent period for the greek community in turkey that saw a turkish victory in the greco-turkish war ( 1919â€“22 ) along with the greek genocide and the forced population exchange between greece and turkey , the palimpsest disappeared from the greek church 's library in istanbul in addition , after disappearing from the greek orthodox patriarchate 's library , a forger added copies of medieval evangelical portraits in gold leaf onto four pages in the book in order to increase its sales value , further damaging the text the greek church contended that the palimpsest had been stolen from its library in constantinople in the 1920s during a period of extreme persecution judge kimba wood decided in favor of christie 's auction house on laches grounds , and the palimpsest was bought for 2 million by an anonymous american buyer reviel netz of stanford university and nigel wilson have produced a diplomatic transcription of the text , filling in gaps in heiberg 's account with these images sometime after 1938 , a forger placed four byzantine art religious images in the manuscript in an effort to increase its sales value '' this referred to the previous discovery of a text by hypereides , an athenian politician from the fourth century bc , which has also been found within the palimpsest but there are two essential differences between archimedes ' method and 19th-century methods : archimedes did not know about differentiation , so he could not calculate any integrals other than those that came from center-of-mass considerations , by symmetry however , if netz is right , this may have been the most sophisticated work in the field of combinatorics in greek antiquity

after apple removed steve jobs from management in 1985 , he left the company and attempted to create the '' next big thing '' , with funding from ross perot and himself it also supported the innovative enterprise objects framework database access layer and webobjects application server development environment , among other notable features all but abandoning the idea of an operating system , next managed to maintain a business selling webobjects and consulting services , but was never a commercial success nextstep underwent an evolution into openstep which separated the object layers from the operating system below , allowing it to run with less modification on other platforms ( some of these efforts , such as taligent , did not fully come to fruition ; others , like java , gained widespread adoption ) on february 4 , 1997 , apple computer acquired next for 427 million , and used openstep as the basis for mac os x , as it was called at the time the decade-old classic mac os had reached the limits of its single-user , co-operative multitasking architecture , and its once-innovative user interface was looking increasingly outdated a massive development effort to replace it , known as copland , was started in 1994 , but was generally perceived outside apple to be a hopeless case due to political infighting and conflicting goals after considering the purchase of beos — a multimedia-enabled , multi-tasking os designed for hardware similar to apple 's , the company decided instead to acquire next and use openstep as the basis for their new os apple expected that developers would port their software to the considerably more powerful openstep libraries once they learned of its power and flexibility apple 's financial losses continued and the board of directors lost confidence in ceo gil amelio , asking him to resign the board asked steve jobs to lead the company on an interim basis , essentially giving him carte blanche to make changes to return the company to profitability mac os applications could be ported to carbon without the need for a complete re-write , making them operate as native applications on the new operating system during this time , the lower layers of the operating system ( the mach kernel and the bsd layers on top of it a practical guide to llinux commands , editors , and shell programming , 3rd edition by mark g sobell , page 2 ) were re-packaged and released under the apple public source license the first release of the new os — mac os x server 1.0 — used a modified version of the mac os gui , but all client versions starting with mac os x developer preview 3 used a new theme known as aqua aqua was a substantial departure from the mac os 9 interface , which had evolved with little change from that of the original macintosh operating system : it incorporated full color scalable graphics , anti-aliasing of text and graphics , simulated shading and highlights , transparency and shadows , and animation with the exception of mac os x server 1.0 and the original public beta , the first several macos versions were named after big cats on september 13 , 2000 , apple released a 29.95 '' preview '' version of mac os x ( internally codenamed kodiak ) in order to gain feedback from users on march 24 , 2001 , apple released mac os x 10.0 ( internally codenamed cheetah ) for instance , a q & a was created in 2005 which mentions it the initial version was slow , incomplete , and had very few applications available at the time of its launch , mostly from independent developers while many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption , they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve mac os x 10.1 ( internally codenamed puma ) was released on september 25 , 2001 apple released a upgrade cd for mac os 9 on january 7 , 2002 , apple announced that mac os x was to be the default operating system for all macintosh products by the end of that month among the new features , tiger introduced spotlight , dashboard , smart folders , updated mail program with smart mailboxes , quicktime 7 , safari 2 , automator , voiceover , core image and core video the initial release of the apple tv used a modified version of tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services on january 10 , 2006 , apple released the first intel-based macs along with the 10.4.4 update to tiger mac os x leopard was released on october 26 , 2007 it was called by apple '' the largest update of mac os x '' notification center , which makes its debut in mountain lion , is a desktop version similar to the one in ios 5.0 and higher it is the first version named under apple 's then-new theme of places in california , dubbed mavericks after the surfing location apple described this release as containing '' refinements to the mac experience '' and '' improvements to system performance '' rather than new features the major version number is changed , for the first time since '' mac os x '' was released , making it macos 11

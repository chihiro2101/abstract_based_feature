however , the company 's object-oriented operating system nextstep had a more lasting legacy all but abandoning the idea of an operating system , next managed to maintain a business selling webobjects and consulting services , but was never a commercial success nextstep underwent an evolution into openstep which separated the object layers from the operating system below , allowing it to run with less modification on other platforms ) on february 4 , 1997 , apple computer acquired next for 427 million , and used openstep as the basis for mac os x , as it was called at the time the decade-old classic mac os had reached the limits of its single-user , co-operative multitasking architecture , and its once-innovative user interface was looking increasingly outdated after considering the purchase of beos — a multimedia-enabled , multi-tasking os designed for hardware similar to apple 's , the company decided instead to acquire next and use openstep as the basis for their new os at first , the plan was to develop a new operating system based almost entirely on an updated version of openstep , with the addition of a virtual machine subsystem — known as the blue box — for running '' classic '' macintosh applications instead , several major developers such as adobe told apple that this would never occur , and that they would rather leave the platform entirely apple 's financial losses continued and the board of directors lost confidence in ceo gil amelio , asking him to resign when jobs announced at the world wide developer 's conference that what developers really wanted was a modern version of the mac os , and apple was going to deliver it , he was met with thunderous applause mac os applications could be ported to carbon without the need for a complete re-write , making them operate as native applications on the new operating system during this period , the java programming language had increased in popularity , and an effort was started to improve mac java support the first release of the new os — mac os x server 1.0 — used a modified version of the mac os gui , but all client versions starting with mac os x developer preview 3 used a new theme known as aqua aqua was a substantial departure from the mac os 9 interface , which had evolved with little change from that of the original macintosh operating system : it incorporated full color scalable graphics , anti-aliasing of text and graphics , simulated shading and highlights , transparency and shadows , and animation with the exception of mac os x server 1.0 and the original public beta , the first several macos versions were named after big cats after the code name '' jaguar '' for version 10.2 received publicity in the media , apple began openly using the names to promote the operating system : 10.3 was marketed as '' panther '' , 10.4 as '' tiger '' , 10.5 as '' leopard '' , 10.6 as '' snow leopard '' , 10.7 as '' lion '' , and 10.8 as '' mountain lion '' ) ; and macos high sierra is named for the area around the high sierra camps simply releasing mac os x was received by the macintosh community as a great accomplishment , for attempts to completely overhaul the mac os had been underway since 1996 , and delayed by countless setbacks following some bug fixes , kernel panics became much less frequent mac os x 10.1 ( internally codenamed puma ) was released on september 25 , 2001 apple released a upgrade cd for mac os 9 on january 7 , 2002 , apple announced that mac os x was to be the default operating system for all macintosh products by the end of that month mac os x panther was released on october 24 , 2003 in addition to providing much improved performance , it also incorporated the most extensive update yet to the user interface the initial release of the apple tv used a modified version of tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services this operating system functioned identically on the powerpc-based macs and the new intel-based machines , with the exception of the intel release dropping support for the classic environment mac os x leopard was released on october 26 , 2007 mac os x snow leopard was released on august 28 , 2009 , the last version to be available on disc rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of , the development of snow leopard was deliberately focused on '' under the hood '' changes , increasing the performance , efficiency , and stability of the operating system an update introduced support for the mac app store , apple 's digital distribution platform for macos applications and subsequent macos upgrades mac os x lion was released on july 20 , 2011 os x mavericks was released on october 22 , 2013 , as a free update through the mac app store worldwide the major version number is changed , for the first time since '' mac os x '' was released , making it macos 11

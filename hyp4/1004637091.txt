after apple removed steve jobs from management in 1985 , he left the company and attempted to create the '' next big thing '' , with funding from ross perot and himself nextstep was based on the mach kernel developed at cmu ( carnegie mellon university ) a practical guide to linux commands , editors , and shell programming , 3rd edition , by mark g this environment is known today in the mac world as cocoa it also supported the innovative enterprise objects framework database access layer and webobjects application server development environment , among other notable features nextstep underwent an evolution into openstep which separated the object layers from the operating system below , allowing it to run with less modification on other platforms ( some of these efforts , such as taligent , did not fully come to fruition ; others , like java , gained widespread adoption ) on february 4 , 1997 , apple computer acquired next for 427 million , and used openstep as the basis for mac os x , as it was called at the time traces of the next software heritage can still be seen in macos the decade-old classic mac os had reached the limits of its single-user , co-operative multitasking architecture , and its once-innovative user interface was looking increasingly outdated after considering the purchase of beos — a multimedia-enabled , multi-tasking os designed for hardware similar to apple 's , the company decided instead to acquire next and use openstep as the basis for their new os avie tevanian took over os development , and steve jobs was brought on as a consultant at first , the plan was to develop a new operating system based almost entirely on an updated version of openstep , with the addition of a virtual machine subsystem — known as the blue box — for running '' classic '' macintosh applications apple expected that developers would port their software to the considerably more powerful openstep libraries once they learned of its power and flexibility instead , several major developers such as adobe told apple that this would never occur , and that they would rather leave the platform entirely this '' rejection '' of apple 's plan was largely the result of a string of previous broken promises from apple ; after watching one '' next os '' after another disappear and apple 's market share dwindle , developers were not interested in doing much work on the platform at all , let alone a re-write when jobs announced at the world wide developer 's conference that what developers really wanted was a modern version of the mac os , and apple was going to deliver it , he was met with thunderous applause mac os applications could be ported to carbon without the need for a complete re-write , making them operate as native applications on the new operating system meanwhile , applications written using the older toolkits would be supported using the '' classic '' mac os 9 environment support for c , c++ , objective-c , java , and python were added , furthering developer comfort with the new platform sobell , page 2 ) were re-packaged and released under the apple public source license the darwin kernel provides a stable and flexible operating system , which takes advantage of the contributions of programmers and independent open-source projects outside apple ; however , it sees little use outside the macintosh community the first release of the new os — mac os x server 1.0 — used a modified version of the mac os gui , but all client versions starting with mac os x developer preview 3 used a new theme known as aqua aqua was a substantial departure from the mac os 9 interface , which had evolved with little change from that of the original macintosh operating system : it incorporated full color scalable graphics , anti-aliasing of text and graphics , simulated shading and highlights , transparency and shadows , and animation despite this , mac os x maintained a substantial degree of consistency with the traditional mac os interface and apple 's own apple human interface guidelines , with its pull-down menu at the top of the screen , familiar keyboard shortcuts , and support for a single-button mouse with the exception of mac os x server 1.0 and the original public beta , the first several macos versions were named after big cats after the code name '' jaguar '' for version 10.2 received publicity in the media , apple began openly using the names to promote the operating system : 10.3 was marketed as '' panther '' , 10.4 as '' tiger '' , 10.5 as '' leopard '' , 10.6 as '' snow leopard '' , 10.7 as '' lion '' , and 10.8 as '' mountain lion '' although the version is now called cheetah by users , rare evidences can be found to prove that it was called so internally for instance , a q & a was created in 2005 which mentions it the initial version was slow , incomplete , and had very few applications available at the time of its launch , mostly from independent developers on january 7 , 2002 , apple announced that mac os x was to be the default operating system for all macintosh products by the end of that month mac os x snow leopard was released on august 28 , 2009 , the last version to be available on disc an update introduced support for the mac app store , apple 's digital distribution platform for macos applications and subsequent macos upgrades it is the first version named under apple 's then-new theme of places in california , dubbed mavericks after the surfing location os x yosemite was released to the general public on october 16 , 2014 , as a free update through the mac app store worldwide the major version number is changed , for the first time since '' mac os x '' was released , making it macos 11

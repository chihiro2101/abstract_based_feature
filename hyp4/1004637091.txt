after apple removed steve jobs from management in 1985 , he left the company and attempted to create the '' next big thing '' , with funding from ross perot and himself the hardware was phased out in 1993 ; however , the company 's object-oriented operating system nextstep had a more lasting legacy nextstep was based on the mach kernel developed at cmu ( carnegie mellon university ) a practical guide to linux commands , editors , and shell programming , 3rd edition , by mark g this environment is known today in the mac world as cocoa it also supported the innovative enterprise objects framework database access layer and webobjects application server development environment , among other notable features all but abandoning the idea of an operating system , next managed to maintain a business selling webobjects and consulting services , but was never a commercial success nextstep underwent an evolution into openstep which separated the object layers from the operating system below , allowing it to run with less modification on other platforms ) on february 4 , 1997 , apple computer acquired next for 427 million , and used openstep as the basis for mac os x , as it was called at the time for example , in the cocoa development environment , the objective-c library classes have '' ns '' prefixes , and the history section of the manual page for the defaults command in macos straightforwardly states that the command '' first appeared in nextstep a massive development effort to replace it , known as copland , was started in 1994 , but was generally perceived outside apple to be a hopeless case due to political infighting and conflicting goals some elements of copland were incorporated into mac os 8 , released on july 26 , 1997 after considering the purchase of beos — a multimedia-enabled , multi-tasking os designed for hardware similar to apple 's , the company decided instead to acquire next and use openstep as the basis for their new os apple expected that developers would port their software to the considerably more powerful openstep libraries once they learned of its power and flexibility apple 's financial losses continued and the board of directors lost confidence in ceo gil amelio , asking him to resign the board asked steve jobs to lead the company on an interim basis , essentially giving him carte blanche to make changes to return the company to profitability when jobs announced at the world wide developer 's conference that what developers really wanted was a modern version of the mac os , and apple was going to deliver it , he was met with thunderous applause mac os applications could be ported to carbon without the need for a complete re-write , making them operate as native applications on the new operating system the darwin kernel provides a stable and flexible operating system , which takes advantage of the contributions of programmers and independent open-source projects outside apple ; however , it sees little use outside the macintosh community the first release of the new os — mac os x server 1.0 — used a modified version of the mac os gui , but all client versions starting with mac os x developer preview 3 used a new theme known as aqua aqua was a substantial departure from the mac os 9 interface , which had evolved with little change from that of the original macintosh operating system : it incorporated full color scalable graphics , anti-aliasing of text and graphics , simulated shading and highlights , transparency and shadows , and animation despite this , mac os x maintained a substantial degree of consistency with the traditional mac os interface and apple 's own apple human interface guidelines , with its pull-down menu at the top of the screen , familiar keyboard shortcuts , and support for a single-button mouse with the exception of mac os x server 1.0 and the original public beta , the first several macos versions were named after big cats after the code name '' jaguar '' for version 10.2 received publicity in the media , apple began openly using the names to promote the operating system : 10.3 was marketed as '' panther '' , 10.4 as '' tiger '' , 10.5 as '' leopard '' , 10.6 as '' snow leopard '' , 10.7 as '' lion '' , and 10.8 as '' mountain lion '' on september 13 , 2000 , apple released a 29.95 '' preview '' version of mac os x ( internally codenamed kodiak ) in order to gain feedback from users it marked the first public availability of the aqua interface , and apple made many changes to the ui based on customer feedback mac os x public beta expired and ceased to function in spring 2001 for instance , a q & a was created in 2005 which mentions it the initial version was slow , incomplete , and had very few applications available at the time of its launch , mostly from independent developers simply releasing mac os x was received by the macintosh community as a great accomplishment , for attempts to completely overhaul the mac os had been underway since 1996 , and delayed by countless setbacks the happy mac which had appeared during the mac os startup sequence for almost 18 years was replaced with a large grey apple logo with the introduction of mac os x 10.2 mac os x tiger was released on april 29 , 2005 the initial release of the apple tv used a modified version of tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services mac os x lion was released on july 20 , 2011 os x yosemite was released to the general public on october 16 , 2014 , as a free update through the mac app store worldwide the major version number is changed , for the first time since '' mac os x '' was released , making it macos 11

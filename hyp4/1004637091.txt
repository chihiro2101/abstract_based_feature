after apple removed steve jobs from management in 1985 , he left the company and attempted to create the '' next big thing '' , with funding from ross perot and himself the hardware was phased out in 1993 ; however , the company 's object-oriented operating system nextstep had a more lasting legacy it also supported the innovative enterprise objects framework database access layer and webobjects application server development environment , among other notable features nextstep underwent an evolution into openstep which separated the object layers from the operating system below , allowing it to run with less modification on other platforms however , by this point , a number of other companies — notably apple , ibm , microsoft , and even sun itself — were claiming they would soon be releasing similar object-oriented operating systems and development tools of their own ( some of these efforts , such as taligent , did not fully come to fruition ; others , like java , gained widespread adoption ) on february 4 , 1997 , apple computer acquired next for 427 million , and used openstep as the basis for mac os x , as it was called at the time for example , in the cocoa development environment , the objective-c library classes have '' ns '' prefixes , and the history section of the manual page for the defaults command in macos straightforwardly states that the command '' first appeared in nextstep the decade-old classic mac os had reached the limits of its single-user , co-operative multitasking architecture , and its once-innovative user interface was looking increasingly outdated some elements of copland were incorporated into mac os 8 , released on july 26 , 1997 after considering the purchase of beos — a multimedia-enabled , multi-tasking os designed for hardware similar to apple 's , the company decided instead to acquire next and use openstep as the basis for their new os avie tevanian took over os development , and steve jobs was brought on as a consultant apple 's financial losses continued and the board of directors lost confidence in ceo gil amelio , asking him to resign the board asked steve jobs to lead the company on an interim basis , essentially giving him carte blanche to make changes to return the company to profitability when jobs announced at the world wide developer 's conference that what developers really wanted was a modern version of the mac os , and apple was going to deliver it , he was met with thunderous applause meanwhile , applications written using the older toolkits would be supported using the '' classic '' mac os 9 environment support for c , c++ , objective-c , java , and python were added , furthering developer comfort with the new platform during this period , the java programming language had increased in popularity , and an effort was started to improve mac java support this consisted of porting a high-speed java virtual machine to the platform , and exposing macos-specific '' cocoa '' apis to the java language the first release of the new os — mac os x server 1.0 — used a modified version of the mac os gui , but all client versions starting with mac os x developer preview 3 used a new theme known as aqua with the exception of mac os x server 1.0 and the original public beta , the first several macos versions were named after big cats prior to its release , version 10.0 was code named '' cheetah '' internally at apple , and version 10.1 was code named internally as '' puma '' '' panther '' , '' tiger '' , and '' leopard '' were registered as trademarks , and apple registered '' lynx '' and '' cougar '' , but these were allowed to lapse , trademark 78257226 for panther , 78269988 for tiger , 78270003 for leopard , 78271630 for cougar and 78271639 for lynx , all registered in 2004 by apple computer , inc mac os x public beta expired and ceased to function in spring 2001 on march 24 , 2001 , apple released mac os x 10.0 ( internally codenamed cheetah ) for instance , a q & a was created in 2005 which mentions it the initial version was slow , incomplete , and had very few applications available at the time of its launch , mostly from independent developers while many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption , they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve apple released a upgrade cd for mac os 9 on august 23 , 2002 , apple followed up with mac os x 10.2 jaguar , the first release to use its code name as part of the branding an update introduced support for the mac app store , apple 's digital distribution platform for macos applications and subsequent macos upgrades it brought developments made in apple 's ios , such as an easily navigable display of installed applications ( launchpad ) and ( a greater use of ) multi-touch gestures , to the mac os x yosemite was released to the general public on october 16 , 2014 , as a free update through the mac app store worldwide it was made available as a public beta in july and was made available publicly on september 30 , 2015 the major version number is changed , for the first time since '' mac os x '' was released , making it macos 11

the christian coalition had been promoted by pope pius v to rescue the venetian colony of famagusta on the island of cyprus , which siege of famagusta by the turks in early 1571 subsequent to the fall of nicosia and other venetian possessions in cyprus in the course of 1570 on 1 august the venetians had surrendered after being reassured that they could leave cyprus freely however , the ottoman commander , lala kara mustafa pasha , who had lost some 50,000 men in the siege , goffman ( 2002 ) , p on 17 august marco antonio bragadin was flayed alive and his corpse hung on mustafa 's galley together with the heads of the venetian commanders , astorre baglioni , alvise martinengo , and gianantonio querini the banner for the fleet , blessed by the pope , reached the kingdom of naples ( then ruled by the philip ii of spain ) on 14 august 1571 there , in the basilica of santa chiara , it was solemnly consigned to john of austria , who had been named the leader of the coalition after long discussions among the allies all members of the alliance viewed the ottoman navy as a significant threat , both to the security of maritime trade in the mediterranean sea and to the security of continental europe itself spain was the largest financial contributor , though the spaniards preferred to preserve most of their galleys for spain 's own wars against the nearby sultanates of the barbary coast rather than expend its naval strength for the benefit of venice the various christian contingents met the main force , that of venice ( under sebastiano venier , later doge of venice ) , in july and august 1571 at messina , sicily 1026 6,000 italian mercenaries in spanish pay , all good troops , in addition to 5,000 professional venetian soldiers 20 also , venetian oarsmen were mainly free citizens and able to bear arms , adding to the fighting power of their ships , whereas convicts were used to row many of the galleys in other holy league squadrons 222–25 free oarsmen were generally acknowledged to be superior but were gradually replaced in all galley fleets ( including those of venice from 1549 ) during the 16th century by cheaper slaves , convicts , and prisoners-of-war owing to rapidly rising costs the first regularly sanctioned use of convicts as oarsmen on venetian galleys did not occur until 1549 ismail uzuncarsili , osmanli devletenin merkez ve bahriye teskilati ( ankara , 1948 ) , p ali pasha , the ottoman admiral ( kapudan-i derya ) , supported by the corsairs mehmed siroco ( natively mehmed şuluk ) of alexandria and uluç ali , commanded an ottoman force of 222 war galleys , 56 galiot , and some smaller vessels the ottoman galleys were manned by 13,000 experienced sailors—generally drawn from the maritime nations of the ottoman empire—mainly berbers , greeks , syrians , and egyptians—and 34,000 soldiers 63 an advantage for the christians was the numerical superiority in guns and cannon aboard their ships , as well as the superior quality of the spanish infantry 87 – 88 the christians embarked with their much improved arquebusier and musketeer forces , while the ottomans trusted in their greatly feared composite bowmen the christian fleet started from messina on 16 september , crossing the adriatic and creeping along the coast , arriving at the group of rocky islets lying just north of the opening of the gulf of corinth on 6 october serious conflict had broken out between venetian and spanish soldiers , and venier enraged don juan by hanging a spanish soldier for impudence the right division to the south consisted of another 53 galleys under the genoese giovanni andrea doria , great-nephew of admiral andrea doria a reserve division was stationed behind ( that is , to the west of ) the main fleet , to lend support wherever it might be needed , commanded by álvaro de bazán the ottoman fleet consisted of 57 galleys and two galliots on its right under mehmed siroco , 61 galleys and 32 galliots in the centre under ali pasha in the sultana , and about 63 galleys and 30 galliots in the south offshore under uluç ali a small reserve consisted of eight galleys , 22 galliots , and 64 fustas , behind the centre body the wind was at first against the christians , and it was feared that the turks would be able to make contact before a line of battle could be formed but around noon , shortly before contact , the wind shifted to favour the christians , enabling most of the squadrons to reach their assigned position before contact around noon , first contact was made between the squadrons of barbarigo and sirocco , close to the northern shore of the gulf in the ensuing mêlée , the ships came so close to each other as to form an almost continuous platform of hand-to-hand fighting in which both leaders were killed the christian galley slaves freed from the turkish ships were supplied with arms and joined in the fighting , turning the battle in favour of the christian side when the real was nearly taken , colonna came alongside , with the bow of his galley , and mounted a counter-attack the entire crew of ali pasha 's flagship was killed , including ali pasha himself after two hours of fighting , the turks were beaten left and centre , although fighting continued for another two hours on the christian right , the situation was different , as doria continued sailing towards the south instead of taking his assigned position when doria had opened a wide gap with the christian centre , uluç ali swung around and fell on colonna 's southern flank , with doria too far away to interfere uluç ali was forced to retreat , escaping the battle with the captured flag of the knights of malta 222 in 1574 , the ottomans conquest of tunis ( 1574 ) from the spanish-supported hafsid dynasty , which had been re-installed after john of austria 's forces reconquered the city from the ottomans the year before bernhard jobin , mercklicher schiffstreit /und schlachtordnung beyder

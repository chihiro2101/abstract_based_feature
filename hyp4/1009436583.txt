galleys , confusing their battle array in the crucial moment of contact the christian galley slaves freed from the turkish ships were supplied with arms and joined in the fighting , turning the battle

, as doria continued sailing towards the south instead of taking his assigned position when doria had opened a wide gap with the christian centre , uluç ali swung around and fell on colonna 's southern flank , with doria too far away to interfere ali attacked a group of some fifteen galleys around the flagship of the knights of malta , threatening to break into the christian centre and

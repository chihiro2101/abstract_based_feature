the christian coalition had been promoted by pope pius v to rescue the venetian colony of famagusta on the island of cyprus , which siege of famagusta by the turks in early 1571 subsequent to the fall of nicosia and other venetian possessions in cyprus in the course of 1570 however , the ottoman commander , lala kara mustafa pasha , who had lost some 50,000 men in the siege , goffman ( 2002 ) , p on 17 august marco antonio bragadin was flayed alive and his corpse hung on mustafa 's galley together with the heads of the venetian commanders , astorre baglioni , alvise martinengo , and gianantonio querini the members of the holy league were the republic of venice , the spanish empire ( including the kingdom of naples , the habsburg monarchy , the kingdoms of sicily and sardinia as part of the spanish possessions ) , the papal states , the republic of genoa , the duchies of savoy , urbino and tuscany , the knights hospitaller , and others the banner for the fleet , blessed by the pope , reached the kingdom of naples ( then ruled by the philip ii of spain ) on 14 august 1571 there , in the basilica of santa chiara , it was solemnly consigned to john of austria , who had been named the leader of the coalition after long discussions among the allies the fleet moved to sicily and , leaving messina , reached ( after several stops ) the port of fiskardo in kefalonia , where news arrived of the fall of famagusta and of the torture inflicted by the turks on the venetian commander of the fortress , marco antonio bragadin all members of the alliance viewed the ottoman navy as a significant threat , both to the security of maritime trade in the mediterranean sea and to the security of continental europe itself spain was the largest financial contributor , though the spaniards preferred to preserve most of their galleys for spain 's own wars against the nearby sultanates of the barbary coast rather than expend its naval strength for the benefit of venice the combined christian fleet was placed under the command of john of austria ( don juan de austria ) with marcantonio colonna as his principal deputy deployment and order of battle 20 also , venetian oarsmen were mainly free citizens and able to bear arms , adding to the fighting power of their ships , whereas convicts were used to row many of the galleys in other holy league squadrons the first regularly sanctioned use of convicts as oarsmen on venetian galleys did not occur until 1549 482 , cites a squadron of 41 ottoman galleys in 1556 of which the flagship and two others were rowed by azabs , salaried volunteer light infantrymen , three were rowed by slaves and the remaining 36 were rowed by salaried mercenary greek oarsmen ali pasha , the ottoman admiral ( kapudan-i derya ) , supported by the corsairs mehmed siroco ( natively mehmed şuluk ) of alexandria and uluç ali , commanded an ottoman force of 222 war galleys , 56 galiot , and some smaller vessels the ottoman galleys were manned by 13,000 experienced sailors—generally drawn from the maritime nations of the ottoman empire—mainly berbers , greeks , syrians , and egyptians—and 34,000 soldiers 63 an advantage for the christians was the numerical superiority in guns and cannon aboard their ships , as well as the superior quality of the spanish infantry the christian fleet started from messina on 16 september , crossing the adriatic and creeping along the coast , arriving at the group of rocky islets lying just north of the opening of the gulf of corinth on 6 october a small reserve consisted of eight galleys , 22 galliots , and 64 fustas , behind the centre body the sacrament was administered to all , the galley slaves were freed from their chains , and the standard of the holy league was raised to the truck of the flagship the wind was at first against the christians , and it was feared that the turks would be able to make contact before a line of battle could be formed but around noon , shortly before contact , the wind shifted to favour the christians , enabling most of the squadrons to reach their assigned position before contact four galeasses stationed in front of the christian battle line opened fire at close quarters at the foremost turkish galleys , confusing their battle array in the crucial moment of contact the banner of the holy league was hoisted on the captured ship , breaking the morale of the turkish galleys nearby after two hours of fighting , the turks were beaten left and centre , although fighting continued for another two hours a flag taken at lepanto by the order of saint stephen , said to be the standard of the turkish commander , is still on display , in the church of the seat of the order in pisa on the christian right , the situation was different , as doria continued sailing towards the south instead of taking his assigned position he would explain his conduct after the battle by saying that he was trying to prevent an enveloping manoeuvre by the turkish left when doria had opened a wide gap with the christian centre , uluç ali swung around and fell on colonna 's southern flank , with doria too far away to interfere ali attacked a group of some fifteen galleys around the flagship of the knights of malta , threatening to break into the christian centre and still turn the tide of the battle uluç ali was forced to retreat , escaping the battle with the captured flag of the knights of malta it is said that at some point the janissaries ran out of weapons and started throwing oranges and lemons at their christian adversaries , leading to awkward scenes of laughter among the general misery of battle the arrival of the spanish squadron of 55 ships evened the numbers on both sides and opened the opportunity for a decisive blow , but friction among the christian leaders and the reluctance of don juan squandered the opportunity in 1573 , the holy league fleet failed to sail altogether ; instead , don juan attacked and took tunis , only for it to be retaken by the ottomans in 1574 in addition , the border between the two powers in dalmatia was modified by the turkish occupation of small but important parts of the hinterland that included the most fertile agricultural areas near the cities , with adverse effects on the economy of the venetian cities in dalmatia in 1576 , the ottomans assisted in abdul malik 's capture of fez – this reinforced the ottoman indirect conquests in morocco that had begun under suleiman the magnificent giovanni pietro contarini ’ s history of the events , which occurred from the beginning of the war brought against the venetians by selim the ottoman , to the day of the great and victorious battle against the turks was published in 1572 , a few months after lepanto the palmanova in italy originally called palma was built by the republic of venice on 7 october 1593 to commemorate the victory titian painted the battle in the background of an allegorical

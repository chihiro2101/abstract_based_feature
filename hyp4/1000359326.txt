in 1916 , in a world war i war effort context , the first concrete-paved runway was built in clermont-ferrand in france , allowing local company michelin to manufacture bréguet aviation military aircraft larger airports usually have several runways in different directions , so that one can be selected that is most nearly aligned with the wind airports with one runway are often constructed to be aligned with the prevailing wind compiling a wind rose is in fact one of the preliminary steps taken in constructing airport runways note that wind direction is given as the direction the wind is coming from : a plane taking off from runway 09 faces east , into an '' east wind '' blowing from 090° originally in the 1920s and 1930s , airports and air bases ( particularly in the united kingdom ) were built in a triangle-like pattern of three runways at 60° angles to each other as a result , three runways in a triangle-like pattern were built , and the runway with the heaviest traffic on it would eventually expand into an airport 's main runway , while the other two runways would be either abandoned or converted into taxiways for example bristol airport has only one runway—09/27 ( 9/27 ) —and two taxiways that form a ' v ' which may have been runways on the original 1930s raf lulsgate bottom airbase runways are named by a number between 01 and 36 , which is generally the magnetic azimuth of the runway 's heading in decadegrees a runway numbered 09 points east ( 90° ) , runway 18 is south ( 180° ) , runway 27 points west ( 270° ) and runway 36 points to the north ( 360° rather than 0° ) , '' runway 15 '' in one direction is '' runway 33 '' when used in the other a leading zero , for example in '' runway zero-six '' or '' runway zero-one-left '' , is included for all icao and some u.s & nbsp ; civil aviation airports drop the leading zero as required by faa regulation for example , runway & nbsp ; 05 at halifax will appear on the program as the single digit 5 rather than 05 these strips eschew the standard numerical naming convention and instead employ the runway 's full three digit heading ; examples include dobbins air reserve base 's runway 110/290and duke field 's runway 180/360 in some countries , regulations mandate that where parallel runways are too close to each other , only one may be used at a time under certain conditions ( usually adverse weather ) for example , in los angeles , this system results in runways 6l , 6r , 7l , and 7r , even though all four runways are actually parallel at approximately 69° at dallas/fort worth international airport , there are five parallel runways , named 17l , 17c , 17r , 18l , and 18r , all oriented at a heading of 175.4° faa ac 150/5200-35 runways that are numbered relative to true north rather than magnetic north will use the suffix t ; this is advantageous for certain airfields in the far north such as thule air base runway designations may change over time because earth 's magnetic lines slowly drift on the surface and the magnetic direction changes if on the other hand the original magnetic heading was 226° ( runway & nbsp ; 23 ) , and the heading decreased by only 2 & nbsp ; degrees to 224° , the runway becomes runway & nbsp ; 22 ; toda : takeoff distance available – the length of the takeoff run available plus the length of the clearway , if clearway is provided according to the federal aviation regulations and joint aviation requirements ( jar ) toda is the lesser of tora plus clearway or 1.5 times tora ) ; lda : landing distance available – the length of runway that is declared available and suitable for the ground run of an airplane landing the runway safety area is the cleared , smoothed and graded area around the paved runway there are runway markings and signs on most large runways runway end lights – a pair of four lights on each side of the runway on precision instrument runways , these lights extend along the full width of the runway runway centerline lighting system ( rcls ) – lights embedded into the surface of the runway at intervals along the runway centerline on some precision instrument runways types of runway safety incidents include : runway excursion – an incident involving only a single aircraft , where it makes an inappropriate exit from the runway ( e.g runway overrun ( also known as an overshoot ) – a type of excursion where the aircraft is unable to stop before the end of the runway ( e.g the boeing 747 is considered to have the longest takeoff distance of the more common aircraft types and has set the standard for runway lengths of larger international airports in india , recommendations of international civil aviation organization ( icao ) are now followed more often

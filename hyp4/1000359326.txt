in 1916 , in a world war i war effort context , the first concrete-paved runway was built in clermont-ferrand in france , allowing local company michelin to manufacture bréguet aviation military aircraft larger airports usually have several runways in different directions , so that one can be selected that is most nearly aligned with the wind originally in the 1920s and 1930s , airports and air bases ( particularly in the united kingdom ) were built in a triangle-like pattern of three runways at 60° angles to each other the reason was that back then aviation was only starting , and as a result although it was known that winds affect runway distance required , etc for example bristol airport has only one runway—09/27 ( 9/27 ) —and two taxiways that form a ' v ' which may have been runways on the original 1930s raf lulsgate bottom airbase runways are named by a number between 01 and 36 , which is generally the magnetic azimuth of the runway 's heading in decadegrees a runway numbered 09 points east ( 90° ) , runway 18 is south ( 180° ) , runway 27 points west ( 270° ) and runway 36 points to the north ( 360° rather than 0° ) federal aviation administration aeronautical information manual , chapter 2 , section 3 airport marking aids and signs part 3b when taking off from or landing on runway 09 , a plane is heading around 90° ( east ) a runway can normally be used in both directions , and is named for each direction separately : e.g , '' runway 15 '' in one direction is '' runway 33 '' when used in the other for clarity in radio communications , each digit in the runway name is pronounced individually : runway one-five , runway three-three , etc for example , runway & nbsp ; 05 at halifax will appear on the program as the single digit 5 rather than 05 military airbases may include smaller paved runways known as '' assault strips '' for practice and training next to larger primary runways these strips eschew the standard numerical naming convention and instead employ the runway 's full three digit heading ; examples include dobbins air reserve base 's runway 110/290and duke field 's runway 180/360 in some countries , regulations mandate that where parallel runways are too close to each other , only one may be used at a time under certain conditions ( usually adverse weather ) for example , in los angeles , this system results in runways 6l , 6r , 7l , and 7r , even though all four runways are actually parallel at approximately 69° at dallas/fort worth international airport , there are five parallel runways , named 17l , 17c , 17r , 18l , and 18r , all oriented at a heading of 175.4° runway designations may change over time because earth 's magnetic lines slowly drift on the surface and the magnetic direction changes for example , if the magnetic heading of a runway is 233° , it is designated runway & nbsp ; 23 if on the other hand the original magnetic heading was 226° ( runway & nbsp ; 23 ) , and the heading decreased by only 2 & nbsp ; degrees to 224° , the runway becomes runway & nbsp ; 22 when a runway designation does change , especially at major airports , it is often done at night , because taxiway signs need to be changed and the huge numbers at each end of the runway need to be repainted to the new runway designators takeoff and landing distances available are given using one of the following terms : ; tora : takeoff run available – the length of runway declared available and suitable for the ground run of an airplane taking off ; toda : takeoff distance available – the length of the takeoff run available plus the length of the clearway , if clearway is provided according to the federal aviation regulations and joint aviation requirements ( jar ) toda is the lesser of tora plus clearway or 1.5 times tora ) faa ac 150/5340-1l – standards for airport markings pages 13 and following the runway thresholds are markings across the runway that denote the beginning and end of the designated space for landing and takeoff under non-emergency conditions the runway safety area is the cleared , smoothed and graded area around the paved runway blast pads and stopways look similar , and are both marked with yellow chevrons ; stopways may optionally be surrounded by red runway lights a displaced threshold often exists because obstacles just before the runway , runway strength , or noise restrictions may make the beginning section of runway unsuitable for landings these runways , depending on the surface , may be marked with threshold markings , designators , centerlines , and sometimes a mark ( known as an aiming point , sometimes installed at seen from the air , runway lights form an outline of the runway runway centerline lighting system ( rcls ) – lights embedded into the surface of the runway at intervals along the runway centerline on some precision instrument runways runway confusion – an aircraft makes use of the wrong runway for landing or takeoff ( e.g

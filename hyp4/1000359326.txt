airports with one runway are often constructed to be aligned with the prevailing wind compiling a wind rose is in fact one of the preliminary steps taken in constructing airport runways note that wind direction is given as the direction the wind is coming from : a plane taking off from runway 09 faces east , into an '' east wind '' blowing from 090° originally in the 1920s and 1930s , airports and air bases ( particularly in the united kingdom ) were built in a triangle-like pattern of three runways at 60° angles to each other the reason was that back then aviation was only starting , and as a result although it was known that winds affect runway distance required , etc as a result , three runways in a triangle-like pattern were built , and the runway with the heaviest traffic on it would eventually expand into an airport 's main runway , while the other two runways would be either abandoned or converted into taxiways for example bristol airport has only one runway—09/27 ( 9/27 ) —and two taxiways that form a ' v ' which may have been runways on the original 1930s raf lulsgate bottom airbase runways are named by a number between 01 and 36 , which is generally the magnetic azimuth of the runway 's heading in decadegrees federal aviation administration aeronautical information manual , chapter 2 , section 3 airport marking aids and signs part 3b when taking off from or landing on runway 09 , a plane is heading around 90° ( east ) , '' runway 15 '' in one direction is '' runway 33 '' when used in the other for clarity in radio communications , each digit in the runway name is pronounced individually : runway one-five , runway three-three , etc a leading zero , for example in '' runway zero-six '' or '' runway zero-one-left '' , is included for all icao and some u.s it is very common in a country such as canada for a controller to clear an incoming american aircraft to , for example , runway 04 , and the pilot read back the clearance as runway & nbsp ; 4 military airbases may include smaller paved runways known as '' assault strips '' for practice and training next to larger primary runways these strips eschew the standard numerical naming convention and instead employ the runway 's full three digit heading ; examples include dobbins air reserve base 's runway 110/290and duke field 's runway 180/360 at dallas/fort worth international airport , there are five parallel runways , named 17l , 17c , 17r , 18l , and 18r , all oriented at a heading of 175.4° for example , if the magnetic heading of a runway is 233° , it is designated runway & nbsp ; 23 if the magnetic heading changes downwards by 5 & nbsp ; degrees to 228° , the runway remains runway & nbsp ; 23 if on the other hand the original magnetic heading was 226° ( runway & nbsp ; 23 ) , and the heading decreased by only 2 & nbsp ; degrees to 224° , the runway becomes runway & nbsp ; 22 in july & nbsp ; 2009 for example , london stansted airport in the united kingdom changed its runway designations from 05/23 to 04/22 during the night takeoff and landing distances available are given using one of the following terms : ; tora : takeoff run available – the length of runway declared available and suitable for the ground run of an airplane taking off the runway safety area is the cleared , smoothed and graded area around the paved runway the runway is the surface from threshold to threshold ( including displaced thresholds ) , which typically features threshold markings , numbers , and centerlines , but excludes blast pads and stopways at both ends blast pads are often constructed just before the start of a runway where jet blast produced by large planes during the takeoff roll could otherwise erode the ground and eventually damage the runway blast pads and stopways look similar , and are both marked with yellow chevrons ; stopways may optionally be surrounded by red runway lights a displaced threshold often exists because obstacles just before the runway , runway strength , or noise restrictions may make the beginning section of runway unsuitable for landings a line of lights on an airfield or elsewhere to guide aircraft in taking off or coming in to land or an illuminated runway is sometimes also known as a flare path runway end lights – a pair of four lights on each side of the runway on precision instrument runways , these lights extend along the full width of the runway runway edge lights – white elevated lights that run the length of the runway on either side types of runway safety incidents include : runway excursion – an incident involving only a single aircraft , where it makes an inappropriate exit from the runway ( e.g the boeing 747 is considered to have the longest takeoff distance of the more common aircraft types and has set the standard for runway lengths of larger international airports file : lbiarunwayflyover.jpg in the 1980s , leeds bradford international airport extended its runway to take wide bodied planes by building an overpass over the a658 road

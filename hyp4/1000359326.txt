in 1916 , in a world war i war effort context , the first concrete-paved runway was built in clermont-ferrand in france , allowing local company michelin to manufacture bréguet aviation military aircraft in january 1919 , aviation pioneer orville wright underlined the need for '' distinctly marked and carefully prepared landing places , but the preparing of the surface of reasonably flat ground is an expensive undertaking and there would also be a continuous expense for the upkeep larger airports usually have several runways in different directions , so that one can be selected that is most nearly aligned with the wind note that wind direction is given as the direction the wind is coming from : a plane taking off from runway 09 faces east , into an '' east wind '' blowing from 090° originally in the 1920s and 1930s , airports and air bases ( particularly in the united kingdom ) were built in a triangle-like pattern of three runways at 60° angles to each other as a result , three runways in a triangle-like pattern were built , and the runway with the heaviest traffic on it would eventually expand into an airport 's main runway , while the other two runways would be either abandoned or converted into taxiways for example bristol airport has only one runway—09/27 ( 9/27 ) —and two taxiways that form a ' v ' which may have been runways on the original 1930s raf lulsgate bottom airbase runways are named by a number between 01 and 36 , which is generally the magnetic azimuth of the runway 's heading in decadegrees a runway numbered 09 points east ( 90° ) , runway 18 is south ( 180° ) , runway 27 points west ( 270° ) and runway 36 points to the north ( 360° rather than 0° ) federal aviation administration aeronautical information manual , chapter 2 , section 3 airport marking aids and signs part 3b when taking off from or landing on runway 09 , a plane is heading around 90° ( east ) military airbases may include smaller paved runways known as '' assault strips '' for practice and training next to larger primary runways these strips eschew the standard numerical naming convention and instead employ the runway 's full three digit heading ; examples include dobbins air reserve base 's runway 110/290and duke field 's runway 180/360 for example , in los angeles , this system results in runways 6l , 6r , 7l , and 7r , even though all four runways are actually parallel at approximately 69° at dallas/fort worth international airport , there are five parallel runways , named 17l , 17c , 17r , 18l , and 18r , all oriented at a heading of 175.4° suffixes may also be used to denote special use runways faa ac 150/5200-35 runways that are numbered relative to true north rather than magnetic north will use the suffix t ; this is advantageous for certain airfields in the far north such as thule air base runway designations may change over time because earth 's magnetic lines slowly drift on the surface and the magnetic direction changes depending on the airport location and how much drift occurs , it may be necessary to change the runway designation takeoff and landing distances available are given using one of the following terms : ; tora : takeoff run available – the length of runway declared available and suitable for the ground run of an airplane taking off the runway safety area is the cleared , smoothed and graded area around the paved runway the runway is the surface from threshold to threshold ( including displaced thresholds ) , which typically features threshold markings , numbers , and centerlines , but excludes blast pads and stopways at both ends the differences are that stopways can support the full weight of an aircraft and are designated for use in an aborted takeoff , while blast pads are often not as strong as the main paved surface of the runway and are not to be used for taxiing , landing , or aborted takeoffs a displaced threshold often exists because obstacles just before the runway , runway strength , or noise restrictions may make the beginning section of runway unsuitable for landings like with blast pads , landings on displaced thresholds of the runway are not permitted save for an emergency or any other circumstance that may require displaced threshold use these runways , depending on the surface , may be marked with threshold markings , designators , centerlines , and sometimes a mark ( known as an aiming point , sometimes installed at while centerlines provide horizontal position guidance , aiming point markers provide vertical position guidance to planes on visual approach runways in norway have yellow markings instead of the usual white ones runway centerline lighting system ( rcls ) – lights embedded into the surface of the runway at intervals along the runway centerline on some precision instrument runways smaller airports may not have lighted runways or runway markings runway overrun ( also known as an overshoot ) – a type of excursion where the aircraft is unable to stop before the end of the runway ( e.g the boeing 747 is considered to have the longest takeoff distance of the more common aircraft types and has set the standard for runway lengths of larger international airports in india , recommendations of international civil aviation organization ( icao ) are now followed more often

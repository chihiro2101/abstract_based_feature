in 1916 , in a world war i war effort context , the first concrete-paved runway was built in clermont-ferrand in france , allowing local company michelin to manufacture bréguet aviation military aircraft larger airports usually have several runways in different directions , so that one can be selected that is most nearly aligned with the wind airports with one runway are often constructed to be aligned with the prevailing wind originally in the 1920s and 1930s , airports and air bases ( particularly in the united kingdom ) were built in a triangle-like pattern of three runways at 60° angles to each other the reason was that back then aviation was only starting , and as a result although it was known that winds affect runway distance required , etc as a result , three runways in a triangle-like pattern were built , and the runway with the heaviest traffic on it would eventually expand into an airport 's main runway , while the other two runways would be either abandoned or converted into taxiways for example bristol airport has only one runway—09/27 ( 9/27 ) —and two taxiways that form a ' v ' which may have been runways on the original 1930s raf lulsgate bottom airbase runways are named by a number between 01 and 36 , which is generally the magnetic azimuth of the runway 's heading in decadegrees a runway numbered 09 points east ( 90° ) , runway 18 is south ( 180° ) , runway 27 points west ( 270° ) and runway 36 points to the north ( 360° rather than 0° ) federal aviation administration aeronautical information manual , chapter 2 , section 3 airport marking aids and signs part 3b when taking off from or landing on runway 09 , a plane is heading around 90° ( east ) , '' runway 15 '' in one direction is '' runway 33 '' when used in the other a leading zero , for example in '' runway zero-six '' or '' runway zero-one-left '' , is included for all icao and some u.s it is very common in a country such as canada for a controller to clear an incoming american aircraft to , for example , runway 04 , and the pilot read back the clearance as runway & nbsp ; 4 for example , runway & nbsp ; 05 at halifax will appear on the program as the single digit 5 rather than 05 these strips eschew the standard numerical naming convention and instead employ the runway 's full three digit heading ; examples include dobbins air reserve base 's runway 110/290and duke field 's runway 180/360 airports with unpredictable or chaotic water currents , such as santa catalina island 's pebbly beach seaplane base , may designate their landing area as waterway all/way to denote the lack of designated landing direction in some countries , regulations mandate that where parallel runways are too close to each other , only one may be used at a time under certain conditions ( usually adverse weather ) suffixes may also be used to denote special use runways faa ac 150/5200-35 runways that are numbered relative to true north rather than magnetic north will use the suffix t ; this is advantageous for certain airfields in the far north such as thule air base runway designations may change over time because earth 's magnetic lines slowly drift on the surface and the magnetic direction changes if the magnetic heading changes downwards by 5 & nbsp ; degrees to 228° , the runway remains runway & nbsp ; 23 if on the other hand the original magnetic heading was 226° ( runway & nbsp ; 23 ) , and the heading decreased by only 2 & nbsp ; degrees to 224° , the runway becomes runway & nbsp ; 22 takeoff and landing distances available are given using one of the following terms : ; tora : takeoff run available – the length of runway declared available and suitable for the ground run of an airplane taking off ; toda : takeoff distance available – the length of the takeoff run available plus the length of the clearway , if clearway is provided ; lda : landing distance available – the length of runway that is declared available and suitable for the ground run of an airplane landing faa ac 150/5340-1l – standards for airport markings pages 13 and following the runway thresholds are markings across the runway that denote the beginning and end of the designated space for landing and takeoff under non-emergency conditions the runway is the surface from threshold to threshold ( including displaced thresholds ) , which typically features threshold markings , numbers , and centerlines , but excludes blast pads and stopways at both ends blast pads are often constructed just before the start of a runway where jet blast produced by large planes during the takeoff roll could otherwise erode the ground and eventually damage the runway the differences are that stopways can support the full weight of an aircraft and are designated for use in an aborted takeoff , while blast pads are often not as strong as the main paved surface of the runway and are not to be used for taxiing , landing , or aborted takeoffs runway end lights – a pair of four lights on each side of the runway on precision instrument runways , these lights extend along the full width of the runway types of runway safety incidents include : runway excursion – an incident involving only a single aircraft , where it makes an inappropriate exit from the runway ( e.g runway confusion – an aircraft makes use of the wrong runway for landing or takeoff ( e.g

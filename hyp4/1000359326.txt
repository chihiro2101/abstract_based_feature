in 1916 , in a world war i war effort context , the first concrete-paved runway was built in clermont-ferrand in france , allowing local company michelin to manufacture bréguet aviation military aircraft for fixed-wing aircraft , it is advantageous to perform takeoffs and landings into the wind to reduce takeoff or landing roll and reduce the ground speed needed to attain airspeed larger airports usually have several runways in different directions , so that one can be selected that is most nearly aligned with the wind airports with one runway are often constructed to be aligned with the prevailing wind note that wind direction is given as the direction the wind is coming from : a plane taking off from runway 09 faces east , into an '' east wind '' blowing from 090° originally in the 1920s and 1930s , airports and air bases ( particularly in the united kingdom ) were built in a triangle-like pattern of three runways at 60° angles to each other the reason was that back then aviation was only starting , and as a result although it was known that winds affect runway distance required , etc as a result , three runways in a triangle-like pattern were built , and the runway with the heaviest traffic on it would eventually expand into an airport 's main runway , while the other two runways would be either abandoned or converted into taxiways for example bristol airport has only one runway—09/27 ( 9/27 ) —and two taxiways that form a ' v ' which may have been runways on the original 1930s raf lulsgate bottom airbase runways are named by a number between 01 and 36 , which is generally the magnetic azimuth of the runway 's heading in decadegrees a runway numbered 09 points east ( 90° ) , runway 18 is south ( 180° ) , runway 27 points west ( 270° ) and runway 36 points to the north ( 360° rather than 0° ) federal aviation administration aeronautical information manual , chapter 2 , section 3 airport marking aids and signs part 3b when taking off from or landing on runway 09 , a plane is heading around 90° ( east ) for clarity in radio communications , each digit in the runway name is pronounced individually : runway one-five , runway three-three , etc & nbsp ; civil aviation airports drop the leading zero as required by faa regulation military airbases may include smaller paved runways known as '' assault strips '' for practice and training next to larger primary runways airports with unpredictable or chaotic water currents , such as santa catalina island 's pebbly beach seaplane base , may designate their landing area as waterway all/way to denote the lack of designated landing direction faa ac 150/5200-35 runways that are numbered relative to true north rather than magnetic north will use the suffix t ; this is advantageous for certain airfields in the far north such as thule air base if on the other hand the original magnetic heading was 226° ( runway & nbsp ; 23 ) , and the heading decreased by only 2 & nbsp ; degrees to 224° , the runway becomes runway & nbsp ; 22 because magnetic drift itself is slow , runway designation changes are uncommon , and not welcomed , as they require an accompanying change in aeronautical charts and descriptive documents when a runway designation does change , especially at major airports , it is often done at night , because taxiway signs need to be changed and the huge numbers at each end of the runway need to be repainted to the new runway designators takeoff and landing distances available are given using one of the following terms : ; tora : takeoff run available – the length of runway declared available and suitable for the ground run of an airplane taking off blast pads are often constructed just before the start of a runway where jet blast produced by large planes during the takeoff roll could otherwise erode the ground and eventually damage the runway stopways , also known as overrun areas , are also constructed at the end of runways as emergency space to slowly stop planes that overrun the runway on a landing that has not gone to plan , or to slowly stop a plane on a rejected takeoff or a takeoff that has not gone to plan the differences are that stopways can support the full weight of an aircraft and are designated for use in an aborted takeoff , while blast pads are often not as strong as the main paved surface of the runway and are not to be used for taxiing , landing , or aborted takeoffs a displaced threshold often exists because obstacles just before the runway , runway strength , or noise restrictions may make the beginning section of runway unsuitable for landings 306 it is marked with white paint arrows that lead up to the beginning of the landing portion of the runway like with blast pads , landings on displaced thresholds of the runway are not permitted save for an emergency or any other circumstance that may require displaced threshold use there are three types of runways : visual runways are used at small airstrips and are usually just a strip of grass , gravel , ice , asphalt , or concrete also , radio communication may not be available and pilots must be self-reliant runway centerline lighting system ( rcls ) – lights embedded into the surface of the runway at intervals along the runway centerline on some precision instrument runways runway confusion – an aircraft makes use of the wrong runway for landing or takeoff ( e.g the boeing 747 is considered to have the longest takeoff distance of the more common aircraft types and has set the standard for runway lengths of larger international airports

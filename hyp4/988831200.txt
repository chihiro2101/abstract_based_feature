in 1619 kepler defined stellation for polygons and polyhedra as the process of extending edges or faces until they meet to form a new polygon or polyhedron he stellated the regular dodecahedron to obtain two regular star polyhedra , the small stellated dodecahedron and great stellated dodecahedron he also stellated the regular octahedron to obtain the stella octangula , a regular compound of two tetrahedra a regular star polygon is represented by its schläfli symbol a polyhedron is stellated by extending the edges or face planes of a polyhedron until they meet again to form a new polyhedron or compound the interior of the new polyhedron is divided by the faces into a number of cells the face planes of a polyhedron may divide space into many such cells , and as the stellation process continues then more of these cells will be enclosed for a symmetrical polyhedron , these cells will fall into groups , or sets , of congruent cells – we say that the cells in such a congruent set are of the same type a common method of finding stellations involves selecting one or more cell types a set of cells forming a closed layer around its core is called a shell '' in a fully supported stellation there are no such overhangs , and all visible parts of a face are seen from the same side ( 20 are shown in wenninger 's polyhedron models ) seventeen of the nonconvex uniform polyhedra are stellations of archimedean solids there are 58 stellations of the icosahedron , including the great icosahedron ( one of the kepler–poinsot polyhedra ) , and the second and final stellations of the icosahedron some polyhedronists take the view that stellation is a two-way process , such that any two polyhedra sharing the same face planes are stellations of each other the first systematic naming of stellated polyhedra was cayley 's naming of the regular star polyhedra ( nowadays known as the kepler–poinsot polyhedra ) by most definitions of a polyhedron , however , these stellations are not strictly polyhedra

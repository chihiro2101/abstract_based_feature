in 1619 kepler defined stellation for polygons and polyhedra as the process of extending edges or faces until they meet to form a new polygon or polyhedron he stellated the regular dodecahedron to obtain two regular star polyhedra , the small stellated dodecahedron and great stellated dodecahedron he also stellated the regular octahedron to obtain the stella octangula , a regular compound of two tetrahedra stellating a regular polygon symmetrically creates a regular star polygon or polygonal compound these polygons are characterised by the number of times m that the polygonal boundary winds around the centre of the figure a regular star polygon is represented by its schl√§fli symbol a polyhedron is stellated by extending the edges or face planes of a polyhedron until they meet again to form a new polyhedron or compound the face planes of a polyhedron may divide space into many such cells , and as the stellation process continues then more of these cells will be enclosed a common method of finding stellations involves selecting one or more cell types '' in a fully supported stellation there are no such overhangs , and all visible parts of a face are seen from the same side they ensure , among other things , that the rotational symmetry of the original polyhedron is preserved , and that each stellation is different in outward appearance on the other hand , kepler 's method also yields stellations which are forbidden by miller 's rules since their cells are edge- or vertex-connected , even though their faces are single polygons most progress has been made based on the notion that stellation is the reciprocal or dual process to facetting , whereby parts are removed from a polyhedron without creating any new vertices some polyhedronists take the view that stellation is a two-way process , such that any two polyhedra sharing the same face planes are stellations of each other in this system the process of extending edges to create a new figure is called stellation , that of extending faces is called greatening and that of extending cells is called aggrandizement ( this last does not apply to polyhedra ) the figure comprising these prisms may be called a stellation to infinity

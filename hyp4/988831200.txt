in 1619 kepler defined stellation for polygons and polyhedra as the process of extending edges or faces until they meet to form a new polygon or polyhedron he stellated the regular dodecahedron to obtain two regular star polyhedra , the small stellated dodecahedron and great stellated dodecahedron these polygons are characterised by the number of times m that the polygonal boundary winds around the centre of the figure a regular star polygon is represented by its schläfli symbol a polyhedron is stellated by extending the edges or face planes of a polyhedron until they meet again to form a new polyhedron or compound the interior of the new polyhedron is divided by the faces into a number of cells the face planes of a polyhedron may divide space into many such cells , and as the stellation process continues then more of these cells will be enclosed for a symmetrical polyhedron , these cells will fall into groups , or sets , of congruent cells – we say that the cells in such a congruent set are of the same type they ensure , among other things , that the rotational symmetry of the original polyhedron is preserved , and that each stellation is different in outward appearance here we usually add the rule that all of the original face planes must be present in the stellation , i.e ( 20 are shown in wenninger 's polyhedron models ) seventeen of the nonconvex uniform polyhedra are stellations of archimedean solids miller proposed a set of rules for defining which stellation forms should be considered '' properly significant and distinct '' bridge found his new stellation of the icosahedron by studying the facettings of its dual , the dodecahedron some polyhedronists take the view that stellation is a two-way process , such that any two polyhedra sharing the same face planes are stellations of each other for example , in 4-space , the great grand stellated 120-cell is the final stellation of the regular 4-polytope 120-cell in this system the process of extending edges to create a new figure is called stellation , that of extending faces is called greatening and that of extending cells is called aggrandizement ( this last does not apply to polyhedra )

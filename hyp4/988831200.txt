in 1619 kepler defined stellation for polygons and polyhedra as the process of extending edges or faces until they meet to form a new polygon or polyhedron he stellated the regular dodecahedron to obtain two regular star polyhedra , the small stellated dodecahedron and great stellated dodecahedron he also stellated the regular octahedron to obtain the stella octangula , a regular compound of two tetrahedra stellating a regular polygon symmetrically creates a regular star polygon or polygonal compound these polygons are characterised by the number of times m that the polygonal boundary winds around the centre of the figure a regular star polygon is represented by its schl√§fli symbol a polyhedron is stellated by extending the edges or face planes of a polyhedron until they meet again to form a new polyhedron or compound the interior of the new polyhedron is divided by the faces into a number of cells the face planes of a polyhedron may divide space into many such cells , and as the stellation process continues then more of these cells will be enclosed this can lead to a huge number of possible forms , so further criteria are often imposed to reduce the set to those stellations that are significant and unique in some way where a polyhedron has planes of mirror symmetry , edges falling in these planes are said to lie in primary lines we can also identify some other categories : a partial stellation is one where not all elements of a given dimensionality are extended here we usually add the rule that all of the original face planes must be present in the stellation , i.e bridge found his new stellation of the icosahedron by studying the facettings of its dual , the dodecahedron for example , in 4-space , the great grand stellated 120-cell is the final stellation of the regular 4-polytope 120-cell in this system the process of extending edges to create a new figure is called stellation , that of extending faces is called greatening and that of extending cells is called aggrandizement ( this last does not apply to polyhedra )

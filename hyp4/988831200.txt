in 1619 kepler defined stellation for polygons and polyhedra as the process of extending edges or faces until they meet to form a new polygon or polyhedron he stellated the regular dodecahedron to obtain two regular star polyhedra , the small stellated dodecahedron and great stellated dodecahedron he also stellated the regular octahedron to obtain the stella octangula , a regular compound of two tetrahedra these polygons are characterised by the number of times m that the polygonal boundary winds around the centre of the figure a regular star polygon is represented by its schl√§fli symbol a polyhedron is stellated by extending the edges or face planes of a polyhedron until they meet again to form a new polyhedron or compound the interior of the new polyhedron is divided by the faces into a number of cells the face planes of a polyhedron may divide space into many such cells , and as the stellation process continues then more of these cells will be enclosed if all edges lie in primary lines , the stellation is primary they ensure , among other things , that the rotational symmetry of the original polyhedron is preserved , and that each stellation is different in outward appearance here we usually add the rule that all of the original face planes must be present in the stellation , i.e miller proposed a set of rules for defining which stellation forms should be considered '' properly significant and distinct '' bridge found his new stellation of the icosahedron by studying the facettings of its dual , the dodecahedron many examples of stellations can be found in the list of wenninger 's stellation models in this system the process of extending edges to create a new figure is called stellation , that of extending faces is called greatening and that of extending cells is called aggrandizement ( this last does not apply to polyhedra ) the figure comprising these prisms may be called a stellation to infinity

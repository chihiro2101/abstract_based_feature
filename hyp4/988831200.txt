in 1619 kepler defined stellation for polygons and polyhedra as the process of extending edges or faces until they meet to form a new polygon or polyhedron he stellated the regular dodecahedron to obtain two regular star polyhedra , the small stellated dodecahedron and great stellated dodecahedron he also stellated the regular octahedron to obtain the stella octangula , a regular compound of two tetrahedra these polygons are characterised by the number of times m that the polygonal boundary winds around the centre of the figure a regular star polygon is represented by its schläfli symbol a polyhedron is stellated by extending the edges or face planes of a polyhedron until they meet again to form a new polyhedron or compound the interior of the new polyhedron is divided by the faces into a number of cells the face planes of a polyhedron may divide space into many such cells , and as the stellation process continues then more of these cells will be enclosed for a symmetrical polyhedron , these cells will fall into groups , or sets , of congruent cells – we say that the cells in such a congruent set are of the same type this can lead to a huge number of possible forms , so further criteria are often imposed to reduce the set to those stellations that are significant and unique in some way for a symmetrical polyhedron , a shell may be made up of one or more cell types other rules for stellation for every stellation of some polyhedron , there is a dual facetting of the dual polyhedron , and vice versa some polyhedronists take the view that stellation is a two-way process , such that any two polyhedra sharing the same face planes are stellations of each other for example , in 4-space , the great grand stellated 120-cell is the final stellation of the regular 4-polytope 120-cell in this system the process of extending edges to create a new figure is called stellation , that of extending faces is called greatening and that of extending cells is called aggrandizement ( this last does not apply to polyhedra )

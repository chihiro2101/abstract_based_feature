in a 1904 paper , jan baudouin de courtenay emphasised the need to distinguish between language similarities arising from a genetic relationship ( rodstvo ) and those arising from convergence due to language contact ( srodstvo ) nikolai trubetzkoy introduced the russian term ; '' language union '' ) in a 1923 article standard average european ( sae ) is a concept introduced in 1939 by benjamin whorf to group the modern indo-european languages of europe with shared common features the work began to assume the character of a comparison between hopi and western european languages it also became evident that even the grammar of hopi bore a relation to hopi culture , and the grammar of european tongues to our own '' western '' or '' european '' culture and it appeared that the interrelation brought in those large subsummations of experience by language , such as our own terms '' time , '' '' space , '' '' substance , '' and '' matter the romance , germanic , and slavic control languages of interlingua are reflective of the language groups most often included in the sae sprachbund inheritance of the sae features from proto-indo-european can be ruled out because proto-indo-european , as currently reconstructed , lacked most of the sae features the same features are not found in other languages that are otherwise closely related , such as the other romance languages in relation to romanian , and the other slavic languages such as polish in relation to bulgaro-macedonian in the paper , emeneau observed that the subcontinent 's dravidian and indo-aryan languages shared a number of features that were not inherited from a common source , but were areal features , the result of diffusion during sustained contact the area stretches from thailand to china and is home to speakers of languages of the sino-tibetan , hmong–mien ( or miao–yao ) , tai–kadai , austronesian ( represented by chamic ) and mon–khmer families a common alternative explanation for similarities between said altaic languages such as vowel harmony and agglutination is that they are due to areal diffusion

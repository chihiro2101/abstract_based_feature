in a 1904 paper , jan baudouin de courtenay emphasised the need to distinguish between language similarities arising from a genetic relationship ( rodstvo ) and those arising from convergence due to language contact ( srodstvo ) nikolai trubetzkoy introduced the russian term ; '' language union '' ) in a 1923 article in a paper presented to the first international congress of linguists in 1928 , he used a german calque of this term , sprachbund , defining it as a group of languages with similarities in syntax , morphological structure , cultural vocabulary and sound systems , but without systematic sound correspondences , shared basic morphology or shared basic vocabulary standard average european ( sae ) is a concept introduced in 1939 by benjamin whorf to group the modern indo-european languages of europe with shared common features reprinted in ( 1956 ) , language , thought and reality : selected writings of benjamins lee whorf it also became evident that even the grammar of hopi bore a relation to hopi culture , and the grammar of european tongues to our own '' western '' or '' european '' culture the romance , germanic , and slavic control languages of interlingua are reflective of the language groups most often included in the sae sprachbund the standard average european sprachbund is most likely the result of ongoing language contact in the time of the migration period '' language typology and language universals '' accessed 2015-10-13 and later , continuing during the middle ages and the renaissance inheritance of the sae features from proto-indo-european can be ruled out because proto-indo-european , as currently reconstructed , lacked most of the sae features in the paper , emeneau observed that the subcontinent 's dravidian and indo-aryan languages shared a number of features that were not inherited from a common source , but were areal features , the result of diffusion during sustained contact these parallels led to confusion over the classification of these languages , until andré-georges haudricourt showed in 1954 that tone was not an invariant feature , by demonstrating that vietnamese tones corresponded to certain final consonants in other languages of the mon–khmer family , and proposed that tone in the other languages had a similar origin many languages in the region are of the isolating ( or analytic ) type , with mostly monosyllabic morphemes and little use of inflection or affixes , though a number of mon–khmer languages have derivational morphology

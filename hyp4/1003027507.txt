coandă was interested in achieving reactive propelled flight as early as 1905 , conducting tests of rockets attached to model aircraft at the romanian army arsenal in bucharest in secret , at spandau in germany , coandă successfully tested a flying machine equipped with a single tractor propeller , and two counter-rotating propellers providing lift , powered by a 50-horsepower ( 37 & nbsp ; kw ) antoinette engine according to later claims , coandă tested the aircraft at kassel , witnessed by the chancellor of the german empire bernhard von bülow it was around this time that coandă 's interest in jet propulsion began , claiming that the aircraft and a jet-propelled model were displayed in december 1907 at the sporthalle indoor sports arena in berlin in 1909 he was employed as technical director of the liège-spa aeroclub , and at the end of that year , with the help of car manufacturer joachim he built the coandă-joachim glider as a continuation of his belgian experiments , and especially looking for a way to test wing aerofoils at higher speeds , he contacted ernest archdeacon , the co-founder of aéro-club de france , who in turn directed coandă to gustav eiffel and paul painlevé with their assistance , he gained approval to test different wing configurations and air resistance on a platform built by eiffel at the front of a locomotive on the north of france railway helped by his schoolfriend cammarotta-adornoin , coandă started to build his slender sesquiplane and the unusual powerplant in a workshop in the courtyard of his house where he tested the thrust of the powerplant on a dynamometer , tests which are described in detail in the april 1910 edition of la technique aéronautique '' he filed for several patents for the mechanism and aircraft on 30 may 1910 , with later additions to the existing patents coandă exhibited the aircraft at the paris air show history ( commonly referred to as the paris salon , or paris flight salon ) held from 15 october to 2 november 1910 in contrast to the monoplane described in the july 1910 patent application , the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction , but in return solved lateral stability control issues the cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires according to coandă 's description the wings were built with metal spars , but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure the trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing , and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit the fuselage , painted reddish-brown and highly polished , was described by the technical world magazine as having a framework of steel , though the construction photographs indicate that it had a wooden framework this was triangular in cross-section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel , and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped moulded plywood it was an early instance of what are now known as v-tail '' the project that he arrived by departing from this above-mentioned concept represents a propulsion assembly for aeroplanes , with a jet effect , comprising a radial compressor powered by an internal combustion engine by means of a rotation multiplier with ratio of 1:4 , an assembly that formed a '' motorfan '' , the ancestor of the current turbofan the invention was given the name 'propeller ' in the patent application and in the documentation it was given the name '' turbo-propeller '' the powerplant was referred to in reports at the time by different terms : a turbine without propellers , turbo-propulseur , ducted fan the article included two sectional drawings of the engine the engine was noted in the aero , reprinted in aircraft , as being '' of remarkably small proportions in relation to the size of the machine '' the writer said the turbo-propulseur was '' claimed to give an enormous wind velocity '' , but the intake area seemed too small to produce the stated thrust , and that '' it also appears as if enormous power would be necessary to drive it '' , more than supplied by the clerget a daily newspaper from bucharest wrote in 1910 that the aircraft was constructed in clerget 's workshops and that it '' will fly in 6–7 weeks near paris , piloted by weymann , one of the pilots celebrated at the rennes aviation meeting '' the official exhibition report ignored the turbo-propulseur engine and instead described coandă 's novel wing design , and the unusual empennage on 15 november 1910 , l'aérophile wrote that if the machine were ever to develop as the inventor hoped , it would be '' a beautiful dream '' after the exhibition the aircraft was moved to a clément-bayard workshop at issy-les-moulineaux for further testing a group of modern-day romanian investigators led by dan antoniu , having examined photographs from 1910 , concluded that the rotary compressor featured at the exhibition was a hybrid between the one described in the initial 30 may 1910 patent and that shown in a later patent application '' the complexity of the director , as it appears in the 1st patented version had major implications for the construction costs due to the multitude of elements that made it very difficult to build coandă simplified it and it was built from 15 independent elements made from cast aluminium that when assembled formed a more efficient director the new version of the propeller that the coandă 1910 machine was equipped with , was partially included in the next patent application which included the new director system but with a different rotor this was not tried , but hartmann concluded that the experiment proved that the solution worked perfectly the additional turbo-propulseur patent application 13.502 , dated 3 december 1910 , was implemented on a double-seat motorised sled commissioned by cyril vladimirovich , grand duke of russia '' at the paris automobile exhibition of december 1910 – january 1911 , coandă presented a two-seat sled powered by '' coandă turbo-propeller '' 2nd construction variant '' with the help of despujols , a boat maker , and the motor manufacturer gregoire , coandă supervised the building of a motor sled , powered by a 30 & nbsp ; hp ( 22 & nbsp ; kw ) gregoire engine driving the turbo-propulseur a number of automobile and general interest magazines published photographs or sketches of the sledge he applied for new patents for aerodynamic investigations and improvements of the coandă-1910 antoniu ( 2010 ) , p coandă described a different , more sturdy system for the attachment of the wings , which also enabled changes in the angle of attack and the centre of gravity he aimed to obtain more power from the propulsion system , and design drawings show the arrangement of two air-cooled rotary engines on the sides of the fuselage the placement of the engines indicates that coandă did not intend to inject fuel into the jet stream and ignite it as the cooling of the engines would have been compromised '' one relevant aspect must be noted in the relation to the entire propulsion system that demonstrates that the reaction force was obtained only with air under pressure ( motofan ) like the engines of modern planes on the external supports of the rotary engines he provided two supporting surfaces , he covered their accessories improving their aerodynamic , and together with the cruciform empennage they were intended to contribute to the longitudinal stability of the machine '' though coandă continued to study rotary propulsion mechanisms , antoniu believes that coandă never implemented a practical solution because of the lack of funds the possibility of a new contract with the french government led coandă to build the coandă-1911 he wished to win an army-organised competition at reims in october , one that required two engines in each aircraft as a fail-safe strategy '' at the third aviation salon in paris 1911 , coandă displayed a scale model of the aircraft which used two gnome rotary engines mounted back to back , connected by a bevel gear to a single two-bladed propeller the mounting support of the engines , initially intended for a jet propulsion version , was not adequate for the new configuration so the forward chassis had to be modified stine wrote that coandă flew on 10 december 1910 , and described the heat from the '' two jet exhausts '' as being '' too much for me '' after the powerplant was mounted in the aircraft gunston 's 1995 description began : '' romanian henri coanda built a biplane with a clerget inline piston engine which , instead of turning a propeller , drove a centrifugal compressor blowing air to the rear '' in 2007 in his popular book extreme aircraft , ron miller wrote that the powerplant in the coandă-1910 was one of the '' earliest attempts '' at a jet engine , but was unsuccessful—it was '' incapable of actual flight '' , unlike the engines designed by whittle and ohain it represents the aircraft on the obverse side and a portrait of coandă on the reverse , including romanian words which translate to '' first jet aircraft ''

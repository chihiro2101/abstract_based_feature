coandă was interested in achieving reactive propelled flight as early as 1905 , conducting tests of rockets attached to model aircraft at the romanian army arsenal in bucharest positioned along the fuselage centreline , the smaller rear lift propeller was mounted vertically , while the larger front one was inclined slightly forwards at 17 & nbsp ; degrees according to later claims , coandă tested the aircraft at kassel , witnessed by the chancellor of the german empire bernhard von bülow it was around this time that coandă 's interest in jet propulsion began , claiming that the aircraft and a jet-propelled model were displayed in december 1907 at the sporthalle indoor sports arena in berlin in 1909 he was employed as technical director of the liège-spa aeroclub , and at the end of that year , with the help of car manufacturer joachim he built the coandă-joachim glider with the opening of the école nationale supérieure de l'aéronautique et de l'espace on 15 november 1909 , coandă moved to paris as a continuation of his belgian experiments , and especially looking for a way to test wing aerofoils at higher speeds , he contacted ernest archdeacon , the co-founder of aéro-club de france , who in turn directed coandă to gustav eiffel and paul painlevé with their assistance , he gained approval to test different wing configurations and air resistance on a platform built by eiffel at the front of a locomotive on the north of france railway helped by his schoolfriend cammarotta-adornoin , coandă started to build his slender sesquiplane and the unusual powerplant in a workshop in the courtyard of his house where he tested the thrust of the powerplant on a dynamometer , tests which are described in detail in the april 1910 edition of la technique aéronautique however , i hope that soon i will be able to restart my experiments at cie du nord who so generously put a train operating between paris and saint-quentin at my disposal coandă exhibited the aircraft at the paris air show history ( commonly referred to as the paris salon , or paris flight salon ) held from 15 october to 2 november 1910 together with henri fabre 's hydravion , the first floatplane , coandă 's aircraft and devices used for aerodynamic experiments were placed '' in solitary state '' in an upstairs gallery , separated from the more usual types of aircraft on the main exhibition floor in contrast to the monoplane described in the july 1910 patent application , the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction , but in return solved lateral stability control issues according to coandă 's description the wings were built with metal spars , but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure the trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing , and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit the fuselage , painted reddish-brown and highly polished , was described by the technical world magazine as having a framework of steel , though the construction photographs indicate that it had a wooden framework four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large antoinette vii-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit , one on each side , and were used for pitch and directional control the fuel tank was located in the fuselage between the engine and the cockpit the most remarkable feature of the aircraft was its engine ( 'turbo ' was a term that described a rotor turning at high speeds of rotation ) the powerplant was referred to in reports at the time by different terms : a turbine without propellers , turbo-propulseur , ducted fan the article included two sectional drawings of the engine the engine was noted in the aero , reprinted in aircraft , as being '' of remarkably small proportions in relation to the size of the machine '' the writer said the turbo-propulseur was '' claimed to give an enormous wind velocity '' , but the intake area seemed too small to produce the stated thrust , and that '' it also appears as if enormous power would be necessary to drive it '' , more than supplied by the clerget coandă 's new aeroplane will fly in 6–7 weeks near paris , piloted by weymann , one of the pilots celebrated at the rennes aviation meeting it may be that weymann expressed his willingness to buy the aircraft once tests had been carried out on 15 november 1910 , l'aérophile wrote that if the machine were ever to develop as the inventor hoped , it would be '' a beautiful dream '' henri mirguet writing for l'aérophile magazine in january 1912 , recalled the previous exhibition 's machine as the '' chief attraction '' of the 1910 salon the additional turbo-propulseur patent application 13.502 , dated 3 december 1910 , was implemented on a double-seat motorised sled commissioned by cyril vladimirovich , grand duke of russia a version of coandă 's turbo-propulseur design was shown for the second time in late 1910 at the grand palais of paris one of the periodicals reported an expected speed of , but no account exists of the sledge being tested coandă continued to work on the coandă-1910 project at the beginning of 1911 , aiming to improve stability , increase the power of the turbo-propulseur , and to implement aerofoil improvements coandă described a different , more sturdy system for the attachment of the wings , which also enabled changes in the angle of attack and the centre of gravity he aimed to obtain more power from the propulsion system , and design drawings show the arrangement of two air-cooled rotary engines on the sides of the fuselage in the case in which fuel was introduced in the exhaust channel , the hot gases would have enveloped the two rotary engines depriving them of the necessary cooling '' the patent was annotated with an additional claim on 19 july 1911 which brought significant changes including the addition of retractable landing gear with dampers inside aerodynamic fairings with skids , removal of the horizontal stabiliser , a supporting surface was provided for each engine and their accessories were covered to improve aerodynamics on the external supports of the rotary engines he provided two supporting surfaces , he covered their accessories improving their aerodynamic , and together with the cruciform empennage they were intended to contribute to the longitudinal stability of the machine '' in may 1911 coandă filed english-language patents on the turbo-propulseur design in the united kingdom and the united states , as well as a second french-language patent filed in switzerland , british patent gb191112740 ( a ) applied for may 26 , 1911 us patent 1104963 propeller the possibility of a new contract with the french government led coandă to build the coandă-1911 he wished to win an army-organised competition at reims in october , one that required two engines in each aircraft as a fail-safe strategy stimulated by an eventual deal with the french government , coandă completed the project of a flying machine derived from the coandă no.1 of 1910 , as well as his latest projects protected by patents , which he modified as a result of the user 's demands '' at the third aviation salon in paris 1911 , coandă displayed a scale model of the aircraft which used two gnome rotary engines mounted back to back , connected by a bevel gear to a single two-bladed propeller '' during the tests , the two-bladed propeller did not provide the necessary traction either , even though there was a reserve of power in the engines as the results were acceptable , he ordered a four-blade one-piece propeller the aircraft was flown on 21 october 1911 , but with modest results as the latest modifications , especially those related to the powerplant , did not compensate for the increased total weight of the aircraft ( photograph of coandă 's 1911 aircraft with propeller a once-classified guggenheim aeronautical laboratory and jet propulsion laboratory study completed in 1946 described the coandă-1910 as '' probably not flown '' but featuring '' a mechanical jet propulsion device with a centrifugal blower '' , one in which heat from the clerget piston engine '' furnished auxiliary jet propulsion adderley said he '' can definitely confirm that the power unit was of the ducted-fan type , similar in basic principles to the caproni-campini aircraft of the 1930s '' ( referring to the caproni campini n.1 ) in the early 1950s coandă began to claim that he had flown his 1910 aircraft himself , and that the 1910 engine was the first motorjet , using fuel injection and combustion to create its thrust in their 1994 book american aviation , authors joe christy and leroy cook state that coandă 's 1910 aircraft was the first jet '' in the 2000s , dan antoniu and other romanian aviation experts investigated existing photographs of the coandă-1910 , leading them to believe that the aircraft presented at the exhibition was not finished , that it was exhibited with many improvisations it represents the aircraft on the obverse side and a portrait of coandă on the reverse , including romanian words which translate to '' first jet aircraft ''

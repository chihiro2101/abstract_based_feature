coandă was interested in achieving reactive propelled flight as early as 1905 , conducting tests of rockets attached to model aircraft at the romanian army arsenal in bucharest in secret , at spandau in germany , coandă successfully tested a flying machine equipped with a single tractor propeller , and two counter-rotating propellers providing lift , powered by a 50-horsepower ( 37 & nbsp ; kw ) antoinette engine positioned along the fuselage centreline , the smaller rear lift propeller was mounted vertically , while the larger front one was inclined slightly forwards at 17 & nbsp ; degrees according to later claims , coandă tested the aircraft at kassel , witnessed by the chancellor of the german empire bernhard von bülow it was around this time that coandă 's interest in jet propulsion began , claiming that the aircraft and a jet-propelled model were displayed in december 1907 at the sporthalle indoor sports arena in berlin coandă continued his studies at liège , belgium , where with his roommate and friend giovanni battista caproni he built the coandă-caproni box glider , based on the plans of gliders designed by otto lilienthal and octave chanute which he previously studied at charlottenburg and spandau with the opening of the école nationale supérieure de l'aéronautique et de l'espace on 15 november 1909 , coandă moved to paris as a continuation of his belgian experiments , and especially looking for a way to test wing aerofoils at higher speeds , he contacted ernest archdeacon , the co-founder of aéro-club de france , who in turn directed coandă to gustav eiffel and paul painlevé with their assistance , he gained approval to test different wing configurations and air resistance on a platform built by eiffel at the front of a locomotive on the north of france railway helped by his schoolfriend cammarotta-adornoin , coandă started to build his slender sesquiplane and the unusual powerplant in a workshop in the courtyard of his house where he tested the thrust of the powerplant on a dynamometer , tests which are described in detail in the april 1910 edition of la technique aéronautique these airscrews would provide a better efficiency compared to those used today i do not dare however to make definitive pronouncements about their shape , as my experiments on this subject were not completed yet '' he filed for several patents for the mechanism and aircraft on 30 may 1910 , with later additions to the existing patents coandă exhibited the aircraft at the paris air show history ( commonly referred to as the paris salon , or paris flight salon ) held from 15 october to 2 november 1910 together with henri fabre 's hydravion , the first floatplane , coandă 's aircraft and devices used for aerodynamic experiments were placed '' in solitary state '' in an upstairs gallery , separated from the more usual types of aircraft on the main exhibition floor in contrast to the monoplane described in the july 1910 patent application , the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction , but in return solved lateral stability control issues according to coandă 's description the wings were built with metal spars , but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure the trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing , and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit tubular radiators for engine cooling were located on either side of the cockpit four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large antoinette vii-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit , one on each side , and were used for pitch and directional control coandă simplified it and it was built from 15 independent elements made from cast aluminium that when assembled formed a more efficient director the new version of the propeller that the coandă 1910 machine was equipped with , was partially included in the next patent application which included the new director system but with a different rotor this was not tried , but hartmann concluded that the experiment proved that the solution worked perfectly he wrote that coandă answered his '' pressing—and indiscreet—questions '' about the turbo-propulseur-powered aircraft at that earlier exhibit , telling him that the machine had attained a speed of 112 & nbsp ; kilometres per hour ( 70 & nbsp ; mph ) during several '' flight tests '' , an improbable answer about which mirguet '' reserved judgment '' , waiting for confirmation that never materialised '' at the paris automobile exhibition of december 1910 – january 1911 , coandă presented a two-seat sled powered by '' coandă turbo-propeller '' 2nd construction variant '' with the help of despujols , a boat maker , and the motor manufacturer gregoire , coandă supervised the building of a motor sled , powered by a 30 & nbsp ; hp ( 22 & nbsp ; kw ) gregoire engine driving the turbo-propulseur a version of coandă 's turbo-propulseur design was shown for the second time in late 1910 at the grand palais of paris coandă described a different , more sturdy system for the attachment of the wings , which also enabled changes in the angle of attack and the centre of gravity '' major changes were made to the landing gear ; he fitted them with dampeners and retraction mechanisms , the whole assembly being located inside aerodynamic pants with skids on the external supports of the rotary engines he provided two supporting surfaces , he covered their accessories improving their aerodynamic , and together with the cruciform empennage they were intended to contribute to the longitudinal stability of the machine '' though coandă continued to study rotary propulsion mechanisms , antoniu believes that coandă never implemented a practical solution because of the lack of funds '' soon after , he dedicated himself to the study of rotary internal combustion engines , which presented the advantage of lower weights , increased efficiency and power when supercharged with air compressors however , this type of internal combustion engine featured the great disadvantage of insufficient cooling which coandă tried to reduce he designed a project for such an internal combustion engine , he was granted the patent fr443.531 , to which he made successive revisions through the patents 16.508 and 16.587 the very expensive project of 1910 , costing coandă about one million francs , left him with limited funds the possibility of a new contract with the french government led coandă to build the coandă-1911 he wished to win an army-organised competition at reims in october , one that required two engines in each aircraft as a fail-safe strategy '' at the third aviation salon in paris 1911 , coandă displayed a scale model of the aircraft which used two gnome rotary engines mounted back to back , connected by a bevel gear to a single two-bladed propeller during trials the assembly did not provide enough traction and a four-bladed propeller was ordered the mounting support of the engines , initially intended for a jet propulsion version , was not adequate for the new configuration so the forward chassis had to be modified antoniu ( 2010 ) , p in these conditions , he used a four-blade propeller made by joining two two-blade propellers the chassis , with two coupled engines , created for the reactive propulsion version , was not adequate for the new machine , so he built a frontal chassis that extended into a latticed truss that formed the load-bearing structure of the fuselage the aircraft was flown on 21 october 1911 , but with modest results as the latest modifications , especially those related to the powerplant , did not compensate for the increased total weight of the aircraft coandă and his 1910 aircraft were absent from much of aviation literature of the day in 1950 's l'aviation d'ader et des temps héroiques , the authors assert that coandă flew the first jet aircraft at issy-les-moulineaux for 30 & nbsp ; metres ( 100 & nbsp ; ft ) , ending with a crash '' in his publication of 1998 , world encyclopedia of aero engines : all major aircraft power plants , from the wright brothers to the present day , gunston did not include coanda ; nor did he include coanda in 2005 's jane 's aero-engines or 2006 's world encyclopedia of aero engines '' in a later magazine article sidebar , boyne described more details : '' romanian inventor henri coanda attempted to fly a primitive jet aircraft in 1910 , using a four-cylinder internal combustion engine to drive a compressor at 4,000 revolutions per minute '' in the 2000s , dan antoniu and other romanian aviation experts investigated existing photographs of the coandă-1910 , leading them to believe that the aircraft presented at the exhibition was not finished , that it was exhibited with many improvisations for instance , antoniu wrote that the exhaust pipes of the clergét engine appeared free ; there were no devices to redirect exhaust gases to the turbine as described in the patent , and there were no heat shields for crew protection in october 2010 the national bank of romania issued a commemorative coin for the centennial of the building of the first jet aircraft

coandă was interested in achieving reactive propelled flight as early as 1905 , conducting tests of rockets attached to model aircraft at the romanian army arsenal in bucharest in secret , at spandau in germany , coandă successfully tested a flying machine equipped with a single tractor propeller , and two counter-rotating propellers providing lift , powered by a 50-horsepower ( 37 & nbsp ; kw ) antoinette engine positioned along the fuselage centreline , the smaller rear lift propeller was mounted vertically , while the larger front one was inclined slightly forwards at 17 & nbsp ; degrees according to later claims , coandă tested the aircraft at kassel , witnessed by the chancellor of the german empire bernhard von bülow it was around this time that coandă 's interest in jet propulsion began , claiming that the aircraft and a jet-propelled model were displayed in december 1907 at the sporthalle indoor sports arena in berlin in 1909 he was employed as technical director of the liège-spa aeroclub , and at the end of that year , with the help of car manufacturer joachim he built the coandă-joachim glider with the opening of the école nationale supérieure de l'aéronautique et de l'espace on 15 november 1909 , coandă moved to paris helped by his schoolfriend cammarotta-adornoin , coandă started to build his slender sesquiplane and the unusual powerplant in a workshop in the courtyard of his house where he tested the thrust of the powerplant on a dynamometer , tests which are described in detail in the april 1910 edition of la technique aéronautique i do not dare however to make definitive pronouncements about their shape , as my experiments on this subject were not completed yet however , i hope that soon i will be able to restart my experiments at cie du nord who so generously put a train operating between paris and saint-quentin at my disposal coandă exhibited the aircraft at the paris air show history ( commonly referred to as the paris salon , or paris flight salon ) held from 15 october to 2 november 1910 together with henri fabre 's hydravion , the first floatplane , coandă 's aircraft and devices used for aerodynamic experiments were placed '' in solitary state '' in an upstairs gallery , separated from the more usual types of aircraft on the main exhibition floor in contrast to the monoplane described in the july 1910 patent application , the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction , but in return solved lateral stability control issues the cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires according to coandă 's description the wings were built with metal spars , but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure the fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large antoinette vii-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit , one on each side , and were used for pitch and directional control ( 'turbo ' was a term that described a rotor turning at high speeds of rotation ) according to later coandă descriptions , cast aluminium components were also made by clerget to create an engine with a weight of & ndash ; equivalent to a power-to-weight ratio of , a considerable achievement at the time coandă 's 1910s-era patents describe the inline piston engine 's exhaust gases as being routed through heating channels or heat exchangers in contact with the central air flow , then sucked into the compressor inlet to reduce back-pressure on the engine while adding more heat and mass to the airflow the powerplant was referred to in reports at the time by different terms : a turbine without propellers , turbo-propulseur , ducted fan the article included two sectional drawings of the engine the coandă-1910 was reportedly sold to charles weymann in october 1910 '' another bucharest newspaper listed the aircraft in november as '' sold twice-over '' at the exhibition , reaction among observers was mixed the reporter from la technique aeronautique wrote , '' in the absence of definitive trials , permitting the precise yield of this machine , it is without doubt premature to say it will supersede the propeller & nbsp ; '' the official exhibition report ignored the turbo-propulseur engine and instead described coandă 's novel wing design , and the unusual empennage a group of modern-day romanian investigators led by dan antoniu , having examined photographs from 1910 , concluded that the rotary compressor featured at the exhibition was a hybrid between the one described in the initial 30 may 1910 patent and that shown in a later patent application they felt that the exhibition machine had a simpler director system , a different rotor with a smaller intake cone , and that the exhaust gas heat transfer system had not been implemented the additional turbo-propulseur patent application 13.502 , dated 3 december 1910 , was implemented on a double-seat motorised sled commissioned by cyril vladimirovich , grand duke of russia '' at the paris automobile exhibition of december 1910 – january 1911 , coandă presented a two-seat sled powered by '' coandă turbo-propeller '' 2nd construction variant '' with the help of despujols , a boat maker , and the motor manufacturer gregoire , coandă supervised the building of a motor sled , powered by a 30 & nbsp ; hp ( 22 & nbsp ; kw ) gregoire engine driving the turbo-propulseur starting the next day , it was exhibited for two weeks at the 12th automobile salon of france , alongside gregoire-powered automobiles on the gregoire stand coandă continued to work on the coandă-1910 project at the beginning of 1911 , aiming to improve stability , increase the power of the turbo-propulseur , and to implement aerofoil improvements he applied for new patents for aerodynamic investigations and improvements of the coandă-1910 the placement of the engines indicates that coandă did not intend to inject fuel into the jet stream and ignite it as the cooling of the engines would have been compromised in the case in which fuel was introduced in the exhaust channel , the hot gases would have enveloped the two rotary engines depriving them of the necessary cooling '' major changes were made to the landing gear ; he fitted them with dampeners and retraction mechanisms , the whole assembly being located inside aerodynamic pants with skids '' though coandă continued to study rotary propulsion mechanisms , antoniu believes that coandă never implemented a practical solution because of the lack of funds antoniu ( 2010 ) , p however , this type of internal combustion engine featured the great disadvantage of insufficient cooling which coandă tried to reduce he designed a project for such an internal combustion engine , he was granted the patent fr443.531 , to which he made successive revisions through the patents 16.508 and 16.587 we found no information about the construction of this type of engine or any of the versions featuring the revisions '' in may 1911 coandă filed english-language patents on the turbo-propulseur design in the united kingdom and the united states , as well as a second french-language patent filed in switzerland , british patent gb191112740 ( a ) applied for may 26 , 1911 us patent 1104963 propeller the very expensive project of 1910 , costing coandă about one million francs , left him with limited funds he wished to win an army-organised competition at reims in october , one that required two engines in each aircraft as a fail-safe strategy ( photograph of coandă 's 1911 aircraft with propeller in the early 1950s coandă began to claim that he had flown his 1910 aircraft himself , and that the 1910 engine was the first motorjet , using fuel injection and combustion to create its thrust garber of the nasm interviewed coandă , who related that the december 1910 flight was no accident , that he had seated himself in the cockpit intending to test five factors : aircraft structure , the engine , the wing lift , the balance of controls , and the aerodynamics other aircraft tests and piloting activities were listed , with no mention of coandă or his machine boyne , director of the national air and space museum and a prolific aviation author , mentions coandă in passing a few times in his works the question of the coandă-1910 being the first jet aircraft does not appear to be resolved , supporting stine 's view : '' whether henri coanda built the first true jet will probably be argued interminably

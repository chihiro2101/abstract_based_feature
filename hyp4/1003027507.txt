coandă was interested in achieving reactive propelled flight as early as 1905 , conducting tests of rockets attached to model aircraft at the romanian army arsenal in bucharest in secret , at spandau in germany , coandă successfully tested a flying machine equipped with a single tractor propeller , and two counter-rotating propellers providing lift , powered by a 50-horsepower ( 37 & nbsp ; kw ) antoinette engine positioned along the fuselage centreline , the smaller rear lift propeller was mounted vertically , while the larger front one was inclined slightly forwards at 17 & nbsp ; degrees according to later claims , coandă tested the aircraft at kassel , witnessed by the chancellor of the german empire bernhard von bülow it was around this time that coandă 's interest in jet propulsion began , claiming that the aircraft and a jet-propelled model were displayed in december 1907 at the sporthalle indoor sports arena in berlin in 1909 he was employed as technical director of the liège-spa aeroclub , and at the end of that year , with the help of car manufacturer joachim he built the coandă-joachim glider with the opening of the école nationale supérieure de l'aéronautique et de l'espace on 15 november 1909 , coandă moved to paris as a continuation of his belgian experiments , and especially looking for a way to test wing aerofoils at higher speeds , he contacted ernest archdeacon , the co-founder of aéro-club de france , who in turn directed coandă to gustav eiffel and paul painlevé helped by his schoolfriend cammarotta-adornoin , coandă started to build his slender sesquiplane and the unusual powerplant in a workshop in the courtyard of his house where he tested the thrust of the powerplant on a dynamometer , tests which are described in detail in the april 1910 edition of la technique aéronautique these airscrews would provide a better efficiency compared to those used today i do not dare however to make definitive pronouncements about their shape , as my experiments on this subject were not completed yet however , i hope that soon i will be able to restart my experiments at cie du nord who so generously put a train operating between paris and saint-quentin at my disposal '' he filed for several patents for the mechanism and aircraft on 30 may 1910 , with later additions to the existing patents coandă exhibited the aircraft at the paris air show history ( commonly referred to as the paris salon , or paris flight salon ) held from 15 october to 2 november 1910 together with henri fabre 's hydravion , the first floatplane , coandă 's aircraft and devices used for aerodynamic experiments were placed '' in solitary state '' in an upstairs gallery , separated from the more usual types of aircraft on the main exhibition floor in contrast to the monoplane described in the july 1910 patent application , the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction , but in return solved lateral stability control issues according to coandă 's description the wings were built with metal spars , but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure the trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing , and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit the vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws according to later coandă descriptions , cast aluminium components were also made by clerget to create an engine with a weight of & ndash ; equivalent to a power-to-weight ratio of , a considerable achievement at the time the powerplant was referred to in reports at the time by different terms : a turbine without propellers , turbo-propulseur , ducted fan the article included two sectional drawings of the engine a daily newspaper from bucharest wrote in 1910 that the aircraft was constructed in clerget 's workshops and that it '' will fly in 6–7 weeks near paris , piloted by weymann , one of the pilots celebrated at the rennes aviation meeting '' the official exhibition report ignored the turbo-propulseur engine and instead described coandă 's novel wing design , and the unusual empennage a group of modern-day romanian investigators led by dan antoniu , having examined photographs from 1910 , concluded that the rotary compressor featured at the exhibition was a hybrid between the one described in the initial 30 may 1910 patent and that shown in a later patent application '' the complexity of the director , as it appears in the 1st patented version had major implications for the construction costs due to the multitude of elements that made it very difficult to build coandă simplified it and it was built from 15 independent elements made from cast aluminium that when assembled formed a more efficient director the new version of the propeller that the coandă 1910 machine was equipped with , was partially included in the next patent application which included the new director system but with a different rotor the additional turbo-propulseur patent application 13.502 , dated 3 december 1910 , was implemented on a double-seat motorised sled commissioned by cyril vladimirovich , grand duke of russia '' at the paris automobile exhibition of december 1910 – january 1911 , coandă presented a two-seat sled powered by '' coandă turbo-propeller '' 2nd construction variant the sledge was blessed by russian orthodox priests at the despujols plant near paris on 2 december 1910 a number of automobile and general interest magazines published photographs or sketches of the sledge a version of coandă 's turbo-propulseur design was shown for the second time in late 1910 at the grand palais of paris on the external supports of the rotary engines he provided two supporting surfaces , he covered their accessories improving their aerodynamic , and together with the cruciform empennage they were intended to contribute to the longitudinal stability of the machine '' though coandă continued to study rotary propulsion mechanisms , antoniu believes that coandă never implemented a practical solution because of the lack of funds '' soon after , he dedicated himself to the study of rotary internal combustion engines , which presented the advantage of lower weights , increased efficiency and power when supercharged with air compressors he designed a project for such an internal combustion engine , he was granted the patent fr443.531 , to which he made successive revisions through the patents 16.508 and 16.587 we found no information about the construction of this type of engine or any of the versions featuring the revisions the very expensive project of 1910 , costing coandă about one million francs , left him with limited funds stimulated by an eventual deal with the french government , coandă completed the project of a flying machine derived from the coandă no.1 of 1910 , as well as his latest projects protected by patents , which he modified as a result of the user 's demands '' at the third aviation salon in paris 1911 , coandă displayed a scale model of the aircraft which used two gnome rotary engines mounted back to back , connected by a bevel gear to a single two-bladed propeller the combination of two engines connected to one propeller was originally intended to drive a new turbine , but coandă was unable to fund one the chassis , with two coupled engines , created for the reactive propulsion version , was not adequate for the new machine , so he built a frontal chassis that extended into a latticed truss that formed the load-bearing structure of the fuselage the aircraft was flown on 21 october 1911 , but with modest results as the latest modifications , especially those related to the powerplant , did not compensate for the increased total weight of the aircraft though coandă had experimented with a variety of nozzles , and said that he had achieved a degree of success , no turbojet-engine-style fuel injection or combustion in the air stream was attempted coandă and his 1910 aircraft were absent from much of aviation literature of the day the soviet engineer nikolai rynin made no mention of coandă in his exhaustive nine-volume encyclopaedia on jet and rocket engines , written in the late 1920s and early '30s smith chronicled technological development in his book gas turbines and jet propulsion for aircraft , but did not mention coandă in their 1994 book american aviation , authors joe christy and leroy cook state that coandă 's 1910 aircraft was the first jet brown 's 1985 a history of aviation , tim brady , the dean of aviation at embry–riddle aeronautical university , wrote in 2000 : '' the development of the jet is , broadly , the story of three men : henri coanda , sir frank whittle , and pabst von ohain later , a plaque honouring coandă and romanian aviation engineer traian vuia was placed on a nearby building under the auspices of the mayor of issy-les-moulineaux , l'aéroclub de france , and the romanian association for aviation history in october 2010 the national bank of romania issued a commemorative coin for the centennial of the building of the first jet aircraft

coandă was interested in achieving reactive propelled flight as early as 1905 , conducting tests of rockets attached to model aircraft at the romanian army arsenal in bucharest in secret , at spandau in germany , coandă successfully tested a flying machine equipped with a single tractor propeller , and two counter-rotating propellers providing lift , powered by a 50-horsepower ( 37 & nbsp ; kw ) antoinette engine positioned along the fuselage centreline , the smaller rear lift propeller was mounted vertically , while the larger front one was inclined slightly forwards at 17 & nbsp ; degrees according to later claims , coandă tested the aircraft at kassel , witnessed by the chancellor of the german empire bernhard von bülow it was around this time that coandă 's interest in jet propulsion began , claiming that the aircraft and a jet-propelled model were displayed in december 1907 at the sporthalle indoor sports arena in berlin coandă continued his studies at liège , belgium , where with his roommate and friend giovanni battista caproni he built the coandă-caproni box glider , based on the plans of gliders designed by otto lilienthal and octave chanute which he previously studied at charlottenburg and spandau in 1909 he was employed as technical director of the liège-spa aeroclub , and at the end of that year , with the help of car manufacturer joachim he built the coandă-joachim glider with the opening of the école nationale supérieure de l'aéronautique et de l'espace on 15 november 1909 , coandă moved to paris as a continuation of his belgian experiments , and especially looking for a way to test wing aerofoils at higher speeds , he contacted ernest archdeacon , the co-founder of aéro-club de france , who in turn directed coandă to gustav eiffel and paul painlevé with their assistance , he gained approval to test different wing configurations and air resistance on a platform built by eiffel at the front of a locomotive on the north of france railway however , i hope that soon i will be able to restart my experiments at cie du nord who so generously put a train operating between paris and saint-quentin at my disposal coandă exhibited the aircraft at the paris air show history ( commonly referred to as the paris salon , or paris flight salon ) held from 15 october to 2 november 1910 together with henri fabre 's hydravion , the first floatplane , coandă 's aircraft and devices used for aerodynamic experiments were placed '' in solitary state '' in an upstairs gallery , separated from the more usual types of aircraft on the main exhibition floor the aircraft 's construction was a novelty for the time in contrast to the monoplane described in the july 1910 patent application , the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction , but in return solved lateral stability control issues according to coandă 's description the wings were built with metal spars , but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large antoinette vii-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit , one on each side , and were used for pitch and directional control '' the compressor , with a diameter of 50 & nbsp ; centimetres ( 20 & nbsp ; in ) , was located within a cowling at the front of the fuselage coandă 's 1910s-era patents describe the inline piston engine 's exhaust gases as being routed through heating channels or heat exchangers in contact with the central air flow , then sucked into the compressor inlet to reduce back-pressure on the engine while adding more heat and mass to the airflow the turbo-propulseur was claimed to be capable of generating of thrust the powerplant was referred to in reports at the time by different terms : a turbine without propellers , turbo-propulseur , ducted fan the article included two sectional drawings of the engine aviation reporters from the aero and la technique aeronautique were doubtful that the engine could provide sufficient thrust the engine was noted in the aero , reprinted in aircraft , as being '' of remarkably small proportions in relation to the size of the machine coandă 's new aeroplane will fly in 6–7 weeks near paris , piloted by weymann , one of the pilots celebrated at the rennes aviation meeting '' another bucharest newspaper listed the aircraft in november as '' sold twice-over '' it may be that weymann expressed his willingness to buy the aircraft once tests had been carried out others gave special notice to the coandă-1910 , calling it original and ingenious the reporter from la technique aeronautique wrote , '' in the absence of definitive trials , permitting the precise yield of this machine , it is without doubt premature to say it will supersede the propeller & nbsp ; '' the official exhibition report ignored the turbo-propulseur engine and instead described coandă 's novel wing design , and the unusual empennage a group of modern-day romanian investigators led by dan antoniu , having examined photographs from 1910 , concluded that the rotary compressor featured at the exhibition was a hybrid between the one described in the initial 30 may 1910 patent and that shown in a later patent application they felt that the exhibition machine had a simpler director system , a different rotor with a smaller intake cone , and that the exhaust gas heat transfer system had not been implemented '' at the paris automobile exhibition of december 1910 – january 1911 , coandă presented a two-seat sled powered by '' coandă turbo-propeller '' 2nd construction variant '' with the help of despujols , a boat maker , and the motor manufacturer gregoire , coandă supervised the building of a motor sled , powered by a 30 & nbsp ; hp ( 22 & nbsp ; kw ) gregoire engine driving the turbo-propulseur a number of automobile and general interest magazines published photographs or sketches of the sledge a version of coandă 's turbo-propulseur design was shown for the second time in late 1910 at the grand palais of paris coandă continued to work on the coandă-1910 project at the beginning of 1911 , aiming to improve stability , increase the power of the turbo-propulseur , and to implement aerofoil improvements coandă described a different , more sturdy system for the attachment of the wings , which also enabled changes in the angle of attack and the centre of gravity he aimed to obtain more power from the propulsion system , and design drawings show the arrangement of two air-cooled rotary engines on the sides of the fuselage '' one relevant aspect must be noted in the relation to the entire propulsion system that demonstrates that the reaction force was obtained only with air under pressure ( motofan ) like the engines of modern planes in the case in which fuel was introduced in the exhaust channel , the hot gases would have enveloped the two rotary engines depriving them of the necessary cooling '' major changes were made to the landing gear ; he fitted them with dampeners and retraction mechanisms , the whole assembly being located inside aerodynamic pants with skids '' though coandă continued to study rotary propulsion mechanisms , antoniu believes that coandă never implemented a practical solution because of the lack of funds however , this type of internal combustion engine featured the great disadvantage of insufficient cooling which coandă tried to reduce we found no information about the construction of this type of engine or any of the versions featuring the revisions at the military competition in reims in october 1911 , coandă displayed a large parasol wing with a wingspan , powered by two gnome rotary engines mounted laterally driving a single four-bladed propeller through an engine-coupling system also designed by coandă in 1953 , flights treatment of aircraft in the 50 years since the wright brothers ' flight included the coandă-1910 '' ducted fan '' and said of coandă that he '' believes that he 'took off for a few feet , then came down hurriedly and broke two teeth , quoting j.w stine gave his assessment that '' coanda 's turbopropulseur had elements of a true jet '' , but that the patent application had no indication of the '' critical stage—injection of fuel into the compressed air '' in 1960 , charles harvard gibbs-smith , aviation historian at the science museum in london , reacted to the mid-1950s assertion that coandă built and flew the first jet engine aircraft '' in 2007 in his popular book extreme aircraft , ron miller wrote that the powerplant in the coandă-1910 was one of the '' earliest attempts '' at a jet engine , but was unsuccessful—it was '' incapable of actual flight '' , unlike the engines designed by whittle and ohain at the site of the historic issy-les-moulineaux airfield , a large plaque lists the three pioneers of flight most closely associated with the airfield : louis blériot , alberto santos-dumont and henri farman it represents the aircraft on the obverse side and a portrait of coandă on the reverse , including romanian words which translate to '' first jet aircraft ''

diversity refers to the attributes that people use to confirm themselves with respect to others , “ that person is different from me ” these attributes include demographic factors ( such as race , gender , and age ) as well as values and cultural norms the more obvious cultural differences that exist between people are language , dress , and traditions , there are also significant variations in the way societies organize themselves , such as in their shared conception of morality , religious belief , and in the ways , they interact with their environment universal declaration on cultural diversity , article 1 the general conference of unesco took this position in 2001 , asserting in article 1 of the universal declaration on cultural diversity that '' firstly , like most evolutionary accounts of human nature , the importance of cultural diversity for survival may be an un-testable hypothesis , which can neither be proved nor disproved secondly , it can be argued that it is unethical deliberately to conserve '' less developed '' societies because this will deny people within those societies the benefits of technological and medical advances enjoyed by those in the '' developed '' world it is unethical to promote all religious practices simply because they are seen to contribute to cultural diversity ethical cultural relativism refers to the position that every action must be judged according to the standards of the culture to which the individual who performed it belongs one of the most pressing logical issues with cultural relativism is that it implies the impossibility of disagreements between cultures and that two contradictory statements can be true at the same time proponents of cultural relativism affirm that the disagreement is solved if the members of the two societies acknowledge that their affirmations about the status of women are just descriptive statements about the dominant cultural norms of their respective societies if cultural relativism is accepted , persons who belong to multiple cultures at the same time face ethical dilemmas which are unsolvable since cultural relativism acknowledges no higher moral standards which can arbitrate cultural contradictions due to its logical flaws and controversial implications , cultural relativism failed to attract widespread acceptance among ethical philosophers the universal declaration on cultural diversity adopted by unesco in 2001 is a legal instrument that recognizes cultural diversity as the '' common heritage of humanity '' and considers its safeguarding to be a concrete and ethical imperative inseparable from respect for human dignity the cultural exception highlights the specificity of cultural products and services , including special recognition by the european union in its declaration on cultural diversity the unesco universal declaration on cultural diversity , adopted by 185 member states in 2001 , represents the first international standard-setting instrument aimed at preserving and promoting cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue unesco convention on the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions ( 2005 ) unesco global alliance for cultural diversity cultural diversity in wiked broadcasting regulation and cultural diversity across cultures - films and articles on cultural diversity in canada at nfb.ca video on intercultural dialogue and the use of the ict for literacy

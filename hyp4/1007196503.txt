radio '' piracy '' began with the advent of regulations of the airwaves at the dawn of the age of radio initially , radio , or wireless as it was more commonly called at the time , was an open field of hobbyists and early inventors and experimenters the radio act of 1912 gave the president legal permission to shut down radio stations '' in time of war '' , and during the first two and a half years of world war i , before us entry , woodrow wilson tasked the us navy with monitoring us radio stations , nominally to '' ensure neutrality the navy took it a step further and declared it was illegal to listen to radio or possess a receiver or transmitter in the us , but there were doubts they had the authority to issue such an order even in war time the ban on radio was lifted in the us in late 1919 government to require stations to operate on specific frequencies , and the result was the passage of the radio act of 1927 to strengthen the government 's regulatory authority the audience in the united kingdom originally listened to their radio sets by permission of a radio licence issued by the british general post office ( gpo ) therefore , as far as the british authorities were concerned , radio luxembourg was a '' pirate radio station '' and british listeners to the station were breaking the law ( although as the term 'unauthorised ' was never properly defined it was somewhat of a legal grey area ) this did not stop british newspapers from printing programme schedules for the station , or a british weekly magazine aimed at teenage girls , fab 208 , from promoting the djs and their lifestyle ( radio luxembourg 's wavelength was 208 metres ( 1439 , then 1440 & nbsp ; khz ) ) radio luxembourg was later joined by other well-known pirate stations received in the uk in violation of uk licensing , including radio caroline and radio atlanta ( subsequently radio carolines north and south respectively , following their merger and the original ship 's relocation ) , radio london and laser 558 , all of which broadcast from vessels anchored outside of territorial limits and were therefore legitimate the term free radio was adopted by the free radio association of listeners who defended the rights of the offshore radio stations broadcasting from ships and marine structures off the coastline of the united kingdom f√©lix guattari points out : in europe , in addition to adopting the term free radio , supportive listeners of what had been called pirate radio adopted the term offshore radio , which was usually the term used by the owners of the marine broadcasting stations illegal use of licensed radio spectrum ( also known as bootlegging in cb circles ) is fairly common and takes several forms the films the boat that rocked , overseas re-titles included pirate radio ( us ) , good morning england ( france ) , radio rock revolution ( germany ) , the rock wave ( russia ) , and i love radio rock ( italy ) pump up the volume , and on the air live with captain midnight , as well as the tv series people just do nothing are set in the world of pirate radio , while born in flames features pirate radio stations as being part of an underground political movement .

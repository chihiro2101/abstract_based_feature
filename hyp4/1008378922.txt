frederick griffith was born in prescot , merseyside ( formerly in cheshire ) england , in late 1877 ( registered december quarter in prescot , lancashire registration district , vol 8b , page 670 ) , and attended liverpool university during world war i ( 1914–18 ) , the local government board 's laboratory was assumed by the national government , namely uk government , and became the ministry of health 's pathological laboratory—where griffith was medical officer griffith was sent pneumococci samples taken from patients throughout the country , amassed a large number , and would type—in other words classify—each pneumococci sample to search patterns of pneumonia epidemiology , and griffith experimented on mice for improved understanding of its pathology however , the r form , lacking a capsule—its outer surface being cell wall—is relatively avirulent , and does not cause pneumonia as often more accurately , point six of griffith 's abstract reports that r tended to transform into s if a large amount of live r , alone , were injected , and that adding much heat-killed s made transformation reliable griffith also induced some pneumococci to transform back and forth griffith also reported transformation of serology type—bacterial antigenicity—distinct from presence or absence of a capsule one of america 's most prominent pneumococcus experts , oswald avery , in new york at the rockefeller hospital—which opened in 1910 on the rockefeller institute 's campus—initially explained that griffith 's experiments must have been poorly conducted and succumbed to contamination avery biographer and colleague at the rockefeller institute , microbiologist rene dubos , recruited by the rockefeller institute from france , later described griffith 's findings as '' exploding a bombshell in the field of pneumococcal immunology '' avery 's associate martin dawson at the rockefeller hospital confirmed each of griffith 's reported findings the first griffith memorial lecture indicates that fred griffith died on the night of 17 april 1941 —though the fourth lecture indicates that he died in his apartment in february 1941 —alongside friend and colleague william m by 1967 pneumococcal transformation had been shown to occur in vivo naturally , and it was further shown that treatment with streptomycin during dual infection by two pneumococcal strains could increase transformation—and virulence—while for the first time pneumococcal transformation was shown to occur in the respiratory tract

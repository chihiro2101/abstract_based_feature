the species name infestans is the present participle of the latin verb , meaning : '' attacking , destroying '' , from which we get the word '' to infest '' the name phytophthora infestans was coined in 1876 by the german mycologist heinrich anton de bary ( 1831–1888 ) image : tomato with phytophthora infestans ( late blight ) jpg right thumb ripe tomato infected with blight jpg right thumb tomato plant infected with blight image : tomato late blight fruit cluster ( 5816739612 ) image : phytophtora infestans-effects.jpg right thumb potatoes infected with late blight are shrunken on the outside , corky and rotted inside the color of potato sign is white people can observe phytophthora infestans produce sporangia and sporangiophores on the surface of potato stems and leaves these sporangia and sporangiophores always appear on the lower surface of the foliage as for tuber blight , the white mycelium often shows on the tubers ' surface under ideal conditions , the life cycle can be completed on potato or tomato foliage in about five days sporangia develop on the leaves , spreading through the crop when temperatures are above and humidity is over 75–80 % for 2 days or more rain can wash spores into the soil where they infect young tubers , and the spores can also travel long distances on the wind symptoms include the appearance of dark blotches on leaf tips and plant stems white mold will appear under the leaves in humid conditions and the whole plant may quickly collapse infestans survives poorly in nature apart from its plant hosts the exceptions involve oospores , and hyphae present within tubers infestans is diploid , with about 11–13 chromosomes , and in 2009 scientists completed the sequencing of its genome proteins produced in the symplast included rxlr proteins , which contain an arginine-x-leucine-arginine ( where x can be any amino acid ) sequence at the amino terminus of the protein infestans was found to encode around 60 % more of these proteins than most other phytophthora species a recent study evaluated these two alternate hypotheses and found conclusive support for central mexico being the center of origin ( 2004 ) oospores of phytophthora infestans in soil provide an important new source of primary inoculum in finland infestans vary in their aggressiveness on potato or tomato , in sporulation rate , and sensitivity to fungicides potato and tomato varieties vary in their susceptibility to blight most early varieties are very vulnerable ; they should be planted early so that the crop matures before blight starts ( usually in july in the northern hemisphere ) some so-called resistant varieties can resist some strains of blight and not others , so their performance may vary depending on which are around fungicides for the control of potato blight are normally only used in a preventative manner , optionally in conjunction with disease forecasting in the past , copper ( ii ) sulfate solution ( called 'bluestone ' ) was used to combat potato blight late blight ( a2 type ) has not yet been detected in australia and strict biosecurity measures are in place the american phytopathological society plantvillage entry on late blight

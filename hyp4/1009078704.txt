the genus name phytophthora comes from the greek – , meaning : '' plant '' – plus the greek , meaning : '' decay , ruin , perish '' the species name infestans is the present participle of the latin verb , meaning : '' attacking , destroying '' , from which we get the word '' to infest '' the name phytophthora infestans was coined in 1876 by the german mycologist heinrich anton de bary ( 1831–1888 ) image : tomato with phytophthora infestans ( late blight ) jpg right thumb ripe tomato infected with blight image : tomato late blight stem lesion 3 ( 5816739322 ) jpg right thumb tomato plant infected with blight image : tomato late blight fruit cluster ( 5816739612 ) jpg right thumb unripe tomatoes infected with blight infestans on water films found on leaves or soils people can observe phytophthora infestans produce sporangia and sporangiophores on the surface of potato stems and leaves as for tuber blight , the white mycelium often shows on the tubers ' surface under ideal conditions , the life cycle can be completed on potato or tomato foliage in about five days rain can wash spores into the soil where they infect young tubers , and the spores can also travel long distances on the wind symptoms include the appearance of dark blotches on leaf tips and plant stems white mold will appear under the leaves in humid conditions and the whole plant may quickly collapse infestans survives poorly in nature apart from its plant hosts in particular , volunteer plants sprouting from infected tubers are thought to be a major source of inoculum at the start of a growing season infestans is diploid , with about 11–13 chromosomes , and in 2009 scientists completed the sequencing of its genome it also contained a diverse variety of transposons and many gene families encoding for effector proteins that are involved in causing pathogenicity infestans was found to encode around 60 % more of these proteins than most other phytophthora species infestans , although others have proposed its origin to be in the andes , which is also the origin of potatoes ( 2004 ) oospores of phytophthora infestans in soil provide an important new source of primary inoculum in finland infestans vary in their aggressiveness on potato or tomato , in sporulation rate , and sensitivity to fungicides there are many chemical options in agriculture for the control of both damage to the foliage and infections of the tuber if adequate field scouting occurs and late blight is found soon after disease development , localized patches of potato plants can be killed with a desiccant ( e.g once in storage , there is n't much that can be done besides emptying the parts of the bin that contain tubers infected with phytophthora infestans most early varieties are very vulnerable ; they should be planted early so that the crop matures before blight starts ( usually in july in the northern hemisphere ) managing late blight in organic tomato & potato crops a major late blight outbreak on potato in germany therefore went untreated , and the resulting scarcity of potatoes led to the deaths of 700,000 german civilians from starvation since 1941 , eastern africa has been suffering potato production losses because of strains of p

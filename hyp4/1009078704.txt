the genus name phytophthora comes from the greek – , meaning : '' plant '' – plus the greek , meaning : '' decay , ruin , perish '' the species name infestans is the present participle of the latin verb , meaning : '' attacking , destroying '' , from which we get the word '' to infest '' the name phytophthora infestans was coined in 1876 by the german mycologist heinrich anton de bary ( 1831–1888 ) image : tomato with phytophthora infestans ( late blight ) jpg right thumb ripe tomato infected with blight image : tomato late blight stem lesion 3 ( 5816739322 ) jpg right thumb tomato plant infected with blight jpg right thumb unripe tomatoes infected with blight image : phytophtora infestans-effects.jpg right thumb potatoes infected with late blight are shrunken on the outside , corky and rotted inside people can observe phytophthora infestans produce sporangia and sporangiophores on the surface of potato stems and leaves these sporangia and sporangiophores always appear on the lower surface of the foliage as for tuber blight , the white mycelium often shows on the tubers ' surface rain can wash spores into the soil where they infect young tubers , and the spores can also travel long distances on the wind under most conditions , the hyphae and asexual sporangia can survive for only brief periods in plant debris or soil , and are generally killed off during frosts or very warm weather infestans is diploid , with about 11–13 chromosomes , and in 2009 scientists completed the sequencing of its genome the genome was found to be considerably larger ( 240 mbp ) than that of most other phytophthora species whose genomes have been sequenced ; phytophthora sojae has a 95 mbp genome and phytophthora ramorum had a 65 mbp genome infestans was found to encode around 60 % more of these proteins than most other phytophthora species infestans , although others have proposed its origin to be in the andes , which is also the origin of potatoes until the 1970s , the a2 mating type was restricted to mexico , but now in many regions of the world both a1 and a2 isolates can be found in the same region ( 2004 ) oospores of phytophthora infestans in soil provide an important new source of primary inoculum in finland infestans vary in their aggressiveness on potato or tomato , in sporulation rate , and sensitivity to fungicides if adequate field scouting occurs and late blight is found soon after disease development , localized patches of potato plants can be killed with a desiccant ( e.g this management technique can be thought of as a field-scale hypersensitive response similar to what occurs in some plant-viral interactions whereby cells surrounding the initial point of infection are killed in order to prevent proliferation of the pathogen once in storage , there is n't much that can be done besides emptying the parts of the bin that contain tubers infected with phytophthora infestans the normal potatoes have blight but the cisgenic potatoes are healthy breeding for resistance , particularly in potato , has had limited success in part due to difficulties in crossing cultivated potato to its wild relatives , which are the source of potential resistance genes in the united states , the environmental protection agency has approved oxathiapiprolin for use against late blight managing late blight in organic tomato & potato crops all of the potato-growing countries in europe were affected , but the potato blight hit ireland the hardest after the blight strains potatoes of chiloé replaced earlier potatoes of peruvian origin in europe potato blight was one of more than 17 agents that the united states researched as potential biological weapons before the nation suspended its biological weapons program

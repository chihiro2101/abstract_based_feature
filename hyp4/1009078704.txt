the species name infestans is the present participle of the latin verb , meaning : '' attacking , destroying '' , from which we get the word '' to infest '' the name phytophthora infestans was coined in 1876 by the german mycologist heinrich anton de bary ( 1831–1888 ) image : tomato with phytophthora infestans ( late blight ) jpg right thumb ripe tomato infected with blight image : tomato late blight stem lesion 3 ( 5816739322 ) jpg right thumb tomato plant infected with blight image : tomato late blight fruit cluster ( 5816739612 ) jpg right thumb unripe tomatoes infected with blight image : phytophtora infestans-effects.jpg right thumb potatoes infected with late blight are shrunken on the outside , corky and rotted inside infestans on water films found on leaves or soils both sporangia and zoospores are short-lived , in contrast to oospores which can persist in a viable form for many years people can observe phytophthora infestans produce sporangia and sporangiophores on the surface of potato stems and leaves as for tuber blight , the white mycelium often shows on the tubers ' surface under ideal conditions , the life cycle can be completed on potato or tomato foliage in about five days sporangia develop on the leaves , spreading through the crop when temperatures are above and humidity is over 75–80 % for 2 days or more rain can wash spores into the soil where they infect young tubers , and the spores can also travel long distances on the wind symptoms include the appearance of dark blotches on leaf tips and plant stems some rxlr proteins are avirulence proteins , meaning that they can be detected by the plant and lead to a hypersensitive response which restricts the growth of the pathogen the highlands of central mexico are considered by many to be the center of origin of p on the other hand , the only close relative found in south america , namely p until the 1970s , the a2 mating type was restricted to mexico , but now in many regions of the world both a1 and a2 isolates can be found in the same region only in mexico and scandinavia , however , is oospore formation thought to play a role in overwintering infestans vary in their aggressiveness on potato or tomato , in sporulation rate , and sensitivity to fungicides many of the strains that appeared outside of mexico since the 1980s have been more aggressive , leading to increased crop losses in addition , most resistance genes only work against a subset of p often discarded potatoes from the previous season and self-sown tubers can act as sources of inoculum fungicides for the control of potato blight are normally only used in a preventative manner , optionally in conjunction with disease forecasting this normally involves piling soil or mulch around the stems of the potato blight meaning the pathogen has farther to travel to get to the tuber after the blight strains potatoes of chiloé replaced earlier potatoes of peruvian origin in europe potato blight was one of more than 17 agents that the united states researched as potential biological weapons before the nation suspended its biological weapons program lists general information and resources for late blight

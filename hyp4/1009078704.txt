the species name infestans is the present participle of the latin verb , meaning : '' attacking , destroying '' , from which we get the word '' to infest '' the name phytophthora infestans was coined in 1876 by the german mycologist heinrich anton de bary ( 1831–1888 ) image : tomato with phytophthora infestans ( late blight ) jpg right thumb ripe tomato infected with blight image : tomato late blight stem lesion 3 ( 5816739322 ) jpg right thumb tomato plant infected with blight image : tomato late blight fruit cluster ( 5816739612 ) jpg right thumb unripe tomatoes infected with blight image : phytophtora infestans-effects.jpg right thumb potatoes infected with late blight are shrunken on the outside , corky and rotted inside the color of potato sign is white people can observe phytophthora infestans produce sporangia and sporangiophores on the surface of potato stems and leaves under ideal conditions , the life cycle can be completed on potato or tomato foliage in about five days sporangia develop on the leaves , spreading through the crop when temperatures are above and humidity is over 75–80 % for 2 days or more infestans survives poorly in nature apart from its plant hosts it also contained a diverse variety of transposons and many gene families encoding for effector proteins that are involved in causing pathogenicity proteins produced in the symplast included rxlr proteins , which contain an arginine-x-leucine-arginine ( where x can be any amino acid ) sequence at the amino terminus of the protein the highlands of central mexico are considered by many to be the center of origin of p ( 2004 ) oospores of phytophthora infestans in soil provide an important new source of primary inoculum in finland infestans vary in their aggressiveness on potato or tomato , in sporulation rate , and sensitivity to fungicides many of the strains that appeared outside of mexico since the 1980s have been more aggressive , leading to increased crop losses some of the differences between strains may be related to variation in the rxlr effectors that are present a few of the most common foliar-applied fungicides are ridomil , a gavel/supertin tank mix , and previcur flex all of the aforementioned fungicides need to be tank mixed with a broad-spectrum fungicide such as mancozeb or chlorothalonil not just for resistance management but also because the potato plants will be attacked by other pathogens at the same time image : cisgenicpotatoes.jpg thumb right potatoes after exposure to phytophthora infestans many old crop varieties , such as king edward potato are also very susceptible but are grown because they are wanted commercially these crops have had polygenic resistance bred into them , and are known as '' field resistant '' often these are deployed as part of decision support systems accessible through web sites or smart phones in the united states , the environmental protection agency has approved oxathiapiprolin for use against late blight all of the potato-growing countries in europe were affected , but the potato blight hit ireland the hardest potato blight was one of more than 17 agents that the united states researched as potential biological weapons before the nation suspended its biological weapons program late blight ( a2 type ) has not yet been detected in australia and strict biosecurity measures are in place

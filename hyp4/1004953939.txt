carl auer was born in vienna on 1 september 1858 to therese neuditschka and alois auer in 1878 auer entered the university of vienna , studying mathematics , general chemistry , engineering physics , and thermodynamics in 1885 , auer von welsbach used a method of fractional crystallization that he had developed himself to separate the alloy didymium into its two parts , for the first time after 167 crystallizations , auer von welsbach differentiated it into two colored salts : he named the green colored salt '' praseodymium '' and the pink one '' neodidymium '' the rare earth element lutetium was independently discovered by three scientists at around the same time in 1907 : french scientist georges urbain , austrian auer von welsbach , and american charles james to name the newly discovered fraction , urbain suggested the name '' lutecium '' , for the roman city of lutetia that preceded paris auer von welsbach suggested the name '' cassiopeium '' to produce a mantle , guncotton is impregnated with a mixture of actinophor and then heated , the cotton eventually burns away , leaving a solid ( albeit fragile ) ash , which glows brightly when heated in 1890 he introduced a new form of the mantle based on a mixture of 99 % thorium dioxide and 1 % cerium ( iv ) oxide , which he developed in collaboration with his colleague ludwig haitinger auer von welsbach then started work on development of metal-filament mantles , first with platinum wiring , and then osmium osmium is very difficult to work with , but he developed a new method , which mixed osmium oxide powder with rubber or sugar into a paste , which is then squeezed through a nozzle and fired in 1903 auer von welsbach won another patent for a fire striker ( '' flint '' ) composition named ferrocerium in auer von welsbach 's first alloy , 30 % iron ( ferrum ) was added to purified cerium , hence the name '' ferro-cerium '' meyer and his staff do not appear to have had the chemical knowledge to understand auer von welsbach 's methods , and auer von welsbach resigned around 1917 in 2008 ( 150 years after his birth ) auer von welsbach was selected as a main motif for a high-value collectors ' coin : the austrian â‚¬25 fascination light he was also depicted on postage stamps of 1936 , carl auer von welsbach , postage stamp 1936 , colnect 1954 5th memorial anniversary of dr

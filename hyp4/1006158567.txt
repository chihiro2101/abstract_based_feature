in the early 17th century most of the bohemian estates , although under the dominion of the predominantly roman catholic holy roman empire , had large protestant populations , and had been granted rights and protections allowing them varying degrees of religious and political freedom in 1617 , as the health of emperor matthias deteriorated , his cousin ferdinand – a fiercely devout roman catholic and proponent of the counter-reformation – was named his successor as holy roman emperor and king of bohemia this led to deep consternation among many bohemian protestants , who feared not only the loss of their properties , but also of their traditional semi-autonomy , under which many of the estates had separate , individual constitutions governing their relationship with the empire , and where the king was elected by the local leaders ferdinand ( who would become emperor ferdinand ii following matthias ' death in 1619 ) saw protestantism as inimical to the empire , and wanted to impose absolutist rule on bohemia while encouraging conversion to the catholic faith he also hoped to reclaim church properties which had been seized by protestants at the start of the reformation decades earlier , and to do away with the electorate - the body of princes who chose the holy roman emperor and who had considerable power over imperial policy king frederick and his military commander , prince christian of anhalt , had organized a protestant army of 30,000 men ; ferdinand countered with a force of 25,000 , many of them seasoned soldiers , under the capable leadership of field marshal tilly , a roman catholic spanish-flemish nobleman tilly 's force was made up of two distinct groups : imperial troops commanded by charles bonaventure de longueval , count of bucquoy , and soldiers of the german catholic league , directly under tilly he thus gained an advantageous position on the '' white mountain '' , actually a low plateau , but had little time to set up defensive works after the reverses of the previous several weeks , christian of anhalt 's army had been reduced to about 15,000 men , with little prospect of victory ; the mercenaries on both sides had not been paid in months ; and with winter approaching , cold , wet , weather made for less than ideal combat conditions the cavalry charged into the imperial infantry , causing significant casualties , but tilly countered with his own cavalry , forcing the bohemian horsemen to retire the bohemian infantry , who were only now approaching the imperial army , saw the cavalry retreating , at which they fired one volley at extreme range before retreating themselves tilly and his imperial cavalrymen advanced with 2,000 bavarian hussars , steadily pushing protestant forces back to the star palace ( just west of prague ) , where the rebels tried without success to establish a line of defense with the bohemian army destroyed , tilly entered prague and the revolt collapsed library of congress there remained a strong protestant army in silesia under the command of johann georg von brandenburg , duke of krnov , which continued fighting the imperial army in moravia and in what today is slovakia until 1623 the kingdom of bohemia during the thirty years´ war the result of the 1620 battle brought two centuries of recatholicization of the czech lands and the decline of the czech-speaking aristocracy and elite as well as the czech language ( accompanied with the growing influence of german-speaking elites ) , a process that was slowed by the czech national revival starting in the late 18th century

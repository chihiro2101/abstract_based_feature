in the early 17th century most of the bohemian estates , although under the dominion of the predominantly roman catholic holy roman empire , had large protestant populations , and had been granted rights and protections allowing them varying degrees of religious and political freedom in 1617 , as the health of emperor matthias deteriorated , his cousin ferdinand – a fiercely devout roman catholic and proponent of the counter-reformation – was named his successor as holy roman emperor and king of bohemia this led to deep consternation among many bohemian protestants , who feared not only the loss of their properties , but also of their traditional semi-autonomy , under which many of the estates had separate , individual constitutions governing their relationship with the empire , and where the king was elected by the local leaders ferdinand ( who would become emperor ferdinand ii following matthias ' death in 1619 ) saw protestantism as inimical to the empire , and wanted to impose absolutist rule on bohemia while encouraging conversion to the catholic faith he also hoped to reclaim church properties which had been seized by protestants at the start of the reformation decades earlier , and to do away with the electorate - the body of princes who chose the holy roman emperor and who had considerable power over imperial policy particularly galling to protestants were perceived violations of emperor rudolf ii 's 1609 letter of majesty , which had ensured religious freedom throughout bohemia in may , 1618 , wanting to air their grievances over this and other issues , a group of bohemian noblemen met representatives of the emperor at the prague castle ; the meeting ended with two of the representatives and their scribe being thrown out a high window and seriously injured battles of the thirty years war from white mountain to nordlingen , 1618–1635 king frederick and his military commander , prince christian of anhalt , had organized a protestant army of 30,000 men ; ferdinand countered with a force of 25,000 , many of them seasoned soldiers , under the capable leadership of field marshal tilly , a roman catholic spanish-flemish nobleman tilly 's force was made up of two distinct groups : imperial troops commanded by charles bonaventure de longueval , count of bucquoy , and soldiers of the german catholic league , directly under tilly force-marching his men , christian of anhalt managed to get ahead of the imperial army just before prague he thus gained an advantageous position on the '' white mountain '' , actually a low plateau , but had little time to set up defensive works a small group of imperial cavalry began circling the protestant forces , driving them to the middle of the battlefield file : white mountain plan.jpg plan of the battle from theatrum europaeum : bohemians above , imperial and bavarian forces below file : battle of white mountain ( 1620 ) -nl.svg battle of white mountain ( 1620 ) bellum.cz – '' battle of white mountain 8th november 1620 ''

in the early 17th century most of the bohemian estates , although under the dominion of the predominantly roman catholic holy roman empire , had large protestant populations , and had been granted rights and protections allowing them varying degrees of religious and political freedom in 1617 , as the health of emperor matthias deteriorated , his cousin ferdinand – a fiercely devout roman catholic and proponent of the counter-reformation – was named his successor as holy roman emperor and king of bohemia this led to deep consternation among many bohemian protestants , who feared not only the loss of their properties , but also of their traditional semi-autonomy , under which many of the estates had separate , individual constitutions governing their relationship with the empire , and where the king was elected by the local leaders ferdinand ( who would become emperor ferdinand ii following matthias ' death in 1619 ) saw protestantism as inimical to the empire , and wanted to impose absolutist rule on bohemia while encouraging conversion to the catholic faith in may , 1618 , wanting to air their grievances over this and other issues , a group of bohemian noblemen met representatives of the emperor at the prague castle ; the meeting ended with two of the representatives and their scribe being thrown out a high window and seriously injured battles of the thirty years war from white mountain to nordlingen , 1618–1635 in november 1619 , elector palatine frederick v , who like many of the rebels was a calvinist , was chosen as king of bohemia by the bohemian electorate king frederick and his military commander , prince christian of anhalt , had organized a protestant army of 30,000 men ; ferdinand countered with a force of 25,000 , many of them seasoned soldiers , under the capable leadership of field marshal tilly , a roman catholic spanish-flemish nobleman tilly 's force was made up of two distinct groups : imperial troops commanded by charles bonaventure de longueval , count of bucquoy , and soldiers of the german catholic league , directly under tilly after conquering most of western bohemia , the imperial army made for prague , the bohemian capital , then in rebel hands the bohemians attempted to block them by setting up defensive positions , which the imperial army simply bypassed force-marching his men , christian of anhalt managed to get ahead of the imperial army just before prague he thus gained an advantageous position on the '' white mountain '' , actually a low plateau , but had little time to set up defensive works with the bohemian army already demoralized , company after company began retreating , most without having actually entered the battle file : white mountain plan.jpg plan of the battle from theatrum europaeum : bohemians above , imperial and bavarian forces below file : battle of white mountain ( 1620 ) -nl.svg battle of white mountain ( 1620 )

it was eventually used as a space launch vehicle the second stage engine ignites shortly before separation of the first stage and the lattice allows the exhaust to escape the first stage of the proton rocket at russian space web a rushed development program led to dozens of failures between 1965 and 1972 proton 's design was kept secret until 1986 , with the public being only shown the upper stages in film clips and photographs , and the first time the complete vehicle was shown to the outside world happened during the televised launch of mir proton launched the uncrewed soviet circumlunar flights and was intended to have launched the first crewed soviet circumlunar spaceflights , before the united states flew the apollo 8 mission proton also launches commercial satellites , most of them being managed by international launch services the first ils proton launch was on 9 april 1996 with the launch of the ses astra 1f communications satellite in june 2018 , the state corporation roscosmos announced that the proton rocket would cease production as the new angara launch vehicle comes on line and becomes operational this avoids the need for components that are tolerant of low temperatures , and allows the rocket to remain on the pad indefinitely ( other launchers with such capability include the u.s the blok d/dm were unusual in that the fuel was stored in a toroidal tank , around the engine and behind the oxidizer tank when the soviet space station program began in 1971 , protons began being flown with the blok d removed for use as a heavy-lift leo launcher it was intended to launch the crewed tks spacecraft , prior to the cancellation of that programme , although a few robotic flights of spacecraft were fulfilled the initial version of proton m , could launch into geostationary orbit or into a geostationary transfer orbit on 6 august 2012 , the russian federal space agency lost a russian and an indonesian communications satellite in an attempt to launch them into orbit on a proton-m due to technical difficulties with the last stage proton launches page on lyngsat proton rocket specifications sheet proton m debuts with successful ekran launch on april 7 , 2001 proton 8k82k / briz-m fas – proton launch vehicle ils proton proton launch schedules on satlaunch слабое звено – '' бриз-м ''

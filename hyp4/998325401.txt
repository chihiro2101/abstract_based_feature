proton started its life as a '' super heavy icbm '' it was eventually used as a space launch vehicle the second stage engine ignites shortly before separation of the first stage and the lattice allows the exhaust to escape the first stage of the proton rocket at russian space web a rushed development program led to dozens of failures between 1965 and 1972 proton 's design was kept secret until 1986 , with the public being only shown the upper stages in film clips and photographs , and the first time the complete vehicle was shown to the outside world happened during the televised launch of mir proton also launches commercial satellites , most of them being managed by international launch services the first ils proton launch was on 9 april 1996 with the launch of the ses astra 1f communications satellite in june 2018 , the state corporation roscosmos announced that the proton rocket would cease production as the new angara launch vehicle comes on line and becomes operational no new launch service contracts for proton are likely to be signed a number of roscosmos and other russian government missions remain on proton launch manifest the blok d/dm were unusual in that the fuel was stored in a toroidal tank , around the engine and behind the oxidizer tank it was intended to launch the crewed tks spacecraft , prior to the cancellation of that programme , although a few robotic flights of spacecraft were fulfilled the initial version of proton m , could launch into geostationary orbit or into a geostationary transfer orbit on 6 august 2012 , the russian federal space agency lost a russian and an indonesian communications satellite in an attempt to launch them into orbit on a proton-m due to technical difficulties with the last stage on 16 may 2015 , a mexsat communications satellite failed to orbit due to another third stage malfunction , the eighth proton failure since 2010 fas – proton launch vehicle ils proton proton launch schedules on satlaunch слабое звено – '' бриз-м ''

it was designed to launch a 100-megaton ( or larger ) thermonuclear weapon over a distance of 13,000 & nbsp ; km it was eventually used as a space launch vehicle the second stage engine ignites shortly before separation of the first stage and the lattice allows the exhaust to escape the first stage of the proton rocket at russian space web a rushed development program led to dozens of failures between 1965 and 1972 mass-production of guidance , navigation and control system for proton has begun in 1964 on '' communard '' industrial association ( kharkov , ukraine ) proton also launches commercial satellites , most of them being managed by international launch services the first ils proton launch was on 9 april 1996 with the launch of the ses astra 1f communications satellite in june 2018 , the state corporation roscosmos announced that the proton rocket would cease production as the new angara launch vehicle comes on line and becomes operational no new launch service contracts for proton are likely to be signed proton flew its last scheduled commercial mission on 9 october 2019 , delivering eutelsat 5 west b and mission extension vehicle-1 to geostationary orbit a number of roscosmos and other russian government missions remain on proton launch manifest the initial proton tests in 1965–66 only used the first two stages of the booster , the complete four-stage vehicle being flown for the first time in 1967 the initial version of proton m , could launch into geostationary orbit or into a geostationary transfer orbit it could place up to in low earth orbit with a 51.6-degree inclination , the orbit of the international space station ( iss ) heavy variants of angara will be simpler and cheaper than proton ( and like the atlas v rocket , will not use hypergolic fuels ; instead , it will use the same rp-1 fuel as that used on the soyuz rocket ) fas – proton launch vehicle ils proton proton launch schedules on satlaunch слабое звено – '' бриз-м ''

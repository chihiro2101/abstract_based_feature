in the post-medieval period , some natural waterways were '' canalised '' or improved for boat traffic in the 16th century the first act of parliament was obtained by the city of canterbury in 1515 , to extend navigation on the river stour in kent , followed by the river exe in 1539 , which led to the construction in 1566 of a new channel , the exeter canal chapter 2 : the river navigations simple flash locks were provided to regulate the flow of water and allow loaded boats to pass through shallow waters by admitting a rush of water , but these were not purpose-built canals as we understand them today the transport system that existed before the canals were built consisted of coastal shipping and horses and carts struggling along mostly unsurfaced mud roads ( although there were some surfaced turnpike roads ) the restrictions of coastal shipping and river transport were obvious , and horses and carts could only carry one or two tons of cargo at a time some 29 river navigation improvements took place in the 16th and 17th centuries dictionary of national biography - sir richard weston in 1670 the stamford canal opened , indistinguishable from 18th century examples with a dedicated cut and double-door locks history of burton from 'british history online ' subsequently , the kennet built by john hore opened in 1723 , the mersey and irwell opened in 1725 , and the bristol avon in 1727 thacker the thames highway : volume ii locks and weirs 1920 - republished 1968 david & charles the net effect of these was to bring most of england , with the notable exceptions of birmingham and staffordshire , within of a waterway eventually , the experience of building long multi-level cuts with their own locks gave rise to the idea of building a '' pure '' canal , a waterway designed on the basis of where goods needed to go , not where a river happened to be they supported the industries that allowed the country to become the world 's first industrial power and created the wealth that led to the british empire in the victorian era the canals were built because they offered the most economic and reliable way to transport goods and commodities in large quantities the navigable water network grew rapidly at first and became an almost completely connected transport network in addition to the building of new canals , older canals were improved the canal fuelled the growth of the chemical industry in widnes , which subsequently became the epicentre of the industry in england in the mid-18th century the 3rd duke of bridgewater built the bridgewater canal its purpose was to transport coal from his mines to the industrialising city of manchester he commissioned the engineer james brindley to build the canal ; the design included an aqueduct carrying the canal over the river irwell canal boats could carry thirty tons at a time ; one horse could tow more than ten times the amount of cargo that was possible with a cart the canal was a huge financial success and repaid the cost of its construction within just a few years the 19th century saw some major new canals such as the caledonian canal and the manchester ship canal the boats on the canals were horse-drawn with a towpath alongside the canal for the horse to walk along during the latter part of the 19th century the boat decoration of roses and castles began to appear the period between the 1770s and the 1830s is often referred to as the '' golden age '' of british canals during this period of canal mania , huge sums were invested in canal building the canal system expanded to nearly 4,000 miles ( 6,400 kilometres ) in length within just a few years an embryonic national canal network came into being canal proposals were put forward by financial investors interested in profiting from dividends , as well as industrial businesses that wanted to move their raw materials and finished goods speculators would try to buy shares in a newly floated company to sell them on for a profit , regardless of whether the canal was ever profitable , or even built on the majority of british canals , the canal-owning companies did not own or run a fleet of boats , since the acts of parliament setting them up usually prohibited this , in order to prevent monopolies developing trains could not only carry more than the canals but could transport people and goods far more quickly than the walking pace of the canal boats by the second half of the 19th century , many canals were increasingly becoming owned by railway company or competing with them , and many were in decline , with decreases in mile-ton charges to try to remain competitive after this , the less successful canals ( particularly narrow-locked canals , whose boats could only carry about thirty tons ) failed quickly canal companies were unable to compete against the speed of the new railways , and in order to survive , they had to slash their prices this became standard practice across the canal system , with in many cases families with several children living in tiny boat cabins , creating a considerable community of boat people sometimes this was a tactical move by railway companies to gain ground in their competitors ' territory , but sometimes canal companies were bought out either to close them down and remove competition , or to build a railway on the line of the canal during the 19th century in much of continental europe the canal systems of many countries such as france , germany and the netherlands were modernised and widened to take much larger boats the only significant exception to this was the modernisation carried out on the grand union canal in the 1930s thus , almost uniquely in europe , many of the uk 's canals remain as they have been since the 18th and 19th century : mostly operated with narrowboats an exception to this stagnation was the manchester ship canal , newly built in the 1890s using the existing river irwell and river mersey , to take ocean-going ships into the centre of manchester via its neighbour salford most of the canal system and inland waterways were nationalised in 1948 and came under the control of the british transport commission , whose subsidiary , the docks and inland waterways executive , managed them into the 1950s three bridges , london is a clever arrangement allowing the routes of the grand junction canal , a road , and a railway line to cross each other a more direct route between london and the national canal network , the grand junction canal , opened in 1805 these were thames and severn canal which linked to the stroudwater navigation , the kennet and avon canal and the wilts and berks canal , which linked to these three rivers canals of the united kingdom list of canals in ireland timeline of transportation technology list of canal tunnels in the united kingdom list of canal aqueducts in the united kingdom list of canal locks in the united kingdom

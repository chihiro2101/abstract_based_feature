in the post-medieval period , some natural waterways were '' canalised '' or improved for boat traffic in the 16th century the first act of parliament was obtained by the city of canterbury in 1515 , to extend navigation on the river stour in kent , followed by the river exe in 1539 , which led to the construction in 1566 of a new channel , the exeter canal the transport system that existed before the canals were built consisted of coastal shipping and horses and carts struggling along mostly unsurfaced mud roads ( although there were some surfaced turnpike roads ) in the 17th century , as early industry started to expand , this transport situation was highly unsatisfactory the restrictions of coastal shipping and river transport were obvious , and horses and carts could only carry one or two tons of cargo at a time because of the small loads that could be carried , supplies of essential commodities such as coal and iron ore were limited , and this kept prices high and restricted economic growth one horse-drawn canal barge could carry about thirty tonnes at a time , faster than road transport and at half the cost chapter 2 : the river navigations in 1605 , the government of king james i established the oxford-burcot commission , which began to improve the system of locks and weirs on the river thames , which were opened between oxford and abingdon by 1635 thacker the thames highway : volume i general history 1920 - republished 1968 david & charles in 1635 sir richard weston was appointed to develop the river wey navigation , making guildford accessible by 1653 dictionary of national biography - sir richard weston in 1670 the stamford canal opened , indistinguishable from 18th century examples with a dedicated cut and double-door locks in 1699 legislation was passed to permit the aire & calder navigation which was opened 1703 , and the trent navigation which was built by george hayne and opened in 1712 history of burton from 'british history online ' subsequently , the kennet built by john hore opened in 1723 , the mersey and irwell opened in 1725 , and the bristol avon in 1727 john smeaton was the engineer of the calder & hebble which opened in 1758 , and a series of eight pound locks was built to replace flash locks on the river thames between maidenhead and reading , beginning in 1772 eventually , the experience of building long multi-level cuts with their own locks gave rise to the idea of building a '' pure '' canal , a waterway designed on the basis of where goods needed to go , not where a river happened to be the canal fuelled the growth of the chemical industry in widnes , which subsequently became the epicentre of the industry in england he commissioned the engineer james brindley to build the canal ; the design included an aqueduct carrying the canal over the river irwell chapter 3 : building the canals the construction of the bridgewater canal was funded entirely by the duke canal boats could carry thirty tons at a time ; one horse could tow more than ten times the amount of cargo that was possible with a cart the bridgewater canal reduced the price of coal in manchester by nearly two-thirds within a year of its opening the canal was a huge financial success and repaid the cost of its construction within just a few years the 19th century saw some major new canals such as the caledonian canal and the manchester ship canal the boats on the canals were horse-drawn with a towpath alongside the canal for the horse to walk along commercial horse-drawn canal boats could be seen on the uk 's canals until as late as the 1950s , although by then diesel powered boats , often towing a second unpowered boat , had become standard within just a few years an embryonic national canal network came into being speculators would try to buy shares in a newly floated company to sell them on for a profit , regardless of whether the canal was ever profitable , or even built rival canal companies were formed , and competition was rampant for many years , a dispute about tolls meant that goods travelling through birmingham had to be moved from boats in one canal to boats in the other this put an end to the huge profits that canal companies had enjoyed before the coming of the railways , and also had an effect on the boatmen who faced a drop in wages by the 1850s the railway system had become well established and the amount of cargo carried on the canals had fallen by nearly two-thirds , lost mostly to railway competition sometimes this was a tactical move by railway companies to gain ground in their competitors ' territory , but sometimes canal companies were bought out either to close them down and remove competition , or to build a railway on the line of the canal during the 19th century in much of continental europe the canal systems of many countries such as france , germany and the netherlands were modernised and widened to take much larger boats thus , almost uniquely in europe , many of the uk 's canals remain as they have been since the 18th and 19th century : mostly operated with narrowboats an exception to this stagnation was the manchester ship canal , newly built in the 1890s using the existing river irwell and river mersey , to take ocean-going ships into the centre of manchester via its neighbour salford most of the canal system and inland waterways were nationalised in 1948 and came under the control of the british transport commission , whose subsidiary , the docks and inland waterways executive , managed them into the 1950s a report in 1955 by the british transport commission placed the canals into three categories according to their economic prospects ; waterways to be developed , waterways to be retained , and waterways having insufficient commercial prospects to justify their retention for navigation during the 1950s and 1960s freight transport on the canals declined rapidly in the face of mass road transport but many factories that had formerly used coal either switched to using other fuels , often because of the clean air act 1956 , or closed completely by this time the canal network had shrunk to 2,000 miles ( 3,000 & nbsp ; kilometres ) , half the size it was at its peak in the early 19th century the transport act 1968 required the british waterways board to keep commercial waterways fit for commercial use , and cruising waterways fit for cruising the narrow locks on the trent and mersey limited the width ( beam ) of the boats ( which came to be called narrowboats ) , and thus limited the quantity of the cargo they could carry to around thirty tonnes canal aqueducts are structures that carry a canal across a valley , road , railway , or another canal later in the 18th century , the leeds and liverpool canal was constructed , creating an east-west link , giving access to the port at liverpool allowing export of finished goods london is a port , and as early as 1790 london was linked to the national network via the river thames and the oxford canal these were thames and severn canal which linked to the stroudwater navigation , the kennet and avon canal and the wilts and berks canal , which linked to these three rivers ( 2006 ) the illustrated history of canal & river navigations : landmark publishing ltd

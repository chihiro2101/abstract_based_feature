in the post-medieval period , some natural waterways were '' canalised '' or improved for boat traffic in the 16th century in the 17th century , as early industry started to expand , this transport situation was highly unsatisfactory one horse-drawn canal barge could carry about thirty tonnes at a time , faster than road transport and at half the cost john smeaton was the engineer of the calder & hebble which opened in 1758 , and a series of eight pound locks was built to replace flash locks on the river thames between maidenhead and reading , beginning in 1772 eventually , the experience of building long multi-level cuts with their own locks gave rise to the idea of building a '' pure '' canal , a waterway designed on the basis of where goods needed to go , not where a river happened to be the uk was the first country to develop a nationwide canal network the canals caused a great change in the economy of britain the navigable water network grew rapidly at first and became an almost completely connected transport network the sankey canal was the first british canal of the industrial revolution , opening in 1757 in the mid-18th century the 3rd duke of bridgewater built the bridgewater canal its purpose was to transport coal from his mines to the industrialising city of manchester he commissioned the engineer james brindley to build the canal ; the design included an aqueduct carrying the canal over the river irwell chapter 3 : building the canals the construction of the bridgewater canal was funded entirely by the duke the bridgewater canal reduced the price of coal in manchester by nearly two-thirds within a year of its opening the canal was a huge financial success and repaid the cost of its construction within just a few years the 19th century saw some major new canals such as the caledonian canal and the manchester ship canal the new canals proved highly successful this horse-drawn system proved to be highly economical and became standard across the british canal network the period between the 1770s and the 1830s is often referred to as the '' golden age '' of british canals during this period of canal mania , huge sums were invested in canal building the canal system expanded to nearly 4,000 miles ( 6,400 kilometres ) in length canal proposals were put forward by financial investors interested in profiting from dividends , as well as industrial businesses that wanted to move their raw materials and finished goods speculators would try to buy shares in a newly floated company to sell them on for a profit , regardless of whether the canal was ever profitable , or even built for many years , a dispute about tolls meant that goods travelling through birmingham had to be moved from boats in one canal to boats in the other from about 1840 , the railway network gained greater importance most of the investment that had previously gone into canal building was diverted into railway building after this , the less successful canals ( particularly narrow-locked canals , whose boats could only carry about thirty tons ) failed quickly canal companies were unable to compete against the speed of the new railways , and in order to survive , they had to slash their prices in many cases struggling canal companies were bought out by railway companies a notable example of this is the croydon canal this canal modernisation never occurred on a large scale in the uk , mainly because of the power of the railway companies who owned most of the canals and saw no reason to invest in a competing form of transport the 20th century brought competition from road haulage , and the network declined further the main network saw brief surges in use during world war i and world war ii most of the canal system and inland waterways were nationalised in 1948 and came under the control of the british transport commission , whose subsidiary , the docks and inland waterways executive , managed them into the 1950s but many factories that had formerly used coal either switched to using other fuels , often because of the clean air act 1956 , or closed completely in the same year the bwb decided to formally cease most of its narrowboat operations and transfer them to a private operator called willow wren canal transport services by this time the canal network had shrunk to 2,000 miles ( 3,000 & nbsp ; kilometres ) , half the size it was at its peak in the early 19th century all or part of the canals could be transferred to local authorities ; this transfer subsequently allowed roads to be built over them , mitigating the need to build expensive bridges and aqueducts the last regular long distance narrowboat commercial contract , to a jam factory near london , ended in 1971 lime juice continued to be carried between brentford and boxmoor until 1981 rolt and robert aickman helped revive interest in the uk 's canals to the point where they are a major leisure destination from the 1970s , increasing numbers of closed canals were restored by enthusiast volunteers the list includes : standedge tunnel , the longest , deepest , and highest canal tunnel in the united kingdom waterway restoration organisations have returned many hundreds of miles of abandoned and remainder canals to use , and work is still ongoing to save many more a more direct route between london and the national canal network , the grand junction canal , opened in 1805

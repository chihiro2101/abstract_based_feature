in the post-medieval period , some natural waterways were '' canalised '' or improved for boat traffic in the 16th century the first act of parliament was obtained by the city of canterbury in 1515 , to extend navigation on the river stour in kent , followed by the river exe in 1539 , which led to the construction in 1566 of a new channel , the exeter canal chapter 2 : the river navigations simple flash locks were provided to regulate the flow of water and allow loaded boats to pass through shallow waters by admitting a rush of water , but these were not purpose-built canals as we understand them today the transport system that existed before the canals were built consisted of coastal shipping and horses and carts struggling along mostly unsurfaced mud roads ( although there were some surfaced turnpike roads ) there was also a small amount of traffic carried along navigable rivers in the 17th century , as early industry started to expand , this transport situation was highly unsatisfactory one horse-drawn canal barge could carry about thirty tonnes at a time , faster than road transport and at half the cost chapter 2 : the river navigations in 1605 , the government of king james i established the oxford-burcot commission , which began to improve the system of locks and weirs on the river thames , which were opened between oxford and abingdon by 1635 thacker the thames highway : volume i general history 1920 - republished 1968 david & charles in 1635 sir richard weston was appointed to develop the river wey navigation , making guildford accessible by 1653 dictionary of national biography - sir richard weston in 1670 the stamford canal opened , indistinguishable from 18th century examples with a dedicated cut and double-door locks in 1699 legislation was passed to permit the aire & calder navigation which was opened 1703 , and the trent navigation which was built by george hayne and opened in 1712 history of burton from 'british history online ' subsequently , the kennet built by john hore opened in 1723 , the mersey and irwell opened in 1725 , and the bristol avon in 1727 thacker the thames highway : volume ii locks and weirs 1920 - republished 1968 david & charles the net effect of these was to bring most of england , with the notable exceptions of birmingham and staffordshire , within of a waterway by the early 18th century , river navigations such as the aire and calder navigation were becoming quite sophisticated , with pound locks and longer and longer '' cuts '' ( some with intermediate locks ) to avoid circuitous or difficult stretches of rivers the uk was the first country to develop a nationwide canal network the navigable water network grew rapidly at first and became an almost completely connected transport network the sankey canal was the first british canal of the industrial revolution , opening in 1757 in the mid-18th century the 3rd duke of bridgewater built the bridgewater canal he commissioned the engineer james brindley to build the canal ; the design included an aqueduct carrying the canal over the river irwell it opened in 1761 and was the longest canal constructed in britain to that date canal boats could carry thirty tons at a time ; one horse could tow more than ten times the amount of cargo that was possible with a cart the canal was a huge financial success and repaid the cost of its construction within just a few years the 19th century saw some major new canals such as the caledonian canal and the manchester ship canal this horse-drawn system proved to be highly economical and became standard across the british canal network commercial horse-drawn canal boats could be seen on the uk 's canals until as late as the 1950s , although by then diesel powered boats , often towing a second unpowered boat , had become standard during the latter part of the 19th century the boat decoration of roses and castles began to appear during this period of canal mania , huge sums were invested in canal building canal proposals were put forward by financial investors interested in profiting from dividends , as well as industrial businesses that wanted to move their raw materials and finished goods trains could not only carry more than the canals but could transport people and goods far more quickly than the walking pace of the canal boats most of the investment that had previously gone into canal building was diverted into railway building by the second half of the 19th century , many canals were increasingly becoming owned by railway company or competing with them , and many were in decline , with decreases in mile-ton charges to try to remain competitive this put an end to the huge profits that canal companies had enjoyed before the coming of the railways , and also had an effect on the boatmen who faced a drop in wages this became standard practice across the canal system , with in many cases families with several children living in tiny boat cabins , creating a considerable community of boat people though this community ostensibly had much in common with gypsies , both communities strongly resisted any such comparison , and surviving boat people feel deeply insulted if described as 'water gypsies ' sometimes this was a tactical move by railway companies to gain ground in their competitors ' territory , but sometimes canal companies were bought out either to close them down and remove competition , or to build a railway on the line of the canal the canals survived through the 19th century largely by occupying the niches in the transport market that the railways had missed , or by supplying local markets such as the coal-hungry factories and mills of the big cities thus , almost uniquely in europe , many of the uk 's canals remain as they have been since the 18th and 19th century : mostly operated with narrowboats most of the canal system and inland waterways were nationalised in 1948 and came under the control of the british transport commission , whose subsidiary , the docks and inland waterways executive , managed them into the 1950s under the transport act of 1962 , the canals were transferred in 1963 to the british waterways board ( bwb ) , which later became british waterways however , the basic network was still intact ; many of the closures were of duplicate routes or branches all or part of the canals could be transferred to local authorities ; this transfer subsequently allowed roads to be built over them , mitigating the need to build expensive bridges and aqueducts title canals and transatlantic slavery author doctor jodie mathews publisher canal and river trust date accessed 18 december 2020 link many restoration projects have been led by local canal societies or trusts , who were initially formed to fight the closure of a remainder waterway or to save an abandoned canal from further decay canals of the united kingdom list of canals in ireland timeline of transportation technology list of canal tunnels in the united kingdom list of canal aqueducts in the united kingdom list of canal locks in the united kingdom the canals of the west midlands

in the post-medieval period , some natural waterways were '' canalised '' or improved for boat traffic in the 16th century the first act of parliament was obtained by the city of canterbury in 1515 , to extend navigation on the river stour in kent , followed by the river exe in 1539 , which led to the construction in 1566 of a new channel , the exeter canal one horse-drawn canal barge could carry about thirty tonnes at a time , faster than road transport and at half the cost some 29 river navigation improvements took place in the 16th and 17th centuries dictionary of national biography - sir richard weston in 1670 the stamford canal opened , indistinguishable from 18th century examples with a dedicated cut and double-door locks by the early 18th century , river navigations such as the aire and calder navigation were becoming quite sophisticated , with pound locks and longer and longer '' cuts '' ( some with intermediate locks ) to avoid circuitous or difficult stretches of rivers eventually , the experience of building long multi-level cuts with their own locks gave rise to the idea of building a '' pure '' canal , a waterway designed on the basis of where goods needed to go , not where a river happened to be the uk was the first country to develop a nationwide canal network the canals caused a great change in the economy of britain the canals were built because they offered the most economic and reliable way to transport goods and commodities in large quantities the navigable water network grew rapidly at first and became an almost completely connected transport network in addition to the building of new canals , older canals were improved the sankey canal was the first british canal of the industrial revolution , opening in 1757 he commissioned the engineer james brindley to build the canal ; the design included an aqueduct carrying the canal over the river irwell chapter 3 : building the canals the construction of the bridgewater canal was funded entirely by the duke canal boats could carry thirty tons at a time ; one horse could tow more than ten times the amount of cargo that was possible with a cart the 19th century saw some major new canals such as the caledonian canal and the manchester ship canal the new canals proved highly successful the boats on the canals were horse-drawn with a towpath alongside the canal for the horse to walk along this horse-drawn system proved to be highly economical and became standard across the british canal network commercial horse-drawn canal boats could be seen on the uk 's canals until as late as the 1950s , although by then diesel powered boats , often towing a second unpowered boat , had become standard during the latter part of the 19th century the boat decoration of roses and castles began to appear during this period of canal mania , huge sums were invested in canal building at the start of this age , canals were built by groups of private individuals with an interest in improving communications in staffordshire the potter josiah wedgwood saw an opportunity to bring bulky cargoes of clay to his factory doors , and to minimise breakages of his fragile finished goods as they travelled to market within just a few years an embryonic national canal network came into being canal proposals were put forward by financial investors interested in profiting from dividends , as well as industrial businesses that wanted to move their raw materials and finished goods speculators would try to buy shares in a newly floated company to sell them on for a profit , regardless of whether the canal was ever profitable , or even built from the tolls the owners would try , with varying degrees of success , to maintain the canal , pay back initial loans and pay dividends to their shareholders after this , the less successful canals ( particularly narrow-locked canals , whose boats could only carry about thirty tons ) failed quickly flyboat working virtually ceased , as it could not compete with the railways on speed and the boatmen found they could only afford to keep their families by taking them with them on the boats by the 1850s the railway system had become well established and the amount of cargo carried on the canals had fallen by nearly two-thirds , lost mostly to railway competition in many cases struggling canal companies were bought out by railway companies sometimes this was a tactical move by railway companies to gain ground in their competitors ' territory , but sometimes canal companies were bought out either to close them down and remove competition , or to build a railway on the line of the canal during the 19th century in much of continental europe the canal systems of many countries such as france , germany and the netherlands were modernised and widened to take much larger boats this canal modernisation never occurred on a large scale in the uk , mainly because of the power of the railway companies who owned most of the canals and saw no reason to invest in a competing form of transport thus , almost uniquely in europe , many of the uk 's canals remain as they have been since the 18th and 19th century : mostly operated with narrowboats an exception to this stagnation was the manchester ship canal , newly built in the 1890s using the existing river irwell and river mersey , to take ocean-going ships into the centre of manchester via its neighbour salford the main network saw brief surges in use during world war i and world war ii during the 1950s and 1960s freight transport on the canals declined rapidly in the face of mass road transport under the transport act of 1962 , the canals were transferred in 1963 to the british waterways board ( bwb ) , which later became british waterways three bridges , london is a clever arrangement allowing the routes of the grand junction canal , a road , and a railway line to cross each other the rochdale canal , the huddersfield narrow canal and the droitwich canals have all been restored to navigation since 2000 a more direct route between london and the national canal network , the grand junction canal , opened in 1805 these were thames and severn canal which linked to the stroudwater navigation , the kennet and avon canal and the wilts and berks canal , which linked to these three rivers

in the post-medieval period , some natural waterways were '' canalised '' or improved for boat traffic in the 16th century the first act of parliament was obtained by the city of canterbury in 1515 , to extend navigation on the river stour in kent , followed by the river exe in 1539 , which led to the construction in 1566 of a new channel , the exeter canal in the 17th century , as early industry started to expand , this transport situation was highly unsatisfactory the restrictions of coastal shipping and river transport were obvious , and horses and carts could only carry one or two tons of cargo at a time the poor state of most of the roads meant that they could often become unusable after heavy rain one horse-drawn canal barge could carry about thirty tonnes at a time , faster than road transport and at half the cost some 29 river navigation improvements took place in the 16th and 17th centuries chapter 2 : the river navigations in 1605 , the government of king james i established the oxford-burcot commission , which began to improve the system of locks and weirs on the river thames , which were opened between oxford and abingdon by 1635 dictionary of national biography - sir richard weston in 1670 the stamford canal opened , indistinguishable from 18th century examples with a dedicated cut and double-door locks history of burton from 'british history online ' subsequently , the kennet built by john hore opened in 1723 , the mersey and irwell opened in 1725 , and the bristol avon in 1727 the uk was the first country to develop a nationwide canal network the navigable water network grew rapidly at first and became an almost completely connected transport network in addition to the building of new canals , older canals were improved the sankey canal was the first british canal of the industrial revolution , opening in 1757 the canal fuelled the growth of the chemical industry in widnes , which subsequently became the epicentre of the industry in england chapter 3 : building the canals the construction of the bridgewater canal was funded entirely by the duke it opened in 1761 and was the longest canal constructed in britain to that date canal boats could carry thirty tons at a time ; one horse could tow more than ten times the amount of cargo that was possible with a cart the canal was a huge financial success and repaid the cost of its construction within just a few years the 19th century saw some major new canals such as the caledonian canal and the manchester ship canal the new canals proved highly successful this horse-drawn system proved to be highly economical and became standard across the british canal network during the latter part of the 19th century the boat decoration of roses and castles began to appear during this period of canal mania , huge sums were invested in canal building canal proposals were put forward by financial investors interested in profiting from dividends , as well as industrial businesses that wanted to move their raw materials and finished goods on the majority of british canals , the canal-owning companies did not own or run a fleet of boats , since the acts of parliament setting them up usually prohibited this , in order to prevent monopolies developing from the tolls the owners would try , with varying degrees of success , to maintain the canal , pay back initial loans and pay dividends to their shareholders trains could not only carry more than the canals but could transport people and goods far more quickly than the walking pace of the canal boats by the second half of the 19th century , many canals were increasingly becoming owned by railway company or competing with them , and many were in decline , with decreases in mile-ton charges to try to remain competitive this put an end to the huge profits that canal companies had enjoyed before the coming of the railways , and also had an effect on the boatmen who faced a drop in wages flyboat working virtually ceased , as it could not compete with the railways on speed and the boatmen found they could only afford to keep their families by taking them with them on the boats by the 1850s the railway system had become well established and the amount of cargo carried on the canals had fallen by nearly two-thirds , lost mostly to railway competition during the 19th century in much of continental europe the canal systems of many countries such as france , germany and the netherlands were modernised and widened to take much larger boats thus , almost uniquely in europe , many of the uk 's canals remain as they have been since the 18th and 19th century : mostly operated with narrowboats an exception to this stagnation was the manchester ship canal , newly built in the 1890s using the existing river irwell and river mersey , to take ocean-going ships into the centre of manchester via its neighbour salford the 20th century brought competition from road haulage , and the network declined further in the 1920s and 1930s many canals in rural areas were abandoned due to falling traffic most of the canal system and inland waterways were nationalised in 1948 and came under the control of the british transport commission , whose subsidiary , the docks and inland waterways executive , managed them into the 1950s however , these obligations were subject to the caveat of being by the most economical means in the 1960s the infant canal leisure industry was only just sufficient to prevent the closure of the remaining canals , but then the pressure to maintain canals for leisure purposes increased the canal and river trust maintains a list of the sites it believes are the most important ; it is called the seven wonders of the waterways the list includes : standedge tunnel , the longest , deepest , and highest canal tunnel in the united kingdom burnley embankment , an innovative solution to a canal crossing a wide valley he built locks long by wide when he extended the bridgewater canal to runcorn , where the canal 's only locks lowered boats to the river mersey london is a port , and as early as 1790 london was linked to the national network via the river thames and the oxford canal

end users often use the term '' posting '' to refer to a single message or file posted to usenet for binary content such as pictures and files , it is often necessary to split the content among multiple articles each news article contains a complete set of header lines , but in common use the term '' headers '' is also used when referring to the news overview database the overview is a list of the most frequently used headers , and additional information such as article sizes , typically retrieved by the client software using the nntp xover command among the operators and users of commercial news servers , common concerns are the continually increasing storage and network capacity requirements and their effects completion ( the ability of a server to successfully receive all traffic ) , retention ( the amount of time articles are made available to readers ) and overall system performance with the increasing demands , it is common for the transit and reader server roles to be subdivided further into numbering , storage and front end systems these server farms are continually monitored by both insiders and outsiders , and measurements of these characteristics are often used by consumers when choosing a commercial news service speed , in relation to usenet , is how quickly a server can deliver an article to the user if the isp has limited connectivity to the network , routing changes may have little effect article sizes are limited to what each news server will accept this generally means that a server can run with less overhead which makes for a more efficient server , but gives less articles for users to access retention is generally quoted separately for text and binary articles , though it may also vary between different groups within these categories the times vary greatly according to the amount of storage available on the servers and continually increasing traffic as of 2009 , it is common for average news providers to have text retention of over 1000 days and binary retention of over 200 days it 's important to understand that retention time varies between different newsgroups within the text and binary categories omicron 's hw media is currently the usenet server with the highest amount of binary retention , while google is the usenet server with the highest amount of text retention a sampling of many or all articles , preferably in more than one newsgroup , is required to detect such anomalies to deal with the increase of usenet traffic , many providers turn to a hybrid system , in which old articles not found on the provider 's server will request the article from another server with longer retention very large articles are frequently dropped , and tend to propagate less well than smaller ones it is also necessary to take into account propagation times and retention ; an article may simply have not yet arrived at a given server , or it may have been present but already expired all usenet servers peer with one or more other servers in order to exchange articles ihave and sendme are sometimes used with uucp to transmit lists of offered and wanted message-ids a reader server typically also works as a transit server , but it may operate independently or serve as an alternative interface to an internet forum they may also be the only available means to obtain articles from remote servers that do not offer conventional feeding

end users often use the term '' posting '' to refer to a single message or file posted to usenet for binary content such as pictures and files , it is often necessary to split the content among multiple articles most servers do not distinguish between single and multiple-part postings , dealing only at the level of the individual component articles each news article contains a complete set of header lines , but in common use the term '' headers '' is also used when referring to the news overview database the overview is a list of the most frequently used headers , and additional information such as article sizes , typically retrieved by the client software using the nntp xover command overviews make reading a newsgroup faster for both the client and server by eliminating the need to open each individual article to present them in list form if non-overview headers are required , such as for when using a kill file , it may still be necessary to use the slower method of reading all the complete article headers among the operators and users of commercial news servers , common concerns are the continually increasing storage and network capacity requirements and their effects completion ( the ability of a server to successfully receive all traffic ) , retention ( the amount of time articles are made available to readers ) and overall system performance these server farms are continually monitored by both insiders and outsiders , and measurements of these characteristics are often used by consumers when choosing a commercial news service speed , in relation to usenet , is how quickly a server can deliver an article to the user this generally means that a server can run with less overhead which makes for a more efficient server , but gives less articles for users to access retention is simply defined as how long the server keeps articles historically , most users want retention to be long enough so that they do n't need to access the server every day but not overly long retention that can overwhelm users with slow computers or network connections retention is generally quoted separately for text and binary articles , though it may also vary between different groups within these categories as of 2009 , it is common for average news providers to have text retention of over 1000 days and binary retention of over 200 days large news providers offer text retention up to 2480 days and binary retention of 850 days or more it 's important to understand that retention time varies between different newsgroups within the text and binary categories omicron 's hw media is currently the usenet server with the highest amount of binary retention , while google is the usenet server with the highest amount of text retention articles may never make their way outside the originating server , or may fail to find their way out to the transit cloud it is also necessary to take into account propagation times and retention ; an article may simply have not yet arrived at a given server , or it may have been present but already expired some servers , such as inn , allow multiple storage schemes to be used at once when an article is posted , the process is much the same as when a transit server receives news , but with additional checks these perform the same reader server role as conventional news servers , but themselves act as newsreaders to exchange articles with other reader servers list of news servers

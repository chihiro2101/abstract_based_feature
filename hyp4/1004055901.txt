end users often use the term '' posting '' to refer to a single message or file posted to usenet most servers do not distinguish between single and multiple-part postings , dealing only at the level of the individual component articles each news article contains a complete set of header lines , but in common use the term '' headers '' is also used when referring to the news overview database the overview is a list of the most frequently used headers , and additional information such as article sizes , typically retrieved by the client software using the nntp xover command completion ( the ability of a server to successfully receive all traffic ) , retention ( the amount of time articles are made available to readers ) and overall system performance these server farms are continually monitored by both insiders and outsiders , and measurements of these characteristics are often used by consumers when choosing a commercial news service speed , in relation to usenet , is how quickly a server can deliver an article to the user the server that the user connects to is typically part of a server farm that has many servers dedicated to multiple tasks historically , most users want retention to be long enough so that they do n't need to access the server every day but not overly long retention that can overwhelm users with slow computers or network connections retention is generally quoted separately for text and binary articles , though it may also vary between different groups within these categories the times vary greatly according to the amount of storage available on the servers and continually increasing traffic omicron 's hw media is currently the usenet server with the highest amount of binary retention , while google is the usenet server with the highest amount of text retention some articles in a group may be retained for longer than others , articles from remote servers do not always arrive promptly , and at times the date headers are simply incorrect a sampling of many or all articles , preferably in more than one newsgroup , is required to detect such anomalies this is a particular problem to binary newsgroups which transmit large volumes of articles to deal with the increase of usenet traffic , many providers turn to a hybrid system , in which old articles not found on the provider 's server will request the article from another server with longer retention given the large number of articles transferred between servers and the large size of individual articles , their complete propagation to any one server farm is not guaranteed looking at only one server , one can not know how many articles were actually inserted throughout the network articles may never make their way outside the originating server , or may fail to find their way out to the transit cloud one way to measure completion is to access multiple servers and retrieve lists of articles it is also necessary to take into account propagation times and retention ; an article may simply have not yet arrived at a given server , or it may have been present but already expired all usenet servers peer with one or more other servers in order to exchange articles a reader server is one that makes the articles available in the hierarchical disk directory format originated by b news 2.10 , or offers the nntp or imap commands , for use by newsreaders these perform the same reader server role as conventional news servers , but themselves act as newsreaders to exchange articles with other reader servers list of news servers

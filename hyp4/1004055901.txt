end users often use the term '' posting '' to refer to a single message or file posted to usenet each news article contains a complete set of header lines , but in common use the term '' headers '' is also used when referring to the news overview database overviews make reading a newsgroup faster for both the client and server by eliminating the need to open each individual article to present them in list form among the operators and users of commercial news servers , common concerns are the continually increasing storage and network capacity requirements and their effects completion ( the ability of a server to successfully receive all traffic ) , retention ( the amount of time articles are made available to readers ) and overall system performance with the increasing demands , it is common for the transit and reader server roles to be subdivided further into numbering , storage and front end systems these server farms are continually monitored by both insiders and outsiders , and measurements of these characteristics are often used by consumers when choosing a commercial news service speed , in relation to usenet , is how quickly a server can deliver an article to the user the server that the user connects to is typically part of a server farm that has many servers dedicated to multiple tasks the speed of data traveling throughout the farm can be severely bottlenecked through hard drive operations some servers allow as many as 60 simultaneous connections , but this varies widely based on the provider this generally means that a server can run with less overhead which makes for a more efficient server , but gives less articles for users to access the times vary greatly according to the amount of storage available on the servers and continually increasing traffic as of 2009 , it is common for average news providers to have text retention of over 1000 days and binary retention of over 200 days large news providers offer text retention up to 2480 days and binary retention of 850 days or more omicron 's hw media is currently the usenet server with the highest amount of binary retention , while google is the usenet server with the highest amount of text retention to deal with the increase of usenet traffic , many providers turn to a hybrid system , in which old articles not found on the provider 's server will request the article from another server with longer retention given the large number of articles transferred between servers and the large size of individual articles , their complete propagation to any one server farm is not guaranteed articles may never make their way outside the originating server , or may fail to find their way out to the transit cloud one way to measure completion is to access multiple servers and retrieve lists of articles all usenet servers peer with one or more other servers in order to exchange articles a reader server is one that makes the articles available in the hierarchical disk directory format originated by b news 2.10 , or offers the nntp or imap commands , for use by newsreaders a reader server typically also works as a transit server , but it may operate independently or serve as an alternative interface to an internet forum these perform the same reader server role as conventional news servers , but themselves act as newsreaders to exchange articles with other reader servers they may also be the only available means to obtain articles from remote servers that do not offer conventional feeding

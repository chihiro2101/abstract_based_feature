in the post-war years ( after 1945 ) , don camillo tarocci ( his full name , which he rarely uses ) is the hotheaded priest of a small town in the po valley in northern italy for the films , the town chosen to represent that of the books was brescello ( which currently has a museum dedicated to don camillo and peppone ) after the production of movies based on guareschi 's tales , but in the first story don camillo is introduced as the parish priest of ponteratto don camillo is constantly at odds with the communist mayor , giuseppe bottazzi , better known as peppone ( meaning , roughly , big joe ) and is also on very close terms with the crucifix in his town church the christ in the crucifix often has far greater understanding than don camillo of the troubles of the people , and has to constantly but gently reprimand the priest for his impatience they also appear to have both been partisan fighters during world war ii ; one episode mentions camillo having braved german patrols in order to reach peppone and his fellow communists in the mountains and administer mass to them under field conditions while peppone makes public speeches about how '' the reactionaries '' ought to be shot , and don camillo preaches fire and brimstone against '' godless communists '' , they actually grudgingly admire each other for example , when the communists organize a local campaign to sign the stockholm peace appeal , it is don camillo who organizes a counter-campaign , and the townspeople take for granted that such a political campaign is part of his work as priest many stories are satirical and take on the real world political divide between the italian roman catholic church and the italian communist party , not to mention other worldly politics don camillo has his own problems — the second vatican council has brought changes in the church , and a new assistant priest , who comes to be called don chichì , has been foisted upon him to see that don camillo moves with the times the name of this fictional town is a play on words of trepalle ( literally '' three balls '' ) , a real town ( near livigno ) whose priest was an acquaintance of guareschi 's pub : rizzoli , 1948 literally : little world : don camillo mondo piccolo : don camillo e il suo gregge pub : rizzoli , 1953 literally : little world : don camillo and his flock mondo piccolo : il compagno don camillo pub : rizzoli , 1969 literally : little world : don camillo and the youth of today gente così pub : rizzoli , 2007 the following us english translations have been published : the little world of don camillo pub : victor gollancz ltd , 1951 ( mondo piccolo : don camillo , translated by una vincenzo troubridge pub : victor gollancz ltd , 1970 ( mondo piccolo : don camillo e i giovani d'oggi , translated by l.k a don camillo ( the world of don camillo ; italian : don camillo ) film was remade in 1983 , an italian production with terence hill directing and also starring as don camillo four further bbc radio series of the little world of don camillo were made , with the final series broadcast on bbc radio 4 in december 2006 in 1980 , the bbc produced the television series the little world of don camillo , based on the stories , starring italian-german actor mario adorf as don camillo and englishman brian blessed as peppone

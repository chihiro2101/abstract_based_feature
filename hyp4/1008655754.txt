in the post-war years ( after 1945 ) , don camillo tarocci ( his full name , which he rarely uses ) is the hotheaded priest of a small town in the po valley in northern italy for the films , the town chosen to represent that of the books was brescello ( which currently has a museum dedicated to don camillo and peppone ) after the production of movies based on guareschi 's tales , but in the first story don camillo is introduced as the parish priest of ponteratto don camillo is constantly at odds with the communist mayor , giuseppe bottazzi , better known as peppone ( meaning , roughly , big joe ) and is also on very close terms with the crucifix in his town church the christ in the crucifix often has far greater understanding than don camillo of the troubles of the people , and has to constantly but gently reprimand the priest for his impatience what peppone and camillo have in common is an interest in the well-being of the town while peppone makes public speeches about how '' the reactionaries '' ought to be shot , and don camillo preaches fire and brimstone against '' godless communists '' , they actually grudgingly admire each other thus , although he publicly opposes the church as a party duty , peppone takes his gang to the church and baptises his children there , which makes him part of don camillo 's flock ; also , peppone and other communists are seen as sharing in veneration of the virgin mary and local saints don camillo also never condemns peppone himself , but the ideology of communism which is in direct opposition to the church as depicted in the stories , the communists are the only political party with a mass grassroots organization in the town the italian christian democratic party , the main force in italian politics at the time , does not have a local political organization ( at least , none is ever mentioned ) ; rather , it is the catholic church which unofficially but very obviously plays that role many stories are satirical and take on the real world political divide between the italian roman catholic church and the italian communist party , not to mention other worldly politics pub : rizzoli , 1948 literally : little world : don camillo mondo piccolo : don camillo e il suo gregge pub : rizzoli , 1953 literally : little world : don camillo and his flock mondo piccolo : il compagno don camillo pub : rizzoli , 1963 literally : little world : comrade don camillo the following italian language books have been published posthumously : mondo piccolo : don camillo e i giovani d'oggi pub : pellegrini and cudahy , 1950 ( mondo piccolo : don camillo , translated by una vincenzo troubridge pub : pellegrini and cudahy , 1952 ( mondo piccolo : don camillo e il suo gregge , translated by frances frenaye pub : victor gollancz ltd , 1970 ( mondo piccolo : don camillo e i giovani d'oggi , translated by l.k a don camillo ( the world of don camillo ; italian : don camillo ) film was remade in 1983 , an italian production with terence hill directing and also starring as don camillo in 1980 , the bbc produced the television series the little world of don camillo , based on the stories , starring italian-german actor mario adorf as don camillo and englishman brian blessed as peppone

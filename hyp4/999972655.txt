in the context of program correctness , static analysis can discover vulnerabilities during the development phase of the program pixy : a static analysis tool for detecting web application vulnerabilities in security and privacy , 2006 ieee symposium on ( pp these vulnerabilities are easier to correct than the ones found during the testing phase since static analysis leads to the root of the vulnerability despite their limitations , the first type of mechanism might reduce the number of vulnerabilities , while the second can sometimes give strong assurance of the lack of a certain class of vulnerabilities data-flow analysis is a technique designed to gather information about the values at each point of the program and how they change over time type checking is used in programming to limit how a programming object is used and what can they do program monitoring records and logs different kinds of information about the program such as resource usage , events , and interactions , so that it can be reviewed to find or pinpoint causes of abnormal behavior the reduced program is called a “ slice ” and is a faithful representation of the original program within the domain of the specified behavior subset

the motivational definition given by shing-tung yau is of a compact kähler manifold with a vanishing first chern class , that is also ricci flat yau and nadis ( 2010 ) there are many other definitions of a calabi & ndash ; yau manifold used by different authors , some inequivalent a calabi & ndash ; yau n-fold or calabi & ndash ; yau manifold of ( complex ) dimension n is sometimes defined as a compact n-dimensional kähler manifold m satisfying one of the following equivalent conditions : the canonical bundle of m is trivial these conditions imply that the first integral chern class c_1 ( m ) of m vanishes the simplest examples where this happens are hyperelliptic surfaces , finite quotients of a complex torus of complex dimension 2 , which have vanishing first integral chern class but non-trivial canonical bundle for a compact n-dimensional kähler manifold m the following conditions are equivalent to each other , but are weaker than the conditions above , though they are sometimes used as the definition of a calabi & ndash ; yau manifold : m has vanishing first real chern class enriques surfaces give examples of complex manifolds that have ricci-flat metrics , but their canonical bundles are not trivial , so they are calabi–yau manifolds according to the second but not the first definition above this follows from yau 's proof of the calabi conjecture , which implies that a compact kähler manifold with a vanishing first real chern class has a kähler metric in the same class with vanishing ricci curvature any calabi–yau manifold has a finite cover that is the product of a torus and a simply-connected calabi–yau manifold enriques surfaces and hyperelliptic surfaces have first chern class that vanishes as an element of the real cohomology group , but not as an element of the integral cohomology group , so yau 's theorem about the existence of a ricci-flat metric still applies to them but they are sometimes not considered to be calabi & ndash ; yau manifolds however , the enriques surface subset do not conform entirely to the su ( 2 ) subgroup in the string theory landscape one example of a three-dimensional calabi & ndash ; yau manifold is a non-singular quintic threefold in cp 4 , which is the algebraic variety consisting of all of the zeros of a homogeneous quintic polynomial in the homogeneous coordinates of the cp 4 calabi & ndash ; yau manifolds are important in superstring theory in other words , the positions of the holes relative to one another and to the substance of the calabi–yau space was found by strominger and witten to affect the masses of particles in a certain way

the motivational definition given by shing-tung yau is of a compact kähler manifold with a vanishing first chern class , that is also ricci flat a calabi & ndash ; yau n-fold or calabi & ndash ; yau manifold of ( complex ) dimension n is sometimes defined as a compact n-dimensional kähler manifold m satisfying one of the following equivalent conditions : the canonical bundle of m is trivial m has a kähler metric with global holonomy contained in su ( n ) for a compact n-dimensional kähler manifold m the following conditions are equivalent to each other , but are weaker than the conditions above , though they are sometimes used as the definition of a calabi & ndash ; yau manifold : m has vanishing first real chern class a positive power of the canonical bundle of m is trivial enriques surfaces give examples of complex manifolds that have ricci-flat metrics , but their canonical bundles are not trivial , so they are calabi–yau manifolds according to the second but not the first definition above on the other hand , their double covers are calabi–yau manifolds for both definitions ( in fact , k3 surfaces ) this follows from yau 's proof of the calabi conjecture , which implies that a compact kähler manifold with a vanishing first real chern class has a kähler metric in the same class with vanishing ricci curvature some definitions put restrictions on the fundamental group of a calabi–yau manifold , such as demanding that it be finite or trivial any calabi–yau manifold has a finite cover that is the product of a torus and a simply-connected calabi–yau manifold some definitions require that the holonomy be exactly equal to su ( n ) rather than a subgroup of it , which implies that the hodge numbers h^^4 equipped with a complex manifold structure abelian surfaces are sometimes excluded from the classification of being calabi & ndash ; yau , as their holonomy ( again the trivial group ) is a subgroup of su ( 2 ) , instead of being isomorphic to su ( 2 ) compactification on calabi & ndash ; yau n-folds are important because they leave some of the original supersymmetry unbroken calabi & ndash ; yau homepage is an interactive reference which describes many examples and classes of calabi & ndash ; yau manifolds and also the physical theories in which they appear

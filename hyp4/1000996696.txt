the motivational definition given by shing-tung yau is of a compact kähler manifold with a vanishing first chern class , that is also ricci flat yau and nadis ( 2010 ) there are many other definitions of a calabi & ndash ; yau manifold used by different authors , some inequivalent a calabi & ndash ; yau n-fold or calabi & ndash ; yau manifold of ( complex ) dimension n is sometimes defined as a compact n-dimensional kähler manifold m satisfying one of the following equivalent conditions : the canonical bundle of m is trivial the structure group of the tangent bundle of m can be reduced from u ( n ) to su ( n ) the simplest examples where this happens are hyperelliptic surfaces , finite quotients of a complex torus of complex dimension 2 , which have vanishing first integral chern class but non-trivial canonical bundle for a compact n-dimensional kähler manifold m the following conditions are equivalent to each other , but are weaker than the conditions above , though they are sometimes used as the definition of a calabi & ndash ; yau manifold : m has vanishing first real chern class m has a kähler metric with vanishing ricci curvature m has a finite cover that is a product of a torus and a simply connected manifold with trivial canonical bundle there are many other inequivalent definitions of calabi–yau manifolds that are sometimes used , which differ in the following ways ( among others ) : the first chern class may vanish as an integral class or as a real class any calabi–yau manifold has a finite cover that is the product of a torus and a simply-connected calabi–yau manifold abelian surfaces are sometimes excluded from the classification of being calabi & ndash ; yau , as their holonomy ( again the trivial group ) is a subgroup of su ( 2 ) , instead of being isomorphic to su ( 2 ) one example of a three-dimensional calabi & ndash ; yau manifold is a non-singular quintic threefold in cp 4 , which is the algebraic variety consisting of all of the zeros of a homogeneous quintic polynomial in the homogeneous coordinates of the cp 4 more precisely , in the absence of fluxes , compactification on a calabi & ndash ; yau 3-fold ( real dimension 6 ) leaves one quarter of the original supersymmetry unbroken if the holonomy is the full su ( 3 ) calabi & ndash ; yau space by andrew j

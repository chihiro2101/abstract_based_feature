the motivational definition given by shing-tung yau is of a compact kähler manifold with a vanishing first chern class , that is also ricci flat yau and nadis ( 2010 ) there are many other definitions of a calabi & ndash ; yau manifold used by different authors , some inequivalent a calabi & ndash ; yau n-fold or calabi & ndash ; yau manifold of ( complex ) dimension n is sometimes defined as a compact n-dimensional kähler manifold m satisfying one of the following equivalent conditions : the canonical bundle of m is trivial the structure group of the tangent bundle of m can be reduced from u ( n ) to su ( n ) the simplest examples where this happens are hyperelliptic surfaces , finite quotients of a complex torus of complex dimension 2 , which have vanishing first integral chern class but non-trivial canonical bundle for a compact n-dimensional kähler manifold m the following conditions are equivalent to each other , but are weaker than the conditions above , though they are sometimes used as the definition of a calabi & ndash ; yau manifold : m has vanishing first real chern class enriques surfaces give examples of complex manifolds that have ricci-flat metrics , but their canonical bundles are not trivial , so they are calabi–yau manifolds according to the second but not the first definition above this follows from yau 's proof of the calabi conjecture , which implies that a compact kähler manifold with a vanishing first real chern class has a kähler metric in the same class with vanishing ricci curvature there are many other inequivalent definitions of calabi–yau manifolds that are sometimes used , which differ in the following ways ( among others ) : the first chern class may vanish as an integral class or as a real class most definitions assert that calabi–yau manifolds are compact , but some allow them to be non-compact any calabi–yau manifold has a finite cover that is the product of a torus and a simply-connected calabi–yau manifold a popular alternative known as large extra dimensions , which often occurs in braneworld models , is that the calabi & ndash ; yau is large but we are confined to a small subset on which it intersects a d-brane im , mee seong ( 2008 ) '' singularities-in-calabi-yau-varieties.pdf singularities in calabi & ndash ; yau varieties '' yau , shing-tung and nadis , steve ; the shape of inner space , basic books , 2010 calabi & ndash ; yau space by andrew j

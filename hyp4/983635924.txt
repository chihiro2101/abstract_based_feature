crews received elementary training in various commonwealth countries before travelling to canada for advanced courses article xv of the agreement stipulated that graduates belonging to dominion air forces , where they were assigned to service with the raf , should be placed in new squadrons identified with the raaf , rcaf and rnzaf these units later became known as '' article xv squadrons '' some pre-war/regular raaf and rcaf squadrons also served under raf operational control , while new zealand and rhodesian personnel were frequently assigned to raf squadrons with the honorifics of '' ( new zealand ) '' and '' ( rhodesia ) '' in their names however , in practice – and technically in contravention of article xv – most personnel from other commonwealth countries , while they were under raf operational control , were assigned to british units '' the empire air training scheme '' ( conference presentation ) note : for the period relevant all persons born within the british empire

pilots it trained continued to come from the local population , eight citizens of the united states of america who volunteered to serve with the royal air force were sent to bermuda to train at the bermuda flying school this would continue to be a problem as late as 1944 , when the british army was forced to disband a division after operation overlord due to a shortage of manpower at the same time , the air ministry had the equivalent of a division of civilians waiting aircrew training slots , and already had more aircrew than it had aircraft available for them to man by then , eighty

agreement , air crews received elementary training in various commonwealth countries before travelling to canada for advanced courses article xv of the agreement stipulated that graduates belonging to dominion air forces , where they were assigned to service with the raf , should be placed in new squadrons identified with the raaf , rcaf and rnzaf some pre-war/regular raaf and rcaf squadrons also served under raf operational control , while new zealand and rhodesian personnel were frequently assigned to raf squadrons with the honorifics of '' ( new zealand ) '' and '' ( rhodesia ) '' in their names however , in practice – and technically in contravention of article xv – most personnel from other commonwealth countries , while they were under raf operational control , were assigned to british units '' the empire air training scheme '' ( conference presentation ) 1 initial training school rcaf , located initially at the toronto hunt club , toronto '' british commonwealth air training plan all of these graduates , however , were retained by the bcatp in canada , as instructors , staff pilots or in similar flying assignments the first bcatp personnel sent to the uk were 37 canadian observers , who received their wings at cfb trenton , near trenton , ontario , on 27 october 1940 the first bcatp-trained pilots posted to europe as a group were 37 raaf personnel who

raaf aircrews received advanced training in canada during mid-1940 , however , some raaf trainees began to receive advanced training at raf facilities in southern rhodesia on 14 november 1940 , the first contingent to graduate from advanced training in canada embarked for britain , following the outbreak of the pacific war in december 1941 , the majority of raaf aircrews completed their training in australia and served with raaf units in the south west pacific theatre in addition , an increasing number of australian personnel were transferred from europe and the mediterranean to raf squadrons

wednesday , 22 june , 2011 although the school was originally run as a purely local effort , under the colonial government of bermuda , it was quickly incorporated into the commonwealth air training plan at the same time , the air ministry had the equivalent of a division of civilians waiting aircrew training slots , and already had more aircrew than it had aircraft available for them to man in bermuda , the excess of pilots meant that the bfs was advised in 1942 that no further pilots were required sixteen bermudian women were also sent to the rcaf to perform roles including air traffic controller the government agreed in december 1939 to join the british commonwealth air training plan , operate its bases in canada , and pick up a large proportion of the costs the 16th canadian ministry saw involvement in the bcatp as a means of keeping canadians at home , but more importantly , it eased demands for a large expeditionary force and buried the politically divisive issue of overseas conscription canada agreed to accept most of the costs of the plan but in return insisted british pronouncement that air training would be canada 's primary war effort yet another negotiation point was the british expectation that the raf would absorb canadian air training graduates without restrictions , as in world war one , and distribute them across the raf at its height of the british commonwealth air training plan , 131,533 allied pilots and aircrew were trained in canada , 72,835 of which were canadian at the plan 's high point in late 1943 , an organisation of over 100,000 administrative personnel operated 107 schools and 184 other supporting units at 231 locations all across canada in late 1944 , the air ministry announced the winding-up of the plan , since the commonwealth air forces had long had a surplus of air crews at the conclusion of the war , over 167,000 students , including over 50,000 pilots , had trained in canada under the program from may 1940 to march 1945 in 1940 , before the british commonwealth air training plan was fully developed , new zealand also trained 183 observers and 395 air gunners for the raf from 1943 onwards , the training of wireless operator/air gunners , and navigators was carried on in new zealand for pacific operations of the 131,000 trainees who graduated in canada under the commonwealth air training plan , new

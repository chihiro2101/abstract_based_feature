the united kingdom was considered an unsuitable location for air training , due to the possibility of enemy attack , the strain caused by wartime traffic at airfields and the unpredictable weather , so the plan called for the facilities in the dominions to train british and each other 's aircrews negotiations regarding joint training , between the four governments concerned , took place in ottawa during the first few months of the war on 17 december 1939 , they signed the air training agreement – often referred to as the '' riverdale agreement '' , after the uk representative at the negotiations , lord riverdale the british commonwealth air training plan was viewed as an incredibly ambitious programme '' british commonwealth air training plan the agreement called for the training of nearly 50,000 aircrew each year , for as long as necessary : 22,000 aircrew from great britain , 13,000 from canada , 11,000 from australia and 3,300 from new zealand under the agreement , air crews received elementary training in various commonwealth countries before travelling to canada for advanced courses article xv of the agreement stipulated that graduates belonging to dominion air forces , where they were assigned to service with the raf , should be placed in new squadrons identified with the raaf , rcaf and rnzaf some pre-war/regular raaf and rcaf squadrons also served under raf operational control , while new zealand and rhodesian personnel were frequently assigned to raf squadrons with the honorifics of '' ( new zealand ) '' and '' ( rhodesia ) '' in their names however , in practice – and technically in contravention of article xv – most personnel from other commonwealth countries , while they were under raf operational control , were assigned to british units

following the outbreak of the pacific war in december 1941 , the majority of raaf aircrews completed their training in australia and served with raaf units in the south west pacific theatre some article xv squadrons were also transferred to raaf or raf formations involved in the pacific war nevertheless , a significant proportion of raaf personnel remained in europe and raaf article xv squadrons continued to be formed there despite the importance of the royal naval dockyard and the use of the colony ( located 640 miles off north carolina ) in both world wars as a forming-up point for trans-atlantic convoys , attempts to raise a royal air force reserve in the colony from raf veterans between the wars did not meet with success its location in the heart of an raf air station used by raf transport command and ferry command afforded considerable opportunity to gain experience on the consolidated catalina and other flying boats at the station salute to bermudian war hero geoffrey osborn : he was taught at bermuda flying school and went on to fly many bombing raids with the raf wednesday , 22 june , 2011 although the school was originally run as a purely local effort , under the colonial government of bermuda , it was quickly incorporated into the commonwealth air training plan while most of the pilots it trained continued to come from the local population , eight citizens of the united states of america who volunteered to serve with the royal air force were sent to bermuda to train at the bermuda flying school these americans were required to enlist into the bermuda volunteer rifle corps , from which they were discharged upon the successful completion of their flight training by 1942 , the air ministry had a glut of trained pilots , resulting from the fear created by the blitz and the battle of britain this would lead to pilots being transferred to the army 's glider pilot regiment , and to the lists of civilians reserved for aircrew training being cleared of men who were then able to be conscripted by the army by then , eighty pilots had been sent to the raf and fleet air arm although the school was closed , bertram work and major montgomery-moore oversaw the conversion of its administration into a recruiting arm , the bermuda flying committee , for the royal canadian air force ( rcaf ) , sending sixty aircrew candidates to that service before the war 's end sixteen bermudian women were also sent to the rcaf to perform roles including air traffic controller canada agreed to accept most of the costs of the plan but in return insisted british pronouncement that air training would be canada 's primary war effort yet another negotiation point was the british expectation that the raf would absorb canadian air training graduates without restrictions , as in world war one , and distribute them across the raf king demanded that canadian airmen be identified as members of the rcaf with distinct uniforms and shoulder badges hatch 1983 , p the rcaf would run the plan in canada , but to satisfy raf concerns , robert leckie , a senior raf commander ( at the time in charge of raf squadrons in malta ) and a canadian , was posted to ottawa as director of training at its height of the british commonwealth air training plan , 131,533 allied pilots and aircrew were trained in canada , 72,835 of which were canadian at the conclusion of the war , over 167,000 students , including over 50,000 pilots , had trained in canada under the program from may 1940 to march 1945 during the war , the rnzaf contributed 2,743 fully trained pilots to serve with the raf in europe , the middle east , and far east in 1940 , before the british commonwealth air training plan was fully developed , new zealand also trained 183 observers and 395 air gunners for the raf in addition , some 2,910 pilots were trained to elementary standards and sent to canada to continue their training with the establishment of the joint air training scheme ( jats ) 38 south african–based air schools were employed to train royal air force , saaf and other allied air and ground crews during its five-year existence , the jats turned out a total of 33,347 aircrew , including 12,221 saaf personnel rhodesia was the last of the commonwealth countries to enter the empire air training scheme and the first to turn out fully qualified pilots

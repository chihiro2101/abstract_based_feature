crews received elementary training in various commonwealth countries before travelling to canada for advanced courses articles xvi and xvii stipulated that the uk government would be wholly responsible for the pay and entitlements of graduates , once they were placed with raf or article xv units however , in practice – and technically in contravention of article xv – most personnel from other commonwealth countries , while they were under raf operational control , were assigned to british units '' the empire air training scheme '' ( conference presentation ) australian war memorial

from advanced training in canada embarked for britain , following the outbreak of the pacific war in december 1941 , the majority of raaf aircrews completed their training in australia and served with raaf units in the south west pacific theatre in addition , an increasing number of australian personnel were transferred from europe and the mediterranean to raf squadrons in the south east asian theatre nevertheless , a significant proportion of raaf personnel remained in europe and raaf article xv squadrons continued to be formed there the purpose of the bermuda flying school was to train local pilots for the air ministry , which would assign them to the raf or the fleet air arm it operated a pair of luscombe sea planes , paid for by an american resident of bermuda , mr bertram work , and a canadian , mr duncan macmartin its location in the heart of an raf air station used by raf transport command and ferry command afforded considerable opportunity to gain experience on the

protect the royal naval dockyard and other sites important to the war effort salute to bermudian war hero geoffrey osborn : he was taught at bermuda flying school and went on to fly many bombing raids with the raf while most of the pilots it trained continued to come from the local population , eight citizens of the united states of america who volunteered to serve with the royal air force were sent to bermuda to train at the bermuda flying school by 1942 , the air ministry had a glut of trained pilots , resulting from the fear created by the blitz and the battle of britain this would lead to pilots being transferred to the army 's glider pilot regiment , and to the lists of civilians reserved for aircrew training being cleared of men who were then able to be conscripted by the army sixteen bermudian women were also sent to the rcaf to perform roles including air traffic controller canada agreed to accept most of the costs of the plan but in return insisted british pronouncement

in new zealand were retained in country ; either as instructors , staff pilots , or manning operational squadrons formed during the latter half of the war in 1940 , before the british commonwealth air training plan was fully developed , new zealand also trained 183 observers and 395 air gunners for the raf despite the prewar south african air force ( saaf ) expansion plans , the start of the second world war in 1939 caught the saaf unprepared new flying schools were established at pretoria , germiston , bloemfontein and baragwanath , while a training command under lieutenant colonel w.t.b on the outbreak of war in september 1939 , the government of southern rhodesia made an offer to the british air ministry to run a flying school and train personnel to man three squadrons ( 44 , 237 and 266 ( rhodesia ) squadrons ) , which was duly accepted rhodesia was the last of the commonwealth countries to enter the empire air training scheme and the first to turn out fully qualified pilots '' the

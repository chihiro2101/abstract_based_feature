for example , if a population initially contains 1,000 non-diseased persons and 28 develop a condition over two years of observation , the incidence proportion is 28 cases per 1,000 persons per two years , i.e it is also known as the incidence density rate or person-time incidence rate , when the denominator is the combined person-time of the population at risk ( the sum of the time duration of exposure across all persons exposed ) in the same example as above , the incidence rate is 14 cases per 1000 person-years , because the incidence proportion ( 28 per 1,000 ) is divided by the number of years ( two ) incidence should not be confused with prevalence , which is the proportion of cases in the population at a given time rather than rate of occurrence of new cases thus , incidence conveys information about the risk of contracting the disease , whereas prevalence indicates how widespread the disease is prevalence is the proportion of the total number of cases to the total population and is more a measure of the burden of the disease on society with no regard to time at risk or when subjects may have been exposed to a possible risk factor incidence is usually more useful than prevalence in understanding the disease etiology : for example , if the incidence rate of a disease in a population increases , then there is a risk factor that promotes the incidence when the incidence is approximately constant for the duration of the disease , prevalence is approximately the product of disease incidence and average disease duration , so prevalence incidence Ã— duration a follow-up at 5 years ( t 5 years ) finds 20 new cases of hiv

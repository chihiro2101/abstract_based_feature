physical exercises are generally grouped into three types , depending on the overall effect they have on the human body : aerobic exercise is any physical activity that uses large muscle groups and causes the body to use more oxygen than it would while resting examples of aerobic exercise include running , cycling , swimming , brisk walking , skipping rope , rowing , hiking , dancing , playing tennis , continuous training , and long distance running anaerobic exercise , which includes strength and resistance training , can firm , strengthen , and increase muscle mass , as well as improve bone density , balance , and coordination anaerobic exercise also includes weight training , functional training , eccentric training , interval training , sprinting , and high-intensity interval training which increase short-term muscle strength physical exercise can also include training that focuses on accuracy , agility , power , and speed conversely , static exercise ( such as weight-lifting ) can cause the systolic pressure to rise significantly , albeit transiently , during the performance of the exercise exercise reduces levels of cortisol , which causes many health problems , both physical and mental there is evidence that vigorous exercise ( 90â€“95 % of vo2 max ) induces a greater degree of physiological cardiac hypertrophy than moderate exercise ( 40 to 70 % of vo 2 max ) , but it is unknown whether this has any effects on overall morbidity and/or mortality both aerobic and anaerobic exercise work to increase the mechanical efficiency of the heart by increasing cardiac volume ( aerobic exercise ) , or myocardial thickness ( strength training ) the effects of physical exercise on the central nervous system are mediated in part by specific neurotrophic factor myokine , including bdnf , igf-1 , and vegf another cochrane review found some evidence that certain types of exercise programmes , such as those involving gait , balance , co-ordination and functional tasks , can improve balance in older adults following progressive resistance training , older adults also respond with improved physical function environmental approaches appear promising : signs that encourage the use of stairs , as well as community campaigns , may increase exercise levels people may exercise for personal enjoyment , health and well-being , social interactions , competition or training , etc when exercising , it becomes even more important to have a good diet to ensure that the body has the correct ratio of macronutrients while providing ample micronutrients , in order to aid the body with the recovery process following strenuous exercise removing lactate from circulation allows for an easy decline in body temperature , which can also benefit the immune system , as an individual may be vulnerable to minor illnesses if the body temperature drops too abruptly after physical exercise in lizards , sprint training had no effect on maximal exercise capacity , and muscular damage from over-training occurred following weeks of forced treadmill exercise .

physical exercises are generally grouped into three types , depending on the overall effect they have on the human body : aerobic exercise is any physical activity that uses large muscle groups and causes the body to use more oxygen than it would while resting the goal of aerobic exercise is to increase cardiovascular endurance anaerobic exercise , which includes strength and resistance training , can firm , strengthen , and increase muscle mass , as well as improve bone density , balance , and coordination anaerobic exercise also includes weight training , functional training , eccentric training , interval training , sprinting , and high-intensity interval training which increase short-term muscle strength physical exercise can also include training that focuses on accuracy , agility , power , and speed conversely , static exercise ( such as weight-lifting ) can cause the systolic pressure to rise significantly , albeit transiently , during the performance of the exercise developing research has demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through the role of skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ exercise reduces levels of cortisol , which causes many health problems , both physical and mental there is evidence that vigorous exercise ( 90â€“95 % of vo2 max ) induces a greater degree of physiological cardiac hypertrophy than moderate exercise ( 40 to 70 % of vo 2 max ) , but it is unknown whether this has any effects on overall morbidity and/or mortality both aerobic and anaerobic exercise work to increase the mechanical efficiency of the heart by increasing cardiac volume ( aerobic exercise ) , or myocardial thickness ( strength training ) ventricular hypertrophy , the thickening of the ventricular walls , is generally beneficial and healthy if it occurs in response to exercise the effects of physical exercise on the central nervous system are mediated in part by specific neurotrophic factor myokine , including bdnf , igf-1 , and vegf physical exercise was said to decrease healthcare costs , increase the rate of job attendance , as well as increase the amount of effort women put into their jobs parents can thus promote physical activity and limit the amount of time children spend in front of screens implementing physical exercise in the school system and ensuring an environment in which children can reduce barriers to maintain a healthy lifestyle is essential physical exercise can improve health and well-being , as well as enhance community ties and appreciation of natural beauty in lizards , sprint training had no effect on maximal exercise capacity , and muscular damage from over-training occurred following weeks of forced treadmill exercise .

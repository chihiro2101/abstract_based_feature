physical exercises are generally grouped into three types , depending on the overall effect they have on the human body : aerobic exercise is any physical activity that uses large muscle groups and causes the body to use more oxygen than it would while resting the goal of aerobic exercise is to increase cardiovascular endurance anaerobic exercise , which includes strength and resistance training , can firm , strengthen , and increase muscle mass , as well as improve bone density , balance , and coordination anaerobic exercise also includes weight training , functional training , eccentric training , interval training , sprinting , and high-intensity interval training which increase short-term muscle strength physical exercise can also include training that focuses on accuracy , agility , power , and speed 'dynamic ' exercises such as steady running , tend to produce a lowering of the diastole blood pressure during exercise , due to the improved blood flow exercise reduces levels of cortisol , which causes many health problems , both physical and mental there is evidence that vigorous exercise ( 90â€“95 % of vo2 max ) induces a greater degree of physiological cardiac hypertrophy than moderate exercise ( 40 to 70 % of vo 2 max ) , but it is unknown whether this has any effects on overall morbidity and/or mortality both aerobic and anaerobic exercise work to increase the mechanical efficiency of the heart by increasing cardiac volume ( aerobic exercise ) , or myocardial thickness ( strength training ) the effects of physical exercise on the central nervous system are mediated in part by specific neurotrophic factor myokine , including bdnf , igf-1 , and vegf however , there is some evidence that school-based interventions can increase activity levels and fitness in children another cochrane review found some evidence that certain types of exercise programmes , such as those involving gait , balance , co-ordination and functional tasks , can improve balance in older adults physical exercise was said to decrease healthcare costs , increase the rate of job attendance , as well as increase the amount of effort women put into their jobs people may exercise for personal enjoyment , health and well-being , social interactions , competition or training , etc dancing in public allows people to interact with those with whom they would not normally interact , allowing for both health and social benefits excessive exercise or overtraining occurs when a person exceeds their body 's ability to recover from strenuous exercise in lizards , sprint training had no effect on maximal exercise capacity , and muscular damage from over-training occurred following weeks of forced treadmill exercise .

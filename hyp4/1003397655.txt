physical exercises are generally grouped into three types , depending on the overall effect they have on the human body : aerobic exercise is any physical activity that uses large muscle groups and causes the body to use more oxygen than it would while resting the goal of aerobic exercise is to increase cardiovascular endurance examples of aerobic exercise include running , cycling , swimming , brisk walking , skipping rope , rowing , hiking , dancing , playing tennis , continuous training , and long distance running anaerobic exercise , which includes strength and resistance training , can firm , strengthen , and increase muscle mass , as well as improve bone density , balance , and coordination anaerobic exercise also includes weight training , functional training , eccentric training , interval training , sprinting , and high-intensity interval training which increase short-term muscle strength physical exercise can also include training that focuses on accuracy , agility , power , and speed conversely , static exercise ( such as weight-lifting ) can cause the systolic pressure to rise significantly , albeit transiently , during the performance of the exercise developing research has demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through the role of skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ exercise reduces levels of cortisol , which causes many health problems , both physical and mental endurance exercise before meals lowers blood glucose more than the same exercise after meals both aerobic and anaerobic exercise work to increase the mechanical efficiency of the heart by increasing cardiac volume ( aerobic exercise ) , or myocardial thickness ( strength training ) parents can thus promote physical activity and limit the amount of time children spend in front of screens children who are overweight and participate in physical exercise experience a greater loss of body fat and increased cardiovascular fitness research published in 2015 suggests that incorporating mindfulness into physical exercise interventions increases exercise adherence and self-efficacy , and also has positive effects both psychologically and physiologically people may exercise for personal enjoyment , health and well-being , social interactions , competition or training , etc physical exercise can improve health and well-being , as well as enhance community ties and appreciation of natural beauty in lizards , sprint training had no effect on maximal exercise capacity , and muscular damage from over-training occurred following weeks of forced treadmill exercise .

from 19 december 1927 , it broadcast a 15.8 & nbsp ; khz time signal from the royal observatory which could be received worldwide the time signals , preceded by the callsign '' gbr gbr time '' in morse code , were transmitted during the 5 minutes preceding 03:00 , 09:00 , 15:00 and 21:00 eventually , time signals from gbr were terminated in november 1986 and it is no longer used as a frequency reference the 60 & nbsp ; khz signal finally became an uninterrupted 24-hour service in 1966 , and the frequency references were discontinued in february 1988 on 27 february 2007 the npl started tests of the new time signal transmissions from anthorn the formal inauguration of the relocated facility took place on 1 april 2007 , when the name of the service became '' the time from npl '' and the signal from rugby was permanently switched off following its relocation in 2007 to cumbria , the npl now formally calls the signal '' the time from npl '' the signal strength is greater than 10 mv/m at 100 & nbsp ; km ; it is greater than 100 μv/m at 1,000 & nbsp ; km from the transmitter , and thus can be received at not less than this strength throughout the uk while at rugby , the transmitter generated 60 & nbsp ; kw of radio frequency power ( using 70 & nbsp ; kw of mains power ) in 1974 , a short burst of binary code at 100 bit/s , was inserted into the minute marker to specify the time bit a is transmitted from 100 to 200 ms after the second bit b is transmitted from 200 to 300 & nbsp ; ms after the second negative polarity bit signalling carrier on represents a bit value of 0 if each second is considered as ten 100 & nbsp ; ms pieces , the minute marker is transmitted as 1111100000 , while all other seconds are transmitted as 1ab0000000 seconds 01–16 carry information for the current minute about the difference ( dut1 ) between atomic and astronomical time , and the remaining seconds convey the time and date code the 4 parity bits cover years ( 8 bits ) , months and days ( 11 bits ) , day of week ( 3 bits ) , and time of day ( 13 bits ) respectively the only indication is a change in the number of padding bits before the time code during the minute before the leap second

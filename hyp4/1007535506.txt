the genre of mystery novels is a young form of literature that has developed since the early-19th century perhaps a reason that mystery fiction was unheard of before the 19th century was due in part to the lack of true police forces naturally , the constable would be aware of every individual in the town , and crimes were either solved quickly or left unsolved entirely as people began to crowd into cities , police forces became institutionalized , and the need for detectives was realized – thus the mystery novel arose an early work of modern mystery fiction , mademoiselle de scuderi by e wilkie collins ' novel the woman in white was published in 1860 , while the moonstone ( 1868 ) is often thought to be his masterpiece an important contribution to mystery fiction in the 1920s was the development of the juvenile mystery by edward stratemeyer the 1920s also gave rise to one of the most popular mystery authors of all time , agatha christie , whose works include murder on the orient express ( 1934 ) , death on the nile ( 1937 ) , and the world 's best-selling mystery and then there were none ( 1939 ) pulp magazines decreased in popularity in the 1950s with the rise of television , so much that the numerous titles available then are reduced to two today : alfred hitchcock 's mystery magazine and ellery queen 's mystery magazine—both now published by dell magazines , a division of crosstown publications the detective fiction author ellery queen ( pseudonym of frederic dannay and manfred b lee ) is also credited with continuing interest in mystery fiction interest in mystery fiction continues to this day because of various television shows which have used mystery themes and the many juvenile and adult novels which continue to be published however , detective fiction was pioneered and popularized only later , in the late 19th century , by sir arthur conan doyle 's sherlock holmes stories , considered milestones in crime fiction as noted , detective stories feature professional and retired detectives , while mystery fiction almost exclusively features amateur detectives finally , detective stories focus on the detective and how the crime was solved , while mystery fiction concentrates on the identity of the culprit and how the crime was committed , a distinction that separated and then there were none from other works of agatha christie unlike fiction of the kind , it does n't focus much on the identity of the culprit and has no red herrings or clues , but often emphasizes how the culprit was caught and their motivations behind their actions an inverted detective story , also known as a '' howcatchem '' , is a murder mystery fiction structure in which the commission of the crime is shown or described at the beginning , usually including the identity of the perpetrator martin hewitt , created by british author arthur morrison in 1894 , is one of the first examples of the modern style of fictional private detective these works are set in a time period considered historical from the author 's perspective , and the central plot involves the solving of a mystery or crime ( usually murder ) mystery weekly magazine presents crime and mystery short stories by some of the world 's best established and emerging mystery writers

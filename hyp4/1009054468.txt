utah lake is within utah valley , in north-central utah mountains surround utah valley on three sides : the wasatch range to the east , traverse mountains to the north , and the lake mountains to the west mount nebo reaches an altitude of , and mount timpanogos reaches an altitude of , nearly above the valley floor utah lake is situated on the western edge of the valley and covers more than 25 % of utah valley 's floor connected to the main body of the lake are two large , shallow bays : the aforementioned goshen bay ( north goshen valley ) to the south and provo bay to the east major cities such as provo and orem are located between the lake 's eastern shore and the wasatch range utah lake is a remnant of a much larger pleistocene lake called lake bonneville , which existed from 75,000 to 8,000 years ago at its peak 30,000 years ago , lake bonneville reached an elevation of above sea level and had a surface area of , which was nearly as large as lake michigan the weight of the lake depressed sections of the lake bottom by as much as before the surface rebounded when the lake dried up as evaporation rates exceeded inflow rates , the lake began to dry up , leaving utah lake , the great salt lake , sevier lake , and rush lake as remnants as a result , the valley floor and lake bed are relatively flat , which causes the lake to be shallow the lake has a maximum depth of just under and an average depth of about this shallowness allows winds to easily stir up sediments from the lake 's bottom , contributing to the turbidity or the impression of pollution seen in utah lake 's water one of the faults , the bird island fault , runs under the eastern edge of the lake and helps give rise to hot springs near lincoln beach the hot springs mostly result from the development of hydraulic pressure as the ground water slopes toward the middle of the lake additionally , there are many hot springs and smaller creeks flowing into the lake utah lake is drained by the jordan river , which begins at the lake 's north end the river flows north through utah , salt lake , and davis counties and then into the southeast portion of the great salt lake given the lake 's semi-arid climate , large surface area , and shallow average depth , evaporation accounts for 42 % of utah lake 's outflow '' in response to the drought , a pumping plant was installed at the outlet of the jordan river from utah lake it was the largest pumping plant in the united states at the time when the water level in utah lake exceeds this level , the jordan river pumps and gates are left open raw sewage was still getting into the lake by 1967 in the state of utah , the utah division of water quality and utah division of drinking water are responsible for the management and regulation of water quality doi : 10.3133/ofr20151164 if levels are high enough of either of these species and others the lake is closed to the public the site dates back 3,000 years and over 30,000 artifacts have been found also , the ancestors to the ute , paiute , and northwestern shoshone moved into the area the third group to inhabit the area were the utes of central utah and eastern colorado the timpanogot ( also called timpanogos , timpanogotzi , timpannah , and tempenny ) band of the utes inhabited utah valley it was a sacred meeting place for the timpanogos , ute and shoshone tribes on september 23 , 1776 , the party traveled down spanish fork canyon and entered the utah valley from escalante 's journal , he describes utah lake : '' the lake , which must be six leagues wide and fifteen leagues long , extends as far as one of these valleys this lake of timpanogotzis abounds in several kinds of good fish , geese , beaver , and other amphibious animals which did not have an opportunity to see '' escalante named the lake lake timpanogos , after the tribe living in the area the city of provo and the provo river are named after him left the mormon settlement of utah began in july 1847 , when pioneers entered the salt lake valley the party brought a small boat in which they explored utah lake and caught fish with their nets in april 1849 , a group of about thirty families came into utah valley and settled on the provo river , very close to the main timpanogot village on the provo river the utah lake wetland preserve has been established at the south end of utah lake the utah lake sculpin was last found in 1928 , and likely became extinct in the 1930s after severe drought lowered the lake levels , allowing much of the lake to freeze , overcrowding fish in unfrozen portions of the lake biologists have been rearing the june sucker in red butte reservoir and releasing them into utah lake to help build the population the utah lake commission has previously stated its goal is to remove 32 million pounds of carp from the lake , and more than 17 million pounds have been removed as of november 2019 the bed of utah lake , along with other natural lakes , was granted to the state upon admission to the union in 1896 speckman , stephen smoking gun found in utah lake pcb study '' , deseret news , utah , 28 october 2008

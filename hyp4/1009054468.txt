utah lake is within utah valley , in north-central utah mountains surround utah valley on three sides : the wasatch range to the east , traverse mountains to the north , and the lake mountains to the west jutting into the south portion of the lake is west mountain , which divides goshen bay and lincoln beach utah lake is situated on the western edge of the valley and covers more than 25 % of utah valley 's floor because of its location on the western side of the valley , the eastern shore has a gentle slope and the western shore rises abruptly against the lake mountains connected to the main body of the lake are two large , shallow bays : the aforementioned goshen bay ( north goshen valley ) to the south and provo bay to the east major cities such as provo and orem are located between the lake 's eastern shore and the wasatch range utah lake is a remnant of a much larger pleistocene lake called lake bonneville , which existed from 75,000 to 8,000 years ago at its peak 30,000 years ago , lake bonneville reached an elevation of above sea level and had a surface area of , which was nearly as large as lake michigan the weight of the lake depressed sections of the lake bottom by as much as before the surface rebounded when the lake dried up as evaporation rates exceeded inflow rates , the lake began to dry up , leaving utah lake , the great salt lake , sevier lake , and rush lake as remnants this shallowness allows winds to easily stir up sediments from the lake 's bottom , contributing to the turbidity or the impression of pollution seen in utah lake 's water three faults run under utah lake one of the faults , the bird island fault , runs under the eastern edge of the lake and helps give rise to hot springs near lincoln beach the lake contains a small island called bird island , about north of the lincoln beach boat ramp , near its south end the watershed 's highest point is at bald mountain in the uinta mountains two major tributaries account for nearly 60 % of inflow by streams or rivers into utah lake additionally , there are many hot springs and smaller creeks flowing into the lake utah lake is drained by the jordan river , which begins at the lake 's north end the river flows north through utah , salt lake , and davis counties and then into the southeast portion of the great salt lake '' in response to the drought , a pumping plant was installed at the outlet of the jordan river from utah lake when the water level in utah lake exceeds this level , the jordan river pumps and gates are left open the new compromise level also meant that the lake 's elevation was below jordan river 's stream bed as a result , utah county cities decided to plan how and where to build sewage treatment plants instead of dumping raw sewage into the lake in the state of utah , the utah division of water quality and utah division of drinking water are responsible for the management and regulation of water quality lakes , rivers , and streams that exceed the standard levels are then placed on the deq 303d list in accordance with the clean water act “ characterizing total phosphorus in current and geologic utah lake sediments : implications for water quality management issues . harmful algal blooms in utah lake there are several cyanobacteria species that are especially common when phosphorus levels and temperature , among other unknown criteria , are favorable for harmful algal blooms doi : 10.3133/ofr20151164 if levels are high enough of either of these species and others the lake is closed to the public the first inhabitants of the area were nomadic hunter-gatherers of the desert archaic culture as a result , the fremont people left the area on september 23 , 1776 , the party traveled down spanish fork canyon and entered the utah valley round about it are these indians , who live on the abundant fish of the lake , for which reason the yutas sabuaganas call them come pescados fisheaters besides this , they gather in the plain grass seeds from which they make atole , which they supplement by hunting hares , rabbits , and fowl of which there is great abundance here '' escalante named the lake lake timpanogos , after the tribe living in the area '' the next recorded european visitor was étienne provost , a french-canadian trapper who visited utah lake in october 1824 left the mormon settlement of utah began in july 1847 , when pioneers entered the salt lake valley in 1850 , captain stansbury explored utah lake and utah valley , surveyed and made observation of the local wildlife the utah lake wetland preserve has been established at the south end of utah lake the lower of the provo river is the only known spawning location for the species the main marina for utah lake is at utah lake state park on the lake 's eastern shore utah lake restoration available at : critics of the project include ecologists and other scientists raising hydrologic and ecological concerns with the project deseret news available at

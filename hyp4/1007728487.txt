naca was established by the federal government through enabling legislation as an emergency measure during world war i to promote industry , academic , and government coordination on war-related projects the most influential agency upon which the naca was based was the british advisory committee for aeronautics walcott suggested the tactic of adding the resolution to the naval appropriations bill the act of congress creating naca , approved march 3 , 1915 , reads , '' it shall be the duty of the advisory committee for aeronautics to supervise and direct the scientific study of the problems of flight with a view to their practical solution on january 29 , 1920 , president wilson appointed pioneering flier and aviation engineer orville wright to naca 's board by the early 1920s , it had adopted a new and more ambitious mission : to promote military and civilian aviation through applied research that looked beyond current needs the result was a long string of fundamental breakthroughs , including '' thin airfoil theory '' ( 1920s ) , '' naca cowling '' ( 1930s ) , the '' naca airfoil '' series ( 1940s ) , and the '' area rule '' for supersonic aircraft ( 1950s ) on the other hand , naca 's 1941 refusal to increase airspeed in their wind tunnels set lockheed back a year in their quest to solve the problem of compressibility encountered in high speed dives made by the lockheed p-38 lightning naca 's first wind tunnel was formally dedicated at langley memorial aeronautical laboratory on june 11 , 1920 it was the first of many now-famous naca and nasa wind tunnels in the years immediately preceding world war ii , naca was involved in the development of several designs that served key roles in the war effort nearly every aircraft used some form of forced induction that relied on information developed by naca naca ran the experiments and data collection , and the bulk of the research used to develop the aircraft came from naca engineer john stack , the head of naca 's compressibility division naca experience provided a powerful model for world war ii research , the postwar government laboratories , and naca 's successor , the nasa ( nasa ) aerospaceweb.org : information on naca airfoil series nasa.gov : '' from engineering science to big science '' â€” the naca and nasa collier trophy research project winners , edited by pamela e

naca was established by the federal government through enabling legislation as an emergency measure during world war i to promote industry , academic , and government coordination on war-related projects the most influential agency upon which the naca was based was the british advisory committee for aeronautics legislation was introduced in both houses of congress early in january 1913 to approve the commission , but when it came to a vote , the legislation was defeated walcott , secretary of the smithsonian institution from 1907 to 1927 , took up the effort , and in january 1915 , senator benjamin r the purpose of the committee was '' to supervise and direct the scientific study of the problems of flight with a view to their practical solution , and to determine the problems which should be experimentally attacked and to discuss their solution and their application to practical questions '' according to one source , '' the enabling legislation for the naca slipped through almost unnoticed as a rider attached to the naval appropriation bill , on march 3 , 1915 the act of congress creating naca , approved march 3 , 1915 , reads , '' on january 29 , 1920 , president wilson appointed pioneering flier and aviation engineer orville wright to naca 's board naca researchers pursued this mission through the agency 's impressive collection of in-house wind tunnels , engine test stands , and flight test facilities the result was a long string of fundamental breakthroughs , including '' thin airfoil theory '' ( 1920s ) , '' naca cowling '' ( 1930s ) , the '' naca airfoil '' series ( 1940s ) , and the '' area rule '' for supersonic aircraft ( 1950s ) this enabled the b-17 to be used as a key aircraft in the war effort although the bell x-1 was commissioned by the air force and flown by air force test pilot chuck yeager , when it exceeded mach 1 naca was officially in charge of the testing and development of the aircraft from engineering science to big science : the naca and nasa collier trophy research project winners , 1998 , p the area rule concept is now used in designing all transonic and supersonic aircraft model research : the national advisory committee for aeronautics , 1915-1958 centennial of flight commission : the national advisory committee for aeronautics ( naca ) the nasa technical reports server provides access to a collection of 14,469 naca documents dating from 1917

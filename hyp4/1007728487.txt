naca was established by the federal government through enabling legislation as an emergency measure during world war i to promote industry , academic , and government coordination on war-related projects the most influential agency upon which the naca was based was the british advisory committee for aeronautics in december 1912 , president william howard taft had appointed a national aerodynamical laboratory commission chaired by robert s woodward , president of the carnegie institution of washington according to one source , '' the enabling legislation for the naca slipped through almost unnoticed as a rider attached to the naval appropriation bill , on march 3 , 1915 president woodrow wilson signed it into law the same day , thus formally creating the advisory committee for aeronautics , as it was called in the legislation , on the last day of the 63rd congress by the early 1920s , it had adopted a new and more ambitious mission : to promote military and civilian aviation through applied research that looked beyond current needs naca researchers pursued this mission through the agency 's impressive collection of in-house wind tunnels , engine test stands , and flight test facilities ; facilities langley memorial aeronautical laboratory ( hampton , virginia ) ames aeronautical laboratory ( moffett field ) aircraft engine research laboratory ( lewis research center ) muroc flight test unit ( edwards air force base ) in 1922 , naca had 100 employees the result was a long string of fundamental breakthroughs , including '' thin airfoil theory '' ( 1920s ) , '' naca cowling '' ( 1930s ) , the '' naca airfoil '' series ( 1940s ) , and the '' area rule '' for supersonic aircraft ( 1950s ) although this specific wind tunnel was not unique or advanced , it enabled naca engineers and scientists to develop and test new and advanced concepts in aerodynamics and to improve future wind tunnel design nearly every aircraft used some form of forced induction that relied on information developed by naca naca ran the experiments and data collection , and the bulk of the research used to develop the aircraft came from naca engineer john stack , the head of naca 's compressibility division from engineering science to big science : the naca and nasa collier trophy p.147 the most important design resulting from the area rule was the b-58 hustler , which was already in development at the time centennial of flight commission : the national advisory committee for aeronautics ( naca ) the nasa technical reports server provides access to a collection of 14,469 naca documents dating from 1917 aerospaceweb.org : information on naca airfoil series nasa.gov : '' from engineering science to big science '' â€” the naca and nasa collier trophy research project winners , edited by pamela e

naca was established by the federal government through enabling legislation as an emergency measure during world war i to promote industry , academic , and government coordination on war-related projects the most influential agency upon which the naca was based was the british advisory committee for aeronautics roberts introduced identical resolutions recommending the creation of an advisory committee as outlined by walcott it shall be the duty of the advisory committee for aeronautics to supervise and direct the scientific study of the problems of flight with a view to their practical solution naca researchers pursued this mission through the agency 's impressive collection of in-house wind tunnels , engine test stands , and flight test facilities in addition to formal assignments , staff were encouraged to pursue unauthorized '' bootleg '' research , provided that it was not too exotic arnold took up the matter and overruled naca objections to higher air speeds naca 's first wind tunnel was formally dedicated at langley memorial aeronautical laboratory on june 11 , 1920 it was the first of many now-famous naca and nasa wind tunnels although this specific wind tunnel was not unique or advanced , it enabled naca engineers and scientists to develop and test new and advanced concepts in aerodynamics and to improve future wind tunnel design naca ran the experiments and data collection , and the bulk of the research used to develop the aircraft came from naca engineer john stack , the head of naca 's compressibility division from engineering science to big science : the naca and nasa collier trophy research project winners , 1998 , p.89 in 1951 , naca engineer richard whitcomb determined the area rule that explained transonic flow over an aircraft from engineering science to big science : the naca and nasa collier trophy research project winners , 1998 , p naca experience provided a powerful model for world war ii research , the postwar government laboratories , and naca 's successor , the nasa ( nasa ) centennial of flight commission : the national advisory committee for aeronautics ( naca ) the nasa technical reports server provides access to a collection of 14,469 naca documents dating from 1917 aerospaceweb.org : information on naca airfoil series nasa.gov : '' from engineering science to big science '' â€” the naca and nasa collier trophy research project winners , edited by pamela e

naca was established by the federal government through enabling legislation as an emergency measure during world war i to promote industry , academic , and government coordination on war-related projects the most influential agency upon which the naca was based was the british advisory committee for aeronautics in december 1912 , president william howard taft had appointed a national aerodynamical laboratory commission chaired by robert s legislation was introduced in both houses of congress early in january 1913 to approve the commission , but when it came to a vote , the legislation was defeated according to one source , '' the enabling legislation for the naca slipped through almost unnoticed as a rider attached to the naval appropriation bill , on march 3 , 1915 the act of congress creating naca , approved march 3 , 1915 , reads , '' naca researchers pursued this mission through the agency 's impressive collection of in-house wind tunnels , engine test stands , and flight test facilities ; facilities langley memorial aeronautical laboratory ( hampton , virginia ) ames aeronautical laboratory ( moffett field ) aircraft engine research laboratory ( lewis research center ) muroc flight test unit ( edwards air force base ) in 1922 , naca had 100 employees the result was a long string of fundamental breakthroughs , including '' thin airfoil theory '' ( 1920s ) , '' naca cowling '' ( 1930s ) , the '' naca airfoil '' series ( 1940s ) , and the '' area rule '' for supersonic aircraft ( 1950s ) atmospheric 5-ft wind tunnel ( 1920 ) variable density tunnel ( 1922 ) propeller research tunnel ( 1927 ) high-speed 11-in wind tunnel ( 1928 ) vertical 5-ft wind tunnel ( 1929 ) atmospheric 7- by 10-ft wind tunnel ( 1930 ) full-scale 30- by 60-ft tunnel ( 1931 ) in the years immediately preceding world war ii , naca was involved in the development of several designs that served key roles in the war effort this enabled the b-17 to be used as a key aircraft in the war effort from engineering science to big science : the naca and nasa collier trophy research project winners , 1998 , p.89 in 1951 , naca engineer richard whitcomb determined the area rule that explained transonic flow over an aircraft from engineering science to big science : the naca and nasa collier trophy p.147 the most important design resulting from the area rule was the b-58 hustler , which was already in development at the time naca experience provided a powerful model for world war ii research , the postwar government laboratories , and naca 's successor , the nasa ( nasa ) aerospaceweb.org : information on naca airfoil series nasa.gov : '' from engineering science to big science '' â€” the naca and nasa collier trophy research project winners , edited by pamela e

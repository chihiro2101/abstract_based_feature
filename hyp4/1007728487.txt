naca was established by the federal government through enabling legislation as an emergency measure during world war i to promote industry , academic , and government coordination on war-related projects the most influential agency upon which the naca was based was the british advisory committee for aeronautics walcott , secretary of the smithsonian institution from 1907 to 1927 , took up the effort , and in january 1915 , senator benjamin r according to one source , '' the enabling legislation for the naca slipped through almost unnoticed as a rider attached to the naval appropriation bill , on march 3 , 1915 the act of congress creating naca , approved march 3 , 1915 , reads , '' ; facilities langley memorial aeronautical laboratory ( hampton , virginia ) ames aeronautical laboratory ( moffett field ) aircraft engine research laboratory ( lewis research center ) muroc flight test unit ( edwards air force base ) in 1922 , naca had 100 employees the result was a long string of fundamental breakthroughs , including '' thin airfoil theory '' ( 1920s ) , '' naca cowling '' ( 1930s ) , the '' naca airfoil '' series ( 1940s ) , and the '' area rule '' for supersonic aircraft ( 1950s ) the full-size langley wind tunnel operated at no more than and the then-recent tunnels at moffett could only reach arnold took up the matter and overruled naca objections to higher air speeds naca built a handful of new high-speed wind tunnels , and mach 0.75 was reached at moffett 's wind tunnel late in 1942 naca 's first wind tunnel was formally dedicated at langley memorial aeronautical laboratory on june 11 , 1920 naca ran the experiments and data collection , and the bulk of the research used to develop the aircraft came from naca engineer john stack , the head of naca 's compressibility division the x-1 program was first envisioned in 1944 when a former naca engineer working for bell aircraft was previously head of the high speed wind tunnel division , which itself had nearly a decade of high speed test data by that time ) the design changes allowed the aircraft to exceed mach 1 , but only by a small margin , as the rest of the convair design was not optimized for this from engineering science to big science : the naca and nasa collier trophy p.147 the most important design resulting from the area rule was the b-58 hustler , which was already in development at the time aerospaceweb.org : information on naca airfoil series nasa.gov : '' from engineering science to big science '' â€” the naca and nasa collier trophy research project winners , edited by pamela e

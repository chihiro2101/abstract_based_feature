0 seconds ( 13.799 ± 0.021 gya ) : planck epoch begins : earliest meaningful time all matter and energy of the entire visible universe is contained in a hot , dense point ( gravitational singularity ) , a billionth the size of a nuclear particle it is almost completely smooth , with quantum variations beginning to cause slight variations in density 10 −43 seconds : grand unification epoch begins : while still at an infinitesimal size , the universe cools down to 10 32 kelvin 10 −36 seconds : electroweak epoch begins : the universe cools down to 10 28 kelvin as a result , the strong nuclear force becomes distinct from the electroweak force perhaps fuelling the inflation of the universe a wide array of exotic elementary particles result from decay of x and y bosons which include w and z bosons and higgs bosons ) , the very early universe ( 1985 ) the universe cools to 10 15 kelvin 10 −6 seconds : hadron epoch begins : as the universe cools to about 10 10 kelvin , a quark-hadron transition takes place in which quarks bind to form more complex particles—hadrons this quark confinement includes the formation of protons and neutrons ( nucleons ) , the building blocks of atomic nuclei 1 second : lepton epoch begins : the universe cools to 10 9 kelvin at this temperature , the hadrons and antihadrons annihilate each other , leaving behind leptons and antileptons – possible disappearance of antiquarks because charged electrons and protons hinder the emission of light , the universe becomes a super-hot glowing fog 3 minutes : primordial nucleosynthesis : nuclear fusion begins as lithium and heavy hydrogen ( deuterium ) and helium nuclei form from protons and neutrons 47,000 years ( z 3600 ) : matter and radiation equivalence : at the beginning of this era , the expansion of the universe was decelerating at a faster rate 70,000 years : matter domination in universe : onset of gravitational collapse as the jeans length at which the smallest structure can form begins to fall recombination : electrons combine with nuclei to form atoms , mostly hydrogen and helium loeb ( 2014 ) speculated that abiogenesis might in principle have appeared during this window , which he called '' the habitable epoch of the early universe '' 200 million years : hd 140283 , the '' methuselah '' star , formed , the unconfirmed oldest star observed in the universe the oldest-known star ( confirmed ) – smss j031300.36-670839.3 , forms 300 million years : first large-scale astronomical objects , protogalaxies and quasars may have begun forming over time these stars are forced to fuse helium to produce carbon , oxygen , silicon and other heavy elements up to iron on the periodic table 400 million years ( z 11 ) : gn-z11 , the oldest-known galaxy , forms this suggests that interacting galaxy is taking place very early on in the history of the universe as starburst galaxies are often associated with collisions and galaxy mergers 720 million years : possible formation of globular clusters in milky way 's galactic halo the large fraction of neutral hydrogen in its spectrum suggests it may also have just formed or is in the process of star formation formation of sdss j102915+172927 : unusual population ii star that is extremely metal poor consisting of mainly hydrogen and helium lae j095950.99+021219.1 , one of the most remote lyman alpha emitter galaxies , forms 870 million years : messier 30 forms in the milky way 890 million years : galaxy sxdf-nb1006-2 forms 900 million years : galaxy bdf-3299 forms formation of hyper-luminous quasar sdss j0100+2802 , which harbors a black hole with mass of 12 billion solar masses , one of the most massive black holes discovered so early in the universe 4.0 billion years ( 9.8 gya ) : quasar 3c 9 forms 9.2318 billion years ( 4.5682 gya ) : sun forms - planetary nebula begins accretion of planets 13.795 billion years ( 4.4 mya ) : fomalhaut b , first directly imaged exoplanet , forms 13.8 billion years ( without uncertainties ) : present day

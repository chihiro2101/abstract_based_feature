the big bang occurs in which ordinary space and time develop out of a primeval state ( possibly a virtual particle or false vacuum ) described by a quantum gravity or '' theory of everything '' all matter and energy of the entire visible universe is contained in a hot , dense point ( gravitational singularity ) , a billionth the size of a nuclear particle the infant universe cools as it begins expanding outward 10 −43 seconds : grand unification epoch begins : while still at an infinitesimal size , the universe cools down to 10 32 kelvin 10 −36 seconds : electroweak epoch begins : the universe cools down to 10 28 kelvin as a result , the strong nuclear force becomes distinct from the electroweak force perhaps fuelling the inflation of the universe 10 −33 seconds : space is subjected to inflation , expanding by a factor of the order of 10 26 over a time of the order of 10 −33 to 10 −32 seconds guth , '' phase transitions in the very early universe '' , in : hawking , gibbon , siklos ( eds ) , the very early universe ( 1985 ) the temperature is still too high for quarks to coalesce into hadrons , and the quark–gluon plasma persists ( quark epoch ) gravity governs the expansion of the universe : neutrinos decouple from matter creating a cosmic neutrino background because charged electrons and protons hinder the emission of light , the universe becomes a super-hot glowing fog 47,000 years ( z 3600 ) : matter and radiation equivalence : at the beginning of this era , the expansion of the universe was decelerating at a faster rate 70,000 years : matter domination in universe : onset of gravitational collapse as the jeans length at which the smallest structure can form begins to fall 370,000 years ( z 1,100 ) : the '' dark ages '' is the period between decoupling , when the universe first becomes transparent , until the formation of the first stars 400,000 years : density waves begin imprinting characteristic polarization ( waves ) signals the background temperature was between 373 & nbsp ; k and 273 & nbsp ; k , allowing the possibility of liquid water , during a period of about 7 million years , from about 10 to 17 million after the big bang ( redshift 137–100 ) loeb ( 2014 ) speculated that abiogenesis might in principle have appeared during this window , which he called '' the habitable epoch of the early universe '' 100 million years : gravitational collapse : ordinary matter particles fall into the structures created by dark matter as reionization intensifies , photons of light scatter off free protons and electrons – universe becomes opaque again 200 million years : hd 140283 , the '' methuselah '' star , formed , the unconfirmed oldest star observed in the universe 380 million years : udfj-39546284 forms , current record holder for unconfirmed oldest-known quasar 420 million years : the quasar macs0647-jd , the , or one of the , furthest known quasars , forms 600 million years he 1523-0901 , the oldest star found producing neutron capture elements forms , marking a new point in ability to detect stars with a telescope this suggests that interacting galaxy is taking place very early on in the history of the universe as starburst galaxies are often associated with collisions and galaxy mergers 770 million years : quasar ulas j1120+0641 , one of the most distant , forms one of the earliest galaxies to feature a supermassive black hole suggesting that such large objects existed quite soon after the big bang lyman alpha emitters are considered to be the progenitors of spiral galaxies like the milky way 870 million years : messier 30 forms in the milky way quasar rd1 , first object observed to exceed redshift 5 , forms 2.41 billion years ( 11.39 gya ) : messier 10 globular cluster forms 9.257 billion years ( 4.543–4.5 gya ) : solar system of eight planets , four terrestrial ( mercury ( planet ) , venus , earth , mars ) evolve around the sun 11.8 billion years ( 2 gya ) : star formation in andromeda galaxy slows 13.795 billion years ( 4.4 mya ) : fomalhaut b , first directly imaged exoplanet , forms 13.8 billion years ( without uncertainties ) : present day timeline of natural history ( formation of the earth to evolution of modern humans ) detailed logarithmic timeline timeline of the far future timelines of world history

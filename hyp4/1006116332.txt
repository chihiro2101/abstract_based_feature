0 seconds ( 13.799 ± 0.021 gya ) : planck epoch begins : earliest meaningful time the big bang occurs in which ordinary space and time develop out of a primeval state ( possibly a virtual particle or false vacuum ) described by a quantum gravity or '' theory of everything '' all matter and energy of the entire visible universe is contained in a hot , dense point ( gravitational singularity ) , a billionth the size of a nuclear particle wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) or dark matter and dark energy may have appeared and been the catalyst for the expansion of the singularity 10 −43 seconds : grand unification epoch begins : while still at an infinitesimal size , the universe cools down to 10 32 kelvin 10 −36 seconds : electroweak epoch begins : the universe cools down to 10 28 kelvin guth , '' phase transitions in the very early universe '' , in : hawking , gibbon , siklos ( eds ) , the very early universe ( 1985 ) the weak nuclear force is now a short-range force as it separates from electromagnetic force , so matter particles can acquire mass and interact with the higgs field 10 −6 seconds : hadron epoch begins : as the universe cools to about 10 10 kelvin , a quark-hadron transition takes place in which quarks bind to form more complex particles—hadrons this quark confinement includes the formation of protons and neutrons ( nucleons ) , the building blocks of atomic nuclei 10 seconds : photon epoch begins : most of the leptons and antileptons annihilate each other as electrons and positrons annihilate , a small number of unmatched electrons are left over – disappearance of the positrons because charged electrons and protons hinder the emission of light , the universe becomes a super-hot glowing fog 20 minutes : nuclear fusion ceases : normal matter consists of 75 % hydrogen nuclei and 25 % helium nuclei – free electrons begin scattering light 47,000 years ( z 3600 ) : matter and radiation equivalence : at the beginning of this era , the expansion of the universe was decelerating at a faster rate the photons present at the time of decoupling are the same photons that we see in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation 10-17 million years : the '' dark ages '' span a period during which the temperature of cosmic background radiation cooled from some 4000 & nbsp ; k down to about 60 & nbsp ; k loeb ( 2014 ) speculated that abiogenesis might in principle have appeared during this window , which he called '' the habitable epoch of the early universe '' 200 million years : hd 140283 , the '' methuselah '' star , formed , the unconfirmed oldest star observed in the universe 380 million years : udfj-39546284 forms , current record holder for unconfirmed oldest-known quasar 420 million years : the quasar macs0647-jd , the , or one of the , furthest known quasars , forms this suggests that interacting galaxy is taking place very early on in the history of the universe as starburst galaxies are often associated with collisions and galaxy mergers smaller galaxies begin merging to form larger ones 720 million years : possible formation of globular clusters in milky way 's galactic halo gn-108036 forms—galaxy is 5 times larger and 100 times more massive than the present day milky way illustrating the size attained by some galaxies very early on one of the earliest galaxies to feature a supermassive black hole suggesting that such large objects existed quite soon after the big bang he0107-5240 , one of the oldest population ii stars , forms as part of a binary star system lae j095950.99+021219.1 , one of the most remote lyman alpha emitter galaxies , forms 890 million years : galaxy sxdf-nb1006-2 forms 900 million years : galaxy bdf-3299 forms because the universe is still small in size , galaxy interactions become common place with larger and larger galaxies forming out of the galaxy merger process 6.0 billion years ( 7.8 gya ) : the universe continues to organize into larger wider structures 9.2 billion years ( 4.6–4.57 gya ) : primal supernova , possibly triggers the formation of the solar system 9.266 billion years ( 4.533 gya ) : formation of earth-moon system following giant impact by hypothetical planetoid theia ( planet ) 13.795 billion years ( 4.4 mya ) : fomalhaut b , first directly imaged exoplanet , forms 13.8 billion years ( without uncertainties ) : present day

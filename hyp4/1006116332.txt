0 seconds ( 13.799 ± 0.021 gya ) : planck epoch begins : earliest meaningful time the big bang occurs in which ordinary space and time develop out of a primeval state ( possibly a virtual particle or false vacuum ) described by a quantum gravity or '' theory of everything '' wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) or dark matter and dark energy may have appeared and been the catalyst for the expansion of the singularity 10 −43 seconds : grand unification epoch begins : while still at an infinitesimal size , the universe cools down to 10 32 kelvin 10 −36 seconds : electroweak epoch begins : the universe cools down to 10 28 kelvin as a result , the strong nuclear force becomes distinct from the electroweak force perhaps fuelling the inflation of the universe ) , the very early universe ( 1985 ) the weak nuclear force is now a short-range force as it separates from electromagnetic force , so matter particles can acquire mass and interact with the higgs field 3 minutes : primordial nucleosynthesis : nuclear fusion begins as lithium and heavy hydrogen ( deuterium ) and helium nuclei form from protons and neutrons 47,000 years ( z 3600 ) : matter and radiation equivalence : at the beginning of this era , the expansion of the universe was decelerating at a faster rate 370,000 years ( z 1,100 ) : the '' dark ages '' is the period between decoupling , when the universe first becomes transparent , until the formation of the first stars recombination : electrons combine with nuclei to form atoms , mostly hydrogen and helium distributions of hydrogen and helium at this time remains constant as the electron-baryon plasma thins the photons present at the time of decoupling are the same photons that we see in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation 100 million years : gravitational collapse : ordinary matter particles fall into the structures created by dark matter because it is a population ii star , some suggestions have been raised that second generation star formation may have begun very early on 300 million years : first large-scale astronomical objects , protogalaxies and quasars may have begun forming these elements , when seeded into neighbouring gas clouds by supernova , will lead to the formation of more population ii stars ( metal poor ) and gas giants 380 million years : udfj-39546284 forms , current record holder for unconfirmed oldest-known quasar 400 million years ( z 11 ) : gn-z11 , the oldest-known galaxy , forms 630 million years ( z 8.2 ) : grb 090423 , the oldest gamma ray burst recorded suggests that supernovas may have happened very early on in the evolution of the universe 670 million years : egs-zs8-1 , the most distant starburst or lyman-break galaxy observed , forms 700 million years : galaxies form 720 million years : possible formation of globular clusters in milky way 's galactic halo gn-108036 forms—galaxy is 5 times larger and 100 times more massive than the present day milky way illustrating the size attained by some galaxies very early on one of the earliest galaxies to feature a supermassive black hole suggesting that such large objects existed quite soon after the big bang 800 million years : farthest extent of hubble ultra deep field 1 billion years ( 12.8 gya , z 6.56 ) : galaxy hcm-6a , the most distant normal galaxy observed , forms visual limit of the hubble deep field messier 4 globular cluster , first to have its individual stars resolved , forms in the halo of the milky way galaxy among the clusters ' many stars , psr b1620-26 b forms '' the oldest observed extrasolar planet in the universe , it orbits a pulsar and a white dwarf 2.2 billion years ( 11.6 gya ) : globular cluster ngc 6752 , third-brightest , forms in milky way 2.4 billion years ( 11.4 gya ) : quasar pks 2000-330 forms 6.0 billion years ( 7.8 gya ) : the universe continues to organize into larger wider structures 9.9 billion years ( 3.9 gya ) : tolstoj ( crater ) forms on mercury 13.795 billion years ( 4.4 mya ) : fomalhaut b , first directly imaged exoplanet , forms 13.8 billion years ( without uncertainties ) : present day

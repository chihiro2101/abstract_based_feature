hydrographic offices evolved from naval heritage and are usually found within national naval structures , for example spain 's instituto hidrográfico de la marina armada esapñola – instituto hidrográfico de la marina coordination of those organizations and product standardization is voluntarily joined with the goal of improving hydrography and safe navigation is conducted by the international hydrographic organization ( iho ) hydrographic survey conducted by non-national agencies governmental entities below the national level conduct or contract for hydrographic surveys for waters within their jurisdictions with both internal and contract assets wisconsin dnr – surface water ( hydrography ) data – conversion from coverage to geodatabase state environmental organizations publish hydrographic data relating to their mission utec surveyor equipped for deep ocean cable route surveys specialized companies exist that haveboth the equipment and expertise to contract with both commercial and governmental entities to perform such surveys companies , universities , and investment groups will often fund hydrographic surveys of public waterways prior to developing areas adjacent those waterways survey firms are also contracted to survey in support of design and engineering firms that are under contract for large public projects infrastructure survey in turkey 14 december 2009 private surveys are also conducted before dredging operations and after these operations are completed here , volunteer vessels record position , depth , and time data using their standard navigation instruments , and then the data is post-processed to account for speed of sound , tidal , and other corrections with this approach there is no need for a specific survey vessel , or for professionally qualified surveyors to be on board , as the expertise is in the data processing that occurs once the data is uploaded to the server after the voyage the process was labor-intensive and time-consuming and , although each individual depth measurement could be accurate , even a thorough survey as a practical matter could include only a limited number of sounding measurements relative to the area being surveyed , inevitably leaving gaps in coverage between single soundings single-beam echosounders and fathometers began to enter service in the 1930s which used sonar to measure the depth beneath a vessel this greatly increased the speed of acquiring sounding data over that possible with lead lines and sounding poles by allowing information on depths beneath a vessel to be gathered in a series of lines spaced at a specified distance in the wire-drag method , a wire attached to two ships or boats and set at a certain depth by a system of weights and buoys was dragged between two points this method revolutionized hydrographic surveying , as it allowed a quicker , less laborious , and far more complete survey of an area than did the use of lead lines and sounding poles sidescan sonar could create images of underwater obstructions with the same fidelity as aerial photography , while multibeam systems could generate depth data for 100 percent of the bottom in a surveyed area 2 , pp 41-43 it was observed that higher frequency single vertical beam echosounders could provide detectable echo amplitudes from high porosity sediments , even if those sediments appeared to be acoustically transparent at lower frequencies side scan sonar parses the continual echo returns from a receive beam that is perfectly aligned with the insonification beam using time-after-transmit , a technique that is independent of water depth and the cross-track beam opening angle of the sonar receive transducer a multispectral multibeam echosounder directly computes a position of origin for each of the backscatter amplitudes in the output data set multispectral multibeam echosounders reinforces the fact that spatially and temporally coincident backscatter , from any given seabed , at widely separated acoustic frequencies provides separate and unique images of the seascape bathymetry bathymetric chart echo sounding national irrigation congress offshore survey radio acoustic ranging u.s ) academy of positioning marine and bathymetry noaa maintains a massive database of survey results , charts , and data on the noaa site noaa 's hydrographic website nos data explorer portal the support for hydrographer teamsurv – crowd sourced hydrographic surveying

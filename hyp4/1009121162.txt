hydrographic offices evolved from naval heritage and are usually found within national naval structures , for example spain 's instituto hidrográfico de la marina hydrographic survey conducted by non-national agencies governmental entities below the national level conduct or contract for hydrographic surveys for waters within their jurisdictions with both internal and contract assets wisconsin dnr – surface water ( hydrography ) data – conversion from coverage to geodatabase state environmental organizations publish hydrographic data relating to their mission texas commission on environmental quality – hydrography maps and data hydrographic survey by private organizations commercial entities also conduct large-scale hydrographic and geophysics surveying , particularly in the dredging , marine construction , oil exploration , and drilling industries infrastructure survey in turkey 14 december 2009 private surveys are also conducted before dredging operations and after these operations are completed hydrographic survey by crowdsourcing nevertheless , the results are often more than adequate for many requirements where high resolution , high accuracy surveys are not required or are unaffordable in either case , the depths measured had to be read manually and recorded , as did the position of each measurement with regard to mapped reference points as determined by three-point sextant fixes single-beam echosounders and fathometers began to enter service in the 1930s which used sonar to measure the depth beneath a vessel in 1904 , wire-drag surveys were introduced into hydrography , and the united states coast and geodetic survey′s nicholas h in the wire-drag method , a wire attached to two ships or boats and set at a certain depth by a system of weights and buoys was dragged between two points this method revolutionized hydrographic surveying , as it allowed a quicker , less laborious , and far more complete survey of an area than did the use of lead lines and sounding poles file : grunnslep fra 1932.jpg principle of sea surveying with two boats , norwegian sea survey , 1932 prior to the advent of sidescan sonar , wire-drag surveying was the only method for searching large areas for obstructions and lost vessels and aircraft these technologies allowed a single vessel to do what wire-drag surveying required two vessels to do , and wire-drag surveys finally came to an end in the early 1990s explicit inclusion of phraseology like : '' for all mbes surveys for linz , high resolution , geo-referenced backscatter intensity is to be logged and rendered as a survey deliverable the frequencies of the early side scan sonars were a matter of engineering design expediency and the most important aspect of the side scanning echoes was not the value of their amplitudes , but rather that the amplitudes were spatially variable in fact , important information was deduced about the shape of the bottom and manmade items on the bottom , based on the regions where there were absences of detectable echo amplitudes ( shadows ) fish , j in particular , multispectral multibeam echosounders not only provide '' multiple look '' depth measurements of a seabed , they also provide multispectral backscatter data that are spatially and temporally coincident with those depth measurements a massive amount of data is collected during the typical hydrographic survey , often several soundings per square foot noaa 's hydrographic website nos data explorer portal the support for hydrographer teamsurv – crowd sourced hydrographic surveying

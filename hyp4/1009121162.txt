hydrographic offices evolved from naval heritage and are usually found within national naval structures , for example spain 's instituto hidrográfico de la marina hydrographic survey conducted by non-national agencies governmental entities below the national level conduct or contract for hydrographic surveys for waters within their jurisdictions with both internal and contract assets such surveys commonly are conducted by national organizations or under their supervision or the standards they have approved , particularly when the use is for the purposes of chart making and distribution or the dredging of state-controlled waters wisconsin dnr – surface water ( hydrography ) data – conversion from coverage to geodatabase state environmental organizations publish hydrographic data relating to their mission commercial entities also conduct large-scale hydrographic and geophysics surveying , particularly in the dredging , marine construction , oil exploration , and drilling industries survey firms are also contracted to survey in support of design and engineering firms that are under contract for large public projects infrastructure survey in turkey 14 december 2009 private surveys are also conducted before dredging operations and after these operations are completed hydrographic survey by crowdsourcing crowdsourcing also is entering hydrographic surveying , with projects such as openseamap , teamsurv and argus with this approach there is no need for a specific survey vessel , or for professionally qualified surveyors to be on board , as the expertise is in the data processing that occurs once the data is uploaded to the server after the voyage apart from obvious cost savings , this also gives a continuous survey of an area , but the drawbacks are time in recruiting observers and getting a high enough density and quality of data single-beam echosounders and fathometers began to enter service in the 1930s which used sonar to measure the depth beneath a vessel in 1904 , wire-drag surveys were introduced into hydrography , and the united states coast and geodetic survey′s nicholas h the location of the '' v '' revealed the position of submerged rocks , wrecks , and other obstructions , while the depth at which the wire was set showed the depth at which the obstruction was encountered this method revolutionized hydrographic surveying , as it allowed a quicker , less laborious , and far more complete survey of an area than did the use of lead lines and sounding poles file : grunnslep fra 1930.jpg technical details of used tools , norwegian sea survey , 1930 the wire-drag technique was a major contribution to hydrographic surveying during much of the rest of the 20th century coast and geodetic survey , and later the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , fielded a pair of sister ships of identical design specifically to work together on such surveys the rise of new electronic technologies – sidescan sonar and multibeam swath systems – in the 1950s , 1960s and 1970s eventually made the wire-drag system obsolete sidescan sonar could create images of underwater obstructions with the same fidelity as aerial photography , while multibeam systems could generate depth data for 100 percent of the bottom in a surveyed area during that same time period , early side scan sonar was introduced into the operational practices of shallow water hydrographic surveying a massive amount of data is collected during the typical hydrographic survey , often several soundings per square foot bathymetry bathymetric chart echo sounding national irrigation congress offshore survey radio acoustic ranging u.s

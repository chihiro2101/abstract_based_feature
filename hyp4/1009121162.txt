armada esapñola – instituto hidrográfico de la marina coordination of those organizations and product standardization is voluntarily joined with the goal of improving hydrography and safe navigation is conducted by the international hydrographic organization ( iho ) increasingly those charts are provided and used in electronic form unders iho standards hydrographic survey conducted by non-national agencies governmental entities below the national level conduct or contract for hydrographic surveys for waters within their jurisdictions with both internal and contract assets such surveys commonly are conducted by national organizations or under their supervision or the standards they have approved , particularly when the use is for the purposes of chart making and distribution or the dredging of state-controlled waters in the united states , there is coordination with the national hydrography dataset in survey collection and publication wisconsin dnr – surface water ( hydrography ) data – conversion from coverage to geodatabase state environmental organizations publish hydrographic data relating to their mission commercial entities also conduct large-scale hydrographic and geophysics surveying , particularly in the dredging , marine construction , oil exploration , and drilling industries survey firms are also contracted to survey in support of design and engineering firms that are under contract for large public projects infrastructure survey in turkey 14 december 2009 private surveys are also conducted before dredging operations and after these operations are completed hydrographic survey by crowdsourcing with this approach there is no need for a specific survey vessel , or for professionally qualified surveyors to be on board , as the expertise is in the data processing that occurs once the data is uploaded to the server after the voyage in either case , the depths measured had to be read manually and recorded , as did the position of each measurement with regard to mapped reference points as determined by three-point sextant fixes this greatly increased the speed of acquiring sounding data over that possible with lead lines and sounding poles by allowing information on depths beneath a vessel to be gathered in a series of lines spaced at a specified distance in 1904 , wire-drag surveys were introduced into hydrography , and the united states coast and geodetic survey′s nicholas h the location of the '' v '' revealed the position of submerged rocks , wrecks , and other obstructions , while the depth at which the wire was set showed the depth at which the obstruction was encountered this method revolutionized hydrographic surveying , as it allowed a quicker , less laborious , and far more complete survey of an area than did the use of lead lines and sounding poles prior to the advent of sidescan sonar , wire-drag surveying was the only method for searching large areas for obstructions and lost vessels and aircraft in the late 1960 's , single beam hydrographic surveys were conducted using widely spaced track lines and the shallow ( peak ) soundings in the bottom data were retained in preference to deeper soundings in the sounding record during that same time period , early side scan sonar was introduced into the operational practices of shallow water hydrographic surveying in fact , important information was deduced about the shape of the bottom and manmade items on the bottom , based on the regions where there were absences of detectable echo amplitudes ( shadows ) fish , j a massive amount of data is collected during the typical hydrographic survey , often several soundings per square foot , bad soundings , ) and for the effects of tides , waves/ heave , water level and thermoclines ( water temperature differences ) noaa 's hydrographic website nos data explorer portal the support for hydrographer teamsurv – crowd sourced hydrographic surveying

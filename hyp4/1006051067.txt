ptms involving addition of functional groups . hydrophobic groups for membrane localization myristoylation ( a type of acylation ) , attachment of myristate , a c 14 saturated acid palmitoylation ( a type of acylation ) , attachment of palmitate , a c 16 saturated acid isoprenylation or prenylation , the addition of an isoprenoid group ( e.g diphthamide formation ( on a histidine found in eef2 ) ethanolamine phosphoglycerol attachment ( on glutamate found in eef1 & alpha ; ) hypusine formation ( on conserved lysine of eif5a ( eukaryotic ) and aif5a ( archaeal ) ) beta-lysine addition on a conserved lysine of the elongation factor p ( efp ) in most bacteria o-acylation ( esters ) , n-acylation ( amides ) , s-acylation ( thioesters ) acetylation , the addition of an acetyl group , either at the n-terminus of the protein or at lysine residues methyl , ethyl methylation the addition of a methyl group , usually at lysine or arginine residues amide bond formation amino acid addition arginylation , a trna-mediation addition polyglutamylation , covalent linkage of glutamic acid residues to the n-terminus of tubulin and some other proteins ( see tubulin polyglutamylase ) polyglycylation , covalent linkage of one to more than 40 glycine residues to the tubulin c-terminal tail butyrylation gamma-carboxylation dependent on vitamin k glycosylation , the addition of a glycosyl group to either arginine , asparagine , cysteine , hydroxylysine , serine , threonine , tyrosine , or tryptophan resulting in a glycoprotein carbamylation : the addition of isocyanic acid to a protein 's n-terminus or the side-chain of lys or cys residues , typically resulting from exposure to urea solutions pegylation : covalent attachment of polyethylene glycol ( peg ) using a pegylation reagent , typically to the n-terminus or the side-chains of lys residues ubiquitination , the covalent linkage to the protein ubiquitin after 7 days of nicotine treatment of mice , the post-translational modifications consisting of acetylation of both histone h3 and histone h4 was increased at the fosb promoter in the nucleus accumbens of the brain , causing a 61 % increase in fosb expression repeated cocaine administration in mice induces post-translational modifications including hyperacetylation of histone h3 or histone h4 at 1,696 genes in one brain reward region the nucleus accumbens and deacetylation at 206 genes at least 45 genes , shown in previous studies to be upregulated in the nucleus accumbens of mice after chronic cocaine exposure , were found to be associated with post-translational hyperacetylation of histone h3 or histone h4 in 2013 , 22.7 million persons aged 12 or older in the united states needed treatment for an illicit drug or alcohol use problem ( 8.6 percent of persons aged 12 or older ) .

ptms involving addition of functional groups myristoylation ( a type of acylation ) , attachment of myristate , a c 14 saturated acid palmitoylation ( a type of acylation ) , attachment of palmitate , a c 16 saturated acid isoprenylation or prenylation , the addition of an isoprenoid group ( e.g farnesol and geranylgeraniol ) farnesylation geranylgeranylation glypiation , gpi anchor formation via an amide bond to c-terminal tail o-acylation ( esters ) , n-acylation ( amides ) , s-acylation ( thioesters ) acetylation , the addition of an acetyl group , either at the n-terminus of the protein or at lysine residues methyl , ethyl methylation the addition of a methyl group , usually at lysine or arginine residues formed by oxidative dissociation of a c-terminal gly residue amide bond formation amino acid addition arginylation , a trna-mediation addition polyglutamylation , covalent linkage of glutamic acid residues to the n-terminus of tubulin and some other proteins carbamylation the addition of isocyanic acid to a protein 's n-terminus or the side-chain of lys biotinylation : covalent attachment of a biotin moiety using a biotinylation reagent , typically for the purpose of labeling a protein carbamylation : the addition of isocyanic acid to a protein 's n-terminus or the side-chain of lys or cys residues , typically resulting from exposure to urea solutions isgylation , the covalent linkage to the isg15 protein ( interferon-stimulated gene 15 ) sumoylation , the covalent linkage to the sumo protein ( small ubiquitin-related modifier ) van g ubiquitination , the covalent linkage to the protein ubiquitin after 7 days of nicotine treatment of mice , the post-translational modifications consisting of acetylation of both histone h3 and histone h4 was increased at the fosb promoter in the nucleus accumbens of the brain , causing a 61 % increase in fosb expression similarly , after 15 days of nicotine treatment of rats , the post-translational modification consisting of 3-fold increased acetylation of histone h4 occurs at the promoter of the dopamine d1 receptor ( drd1 ) gene in the prefrontal cortex ( pfc ) of the rats at least 45 genes , shown in previous studies to be upregulated in the nucleus accumbens of mice after chronic cocaine exposure , were found to be associated with post-translational hyperacetylation of histone h3 or histone h4

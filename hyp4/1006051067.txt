ptms involving addition of functional groups myristoylation ( a type of acylation ) , attachment of myristate , a c 14 saturated acid palmitoylation ( a type of acylation ) , attachment of palmitate , a c 16 saturated acid isoprenylation or prenylation , the addition of an isoprenoid group ( e.g farnesol and geranylgeraniol ) farnesylation geranylgeranylation glypiation , gpi anchor formation via an amide bond to c-terminal tail efp is a homolog to eif5a ( eukaryotic ) and aif5a ( archaeal ) ( see above ) o-acylation ( esters ) , n-acylation ( amides ) , s-acylation ( thioesters ) acetylation , the addition of an acetyl group , either at the n-terminus of the protein or at lysine residues methyl , ethyl methylation the addition of a methyl group , usually at lysine or arginine residues amide bond formation amino acid addition arginylation , a trna-mediation addition polyglutamylation , covalent linkage of glutamic acid residues to the n-terminus of tubulin and some other proteins glycation , the addition of a sugar molecule to a protein without the controlling action of an enzyme spontaneous isopeptide bond formation , as found in many surface proteins of gram-positive bacteria carbamylation : the addition of isocyanic acid to a protein 's n-terminus or the side-chain of lys or cys residues , typically resulting from exposure to urea solutions pegylation is used to improve the efficacy of protein pharmaceuticals protein sequences contain sequence motifs that are recognized by modifying enzymes , and which can be documented or predicted in ptm databases with the large number of different modifications being discovered , there is a need to document this sort of information in databases once particular post-translational epigenetic modifications occur , they appear to be long lasting '' molecular scars '' that may account for the persistence of addictions in rats exposed to alcohol for up to 5 days , there was an increase in the post-translational modification of histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation , h3k9ac , in the nociceptin promoter in the brain amygdala complex

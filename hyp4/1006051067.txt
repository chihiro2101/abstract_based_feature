myristoylation ( a type of acylation ) , attachment of myristate , a c 14 saturated acid palmitoylation ( a type of acylation ) , attachment of palmitate , a c 16 saturated acid isoprenylation or prenylation , the addition of an isoprenoid group ( e.g farnesol and geranylgeraniol ) farnesylation geranylgeranylation glypiation , gpi anchor formation via an amide bond to c-terminal tail efp is a homolog to eif5a ( eukaryotic ) and aif5a ( archaeal ) ( see above ) o-acylation ( esters ) , n-acylation ( amides ) , s-acylation ( thioesters ) acetylation , the addition of an acetyl group , either at the n-terminus of the protein or at lysine residues methyl , ethyl methylation the addition of a methyl group , usually at lysine or arginine residues amide bond formation amino acid addition arginylation , a trna-mediation addition polyglutamylation , covalent linkage of glutamic acid residues to the n-terminus of tubulin and some other proteins carbamylation the addition of isocyanic acid to a protein 's n-terminus or the side-chain of lys spontaneous isopeptide bond formation , as found in many surface proteins of gram-positive bacteria biotinylation : covalent attachment of a biotin moiety using a biotinylation reagent , typically for the purpose of labeling a protein carbamylation : the addition of isocyanic acid to a protein 's n-terminus or the side-chain of lys or cys residues , typically resulting from exposure to urea solutions oxidation : addition of one or more oxygen atoms to a susceptible side-chain , principally of met , trp , his or cys residues in 2011 , statistics of each post-translational modification experimentally and putatively detected have been compiled using proteome-wide information from the swiss-prot database in the nucleus accumbens of the brain , delta fosb functions as a '' sustained molecular switch '' and '' master control protein '' in the development of an addiction in rats exposed to alcohol for up to 5 days , there was an increase in the post-translational modification of histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation , h3k9ac , in the nociceptin promoter in the brain amygdala complex at least 45 genes , shown in previous studies to be upregulated in the nucleus accumbens of mice after chronic cocaine exposure , were found to be associated with post-translational hyperacetylation of histone h3 or histone h4

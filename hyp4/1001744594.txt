the basal metabolic rate of flighted species is much higher than that of flightless terrestrial birds but energetic efficiency can only help explain the loss of flight when the benefits of flying are not critical to survival research on flightless rails indicates the flightless condition evolved in the absence of predators this shows flight to be generally necessary for survival and dispersal in birds in apparent contradiction to this , many landmasses occupied by ratites are also inhabited by predatory mammals however , the kâ€“pg extinction event created a window of time with large predators absent that may have allowed the ancestors of ratites to evolve flightlessness ratites in general have many physical characteristics in common , which are often not shared by the family tinamidae , or tinamous they have no feather vanes , which means they do not need to oil their feathers , hence they have no preen glands they have no separation of pterylae ( feathered areas ) and apteria ( non-feathered areas ) , for definitions of the two latin words and finally , they have palaeognathous palates emus , cassowaries , and kiwis show some dimorphism , predominantly in size moas and elephant birds were the largest native herbivores in their faunas , far larger than contemporary herbivorous mammals in the latter 's case rhea feathers are popular for dusters , and eggs and meat are used for chicken and pet feed in south america

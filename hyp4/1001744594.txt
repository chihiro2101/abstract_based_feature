loss of flight allows birds to eliminate the costs of maintaining various flight-enabling like high pectoral muscle mass , hollow bones and a light build , et cetera but energetic efficiency can only help explain the loss of flight when the benefits of flying are not critical to survival however , the kâ€“pg extinction event created a window of time with large predators absent that may have allowed the ancestors of ratites to evolve flightlessness one hypothesis suggests that as predation pressure decreases on islands with low raptor species richness and no mammalian predators , the need for large , powerful flight muscles that make for a quick escape decreases moreover , raptor species tend to become generalist predators on islands with low species richness , as opposed to specializing in the predation of birds an increase in leg size compensates for a reduction in wing length in insular birds that have not lost flight by providing a longer lever to increase force generated during the thrust that initiates takeoff ratites in general have many physical characteristics in common , which are often not shared by the family tinamidae , or tinamous they have no feather vanes , which means they do not need to oil their feathers , hence they have no preen glands image : autruche thoiry 19801.jpg ostrich image : masai ostriches benh.jpg ostrich herd ( s moas and elephant birds were the largest native herbivores in their faunas , far larger than contemporary herbivorous mammals in the latter 's case ostrich farming grew out of this need , and humans harvested feathers , hides , eggs , and meat from the ostrich rhea feathers are popular for dusters , and eggs and meat are used for chicken and pet feed in south america

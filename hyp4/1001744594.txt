loss of flight allows birds to eliminate the costs of maintaining various flight-enabling like high pectoral muscle mass , hollow bones and a light build , et cetera the basal metabolic rate of flighted species is much higher than that of flightless terrestrial birds research on flightless rails indicates the flightless condition evolved in the absence of predators in apparent contradiction to this , many landmasses occupied by ratites are also inhabited by predatory mammals however , the kâ€“pg extinction event created a window of time with large predators absent that may have allowed the ancestors of ratites to evolve flightlessness moreover , raptor species tend to become generalist predators on islands with low species richness , as opposed to specializing in the predation of birds ratites in general have many physical characteristics in common , which are often not shared by the family tinamidae , or tinamous while the ratites share a lot of similarities , they also have major differences image : autruche thoiry 19801.jpg ostrich image : masai ostriches benh.jpg ostrich herd ( s some extinct ratites might have had odder lifestyles , such as the narrow-billed diogenornis and palaeotis , compared to the shorebird-like lithornithids , and could imply similar animalivorous diets ratites are different from the flying birds in that they needed to adapt or evolve certain features to protect their young rhea feathers are popular for dusters , and eggs and meat are used for chicken and pet feed in south america

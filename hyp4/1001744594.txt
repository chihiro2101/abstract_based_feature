the basal metabolic rate of flighted species is much higher than that of flightless terrestrial birds research on flightless rails indicates the flightless condition evolved in the absence of predators in apparent contradiction to this , many landmasses occupied by ratites are also inhabited by predatory mammals however , the kâ€“pg extinction event created a window of time with large predators absent that may have allowed the ancestors of ratites to evolve flightlessness moreover , raptor species tend to become generalist predators on islands with low species richness , as opposed to specializing in the predation of birds an increase in leg size compensates for a reduction in wing length in insular birds that have not lost flight by providing a longer lever to increase force generated during the thrust that initiates takeoff without exception , ratite chicks are capable of swimming and even diving ratite chicks tend to be more omnivorous or insectivorous ; similarities in adults end with feeding , as they all vary in diet and length of digestive tract , which is indicative of diet also , most ratites have communal nests , where they share the incubating duties with others cassowaries and emu are polyandrous , with males incubating eggs and rearing chicks with no obvious contribution from females rhea feathers are popular for dusters , and eggs and meat are used for chicken and pet feed in south america 106-387 ) amended the poultry products inspection act to make federal inspection of ratite meat mandatory as of april 2001 ( 21 u.s.c

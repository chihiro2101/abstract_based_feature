in an election using the additional member system , each voter casts two votes : a vote for a candidate standing in their constituency ( with or without an affiliated party ) , and a vote for a party list standing in a wider region made up of multiple constituencies the constituency vote is used to elect a single representative in the voter 's constituency using the traditional first past the post system : the candidate plurality ( voting ) ( not necessarily a majority of the electorate ) wins the regional vote is used to elect representatives from party lists to stand in regional seats , taking into account how many seats were gained by that party in the constituency vote , using a system of proportional representation : the number of seats a party receives will roughly reflect its percentage of the vote with a similar model in bavaria the second vote is not simply for the party but for one of the candidates on the party 's regional list and both votes count for party and candidates so that every vote counts : bavaria uses seven regions for this purpose in baden-w√ºrttemberg there are no lists ; they use the '' best near-winner '' method in a four-region model , where the regional members are the local candidates of the under-represented party in that region who received the most votes in their local constituency without being elected in it , but this model has not been copied in the united kingdom in the model of ams used in the united kingdom , the regional seats are divided using a d'hondt method however , the number of seats already won in the local constituencies is taken into account in the calculations for the list seats , and the first average taken in account for each party follows the number of fptp seats won the largest party in an election is likely to win a smaller number of proportional seats , so that governing parties may lose diversity , unless the members elected from the party list when it was in opposition then win local seats when the party gains enough support to form the government the system implemented for the scottish parliament is known to make it more difficult for any one party to win an outright majority , compared to the first-past-the-post system used for general elections to the uk parliament in westminster the arbuthnott commission found references to first and second votes fuelled a misconception that the constituency vote should be a first preference and the regional vote a second one

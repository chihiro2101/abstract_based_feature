in an election using the additional member system , each voter casts two votes : a vote for a candidate standing in their constituency ( with or without an affiliated party ) , and a vote for a party list standing in a wider region made up of multiple constituencies the constituency vote is used to elect a single representative in the voter 's constituency using the traditional first past the post system : the candidate plurality ( voting ) ( not necessarily a majority of the electorate ) wins the regional vote is used to elect representatives from party lists to stand in regional seats , taking into account how many seats were gained by that party in the constituency vote , using a system of proportional representation : the number of seats a party receives will roughly reflect its percentage of the vote with a similar model in bavaria the second vote is not simply for the party but for one of the candidates on the party 's regional list and both votes count for party and candidates so that every vote counts : bavaria uses seven regions for this purpose in baden-w√ºrttemberg there are no lists ; they use the '' best near-winner '' method in a four-region model , where the regional members are the local candidates of the under-represented party in that region who received the most votes in their local constituency without being elected in it , but this model has not been copied in the united kingdom in the model of ams used in the united kingdom , the regional seats are divided using a d'hondt method for example , if a party won 5 constituency seats , then the first d'hondt divisor taken for that party would be 6 ( 5 seats + 1 ) , not 1 in the italian model of ams , used from 1993 to 2005 , for every constituency seat won by a party , that party 's vote total was reduced by the number of votes received by the second-place candidate in the constituency , subject to the condition that the deduction can not be less than either 25 % of the total votes cast in the constituency , or the votes received by the winning candidate , whichever is less since smaller parties are likely , in compensatory systems , to win a larger number of proportional seats , such additional member systems could hand additional political power to the leaders of these parties at the expense of regional directly elected representatives , unless the additional members are elected on an open regional list or a closed regional list as in scotland and wales in the run up to the 2007 scottish election , the labour party had considered not fielding list candidates in the glasgow , west of scotland , and central scotland regions , as their constituency strength in the previous two elections had resulted in no list msps ; instead they proposed to support a list composed of co-operative party candidates

in an election using the additional member system , each voter casts two votes : a vote for a candidate standing in their constituency ( with or without an affiliated party ) , and a vote for a party list standing in a wider region made up of multiple constituencies the constituency vote is used to elect a single representative in the voter 's constituency using the traditional first past the post system : the candidate plurality ( voting ) ( not necessarily a majority of the electorate ) wins the regional vote is used to elect representatives from party lists to stand in regional seats , taking into account how many seats were gained by that party in the constituency vote , using a system of proportional representation : the number of seats a party receives will roughly reflect its percentage of the vote in the regional vote , the voter votes for a specific party , but has no control over which candidates from the party are elected with a similar model in bavaria the second vote is not simply for the party but for one of the candidates on the party 's regional list and both votes count for party and candidates so that every vote counts : bavaria uses seven regions for this purpose in baden-w√ºrttemberg there are no lists ; they use the '' best near-winner '' method in a four-region model , where the regional members are the local candidates of the under-represented party in that region who received the most votes in their local constituency without being elected in it , but this model has not been copied in the united kingdom for example , if a party won 5 constituency seats , then the first d'hondt divisor taken for that party would be 6 ( 5 seats + 1 ) , not 1 as in many systems containing or based upon party-list representation , in order to be eligible for list seats in some ams models , a party must earn at least a certain percentage of the total party vote , or no candidates will be elected from the party list the largest party in an election is likely to win a smaller number of proportional seats , so that governing parties may lose diversity , unless the members elected from the party list when it was in opposition then win local seats when the party gains enough support to form the government in the first election for scotland 's new parliament , the majority of voters surveyed misunderstood some key aspects of the difference there between the '' first '' ( constituency ) vote and the '' second '' ( regional list ) vote ; indeed in some ways the understanding worsened in the second election

in an election using the additional member system , each voter casts two votes : a vote for a candidate standing in their constituency ( with or without an affiliated party ) , and a vote for a party list standing in a wider region made up of multiple constituencies the regional vote is used to elect representatives from party lists to stand in regional seats , taking into account how many seats were gained by that party in the constituency vote , using a system of proportional representation : the number of seats a party receives will roughly reflect its percentage of the vote with a similar model in bavaria the second vote is not simply for the party but for one of the candidates on the party 's regional list and both votes count for party and candidates so that every vote counts : bavaria uses seven regions for this purpose in the model of ams used in the united kingdom , the regional seats are divided using a d'hondt method as in many systems containing or based upon party-list representation , in order to be eligible for list seats in some ams models , a party must earn at least a certain percentage of the total party vote , or no candidates will be elected from the party list since smaller parties are likely , in compensatory systems , to win a larger number of proportional seats , such additional member systems could hand additional political power to the leaders of these parties at the expense of regional directly elected representatives , unless the additional members are elected on an open regional list or a closed regional list as in scotland and wales the largest party in an election is likely to win a smaller number of proportional seats , so that governing parties may lose diversity , unless the members elected from the party list when it was in opposition then win local seats when the party gains enough support to form the government between them , the two decoy lists won 360 of the 475 constituency seats , more than half of the total of 630 seats available , despite winning a combined total of less than 0.2 % of the national proportional part of the vote the system implemented for the scottish parliament is known to make it more difficult for any one party to win an outright majority , compared to the first-past-the-post system used for general elections to the uk parliament in westminster in the first election for scotland 's new parliament , the majority of voters surveyed misunderstood some key aspects of the difference there between the '' first '' ( constituency ) vote and the '' second '' ( regional list ) vote ; indeed in some ways the understanding worsened in the second election

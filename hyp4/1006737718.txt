in an election using the additional member system , each voter casts two votes : a vote for a candidate standing in their constituency ( with or without an affiliated party ) , and a vote for a party list standing in a wider region made up of multiple constituencies the regional vote is used to elect representatives from party lists to stand in regional seats , taking into account how many seats were gained by that party in the constituency vote , using a system of proportional representation : the number of seats a party receives will roughly reflect its percentage of the vote the arbuthnott commission recommended that scotland change to a model where the voter can vote for a specific regional candidate as well , but this has not been implemented with a similar model in bavaria the second vote is not simply for the party but for one of the candidates on the party 's regional list and both votes count for party and candidates so that every vote counts : bavaria uses seven regions for this purpose in baden-württemberg there are no lists ; they use the '' best near-winner '' method in a four-region model , where the regional members are the local candidates of the under-represented party in that region who received the most votes in their local constituency without being elected in it , but this model has not been copied in the united kingdom however the elections for the london assembly have a threshold of 5 % which has at times denied seats to the christian peoples alliance ( in the 2000 election ) , the british national party , respect – the unity coalition ( both in the 2004 election ) , and the women 's equality party ( in the 2016 election ) since smaller parties are likely , in compensatory systems , to win a larger number of proportional seats , such additional member systems could hand additional political power to the leaders of these parties at the expense of regional directly elected representatives , unless the additional members are elected on an open regional list or a closed regional list as in scotland and wales so-called '' decoy lists '' are a trick to unhinge the compensation mechanisms contained into the proportional part of the ams , so to de facto establish a parallel voting system the system implemented for the scottish parliament is known to make it more difficult for any one party to win an outright majority , compared to the first-past-the-post system used for general elections to the uk parliament in westminster in the first election for scotland 's new parliament , the majority of voters surveyed misunderstood some key aspects of the difference there between the '' first '' ( constituency ) vote and the '' second '' ( regional list ) vote ; indeed in some ways the understanding worsened in the second election

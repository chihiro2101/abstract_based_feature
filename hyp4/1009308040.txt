in the philosophy of science , the term scientism frequently implies a critique of the more extreme expressions of logical positivism and has been used by social scientists such as friedrich hayek , philosophers of science such as karl popper , and philosophers such as mary midgley , the later hilary putnam , and tzvetan todorov tzvetan todorov more generally , scientism is interpreted as science applied '' in excess '' it can also address the attempt to apply '' hard science '' methodology and claims of certainty to the social sciences , which friedrich hayek described in the counter-revolution of science ( 1952 ) as being impossible , because that methodology involves attempting to eliminate the '' human factor '' , while social sciences ( including his own field of economics ) center almost purely on praxeology '' the belief that the methods of natural science , or the categories and things recognized in natural science , form the only proper elements in any philosophical or other inquiry '' , or that '' science , and only science , describes the world as it is in itself , independent of perspective '' with a concomitant '' elimination of the psychological and spiritual dimensions of experience '' it is also sometimes used to describe universal applicability of the scientific method and approach , and the view that empirical science constitutes the most authoritative worldview or the most valuable part of human learning—sometimes to the complete exclusion of other viewpoints , such as historical , philosophical , economic or cultural worldviews it has been defined as '' the view that the characteristic inductive methods of the natural sciences are the only source of genuine factual knowledge and , in particular , that they alone can yield true knowledge about man and society '' allan bullock & stephen trombley ( eds ) , the new fontana dictionary of modern thought , london : harper collins , 1999 , p.775 the term scientism is also used by historians , philosophers , and cultural critics to highlight the possible dangers of lapses towards excessive reductionism in all fields of human knowledge for social theorists in the tradition of max weber , such as jürgen habermas and max horkheimer , the concept of scientism relates significantly to the philosophy of positivism , but also to the cultural rationalization for modern western civilization an example of this second usage is to label as scientism any attempt to claim science as the only or primary source of human values ( a traditional domain of ethics ) or as the source of meaning and purpose ( a traditional domain of religion and related worldviews ) theologian john haught argued that philosopher daniel dennett and other new atheists subscribe to a belief system of scientific naturalism , which holds the central dogma that '' only nature , including humans and our creations , is real : that god does not exist ; and that science alone can give us complete and reliable knowledge of reality '' echoing common criticisms of logical positivism and verificationism , philosopher of religion keith ward has said scientism is philosophically inconsistent or even self-refuting , as the truth of the two statements '' no statements are true unless they can be proven scientifically ( or logically ) '' and '' no statements are true unless they can be shown empirically to be true '' can not themselves be proven scientifically , logically , or empirically

the red arrows were not the first raf aerobatics team an raf pageant was held at hendon in 1920 with teams from front-line biplane squadrons 32 squadron raf flew an air display six nights a week entitled '' london defended '' at the british empire exhibition one of the pilots in the display was flying officer c 72 squadron was flying a team of seven 54 squadron became the first raf jet formation team to use smoke trails this team became the first team to fly a five-hunter formation in 1958 , the black arrows performed a loop and barrel roll of 22 hunters , a world record for the greatest number of aircraft looped in formation 74 squadron ) were re-equipped with the supersonic english electric lightning and performed wing-overs and rolls with nine aircraft in tight formation in 1964 , the red pelicans , flying six bac jet provost t mk 4s , assumed the role of the raf 's leading display team this team became known as the yellowjacks after flight lieutenant lee jones 's call sign , '' yellowjack '' in 1964 , all the raf display teams were amalgamated , as it was feared pilots were spending too much time practising formation aerobatics rather than operational training the royal air force aerobatic team , the formal name of the red arrows , began life at raf little rissington in gloucestershire , then the central flying school the first team , led by squadron leader lee jones , had seven display pilots and flew the folland gnat t1 jet trainer in 1968 , the then team leader ( sqn ldr ray hanna ) expanded the team from seven to nine jets , as he wanted to expand the team 's capabilities and the permutations of formation patterns since being introduced into service with the red arrows , the hawk has performed with the red arrows in 50 countries according to the bbc , disbanding the red arrows will be highly unlikely , as they are a considerable attraction throughout the world the ministry of defence confirmed in june 2012 that the red arrows would remain at raf scampton until at least the end of the decade pilots must have completed one or more operational tours on a fast jet such as the tornado , harrier , or typhoon , have accumulated at least 1,500 flying hours , and have been assessed as above average in their operational role to be eligible pilots stay with the red arrows for a three-year tour of duty three pilots are changed every year , such that normally three first-year pilots , three second-year pilots , and three in their final year are on the team the team leader also spends three years with the team during the second half of each display , the red arrows split into two sections at the end of each season , one of that year 's new pilots will be chosen to be red 7 for the following season , with that year 's red 7 taking over as red 6 if one of the pilots is not able to fly , the team flies an eight-plane formation however , if the team leader , 'red 1 ' , is unable to fly , then the team does not display at all the pilots spend six months from october to april practising for the display season the new pilots joining the team spend their first season flying at the front of the formation near the team leader the exception to this are reds 6 and 7 ( the synchro pair ) , who fly in the 'stem ' of the formation - the two positions behind the team leader during an aerobatics display , red arrows pilots experience forces up to five times g-force , and when performing the aerobatic manoeuvre 'vixen break ' , forces up to 7g can be reached , close to the 8g structural limit of the aircraft on 13 may 2009 , it was announced that the red arrows would include their first female display pilot the team departed the uk on friday 18 march 2011 and travelled to cyprus to undertake exercise springhawk at raf akrotiri the first 9-ship practice was flown on the first day of training in cyprus on monday 21 march 2011 the team gained their public display authority ( pda ) on 20 may 2011 , just two days before their first planned public display in crete the engineering team that supports the red arrows is known as '' the blues '' and consists of 85 members drawn from various technical ( and support ) trades in the raf the team use the same two-seat training aircraft used for advanced pilot training , at first the folland gnat which was replaced in 1979 by the bae hawk the first display by the red arrows was at raf little rissington on 6 may 1965 the display was to introduce the royal air force aerobatic team to the media the first display with nine aircraft was on 8 july 1966 at raf little rissington the first display in germany was at raf laarbruch on 6 august 1965 the red arrows performed in germany a further 170 times before formation aerobatics were banned in germany following the ramstein airshow disaster in 1988 following the accidents during the 2011 season , the red arrows retained red 8 and moved the original red 10 to the red 5 position to enable them to continue displaying with nine aircraft in 2014 , the red arrows celebrated 50 years of aerobatic history as a display team returning to raf fairford for the royal international air tattoo wg cdr ernie jones ejected ok ( xp539 actually belonged to the red arrows , but was a reserve ship not fitted with smoke ; : hawk xx297 flown by flt lt dan findlay flew into the jet wash of the leading aircraft during a practice display at raf scampton and was unable to relight the hawk 's engine flt lt stark was unable to resume his place in the 2018 display team and was replaced by sqn ldr mike ling , outgoing red 10

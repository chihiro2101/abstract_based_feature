the red arrows were not the first raf aerobatics team an raf pageant was held at hendon in 1920 with teams from front-line biplane squadrons 32 squadron raf flew an air display six nights a week entitled '' london defended '' at the british empire exhibition the display involved firing blank ammunition into the stadium crowds and dropping pyrotechnics from the aeroplanes to simulate shrapnel from guns on the ground london : fleetway press in 1947 , the first jet team of three de havilland vampires came from raf odiham fighter wing 54 squadron became the first raf jet formation team to use smoke trails the official raf team was provided by no after a demonstration in france , they were hailed as '' les fleches noires '' and from then on known as the black arrows this team became the first team to fly a five-hunter formation in 1958 , the black arrows performed a loop and barrel roll of 22 hunters , a world record for the greatest number of aircraft looped in formation in 1964 , the red pelicans , flying six bac jet provost t mk 4s , assumed the role of the raf 's leading display team this team became known as the yellowjacks after flight lieutenant lee jones 's call sign , '' yellowjack '' the new team name took the word '' red '' from the fact that the red pelicans ' planes had been painted red ( for safety reasons , as it was a far clearer and more visible colour in the sky ) and '' arrows '' after the black arrows the royal air force aerobatic team , the formal name of the red arrows , began life at raf little rissington in gloucestershire , then the central flying school as an economy measure , scampton closed in 1995 , so the red arrows moved just 20 miles to raf cranwell ; however , as they still used the air space above scampton , the emergency facilities and runways had to be maintained the first team , led by squadron leader lee jones , had seven display pilots and flew the folland gnat t1 jet trainer by the end of their first season , the red arrows had displayed 65 times in britain , france , italy , holland , germany , and belgium and were awarded the britannia trophy by the royal aero club for their contribution to aviation in 1968 , the then team leader ( sqn ldr ray hanna ) expanded the team from seven to nine jets , as he wanted to expand the team 's capabilities and the permutations of formation patterns during this season , the 'diamond nine ' pattern was formed and it has remained the team 's trademark pattern ever since after displaying 1,292 times in the folland gnat , the red arrows took delivery of the bae hawk in 1979 since being introduced into service with the red arrows , the hawk has performed with the red arrows in 50 countries in july 2004 , speculation surfaced in the british media that the red arrows would be disbanded , after a defence spending review , due to running costs between £5 million and £6 million according to the bbc , disbanding the red arrows will be highly unlikely , as they are a considerable attraction throughout the world with the planned closure of raf scampton , the future home of the red arrows became uncertain on 20 may 2008 , months of speculation were ended when it was revealed that the ministry of defence were moving the red arrows to nearby raf waddington the ministry of defence confirmed in june 2012 that the red arrows would remain at raf scampton until at least the end of the decade pilots must have completed one or more operational tours on a fast jet such as the tornado , harrier , or typhoon , have accumulated at least 1,500 flying hours , and have been assessed as above average in their operational role to be eligible the 'boss ' , as he is known to the rest of the team , is always a pilot who has previously completed a three-year tour with the red arrows , often ( although not always ) including a season as the leader of the synchro pair reds 1 to 5 are known as 'enid ' ( named after enid blyton , author of the famous five books ) and reds 6 to 9 are known as 'gypo ' ( the nickname of one of the team 's pilots back in the 1960s ) pilots wear green flying suits during training , and are only allowed to wear their red flying suits once they are awarded their public display authority at the end of winter training as their experience and proficiency improve , they move to positions further back in the formation in their second and third seasons pilots who start on the left of the formation stay on that side for the duration of their three-year tour ; the pilots on the right side stay on the right as well as the nine pilots , 'red 10 ' , who is the team supervisor , is a fully qualified hawk pilot who flies the tenth aircraft when the red arrows are away from base red 10 's duties include co-ordination of all practices and displays and acting as the team 's ground safety officer red 10 often flies tv cameramen and photographers for air-to-air pictures of the red arrows and also provides the commentary for all of the team 's displays the team received its pda on 22 may 2012 , having taken part in the armed forces muster for elizabeth ii 's diamond jubilee at windsor castle three days earlier the engineering team that supports the red arrows is known as '' the blues '' and consists of 85 members drawn from various technical ( and support ) trades in the raf each season nine members of the blues are selected to be members of the 'circus ' each member of the circus works with the same pilot for the duration of the season and is responsible for servicing their aircraft and preparing their flying kit prior to each display the first display by the red arrows was at raf little rissington on 6 may 1965 the display was to introduce the royal air force aerobatic team to the media the red arrows performed in germany a further 170 times before formation aerobatics were banned in germany following the ramstein airshow disaster in 1988 if the cloud base is less than but more than the team will perform the rolling display , substituting wing-overs and rolls for the loops the greatest number of displays flown in any year was in 1995 , when the red arrows performed 136 times data from : ejection history - red arrows ; : gnat xr573 hit trees while joining formation during a practice at raf kemble in 1985 , database software released a flight simulator called red arrows , made in cooperation with the flight team

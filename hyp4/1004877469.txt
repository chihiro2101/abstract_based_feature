the red arrows were not the first raf aerobatics team 32 squadron raf flew an air display six nights a week entitled '' london defended '' at the british empire exhibition the display involved firing blank ammunition into the stadium crowds and dropping pyrotechnics from the aeroplanes to simulate shrapnel from guns on the ground vampires were replaced by gloster meteors , no 111 squadron in 1956 , and for the first time , the aircraft had a special colour scheme , which was an all-black finish this team became the first team to fly a five-hunter formation 56 squadron , the firebirds , with nine red and silver lightnings in 1964 , all the raf display teams were amalgamated , as it was feared pilots were spending too much time practising formation aerobatics rather than operational training the royal air force aerobatic team , the formal name of the red arrows , began life at raf little rissington in gloucestershire , then the central flying school the first team , led by squadron leader lee jones , had seven display pilots and flew the folland gnat t1 jet trainer the first display in the uk was on 6 may 1965 , at little rissington for a press day at the subsequent national air day display , three days later , at clermont ferrand in france , one french journalist described the team as '' les fleches rouges '' , confirming the name '' the red arrows '' in 1968 , the then team leader ( sqn ldr ray hanna ) expanded the team from seven to nine jets , as he wanted to expand the team 's capabilities and the permutations of formation patterns during this season , the 'diamond nine ' pattern was formed and it has remained the team 's trademark pattern ever since with the planned closure of raf scampton , the future home of the red arrows became uncertain on 20 may 2008 , months of speculation were ended when it was revealed that the ministry of defence were moving the red arrows to nearby raf waddington the ministry of defence confirmed in june 2012 that the red arrows would remain at raf scampton until at least the end of the decade would close by 2022 , and in may 2020 it was announced that the red arrows would be relocated to nearby raf waddington the red arrows will continue to use airspace above raf scampton for their training pilots must have completed one or more operational tours on a fast jet such as the tornado , harrier , or typhoon , have accumulated at least 1,500 flying hours , and have been assessed as above average in their operational role to be eligible even then , more than ten pilots apply for each place on the team the 'boss ' , as he is known to the rest of the team , is always a pilot who has previously completed a three-year tour with the red arrows , often ( although not always ) including a season as the leader of the synchro pair if one of the pilots is not able to fly , the team flies an eight-plane formation however , if the team leader , 'red 1 ' , is unable to fly , then the team does not display at all each pilot always flies the same position in the formation during a season during an aerobatics display , red arrows pilots experience forces up to five times g-force , and when performing the aerobatic manoeuvre 'vixen break ' , forces up to 7g can be reached , close to the 8g structural limit of the aircraft as well as the nine pilots , 'red 10 ' , who is the team supervisor , is a fully qualified hawk pilot who flies the tenth aircraft when the red arrows are away from base red 10 's duties include co-ordination of all practices and displays and acting as the team 's ground safety officer on 13 may 2009 , it was announced that the red arrows would include their first female display pilot she joined the raf in 1998 and was a qualified flying instructor on the hawk aircraft at raf valley the team gained their public display authority ( pda ) on 20 may 2011 , just two days before their first planned public display in crete the team received its pda on 22 may 2012 , having taken part in the armed forces muster for elizabeth ii 's diamond jubilee at windsor castle three days earlier the engineering team that supports the red arrows is known as '' the blues '' and consists of 85 members drawn from various technical ( and support ) trades in the raf similarly , the position of circus leader ( red 6 or 7 ) is occupied by a technician of sergeant rank ; the other slots being filled by technicians holding corporal or senior aircraftsman/woman ( sac ( w ) ) rank each member of the circus works with the same pilot for the duration of the season and is responsible for servicing their aircraft and preparing their flying kit prior to each display the team use the same two-seat training aircraft used for advanced pilot training , at first the folland gnat which was replaced in 1979 by the bae hawk the hawks are modified with an uprated engine and a modification to enable smoke to be generated ; diesel is mixed with a coloured dye and ejected into the jet exhaust to produce either red , white or blue smoke the first display by the red arrows was at raf little rissington on 6 may 1965 the first public display in the uk was on 15 may 1965 at the biggin hill international air fair if the cloud base is less than but more than the team will perform the rolling display , substituting wing-overs and rolls for the loops following the accidents during the 2011 season , the red arrows retained red 8 and moved the original red 10 to the red 5 position to enable them to continue displaying with nine aircraft in march 2012 , the mod announced that the red arrows would fly aerobatic displays with seven aircraft during the 2012 display season as flt lt kirsty stewart had moved into a ground-based role with the team as a consequence of this , red 8 also dropped out of the display team to enable an odd number of aircraft to perform and thus maintain formation symmetry however , the team carried out official flypasts with nine aircraft by utilising red 8 as well as ex-red arrow display pilot and current red 10 mike ling the red arrows returned to a full aerobatic formation of nine aircraft in 2013 ;

the challenger lethality improvement programme ( clip ) was a programme to replace the current l30a1 rifled gun with the smoothbore rheinmetall 120 mm gun currently used in the leopard 2a6 the use of a smoothbore weapon would have allowed challenger 2 to use nato standard ammunition developed in germany and the us the production lines for rifled 120 & nbsp ; mm ammunition in the uk have been closed for some years , so existing stocks of ammunition for the l30a1 are finite this means that the challenger 2 now has available new tungsten '' fin '' ( apfsds ) and hesh rounds , if and when required , which secures a line of ammunition for its 55 calibre rifled main gun , the l30 , when required in the future the smoothbore gun is the same length as the l30a1 , and is fitted with the rifled gun 's cradle , thermal sleeve , bore evacuator and muzzle reference system in may 2007 , the ministry of defence 's future systems group invited baes to tender for the challenger 2 capability sustainment program ( c2 csp ) , which combined all upgrades into one programme the challenger 2 life extension programme ( lep ) is designed to replace obsolete equipment , enhance protection , increase range and provide improved lethality of the tank until an out of service date of 2035 - extending its life from 2025 in june 2014 , it was stated that not all of the 227 challenger 2s may be modified to clep standard and the smoothbore cannon had been dropped a royal tank regiment ( rtr ) newsletter dated december 2015 stated that the lep includes managing to curb obsolescence in several turret systems – including ti sights , the fire control computer ( fcc ) and electronic architecture in turret active protection systems ( aps ) for armoured vehicles in the uk armed forces ( including the challenger 2 ) are being assessed by the uk defence science and technical laboratory ( dstl ) as part of the medusa technical assessment programme , this includes the muss system in 2017 a challenger 2 was also fitted with a rheinmetall rosy rapid obscurant system including parts from the israeli military industries ( imi ) iron fist hard-kill aps for development and assessment by the dstl on 22 december 2016 , the assessment phase award to bae systems and rheinmetall land systeme gmbh to progress the challenger 2 life extension project was announced in order to maintain the effectiveness of the thermal imaging system prior to the award and implementation of the cr2 lep , an interim £15.4 million '' challenger 2 thermal imaging sustainment project '' was awarded to bae systems on 15 december 2017 to '' demonstrate and manufacture '' a suitable interim solution separate to that incorporated in the lep in october 2018 , bae systems unveiled its proposed challenger 2 lep technology demonstrator , the “ black night ” the company ’ s solution has been to develop a completely new turret which has a fully digital electronic architecture , new day and night sights for the commander and gunner , and a rheinmetall l55 smoothbore 120 & nbsp ; mm gun options for updating the automotive components of challenger 2 , and its associated variants , are being analysed separately from clep as part of the heavy armour automotive improvement programme ( haaip ) the challenger armoured repair and recovery vehicle ( crarrv ) is an armoured recovery vehicle based on the challenger 1 hull ( with the updated challenger 2 powertrain ) and designed to repair and recover damaged tanks on the battlefield on 14 june 2017 , a challenger 2 from the royal tank regiment suffered an ammunition explosion during live firing exercises at the castlemartin range in pembrokeshire the tank was firing 120 & nbsp ; mm practice shells with a standard propellant charge

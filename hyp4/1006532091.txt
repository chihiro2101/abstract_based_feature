the challenger lethality improvement programme ( clip ) was a programme to replace the current l30a1 rifled gun with the smoothbore rheinmetall 120 mm gun currently used in the leopard 2a6 the use of a smoothbore weapon would have allowed challenger 2 to use nato standard ammunition developed in germany and the us the production lines for rifled 120 & nbsp ; mm ammunition in the uk have been closed for some years , so existing stocks of ammunition for the l30a1 are finite this means that the challenger 2 now has available new tungsten '' fin '' ( apfsds ) and hesh rounds , if and when required , which secures a line of ammunition for its 55 calibre rifled main gun , the l30 , when required in the future in addition , several challenger 2s had the pintle-mounted gpmg on the loader 's crew hatch replaced with a remote controlled turret , allowing the loader to operate the weaponry without having to expose himself to enemy fire the challenger 2 life extension programme ( lep ) is designed to replace obsolete equipment , enhance protection , increase range and provide improved lethality of the tank until an out of service date of 2035 - extending its life from 2025 in june 2014 , it was stated that not all of the 227 challenger 2s may be modified to clep standard and the smoothbore cannon had been dropped a royal tank regiment ( rtr ) newsletter dated december 2015 stated that the lep includes managing to curb obsolescence in several turret systems – including ti sights , the fire control computer ( fcc ) and electronic architecture in turret improved technology will be integrated as a new system on the platform , which will deliver more accurate engagements at range and improved fcc power , meaning that cr2 will remain a '' battle winning '' asset out to the extended out of service date parallel work strands will provide extensions to virtual training systems , deliver improved live fire monitoring equipment ( lfme ) and work is ongoing to develop improved 120 & nbsp ; mm ammunition active protection systems ( aps ) for armoured vehicles in the uk armed forces ( including the challenger 2 ) are being assessed by the uk defence science and technical laboratory ( dstl ) as part of the medusa technical assessment programme , this includes the muss system in addition to bae systems combat vehicles ( uk ) , which is the original manufacturer , contenders were stated to include rheinmetall and krauss-maffei wegmann of germany , general dynamics uk , lockheed martin uk , cmi defence of belgium , and ruag defence of switzerland the lep will see the replacement of most of the tanks electronics , including its sighting systems but does not envisage a major upgrade of the vehicle 's drive systems or replacement of the 120 & nbsp ; mm l30a1 rifled gun teams led by rheinmetall landsystem and bae systems were chosen for the assessment phase of the lep which would cost £53 million - £23 million for each team and £7 million to cover additional , unspecified work in order to maintain the effectiveness of the thermal imaging system prior to the award and implementation of the cr2 lep , an interim £15.4 million '' challenger 2 thermal imaging sustainment project '' was awarded to bae systems on 15 december 2017 to '' demonstrate and manufacture '' a suitable interim solution separate to that incorporated in the lep in october 2019 it was announced that thales would be supplying their catherine megapixel ( mp ) thermal imaging camera which forms part of the thermal imaging sub-system on the tank in october 2018 , bae systems unveiled its proposed challenger 2 lep technology demonstrator , the “ black night ” the challenger armoured repair and recovery vehicle ( crarrv ) is an armoured recovery vehicle based on the challenger 1 hull ( with the updated challenger 2 powertrain ) and designed to repair and recover damaged tanks on the battlefield on 14 june 2017 , a challenger 2 from the royal tank regiment suffered an ammunition explosion during live firing exercises at the castlemartin range in pembrokeshire

technologies like solar panels , wind farm , and other renewable energy sources—together with smart grids , micro-grids , battery storage—can automate power production many supermarkets and even smaller stores are rapidly introducing self-checkout systems reducing the need for employing checkout workers globally , an estimated 192 million workers could be affected by automation according to research by eurasia group . food and drink the food retail industry has started to apply automation to the ordering process ; mcdonald 's has introduced touch screen ordering and payment systems in many of its restaurants , reducing the need for as many cashier employees some cafes and restaurants have utilized mobile and tablet '' apps '' to make the ordering process more efficient by customers ordering and paying on their device currently , it can still require a large amount of human capital , particularly in the third world where labor costs are low so there is less incentive for increasing efficiency through automation the defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) started the research and development of automated visual surveillance and monitoring ( vsam ) program , between 1997 and 1999 , and airborne video surveillance ( avs ) programs , from 1998 to 2002 automated video surveillance monitors people and vehicles in real-time within a busy environment , indoor , outdoor or airborne , the number of sensors that the automated system can handle and the mobility of sensors , i.e full automation commonly defined as requiring no control or very limited control by the driver ; such automation would be accomplished through a combination of sensor , computer , and communications systems in vehicles and along the roadway fully automated driving would , in theory , allow closer vehicle spacing and higher speeds , which could enhance traffic capacity in places where additional road building is physically impossible , politically unacceptable , or prohibitively expensive automated controls also might enhance road safety by reducing the opportunity for driver error , which causes a large share of motor vehicle crashes other potential benefits include improved air quality ( as a result of more-efficient traffic flows ) , increased fuel economy , and spin-off technologies generated during research and development related to automated highway systems bpa consists of integrating applications , restructuring labor resources and using software applications throughout the organization the rise in the usage of home automation solutions has taken a turn reflecting the increased dependency of people on such automation solutions industrial automation deals primarily with the automation of manufacturing , quality control , and material handling processes general-purpose controllers for industrial processes include programmable logic controllers , stand-alone i/o modules , and computers industrial automation is to replace the decision making of humans and manual command-response activities with the use of mechanized equipment and logical programming commands industrial automation and industry 4.0 industrial robotics is a sub-branch in industrial automation that aids in various manufacturing processes programmable logic controllers ( plcs ) use a processing system which allows for variation of controls of inputs and outputs using simple programming however , these early computers required specialist programmers and stringent operating environmental control for temperature , cleanliness , and power quality there are two basic types : desktop automation and automated voice solutions

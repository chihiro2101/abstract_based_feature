many supermarkets and even smaller stores are rapidly introducing self-checkout systems reducing the need for employing checkout workers globally , an estimated 192 million workers could be affected by automation according to research by eurasia group some cafes and restaurants have utilized mobile and tablet '' apps '' to make the ordering process more efficient by customers ordering and paying on their device automated mining involves the removal of human labor from the mining process the defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) started the research and development of automated visual surveillance and monitoring ( vsam ) program , between 1997 and 1999 , and airborne video surveillance ( avs ) programs , from 1998 to 2002 existing automated surveillance systems are based on the environment they are primarily designed to observe , i.e , indoor , outdoor or airborne , the number of sensors that the automated system can handle and the mobility of sensors , i.e the goal of this program is to have the first fully automated highway roadway or an automated test track in operation by 1997 this system shall accommodate the installation of equipment in new and existing motor vehicles fully automated driving would , in theory , allow closer vehicle spacing and higher speeds , which could enhance traffic capacity in places where additional road building is physically impossible , politically unacceptable , or prohibitively expensive automated waste collection trucks prevent the need for as many workers as well as easing the level of labor required to provide the service business process automation ( bpa ) is the technology-enabled automation of complex business processes bpa consists of integrating applications , restructuring labor resources and using software applications throughout the organization however , the increased comfort that gets added through these automation solutions is remarkable automation is essential for many scientific and clinical applications however , automation has not become widespread in laboratories due to its high cost autosamplers are common devices used in laboratory automation industrial automation deals primarily with the automation of manufacturing , quality control , and material handling processes general-purpose controllers for industrial processes include programmable logic controllers , stand-alone i/o modules , and computers scada is a supervisory data collection software , just one of the many used in industrial automation industrial automation incorporates programmable logic controllers in the manufacturing process plcs make it unnecessary to rewire a system to change the control system agent-assisted automation refers to automation used by call center agents to handle customer inquiries

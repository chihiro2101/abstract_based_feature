technologies like solar panels , wind farm , and other renewable energy sources—together with smart grids , micro-grids , battery storage—can automate power production many supermarkets and even smaller stores are rapidly introducing self-checkout systems reducing the need for employing checkout workers in the united states , the retail industry employs 15.9 million people as of 2017 ( around 1 in 9 americans in the workforce ) globally , an estimated 192 million workers could be affected by automation according to research by eurasia group . food and drink the food retail industry has started to apply automation to the ordering process ; mcdonald 's has introduced touch screen ordering and payment systems in many of its restaurants , reducing the need for as many cashier employees some cafes and restaurants have utilized mobile and tablet '' apps '' to make the ordering process more efficient by customers ordering and paying on their device some restaurants have automated food delivery to tables of customers using a conveyor belt sushi currently , it can still require a large amount of human capital , particularly in the third world where labor costs are low so there is less incentive for increasing efficiency through automation automated video surveillance monitors people and vehicles in real-time within a busy environment existing automated surveillance systems are based on the environment they are primarily designed to observe , i.e the purpose of a surveillance system is to record properties and trajectories of objects in a given area , generate warnings or notify the designated authorities in case of occurrence of particular events full automation commonly defined as requiring no control or very limited control by the driver ; such automation would be accomplished through a combination of sensor , computer , and communications systems in vehicles and along the roadway automated waste collection trucks prevent the need for as many workers as well as easing the level of labor required to provide the service business process automation ( bpa ) is the technology-enabled automation of complex business processes robotic process automation ( rpa ; or rpaai for self-guided rpa 2.0 ) is an emerging field within bpa and uses artificial intelligence however , the increased comfort that gets added through these automation solutions is remarkable industrial automation deals primarily with the automation of manufacturing , quality control , and material handling processes industrial automation is to replace the decision making of humans and manual command-response activities with the use of mechanized equipment and logical programming commands implementation of systems such as scada is an example of software that takes place in industrial automation today industrial automation incorporates programmable logic controllers in the manufacturing process however , these early computers required specialist programmers and stringent operating environmental control for temperature , cleanliness , and power quality since many industrial processes have timescales easily addressed by millisecond response times , modern ( fast , small , reliable ) electronics greatly facilitate building reliable controllers , and performance could be traded off for reliability agent-assisted automation refers to automation used by call center agents to handle customer inquiries

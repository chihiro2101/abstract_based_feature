technologies like solar panels , wind farm , and other renewable energy sources—together with smart grids , micro-grids , battery storage—can automate power production many supermarkets and even smaller stores are rapidly introducing self-checkout systems reducing the need for employing checkout workers in the united states , the retail industry employs 15.9 million people as of 2017 ( around 1 in 9 americans in the workforce ) globally , an estimated 192 million workers could be affected by automation according to research by eurasia group . food and drink the food retail industry has started to apply automation to the ordering process ; mcdonald 's has introduced touch screen ordering and payment systems in many of its restaurants , reducing the need for as many cashier employees some cafes and restaurants have utilized mobile and tablet '' apps '' to make the ordering process more efficient by customers ordering and paying on their device automated mining involves the removal of human labor from the mining process currently , it can still require a large amount of human capital , particularly in the third world where labor costs are low so there is less incentive for increasing efficiency through automation existing automated surveillance systems are based on the environment they are primarily designed to observe , i.e congress legislated in istea that : intermodal surface transportation efficiency act 1991 , part b , section 6054 ( b ) the secretary of transportation shall develop an automated highway and vehicle prototype from which future fully automated intelligent vehicle-highway systems can be developed full automation commonly defined as requiring no control or very limited control by the driver ; such automation would be accomplished through a combination of sensor , computer , and communications systems in vehicles and along the roadway other potential benefits include improved air quality ( as a result of more-efficient traffic flows ) , increased fuel economy , and spin-off technologies generated during research and development related to automated highway systems robotic process automation ( rpa ; or rpaai for self-guided rpa 2.0 ) is an emerging field within bpa and uses artificial intelligence home automation ( also called domotics ) designates an emerging practice of increased automation of household appliances and features in residential dwellings , particularly through electronic means that allow for things impracticable , overly expensive or simply not possible in recent past decades industrial automation deals primarily with the automation of manufacturing , quality control , and material handling processes industrial automation is to replace the decision making of humans and manual command-response activities with the use of mechanized equipment and logical programming commands the rise of industrial automation is directly tied to the “ fourth industrial revolution ” , which is better known now as industry 4.0 '' these new revolutionary advancements have drawn attention to the world of automation in an entirely new light and shown ways for it to grow to increase productivity and efficiency in machinery and manufacturing facilities industrial robots use various mechanical , electrical as well as software systems to allow for high precision , accuracy and speed that far exceed any human performance industrial automation incorporates programmable logic controllers in the manufacturing process before the plc , control , sequencing , and safety interlock logic for manufacturing automobiles was mainly composed of relays , cam timers , drum sequencers , and dedicated closed-loop controllers when digital computers became available , being general-purpose programmable devices , they were soon applied to control sequential and combinatorial logic in industrial processes agent-assisted automation refers to automation used by call center agents to handle customer inquiries

the hurdy-gurdy is generally thought to have originated from fiddles in either europe or the middle east ( e.g the first recorded reference to fiddles in europe was in the 9th century by the persian geographer ibn khordadbeh ( d the organistrum had a single melody string and two drone strings , which ran over a common bridge , and a relatively small wheel due to its size , the organistrum was played by two people , one of whom turned the crank while the other pulled the keys upward 1 : a legacy from the east ? , '' the galpin society journal 35:37–44 , and '' the medieval organistrum and symphonia the solo organistrum was known from spain and france , but was largely replaced by the symphonia , a small box-shaped version of the hurdy-gurdy with three strings and a diatonic keyboard at about the same time , a new form of key pressed from beneath was developed these keys were much more practical for faster music and easier to handle ; eventually they completely replaced keys pulled up from above the buzzing bridge ( commonly called the dog ) is an asymmetrical bridge that rests under a drone string on the sound board when the wheel is accelerated , one foot of the bridge lifts from the soundboard and vibrates , creating a buzzing sound the first was guitar-shaped and the second had a rounded lute-type body made of staves most types of hurdy-gurdy were essentially extinct by the early twentieth century , but a few have survived the best-known are the french vielle à roue , the hungarian tekerőlant , and the spanish zanfoña the hurdy-gurdy is the instrument played by der leiermann , the street musician portrayed in the last , melancholy song of schubert 's winterreise as the instrument has been revived , musicians have used it in a variety of styles of music ( see the recordings featuring the hurdy-gurdy ) , including contemporary forms not typically associated with it such organs require only the turning of the crank to play ; the music is coded by pinned barrels , perforated paper rolls , and , more recently , by electronic modules a person who plays the hurdy-gurdy is called a hurdy-gurdist , or ( particularly for players of french instruments ) viellist in france , a player is called un sonneur de vielle ( literally : '' a sounder of vielle '' ) , un vielleux or un vielleur the instrument is sometimes more descriptively called a wheel fiddle in english , but this term is rarely used among players of the instrument another possible derivation is from the hungarian '' hegedűs '' ( slovenian variant '' hrgadus '' ) meaning a fiddle copeland , source : folklore , vol in portugal , it is called sanfona another hungarian name for the instrument is nyenyere , which is thought to be an onomatopoeic reference to the repetitive warble produced by a wheel that is not even this term was considered derogatory in the hungarian lowlands , but was the normal term for the instrument on csepel island directly south of budapest a number of regional forms developed , but outside france the instrument was considered a folk instrument and there were no schools of construction that could have determined a standard form the box form of the simphonia is also commonly found among players of early music and historical re-enactors however , metal strings have become common in the twentieth century , especially for the heavier drone strings or for lower melody strings if octave tuning is used some instruments also have optional sympathetic strings , generally guitar or banjo b strings shimming and cottoning are connected processes since either one can affect the geometry of the instrument 's strings because of the small size of the wheel these instruments most commonly have three strings : one melody string , one tenor drone and one bass drone two drones + one diatonic melody string two drones + one diatonic melody string traditional french instruments have two melody strings and four drone strings with one buzzing bridge the drones are : the bordonciño in g ( one octave below the melody strings ) and the bordón in c ( two octaves below middle c ) two forms : one has a standard drone-melody arrangement , while the other runs the drone strings between the melody strings in the keybox

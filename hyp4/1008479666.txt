the hurdy-gurdy is generally thought to have originated from fiddles in either europe or the middle east ( e.g chicago studies in ethnomusicology , university of chicago press , 1990 one of the earliest forms of the hurdy-gurdy was the organistrum , a large instrument with a guitar-shaped body and a long neck in which the keys were set ( covering one diatonic octave ) the organistrum had a single melody string and two drone strings , which ran over a common bridge , and a relatively small wheel due to its size , the organistrum was played by two people , one of whom turned the crank while the other pulled the keys upward pulling keys upward is cumbersome , so only slow tunes could be played on the organistrum 1 : a legacy from the east ? , '' the galpin society journal 35:37–44 , and '' the medieval organistrum and symphonia another 10th-century treatise thought to have mentioned an instrument like a hurdy-gurdy is an arabic musical compendium written by al zirikli the solo organistrum was known from spain and france , but was largely replaced by the symphonia , a small box-shaped version of the hurdy-gurdy with three strings and a diatonic keyboard these keys were much more practical for faster music and easier to handle ; eventually they completely replaced keys pulled up from above during the renaissance , the hurdy-gurdy was a very popular instrument ( along with the bagpipe ) and the characteristic form had a short neck and a boxy body with a curved tail end the buzzing bridge ( commonly called the dog ) is an asymmetrical bridge that rests under a drone string on the sound board the buzzing bridge is thought to have been borrowed from the tromba marina ( monochord ) , a bowed string instrument during the late renaissance , two characteristic shapes of hurdy-gurdies developed the lute-like body is especially characteristic of french instruments at this time the most common style of hurdy-gurdy developed , the six-string vielle à roue this instrument has two melody strings and four drones the drone strings are tuned so that by turning them on or off , the instrument can be played in multiple keys ( e.g during this time the hurdy-gurdy also spread further to central europe , where further variations developed in western slavic countries , german-speaking areas and hungary ( see the list of types below for more information on them ) most types of hurdy-gurdy were essentially extinct by the early twentieth century , but a few have survived in ukraine , a variety called the lira was widely used by blind street musicians , most of whom were purged by stalin in the 1930s ( see persecuted bandurists ) although the song does not use a hurdy-gurdy , the repeated reference to the instrument in the song 's lyrics sparked curiosity and interest among young people , eventually resulting in an annual hurdy-gurdy music festival in the olympic peninsula area of the state of washington each september as the instrument has been revived , musicians have used it in a variety of styles of music ( see the recordings featuring the hurdy-gurdy ) , including contemporary forms not typically associated with it another hungarian name for the instrument is nyenyere , which is thought to be an onomatopoeic reference to the repetitive warble produced by a wheel that is not even this term was considered derogatory in the hungarian lowlands , but was the normal term for the instrument on csepel island directly south of budapest the equivalent names ninera and niněra are used in slovakia and the czech republic respectively leier , lant , and related terms today are generally used to refer to members of the lute or lyre family , but historically had a broader range of meaning and were used for many types of stringed instruments however , metal strings have become common in the twentieth century , especially for the heavier drone strings or for lower melody strings if octave tuning is used the cotton on melody strings tends to be quite light , while drone strings have heavier cotton improper cottoning results in a raspy tone , especially at higher pitches in addition , individual strings ( in particular the melody strings ) often have to have their height above the wheel surface adjusted by having small pieces of paper placed between the strings and the bridge , a process called shimming on french-style instruments , the sensitivity of the buzzing bridge can be altered by turning a peg called a tirant in the tailpiece of the instrument that is connected by a wire or thread to the trompette regional types of hurdy-gurdies since the renaissance can also be classified based on wheel size and the presence or absence ( and type ) of a buzzing bridge usually four drones + two melody strings , but often extended to have more strings two forms : one has a standard drone-melody arrangement , while the other runs the drone strings between the melody strings in the keybox the signals for drone strings and the snares are generated by the crank movements of the wheel

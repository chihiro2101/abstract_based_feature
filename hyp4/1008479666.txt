the hurdy-gurdy is generally thought to have originated from fiddles in either europe or the middle east ( e.g , the rebab instrument ) some time before the eleventh century a.d the first recorded reference to fiddles in europe was in the 9th century by the persian geographer ibn khordadbeh ( d chicago studies in ethnomusicology , university of chicago press , 1990 one of the earliest forms of the hurdy-gurdy was the organistrum , a large instrument with a guitar-shaped body and a long neck in which the keys were set ( covering one diatonic octave ) the organistrum had a single melody string and two drone strings , which ran over a common bridge , and a relatively small wheel due to its size , the organistrum was played by two people , one of whom turned the crank while the other pulled the keys upward pulling keys upward is cumbersome , so only slow tunes could be played on the organistrum 2 : terminology , '' the galpin society journal 36:71–87 the pitches on the organistrum were set according to pythagorean tuning and the instrument was primarily used in monastic and church settings to accompany choral music known through a much later copy , but its authenticity is very doubtful another 10th-century treatise thought to have mentioned an instrument like a hurdy-gurdy is an arabic musical compendium written by al zirikli one of the earliest visual depictions of the organistrum is from the twelfth-century pórtico da gloria ( portal of glory ) on the cathedral at santiago de compostela , galicia , spain : it has a carving of two musicians playing an organistrum later on , the organistrum was made smaller to let a single player both turn the crank and work the keys the solo organistrum was known from spain and france , but was largely replaced by the symphonia , a small box-shaped version of the hurdy-gurdy with three strings and a diatonic keyboard these keys were much more practical for faster music and easier to handle ; eventually they completely replaced keys pulled up from above during the renaissance , the hurdy-gurdy was a very popular instrument ( along with the bagpipe ) and the characteristic form had a short neck and a boxy body with a curved tail end when the wheel is accelerated , one foot of the bridge lifts from the soundboard and vibrates , creating a buzzing sound the buzzing bridge is thought to have been borrowed from the tromba marina ( monochord ) , a bowed string instrument this instrument has two melody strings and four drones the drone strings are tuned so that by turning them on or off , the instrument can be played in multiple keys ( e.g during this time the hurdy-gurdy also spread further to central europe , where further variations developed in western slavic countries , german-speaking areas and hungary ( see the list of types below for more information on them ) in ukraine , a variety called the lira was widely used by blind street musicians , most of whom were purged by stalin in the 1930s ( see persecuted bandurists ) the hurdy-gurdy is the instrument played by der leiermann , the street musician portrayed in the last , melancholy song of schubert 's winterreise it is also featured and played prominently in the film captains courageous ( 1937 ) as the instrument of the character manuel , acted by spencer tracy a person who plays the hurdy-gurdy is called a hurdy-gurdist , or ( particularly for players of french instruments ) viellist in france , a player is called un sonneur de vielle ( literally : '' a sounder of vielle '' ) , un vielleux or un vielleur because of the prominence of the french tradition , many instrument and performance terms used in english are commonly taken from the french , and players generally need to know these terms to read relevant literature another possible derivation is from the hungarian '' hegedűs '' ( slovenian variant '' hrgadus '' ) meaning a fiddle in italy , it is called the ghironda or lira tedesca while in spain , it is a zanfona in galicia , zanfoña in zamora , rabil in asturias and viola de roda in catalonia the box form of the simphonia is also commonly found among players of early music and historical re-enactors because of the small size of the wheel these instruments most commonly have three strings : one melody string , one tenor drone and one bass drone usually two drones ( sometimes three ) + one or two chromatic melody strings usually four drones + two melody strings , but often extended to have more strings traditional french instruments have two melody strings and four drone strings with one buzzing bridge in pop music , especially in the popular neo-medieval music , electric hurdy-gurdies are used , wherein electro magnetic pickups convert the vibration of its strings into electrical signals depending on the technical equipment of the instrument , the digital audio signal can be output directly via an integrated processor and sound card

the hurdy-gurdy is generally thought to have originated from fiddles in either europe or the middle east ( e.g , the rebab instrument ) some time before the eleventh century a.d the first recorded reference to fiddles in europe was in the 9th century by the persian geographer ibn khordadbeh ( d 911 ) describing the lira ( lūrā ) as a typical instrument within the byzantine empire kartomi : on concepts and classifications of musical instruments chicago studies in ethnomusicology , university of chicago press , 1990 one of the earliest forms of the hurdy-gurdy was the organistrum , a large instrument with a guitar-shaped body and a long neck in which the keys were set ( covering one diatonic octave ) the organistrum had a single melody string and two drone strings , which ran over a common bridge , and a relatively small wheel due to its size , the organistrum was played by two people , one of whom turned the crank while the other pulled the keys upward pulling keys upward is cumbersome , so only slow tunes could be played on the organistrum 2 : terminology , '' the galpin society journal 36:71–87 the pitches on the organistrum were set according to pythagorean tuning and the instrument was primarily used in monastic and church settings to accompany choral music another 10th-century treatise thought to have mentioned an instrument like a hurdy-gurdy is an arabic musical compendium written by al zirikli later on , the organistrum was made smaller to let a single player both turn the crank and work the keys the solo organistrum was known from spain and france , but was largely replaced by the symphonia , a small box-shaped version of the hurdy-gurdy with three strings and a diatonic keyboard during the renaissance , the hurdy-gurdy was a very popular instrument ( along with the bagpipe ) and the characteristic form had a short neck and a boxy body with a curved tail end the buzzing bridge ( commonly called the dog ) is an asymmetrical bridge that rests under a drone string on the sound board when the wheel is accelerated , one foot of the bridge lifts from the soundboard and vibrates , creating a buzzing sound the buzzing bridge is thought to have been borrowed from the tromba marina ( monochord ) , a bowed string instrument this instrument has two melody strings and four drones the drone strings are tuned so that by turning them on or off , the instrument can be played in multiple keys ( e.g the best-known are the french vielle à roue , the hungarian tekerőlant , and the spanish zanfoña in ukraine , a variety called the lira was widely used by blind street musicians , most of whom were purged by stalin in the 1930s ( see persecuted bandurists ) the hurdy-gurdy is the instrument played by der leiermann , the street musician portrayed in the last , melancholy song of schubert 's winterreise a person who plays the hurdy-gurdy is called a hurdy-gurdist , or ( particularly for players of french instruments ) viellist in france , a player is called un sonneur de vielle ( literally : '' a sounder of vielle '' ) , un vielleux or un vielleur because of the prominence of the french tradition , many instrument and performance terms used in english are commonly taken from the french , and players generally need to know these terms to read relevant literature in her overview of the instrument 's history , palmer recorded twenty-three different forms , and there is still no standardized design today the six-stringed french vielle à roue is the best-known and most common sort both forms are found in french-speaking areas , while guitar-bodied instruments are the general form elsewhere historically , strings were made of gut , which is still a preferred material today and modern instruments are mounted with violin ( d or a ) and cello ( a , g , c ) strings the drone strings produce steady sounds at fixed pitches on french-style instruments , the sensitivity of the buzzing bridge can be altered by turning a peg called a tirant in the tailpiece of the instrument that is connected by a wire or thread to the trompette because of the small size of the wheel these instruments most commonly have three strings : one melody string , one tenor drone and one bass drone two body forms : guitar-bodied and lute-backed ( vielle en luth ) traditional french instruments have two melody strings and four drone strings with one buzzing bridge two forms : one has a standard drone-melody arrangement , while the other runs the drone strings between the melody strings in the keybox

the hurdy-gurdy is generally thought to have originated from fiddles in either europe or the middle east ( e.g the first recorded reference to fiddles in europe was in the 9th century by the persian geographer ibn khordadbeh ( d 911 ) describing the lira ( lūrā ) as a typical instrument within the byzantine empire chicago studies in ethnomusicology , university of chicago press , 1990 one of the earliest forms of the hurdy-gurdy was the organistrum , a large instrument with a guitar-shaped body and a long neck in which the keys were set ( covering one diatonic octave ) the organistrum had a single melody string and two drone strings , which ran over a common bridge , and a relatively small wheel due to its size , the organistrum was played by two people , one of whom turned the crank while the other pulled the keys upward pulling keys upward is cumbersome , so only slow tunes could be played on the organistrum the solo organistrum was known from spain and france , but was largely replaced by the symphonia , a small box-shaped version of the hurdy-gurdy with three strings and a diatonic keyboard these keys were much more practical for faster music and easier to handle ; eventually they completely replaced keys pulled up from above the buzzing bridge ( commonly called the dog ) is an asymmetrical bridge that rests under a drone string on the sound board when the wheel is accelerated , one foot of the bridge lifts from the soundboard and vibrates , creating a buzzing sound the buzzing bridge is thought to have been borrowed from the tromba marina ( monochord ) , a bowed string instrument during the late renaissance , two characteristic shapes of hurdy-gurdies developed at this time the most common style of hurdy-gurdy developed , the six-string vielle à roue this instrument has two melody strings and four drones the drone strings are tuned so that by turning them on or off , the instrument can be played in multiple keys ( e.g most types of hurdy-gurdy were essentially extinct by the early twentieth century , but a few have survived the hurdy-gurdy is the instrument played by der leiermann , the street musician portrayed in the last , melancholy song of schubert 's winterreise it is also featured and played prominently in the film captains courageous ( 1937 ) as the instrument of the character manuel , acted by spencer tracy as the instrument has been revived , musicians have used it in a variety of styles of music ( see the recordings featuring the hurdy-gurdy ) , including contemporary forms not typically associated with it the french call these organs orgue de barbarie ( '' barbary organ '' ) , while the germans and dutch say drehorgel and draaiorgel ( '' turned organ '' ) , instead of drehleier ( '' turning lyre '' ) a person who plays the hurdy-gurdy is called a hurdy-gurdist , or ( particularly for players of french instruments ) viellist in france , a player is called un sonneur de vielle ( literally : '' a sounder of vielle '' ) , un vielleux or un vielleur another possible derivation is from the hungarian '' hegedűs '' ( slovenian variant '' hrgadus '' ) meaning a fiddle in russian , ukrainian and belarusian , the instrument is called '' wheel lyre '' ( колёсная лира , колісна ліра , колавая ліра ) there are two primary body styles for contemporary instruments : guitar-bodied and lute-backed both forms are found in french-speaking areas , while guitar-bodied instruments are the general form elsewhere some instruments also have optional sympathetic strings , generally guitar or banjo b strings however , because the tangents can be adjusted to tune individual notes , it is possible to tune hurdy-gurdies to almost any temperament as needed this technique is often known by its french term , the coup-de-poignet ( or , more simply , the shortened coup ) small-wheeled ( wheel diameter less than 14 & nbsp ; cm , or about 5.5 & nbsp ; inches ) instruments are traditionally found in central and eastern europe no buzzing bridge lira korbowa ( poland ) large-wheeled instruments ( wheel diameters between 14 and 17 & nbsp ; cm , or about 5.56.6 & nbsp ; inches ) are traditionally found in western europe traditional french instruments have two melody strings and four drone strings with one buzzing bridge typically guitar-shaped body , with three melody strings , and two drone strings

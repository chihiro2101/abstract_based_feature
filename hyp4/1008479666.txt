the hurdy-gurdy is generally thought to have originated from fiddles in either europe or the middle east ( e.g , the rebab instrument ) some time before the eleventh century a.d the first recorded reference to fiddles in europe was in the 9th century by the persian geographer ibn khordadbeh ( d chicago studies in ethnomusicology , university of chicago press , 1990 one of the earliest forms of the hurdy-gurdy was the organistrum , a large instrument with a guitar-shaped body and a long neck in which the keys were set ( covering one diatonic octave ) the organistrum had a single melody string and two drone strings , which ran over a common bridge , and a relatively small wheel due to its size , the organistrum was played by two people , one of whom turned the crank while the other pulled the keys upward pulling keys upward is cumbersome , so only slow tunes could be played on the organistrum 2 : terminology , '' the galpin society journal 36:71–87 the pitches on the organistrum were set according to pythagorean tuning and the instrument was primarily used in monastic and church settings to accompany choral music another 10th-century treatise thought to have mentioned an instrument like a hurdy-gurdy is an arabic musical compendium written by al zirikli the solo organistrum was known from spain and france , but was largely replaced by the symphonia , a small box-shaped version of the hurdy-gurdy with three strings and a diatonic keyboard medieval depictions of the symphonia show both types of keys during the renaissance , the hurdy-gurdy was a very popular instrument ( along with the bagpipe ) and the characteristic form had a short neck and a boxy body with a curved tail end the buzzing bridge ( commonly called the dog ) is an asymmetrical bridge that rests under a drone string on the sound board when the wheel is accelerated , one foot of the bridge lifts from the soundboard and vibrates , creating a buzzing sound the buzzing bridge is thought to have been borrowed from the tromba marina ( monochord ) , a bowed string instrument during the late renaissance , two characteristic shapes of hurdy-gurdies developed during the 18th century , however , french rococo tastes for rustic diversions brought the hurdy-gurdy back to the attention of the upper classes , where it acquired tremendous popularity among the nobility , with famous composers writing works for the hurdy-gurdy the most famous of these is nicolas chédeville 's il pastor fido , attributed to vivaldi this instrument has two melody strings and four drones the drone strings are tuned so that by turning them on or off , the instrument can be played in multiple keys ( e.g the hurdy-gurdy is the instrument played by der leiermann , the street musician portrayed in the last , melancholy song of schubert 's winterreise the instrument came into a new public consciousness when donovan released his hit pop song , '' hurdy gurdy man '' , in 1968 such organs require only the turning of the crank to play ; the music is coded by pinned barrels , perforated paper rolls , and , more recently , by electronic modules a person who plays the hurdy-gurdy is called a hurdy-gurdist , or ( particularly for players of french instruments ) viellist the instrument is sometimes more descriptively called a wheel fiddle in english , but this term is rarely used among players of the instrument in her overview of the instrument 's history , palmer recorded twenty-three different forms , and there is still no standardized design today to achieve proper intonation and sound quality , each string of a hurdy-gurdy must be wrapped with cotton or similar fibers the cotton on melody strings tends to be quite light , while drone strings have heavier cotton shimming and cottoning are connected processes since either one can affect the geometry of the instrument 's strings when the wheel is turned regularly and not too fast the pressure on the string ( called the trompette on french instruments ) holds the bridge in place , sounding a drone because of the small size of the wheel these instruments most commonly have three strings : one melody string , one tenor drone and one bass drone the type of buzzing bridge found on this instrument usually has the adjustment peg set in a block next to the string , rather than in the tailpiece ( as is typical of french instruments ) usually diatonic , but has been extended with a chromatic range with the additional keys placed below the normal diatonic range ( the opposite of most chromatic hurdy-gurdy keyboards ) wedge-adjusted buzzing bridge tekerőlant ( hungarian ) the drones are : the bordonciño in g ( one octave below the melody strings ) and the bordón in c ( two octaves below middle c ) two forms : one has a standard drone-melody arrangement , while the other runs the drone strings between the melody strings in the keybox

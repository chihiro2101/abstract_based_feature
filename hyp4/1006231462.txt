zimbabwe is the shona name of the ruins , first recorded in 1531 by vicente pegado , captain of the portuguese garrison of sofala the first proposes that the word is derived from , translated from the karanga dialect of shona as '' large houses of stone '' plural of , '' house '' ; plural of , '' stone '' ) image : great-zimbabwe.jpg right thumb overview of great zimbabwe the majority of scholars believe that it was built by members of the gokomere culture , who were the ancestors of the modern shona in zimbabwe the great zimbabwe area was settled by the fourth century ad between the fourth and the seventh centuries , communities of the gokomere or ziwa cultures farmed the valley , and mined and worked iron , but built no stone structures construction of the stone buildings started in the 11th century and continued for over 300 years its most formidable edifice , commonly referred to as the great enclosure , has walls as high as extending approximately , making it the largest ancient structure south of the sahara desert david beach believes that the city and its state , the kingdom of zimbabwe , flourished from 1200 to 1500 , although a somewhat earlier date for its demise is implied by a description transmitted in the early 1500s to joão de barros its growth has been linked to the decline of mapungubwe from around 1300 , due to climatic change or the greater availability of gold in the hinterland of great zimbabwe traditional estimates are that great zimbabwe had as many as 18,000 inhabitants at its peak in 1531 , vicente pegado , captain of the portuguese garrison of sofala , described zimbabwe thus : the ruins form three distinct architectural groups they are known as the hill complex , the valley complex and the great enclosure notable features of the hill complex include the eastern enclosure , in which it is thought the zimbabwe birds stood , a high balcony enclosure overlooking the eastern enclosure , and a huge boulder in a shape similar to that of the zimbabwe bird garlake ( 1973 ) 27 the great enclosure is composed of an inner wall , encircling a series of structures and a younger outer wall garlake ( 1973 ) 29 the valley complex is divided into the upper and lower valley ruins , with different periods of occupation the focus of power moved from the hill complex in the twelfth century , to the great enclosure , the upper valley and finally the lower valley in the early sixteenth century the alternative '' structuralist '' interpretation holds that the different complexes had different functions : the hill complex as a temple , the valley complex was for the citizens , and the great enclosure was used by the king it is thought that they represent the bateleur eagle- a good omen , protective spirit and messenger of the gods in shona culture archaeological evidence suggests that great zimbabwe became a centre for trading , with artefacts suggesting that the city formed part of a trade network linked to kilwa garlake ( 2002 ) 184–185 and extending as far as china that international commerce was in addition to the local agricultural trade , in which cattle were especially important chinese pottery shards , coins from arabia , glass beads and other non-local items have been excavated at zimbabwe despite these strong international trade links , there is no evidence to suggest exchange of architectural concepts between great zimbabwe and centres such as kilwa however , passing en route a few kilometres north and about south of the site , he did not make a reference to great zimbabwe 738 portuguese traders heard about the remains of the ancient city in the early 16th century , and records survive of interviews and notes made by some of them , linking great zimbabwe to gold production and long-distance trade joão de barros left another such description of great zimbabwe in 1538 , as recounted to him by moors traders who had visited the area and possessed knowledge of the hinterland it would seem that some prince who has possession of these mines ordered it to be built as a sign thereof , which he afterwards lost in the course of time and through their being so remote from his kingdom the ruins were rediscovered during a hunting trip in 1867 by adam render , a german-american hunter , prospector and trader in southern africa , who in 1871 showed the ruins to karl mauch , a german explorer and geographer of africa swan ( 1858-1904 ) , who also visited and surveyed a host of related stone ruins nearby by the third edition of his book ( 1902 ) he was more specific , with his primary theory being '' a semitic race and of arabian origin '' of '' strongly commercial '' traders living within a client african city the construction of great zimbabwe is also claimed by the lemba more recent research argues that dna studies do not support claims for a specifically jewish genetic heritage today , the most recent consensus appears to attribute the construction of great zimbabwe to the shona people the great zimbabwe university file : great zimbabwe ( donjon )
